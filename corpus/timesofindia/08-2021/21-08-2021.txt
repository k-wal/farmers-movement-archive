Here's a look at how the pandemic has changed the mindset of the on-the-move Bengalureans who are now more mindful about their home and surroundings. Meaningful relationships started with a casual helloCity-based data scientist Jagrati Gogia confesses that a casual hello during a run or a walk bloomed into something more meaningful during the lockdown. "We being social animals, literally craved meeting some of our friends whom we have not been able to meet during the lockdown and this led to us reaching out to our neighbours and connecting over similar interests. And that gradually developed into a good bond. Now, we meet up for walks and runs as our neighbours are also into fitness." Parul Kanwar who works in an MNC bank adds, "We moved into a new apartment last year when Covid was at its peak and over a period time we met a lot of people when we went out on our daily walks. We bonded over a lot of small things which we would not have had the time to do in the pre-Covid era. It is definitely nice to take a break from work, step away from the screen and have a cup of coffee with them for a while when they pop in to check up on us." Residents create a community brimming with spiritWhile during the pre-Covid era, urban city-dwellers restricted themselves to their friends and family and reaching out to neighbours was not really a common trend, the lockdown phase has certainly brought in a sense of community spirit within apartments. Speaking about the community support, Nikhil Jasrotia who is banker (operations) says, "We moved into a building that was handed over to the residents and because of the support structure of people who had earlier moved in, it really helped us with essential support in terms sourcing help and other logistics to get the house ready for us to be able to move in. And it was pretty much a take it forward from there and whenever we see neighbours moving in, we are trying to give them the same support and help. In fact, some houses have tiffin services for those self isolating and that was the support we had during isolating ourselves because of Covid. This is continuing as a goodwill." Dog parents connect with like-minded dog parentsThe lockdown phase has undoubtedly been hard for pet parents as they had not much to offer their furry babies during the lockdown. And, this common concern got many pet parents to bond and help each other out. "My husband and I are very social people and this lockdown was a huge deterrent to all the socialising and meeting up with friends. Not just that, the pandemic came in with a lot of confusion around animals and Covid-19 transmission which made the phase extremely stressful. Luckily, we met a lot of dog parents here and eventually we became this huge dog family that connected over various issues. As a community we have been there for each other and that bond has certainly helped during this entire lockdown phase," says dog mom and animal lover Sandhya Nair, who confesses that the support system built within the gated community has certainly helped them not feel left out. Same holds true for another dog mom. UX lead Sucharita Ghosh confesses, “We were one of the unfortunate ones who had to stay in isolation because of Covid and that’s when our neighbours were of most help. Since we couldn’t go out, they took our pet to the veterinarian for his vaccinations, ensured we were sent food so we didn’t have to worry about that. They took turns to take our pet on walks to ensure there wasn’t frustration building inside him. We are extremely fortunate to have neighbors who’ve become such close friends.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/neighbours-in-bengaluru-turn-into-a-support-system-in-the-pandemic/articleshow/85480886.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

However, traffic cops sought to wash their hands of the allegation by claiming the vehicle was not part of their fleet. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said the licence plate number of the truck does not match any of the 80-odd towing vehicles his force is using in the city. “The picture shows men in plainclothes lifting the bikes. For many years now, towing staff have been wearing uniforms. Above all, we use towing vehicles with clear documentation and approval by the Regional Transport Office,” Gowda said. Another senior traffic police officer, however, said they will look into the matter. “The truck definitely does not belong to city traffic police. But we will examine the picture and trace the vehicle as we have been dragged into the matter,” he added. It all began with the Twitter user posting the photograph and pointing to the speed at which towing staff lift motorbikes parked on roads, place them inside the vehicle and leave in a jiffy. The Twitter user wondered whether all government projects work at the same pace. “Any other Government work happens at lightening speed like this happens (sic)?” the tweet read. “The very own towing vehicle has no permit. it’s fitness expired and from 2003 they have not paid any kind of motor vehicle tax. no insurance. DO THIS BTP ALLOW ANY OTHER VECHILE WITHOUT INSURANCE. Before giving contract how come dey have not checked all (sic),” replied another Twitter user, sparking a flood of tweets ridiculing police. “Traffic Police wants you to pay fines for not wearing seatbelts in Traffic Signals but nobody cares for helmets, seat belts on highways,” read a post. Another Twitter user said: “Law enforcement agency is providing full cover if law to towing mafia. Towing truck belongs to contractor, and more they scoop, more money for everyone involved in this excluding government (sic).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/twitter-user-claims-towing-vehicle-lacks-docus-cops-say-its-not-theirs/articleshow/85498626.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

They raised the money via crowd funding in just about 45 days. Shilpa Singh, the IT professional, said she noticed during the height of the second wave that the biggest issues facing healthcare were lack of equipment and shortage of staff. “So, I decided to raise funds on a crowdfunding platform for equipment that could be donated,” Shilpa told TOI. “But I didn’t know whom to give the funds to. I decided to meet D Randeep, special commissioner, health, BBMP, who told me the civic agency was setting up a child care unit at Dr Babu Jagjivan Ram hospital and the money could be used there.” The 117 contributors to the fund include Shilpa, her daughter Parissa, friends and relatives besides others. “I understand these donations will come in handy if there is a third wave of infections and can always be used to treat people who cannot afford care in private hospitals,” Shilpa said. She said she isn’t involved or a part of any NGO and that the work she did was purely on her own steam. She also provided meals and ration kits to several people. The equipment was handed over to Randeep on Tuesday. The special commissioner said: “After the pandemic hit, we set up fever clinics and a triage centre at Dr Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital. Now, a 30-bed childcare centre has been established. It has two ICU, eight HDU and 20 oxygenated beds. Children with mild and moderate symptoms will be treated here.” Shilpa and Parissa’s contribution to this facility include three BiPAP machines, which are essentially non-invasive ventilators, one video laryngoscope, 300 PPE kits, and 50-litres of sanitiser. Parissa is a Class 10 student. “Although my daughter’s financial contribution was little, she is definitely a part of this,” Shilpa said. “She made videos and uploaded them on the crowdfunding platform and came with me when I met the vendors. This is how our children learn.” After raising the funds, it took another 45 days to meet officials and vendors and understand how the funds can be used. “But it wasn’t a difficult procedure,” Shilpa said. Randeep insisted that there has been no increase in infections among children in BBMP limits. Of the children who have been affected, most have only mild to moderate symptoms and are recovering at home. “The number of hospital admissions is very low,” he said. He said guidelines have been issued to residents’ welfare associations to focus especially on the health of children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/girl-mom-raise-5l-donate-medical-equipment-for-kids/articleshow/85498659.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||Appoint crime scene officers at police stns in 6 mnths: HC||BENGALURU: Considering the severe shortage of manpower and its impact on working of forensic science laboratories across the state, the high court has issued a series of interim directions for filling of vacancies, apart from stipulating timeline for test results. The government is required to appoint Scene of Crime Officers (SOCOs) at all police stations in the state within six months. The state has also been told to operationalise in all districts within six months district scientific aid (DSA) units with staff comprising one senior scientific officer, two scientific officers and one lab attender along with a mobile forensic laboratory. Acting on a suo motu PIL, a division bench comprising chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and justice Suraj Govindaraj said the one-month timeline, as recommended by KSLSA, should be followed for furnishing test reports by 13 sections such as biology, DNA and toxicology, among others. Filling of top postsRegarding the three vacant joint director posts, the bench said one post should be filled through deputation (IPS officer) within a month and one of the two remaining (promotional posts) on ad-hoc basis within four months. The court added the government should undertake ad-hoc measures within four months for filling at least five posts of deputy directors, six of assistant directors and 20 of senior scientific officers. Regarding scientific officers, the government was told to abide by its assurance that all 138 vacancies will be filled by March 31, 2022. Similarly, the government is required to abide by its assurance on completion of recruitment process vis-a-vis lab assistants and EEG technicians by August 31,2021. Expressing surprise vis-a-vis the statement that brain mapping and narco test are not being conducted owing to non-availability of OT attenders, the bench said one such attender should be recruited within four months. Considering the nature and number of cases relating to firearms, coming from Mangaluru or surrounding areas, the court directed for recruiting an armorer within four months to make that section in regional FSL at Mangaluru operational. New labs, new sectionsThe bench directed the government to operationalise within one year additional regional forensic science laboratories at Hubballi and Ballari consisting of all 13 sections. The government and director of FSL were told to operationalise the additional sections, which have been proposed in connection with DNA testing, digital forensic (combining three sections of computer, mobile and audio-video forensics) in all regional FSLs. “Certain new sections like advanced digital forensic, explosives and wildlife forensics are required to be made operational in state FSL and regional FSLs. We direct that it be done within 9 months,” the bench added. To consider the compliance report to be submitted by the government, the matter was directed to be listed on October 8, 2021. The suo motu PIL was registered based on a single bench order dated December 22, 2020 after noticing there was a four-year delay in getting an FSL report in a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/appoint-crime-scene-officers-at-police-stns-in-6-mnths-hc/articleshow/85498679.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Bengaluru||18 shifted out of Bengaluru jail for driving crimes||BENGALURU: Eighteen inmates of Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara have been shifted to various central and districts jails, following suspicion that they were orchestrating heinous crimes from inside the Bengaluru prison. The move came after police probe into the recent murder of history-sheeter Joseph Babli revealed that the prime conspirators in the case were in judicial custody of Central Prison. Babli was hacked to death inside a bank in front of his wife and minor daughter on July 19.  Koramanagala police have already arrested eight men outside the prison in connection with killing. According to police, three prison inmates masterminded the murder from behind the bars. Following Babli’s murder, police commissioner Kamal Pant directed his men to keep an eye on the activities of rowdy elements and history-sheeters. As a result, cops zeroed in on 18 rowdy elements, who were guiding their associates outside on how to commit various crimes even as they were locked inside jail. They submitted a report to Pant, identifying these individuals and detailing how they were operating out of the prison. Following this, all 18 inmates were shifted to different district and central prisons across the state. “Among those shifted are Naga alias Wilson Garden Naga and Shiva alias Shivakumar from Wilson Garden, both arch rivals of Babli and George Michel of Adugodi, Babli’s brother-in-law. Another history-sheeter Pradeep alias Chotte, who led the gang that hacked Babli to death, too has been shifted. Chotte was shot at and injured when cops tried to arrest him,” a police officer said.“Bombay Saleem is another rowdy-sheeter who has been moved out. Saleem, who was arrested in a murder case reported in Talaghattapura this year, was active in land mafia in south Bengaluru region,” a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/18-shifted-out-of-bluru-jail-for-driving-crimes/articleshow/85498742.cms||---

The foreigner had swallowed the pills containing the drug to avoid detection. The drug bust unfolded on Tuesday when a team of the Bengaluru unit of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) reached the international arrival area on receiving specific information that large quantities of cocaine were being smuggled into Bengaluru. “We carried out passenger profiling of flyers who came on a flight from West Asia and intercepted the 30-year-old man, who claimed to have come to Bengaluru for kidney treatment and had a visa for medical purposes,” a DRI officer said. Following suspicion, the DRI sleuths escorted the man for a medical scan and found that he was indeed carrying numerous capsules containing a drug, later established as cocaine, in his stomach. The drug smuggler was hospitalised and the cocaine capsules were extracted by Friday evening. The man has been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-with-cocaine-worth-11cr-in-stomach-nabbed/articleshow/85498749.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Upskilling as crucial as domain knowledge: Experts||BENGALURU: Engineering students must not just focus on domain expertise, but also on soft skills, projects, upskilling and programming skills, said experts at the CET prepmaster webinar on Friday. The webinar, hosted on TOI Bangalore FB page was attended by Yogesh Bhat, co-founder at Masai School, along with Jacob Augustine, professor and associate dean, Presidency University. The session was organised by Presidency University in association with The Times of India and Vijay Karnataka. While discussing the topic, ‘Industry 4.0 expectations from next generation engineers’, the speakers dwelt on the need to go beyond marks and exams. “Today, you have to demonstrate domain expertise irrespective of the stream you have chosen. Also, communication skills, problem-solving skills and people skills are equally important,” said Bhat. Bhat elaborated on the importance of communication skills. “Even while I respect mother tongues, it is important that students pick up the ‘vyapar bhasha’ (business language). For this you need to practise, just like how you learn cycling or swimming. You cannot learn a language just by reading books. You need to speak, listen, write and read over a span of time,” he said. Bhat himself studied in a Kannada-medium school. Augustine emphasised the need to develop the ability to learn things by oneself in the industry. “Lifelong learning ability is critical. We have seen several experts switch from their initial branches of work. What we learn now might not be relevant in the next five years. Engineers also need the patience to sit for long hours and chase a problem until it is solved. While in schools and colleges, students chase marks, the real learning is lost,” he said. Curiosity to solve problems, critical thinking and creative thinking are important. An engineer spends 75% of his time with the team, collaborating and co-creating solutions, the panellists pointed out. Students must focus on their core subjects whichever stream they choose. “There’s no short cut. The core subjects are the foundation and have to be learnt thoroughly. It will stay with you and help you think the right way,” said Augustine. He also underlined how programming has seeped into all streams even outside engineering. The speakers also dwelt on the need for active industry collaboration. For students they recommended industry projects, internships, research centres, innovative labs and working with NGOs. For the faculty, they suggested a month of internship with the industry every year. “While upskilling is extremely important, it is just not about certification, enrolling or completing a course, but about acquiring the skills. Peer tutoring and mentoring is a great space to work now for students,” Bhat said. The experts said students should get over the fear of failure and be curious about solving problems. Around 9,000 students registered for the CET prepmaster mock tests.

---||Cuttack||Nearly 1/2 of state’s active cases from Khurda, Cuttack||BHUBANESWAR: The state capital has witnessed a nearly three-fold rise in active Covid cases since July 15 even as cases in the state have come down by more than half during the same period. On Friday, the city has 3,292 active cases, up from 1192 registered on July 15. In the same period, active positive cases across the state fell from 22,860 to 9,578. With the capital city adding around 300 cases daily, the active cases have not gone down even after five months into the second wave. Active cases is a worry as it means it will take time to break the chain of infection. Experts also feel that active caseload for a longer period could lead to mutant strains of the virus. Bhubaneswar now accounts for nearly one-third of the active cases in the state and the bulk of Khurda’s 3,695 infections. Cuttack city has 1086 active cases and together with Khurda, make up almost half of the state’s active caseload. On the contrary, the 10 western Odisha districts together have only 581 active cases. The remaining active cases are limited to Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Nayagarh and Puri districts. Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), said the active cases in Bhubaneswar is increasing every day because of the daily caseload and slow recovery. “The recovery in the second wave, especially in Bhubaneswar, is not in proportion to the fresh cases. It is far below. This pushes up the active infection graph. Also, the delta variant of the virus is showing a prolonged action on the body, as a result of which recovery seems to be low. In other parts, caseload is less and the active graph is falling every day,” Parida said. On Friday, the state reported 986 new infections even as three districts — Boudh, Nuapada and Jharsuguda — reported zero Covid infection. On Saturday, the state’s cumulative Covid cases is poised to cross 10 lakh mark as till Friday it has recorded 9,99,173 cases. The government confirmed 69 more Covid deaths, taking the toll to 7,223.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/nearly-1/2-of-states-active-cases-from-khurda-cuttack/articleshow/85508836.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||CM Naveen Patnaik launches smart health cards for cashless treatment||BHUBANESWAR/KORAPUT: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday handed over the first smart health card under Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana (BSKY) to Sukri Dhangda Majhi — member of the primitive Bonda tribe — at a programme in Malkangiri district, marking the beginning of a new phase in the state government’s efforts to bring healthcare to the marginalised and the poor. While the BSKY was originally launched on August 15, 2018, covering around 71 lakh families, the government now aims to include a total of 96 lakh households (around 3.5 crore people) under the expanded scheme to be implemented from September 1. The state government decided to expand the health assurance scheme ignoring frequent pleas by opposition BJP to implement the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat scheme. Addressing a gathering, Naveen said every life is precious. He reiterated that financial constraints should not be an obstacle for anyone in getting quality healthcare. “Under the revised scheme, the beneficiaries won’t have to produce any document at the hospitals to avail its benefit. S/he can simply go to a hospital with the smart card and avail cashless treatment without any hassle. It is the first of its kind in the entire country,” said Naveen, making his first outing outside the state capital since the second wave of Covid struck. The chief minister said it is a paradigm shift in India’s healthcare service system where a patient can get the best of treatment without spending any money. While the card allows each family to avail free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh per annum, women members can avail benefits up to Rs 10 lakh annually in more than 200 hospitals in and outside Odisha. “Healthcare is crucial for all. It is said that health is wealth. We often get worried about arranging funds for treatment if anyone in the family falls sick. At times people have to sell property or opt for loan while others are forced to stop their child’s education to pay hospital dues,” said Naveen, adding, “The smart health card will reduce the burden on families to bear treatment cost. People can spend their savings on education of their children and for other household expenses.” Around 1.55 lakh smart cards will be distributed in Malkangiri alone for which nearly half a dozen ministers and senior BJD leaders will camp in Malkangiri district for the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/naveen-launches-smart-health-cards-for-cashless-treatment/articleshow/85499925.cms||Sujit kumar bisoyi

There are allegations against Mamata that she detained the ambulance that carried the ACF, Soumya Ranjan Mohapatra, to Cuttack on July 12 after the forest officer sustained burn injuries in his quarters, a day before he succumbed to his injuries. The Crime Branch grilled Panda for over three hours. During the interrogation, she reportedly told the Crime Branch that she was a distant relative of Bidya Bharati Panda, wife of the deceased forest officer. She was going to the hospital where he was initially treated as he was her relative. “I answered all the questions they asked me,” said Mamata. Earlier, they interrogated the ambulance driver and helper, doctors, who initially treated the forest officer and tehsildar of Paralakhemundi, who was present during his dying declaration. The forest officer sustained burn injuries in his official quarter on July 12 and died at a private hospital in Cuttack on July 13. His wife was present in the house during the incident. The deceased’s father, Abhiram Mohapatra, alleged that his son was murdered. After a month of investigation by Paralakhemundi police, the Crime Branch took over the probe into the muc-publicised case recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/oic-quizzed-in-acfs-death-case/articleshow/85497404.cms||---

The Democrat is scheduled to have a last full day as governor Monday, giving way to Lt. Kathy Hochul at the stroke of midnight. Cuomo hasn’t said where he’ll be living once he leaves the Executive Mansion. He formerly had a residence in Mount Kisco, north of New York City, with the television personality Sandra Lee, but the former couple sold the home after they split up. Office of General Services spokesperson Joe Brill told The Associated Press the governor will need to vacate the state mansion by the time he leaves office. In addition to U-Haul vans on the mansion’s grounds, photographers snapped pictures of state workers loading items into into an SUV with Office of General Services plates. Cuomo’s spokespeople and the Office of General Services didn’t immediately respond to questions Friday about whether the moving vans were there for Cuomo’s belongings or not. Legislative leaders have yet to receive Cuomo’s resignation letter. He announced he would resign days after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he sexually harassed at least 11 women. Even as Cuomo prepared to leave office, his lawyer continued to attack the accuracy of the report that led to his resignation. Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin claimed in an online briefing that the report contained omissions and errors. For instance, the report described Cuomo at a public event pressing two fingers of his right hand on the letters of a company name printed on Virginia Limmiatis’ shirt. Glavin showed a photo of Cuomo appearing to point at the shirt with his left hand. Limmiatis’ attorney, Mariann Wang, said the photos do not depict the inappropriate touching and characterized Cuomo’s actions as “desperate efforts of a bully down and alone.” The report describes Cuomo grabbing another woman’s bottom at a public event. Glavin showed an email in which the woman described it as two “quick pats.” Attorney General Letitia James’ office has defended the report as thorough and accurate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/moving-vans-at-mansion-as-andrew-cuomo-prepares-to-leave-office/articleshow/85500124.cms||---

With the rule still in force in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri, people are worried about not being able to visit each other on the occasion, which falls on a Sunday this year. Shopkeepers, too, apprehend that with the markets shut on weekends, they may miss out on the profits from the last-minute sales of rakhis and other items. “People usually buy sweets, fruits and goodies in the 11th hour. But with weekend shutdown restrictions in some cities, including the state capital, business will be affected. We have been selling extra stuff on Friday in view of the weekend shutdown and the festival,” Bimbadhar Behera of Nimapada Sweets said. Seasonal shopkeepers in other markets were hoping for some relaxations ahead of the festival to help their business. “Everything has returned to normal. There have be no sales in the last few months owing to the successive lockdowns. I hope the government eases the restrictions so that we can make some money,” Kartika Sahu, who sets up a shop at Unit-4 market for Rakhi, said. With public transport like buses and auto-rickshaws largely off the road during the weekend, many people may be forced to stay at home and celebrate the festival virtually. “I stay at Lingipur and my brother is in Patia. Without public transport, it would be difficult for me to visit him to tie the rakhi. The festival is not just about tying the rakhi, but also having a family get-together when our other siblings join the celebrations,” Suchitra Sahu, a homemaker, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/weekend-shutdown-may-dampen-rakhi-celebrations/articleshow/85494728.cms||Minati Singha

The high court observed that it was very unfortunate that even in the 75th year of Independence, some sections were being deprived of basic facilities such as burial grounds and crematoriums for last rites in a dignified manner. The high court made the observations in the judgment on allotting land to Scheduled Castes for a burial ground at Pedakakani village in Guntur district. Justice Battu Devanand said that people living in various colonies in Pedakakani, mostly SCs, have been performing the last rites on the bund of a tank which has been objected to by people from other castes. Justice Devanand further observed that it was the duty of the state and local governments to ensure the right to life of all citizens irrespective of their caste, creed, gender, region and religion. He said the right to life also included right to dignity even after death. ‘Steps must be taken to allot same land to SCs’ Justice Devanand sent the judgment copy to the chief secretary to conduct a survey across the state. The judge turned down the petition challenging allotment of 0.24 acres for a burial ground. The petitioners contended that the said land belonged to Hindu crematorium and the officials were allotting it for a Christian cemetery. The petitioner further argued that the farmers would face problems if the land was assigned for cemetery. The state government filed an affidavit stating the petitioners encroached part of the land assigned for Hindu crematorium. The proposal to allot the said land was prepared as the crematorium was surrounded by a compound wall and the others have been requesting for suitable place for burial ground. After hearing both sides, the high court disposed the petition directing the authorities to conduct a survey in the presence of the petitioner to find out if the land was encroached. The high court further said that if the petitioner was in possession of land belonging to crematorium, he should be evicted in accordance with law and steps must be taken to allot the same land to people from Scheduled Castes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/right-to-dignity-also-applies-to-the-dead-andhra-hc/articleshow/85497868.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||BJP, BJD lock horns over state education minister’s tweet||BHUBANESWAR: Amid the BJP’s ongoing Jan Ashirwad Yatra, a tweet by state education minister Arun Sahoo evoked sharp reactions from saffron party leaders on Friday. Sahoo tweeted, “Forcing someone to bless without serving them and earning the blessing of someone without asking for it by working nonstop are different things. People of Odisha know the difference.” While Sahoo did not name anyone, the BJP leaders interpreted it as a dig at Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Ashwini Vaishnaw, who sought the people’s and Lord Jagannath’s blessings for Odisha’s development on Thursday. Dharmendra had tweeted a photo of the two ministers and state BJP president Samir Mohanty lying face down in front of the Jagannath temple. “With Lord’s blessings, let everyone stay happy and in peace,” he had written in his post. Responding to Sahoo’s tweet, state BJP secretary Tankadhar Tripathy wrote back, “It seems education minister Arun Sahoo does not know that no one can force anyone to give blessings. People may bless those who mix with them, be part of them in their sorrow and happiness. One can’t get this if he/she is closeted in a room.” BJP leader Lekhashree Samantsinghar said it’s unbecoming of a minister to stoop so low. “How can someone make fun of anyone seeking the blessings of Lord Jagannath?” she asked. Many BJP leaders also tweeted a “controversial” photograph of Sahoo spending time with a section of priests of Jagannath Temple in Puri during his tenure as law minister. Sahoo, when contacted, declined to comment on his tweet. While Dharmendra attended several inauguration and foundation stone laying events related to the education ministry, Vaishnaw toured Rayagada and Koraput districts after an overnight train journey from Bhubaneswar to Rayagada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/bjp-bjd-lock-horns-over-state-education-ministers-tweet/articleshow/85494974.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Doorstep collection of e-waste from Bhubaneswar’s 57 more wards||BHUBANESWAR: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) will extend the ‘collection of e-waste from people’s doorsteps’ service to 57 more wards of the city from Saturday. Until now, the civic body would collect the e-waste from 10 wards every Saturday. Around three quintals of e-waste were collected from these wards recently as part of a special drive. On July 24, the BMC started a campaign to spread awareness among people about giving away e-waste to safai karmacharis (sanitation workers) and not dumping it outside their homes. “Damaged electronic apparatus, accessories and other such items can not only cause environment and health hazards, but can also be misused if they fall into the wrong hands. This is why people should ensure that they are properly disposed of,” a BMC official said. The residents can give away their e-waste like cords, computer keyboards, broken parts of mobile phones to the sanitation workers. The garbage collection van has a separate bag to collect e-waste during the door-to-door collection. These dedicated vehicles transport the waste to the three different material recovery facilities. BMC additional commissioner Laxmikanta Sethi said, “I appeal to the residents to cooperate with the sanitation workers. The e-waste collection vehicles will be moving around the wards in the morning hours, and not just on Saturdays, like before.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/doorstep-collection-of-e-waste-from-citys-57-more-wards/articleshow/85494811.cms||---

Official sources said the tribals are now selling each piece of the fruit between Rs 20 and Rs 25, which is around Rs 10 higher than last year’s price, as there is a huge demand for pineapples in northern India. The Dongria Kondhs grow pineapple in an organic manner, said collector (Rayagada) Saroj Kumar Mishra. Most importantly, contrary to previous years, when the Dongia Kondhs used to come down the hill with their produce to sell it at Chatikona from where the traders used to transport the fruit by trains, this year the traders are going to their doorsteps due to restrictions on the movement of trains during the lockdown. “This has saved the transportation cost of tribals that they used to spend to bring down their produce to Chatikona from the villages spread across the Niyamgiri hill,” said Sudarshan Padhi, project manager, Odisha PVTG empowerment and livelihood improvement programme, Rayagada. With the climatic condition being conducive, pineapple is grown over 700 acres by the Dongria Kondhs residing in and around the Niyamgiri Hills. Around 8,000 to Rs 10,000 pineapples are harvested from an acre after three years of planting it. While the cleaning season for pineapple cultivation is September-October, the harvesting and trading season is from June-August. “Currently, the tribals are selling pineapples at a profit. All steps have been taken by the administration to ensure that there is no distress sale,” the collector said. Official sources said the civil construction work for a pineapple juice making unit got recently over and orders have been placed for installation of the machinery. “Once, the pineapple juice-making unit becomes operational, it will further enhance the tribal economy through value addition and will generate employment opportunities for the community,” the collector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/pineapples-grown-by-tribals-find-favour-with-traders/articleshow/85495014.cms||Satyanarayan Patnaik
---||Delhi||Former aspirants on SC allowing girls to appear for NDA exam: 'Now, women can choose to serve in the Indian military at a young age’||Earlier this week, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy issued an interim order allowing women candidates to take the National Defence Academy examination to be held on November 14 this year. This will allow girls to enter NDA right after school. Currently, female candidates are allowed to join the armed forces only after graduation in both technical and non-technical services. The Press Information Bureau released information on the gender ratio in the armed forces in February 2021. The current percentage of women in the armed forces (0.56% in the Army, 1.04% in the Air Force and 6.05% in the Navy) is likely to go up once the NDA entry is opened to girls. Laqshika Patiyal, 26, who has been a defence aspirant and is now helping other aspirants to prepare for their Service Selection Board interviews, says, “The change was needed. I am thrilled that now young girls will be eligible for the exam. Young women will only add to the prestige of the organisation, I wish this chance was given to us.” Prachi Soni, 22, shares, “I have appeared for UPSC CDS exam thrice and managed to clear two times. I also appeared for SSB thrice. When female candidates are allowed to sit for exams like CDS and CAPF, then why not NDA? It will give girls the option to choose the Indian military at a very early age. It will be a great opportunity especially for girls like me, who do not have an armed forces family background.” “I really wish I had this opportunity,” says Sonali Shehnaz, 25, a student and former armed forces aspirant, adding, “I can’t think of any reason why women were not allowed to sit for NDA. But better late than never.” A woman officer currently serving in the Army tells us, “This will give girls more time to train themselves, and make the armed forces a viable career option at an early stage.” Although the court has allowed girls to appear for the NDA exam, coaching centres are still waiting for further details before prepping female aspirants. A Chandigarh-based SSB coaching academy’s representative says, “We will wait for Union Public Service Commission and Service Selection Board’s directions before preparing to give coaching for NDA to girls.” The NDA to armed forces journeyTill now, only boys aged 16 1/2 to 19 1/2 years, were allowed to sit for the NDA written exam. Upon clearing the exam, they undergo a five-day Service Selection Board (SSB) process, followed by medical examination on clearing the SSB. A merit list is released after that and the selected candidates undergo three years of training at the National Defence Academy in Khadakwasla, Pune. In the fourth year, cadets move to their respective service academies – Indian Military Academy (Dehradun, Uttarakhand), Air Force Academy (Dundigal, Hyderabad) or the Indian Naval Academy (Ezhimala, Kerala). The four-year journey culminates as they get commissioned as officers in the armed forces. - Shivika Manchanda and Riya Sharma||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/former-aspirants-on-sc-allowing-girls-to-appear-for-nda-exam-now-women-can-choose-to-serve-in-the-indian-military-at-a-young-age/articleshow/85487351.cms||---

He died on the spot and all efforts to rescue him failed. The incident was recorded on a CCTV camera. The police have identified the deceased as Panyam Venkata Subbaiah, 60. According to Owk police sub-inspector Jagadeeswara Reddy, Venkata Subbaiah, who hails from neighbouring Kasipuram village, came to Sunkesula village to witness Muharram procession. As part of the observance a huge bonfire was lit for fire-walk. Even as the fire was blazing, Venkata Subbaiah went around it. Locals, who noticed Subbaiah in an inebriated state, reprimanded him and forced him to sit on a bench nearby. After some time, even as everyone present was engrossed in the Peerla Panduga (Muharrum observance) Venkata Subbaiah once again got close to the fire pit and suddenly jumped into it. Though villagers tried to rescue him after great difficulty, Venkata Subbaiah, who sustained severe burns, was already dead. Owk police, who learnt about the incident, rushed to the spot and shifted the victim’s body to the local area hospital for postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/man-jumps-into-fire-pit-during-muharram-in-kurnool-district/articleshow/85497832.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Delhi||As big releases hit the theatres, will Delhi’s film buffs follow suit?||With Bollywood releases lined up for the coming week, coupled with big-ticket Hollywood blockbusters, will moviegoers return to cinemas? So far, the audience is sharply divided on the matter. On the one hand are people who have been waiting to go back to theatres and enjoy ‘the big screen with a big tub of popcorn experience’ once again. On the other are folks who are wondering whether cinema halls are even required in the age of OTT, and who now prefer viewing films from the comfort and safety of their home. Safety protocols taken by cinemas include a 100% vaccinated staff, 50% occupancy & mandatory masks policy'I can watch latest releases at home, why risk going to cinemas?'Cinemas are going out of their way to assure moviegoers that they have rigorous safety protocols in place, but not everyone is convinced. Preeti Gaur, who works for a cultural organisation, says, “My friends keep asking me to go out for a movie, but I am not convinced yet. Cinemas can’t keep an eye on every moviegoer and I’m more concerned about fellow audiences exhibiting COVID inappropriate behaviour. They wear masks while entering a cinema hall, but as soon as they get inside they may remove them. As F&B is allowed in cinemas, people will be removing their masks to eat. I also don’t think the show timings are staggered enough to avoid crowds. My home is a movie theatre in itself now, where I can watch the latest releases without any hassles. Why risk visiting a cinema hall?” So, when is she likely to go back to cinemas? “Not this year, for sure,” says Preeti. Priyanjali, who works in the interior decor sector, says, “Cinemas are an enclosed space, which feels like a nightmare scenario at the moment. Discounts are not going to pull people out of their homes, because many worry that other audience members won’t follow COVID appropriate behaviour and so their safety may be compromised. Also, cinemas are allowing people who are not vaccinated or partially vaccinated as well. I feel there should be special shows only for people who are fully vaccinated. I’m not going back to cinemas anytime in near future.” Will the audience follow the suit?Can't wait to go back to cinemas:Cinephiles say watching films on the big screen is magical and no big screen TV can match the experience. Tathagatha Chowdhury, a theatre director, says, “I’ve waited so long for the latest releases to be shown in cinemas. I even went to watch movies during all those phases when cinemas temporarily reopened. At all those shows, I have seen there were only four-five moviegoers, so it feels pretty much like a private screening. The cinemas are also taking all precautions to ensure moviegoers are safe. I am planning to watch The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It , Suicide Squad and Bollywood releases this week. I find cinemas safer than any other public space like markets. People have been eating out at restaurants then why not go to cinemas?” Mayuri Saha, who works in a salon, says, “I’ve missed going to the movies. You need to watch a film on the big screen again to realise what you’re missing. I have seen horror films at home when theatres were closed. But when I came to watch the new Conjuring installment on Sunday, I realised that this experience is irreplaceable. At home, whenever I used to feel scared, I used to pause and play. But here in the cinema hall, with the sound and your friends screaming along with you, it is a very different experience. I find cinemas safe and they follow all COVID safety protocols. I may not be frequenting theatres as much as I used to before, but I will be catching up on all the new releases in one.” Sanjay Varshney, a college student, who booked the first-day first-show ticket post reopening of cinemas in Gurgaon, says, “You can’t compare going to cinemas with watching a movie on TV. First, you are glued to your laptop screen for work and then you shift from chair to couch to stare at your TV. No matter how good a film is, I always end up thinking about how it would’ve felt watching it in cinemas..” With 100% vaccinated staff, 50% occupancy, cinemas are among safest public spaces: ExhibitorsOn their part, cinemas have been promoting the safety measure they have been taking, which includes a 100% vaccinated staff, mandatory mask policy, and staggered shows with 50% occupancy. Post reopening on July 29, a statement by Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Limited, read, “Ensuring the safety and security of our customers and employees is our foremost responsibility. All the ground level staff and employees across our cinemas are 100% vaccinated.” A senior official of another multiplex chain says, “We want to assure cinemagoers that cinema halls are the safest public place. People are ready to eat out in restaurants where everyone’s mask is down, flyers sit close to each other in planes, but people think cinemas are unsafe. Why? A lot has been said about cinemas being closed spaces, but what people don’t understand is that the air filtration system of cinemas is better than any other place.You are not sitting close to any other moviegoer. Due to the 50% occupancy system, when you book tickets, the seats on both sides are anyway blocked. Besides that, sanitisers have been kept at all access points.” Releases lined up for August-September:Chehre Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings F9 Malignant Qismat 2 No Time to Die Watch As big releases hit the theatres, will Delhi’s film buffs follow suit?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-big-releases-hit-the-theatres-will-delhis-film-buffs-follow-suit/articleshow/85494080.cms||Niharika Lal
---||India||Empires founded on terror don't last: Prime Minister Modi||RAJKOT: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that destructive forces and people following the ideology of creating empires using terror as a tool have an ephemeral dominance and they cannot suppress humanity forever. The Prime Minister's comments - made at a virtual inauguration of beautification projects at Somnath temple - come in the wake of Taliban's stunningly rapid takeover of Afghanistan. Modi cited the example of repeated plundering of Somnath temple and how it survived every attack. "This temple is emblematic of the belief that truth can't be defeated by falsehood and faith can't be crushed by terror. The destructive powers and thinking that try to establish an empire on the basis of terror may dominate temporarily, but their existence is never permanent. They cannot suppress humanity for a long time. This was true when some tyrants were plundering Somnath and it is equally true even today when the world is apprehensive of such ideologies," he said without naming any country or terrorist organisation. Recalling the contribution of Sardar Patel in building the present temple, Modi also paid tributes to India's first President Dr Rajendra Prasad and freedom fighter from Gujarat Kanaiyalal Munshi who played pivotal roles in its construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/empires-founded-on-terror-dont-last-prime-minister-modi/articleshow/85501124.cms||---

Gary C. Ferrell II, 26, faces two counts of murder and one count each of criminal confinement with a deadly weapon, resisting law enforcement and carrying a handgun without a license. The Frankfort man was arrested Wednesday following a high-speed car chase after the fatal shootings outside NHK Seating of America, where police said he had worked a day shift. Ferrell is accused of killing co-workers Promise Mays, 21, and her grandmother, Pamela Sled, 62, both of nearby Rossville, in the plant's parking lot as they arrived late Wednesday afternoon for their evening shifts. Ferrell, who remains incarcerated at the Clinton County Jail without bond, was scheduled to appear Friday for an initial hearing, according to court records. It was not immediately clear if he has an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Clinton County prosecutors filed a court notice Friday declaring that they will seek the death penalty against Ferrell, citing his alleged confinement of Mays just prior to the shootings as an aggravator that allows them to pursue capital punishment. According to prosecutors, when police interviewed Ferrell after his arrest on Wednesday, he told them he thought up his plans to kill Mays the night before, the Journal & Courier reported. A probable cause affidavit filed with the charges does not indicate what Ferrell's motive might have been in the killings. The affidavit, which cites factory security video for details of the killings, states that Ferrell parked next to Sledd's vehicle outside the plant shortly after 4 p.m. Wednesday, opened his car's trunk and then forced Mays from her grandmother's car. With a semiautomatic handgun in his right hand, Ferrell then dragged Mays to the back of his car and tried to force her into the trunk, according to the affidavit. Sledd then exited her car and exchanged words with Ferrell, who pointed to the factory, aimed the gun at Sledd as she backed away, allegedly shot her three times as she tried to get away, and she collapsed. Ferrell then shot Mays, who was crouched behind his car refusing to get into the trunk, and she fell to the ground before he returned to his car, backed over her body and drove from the scene, according to the affidavit. Police intercepted Ferrell on Indiana 28 and chased him into Frankfort, where he was arrested after crashing his car in the construction zone, police said Wednesday. NHK Seating of America opened in June and employs about 700 people who design and make seating for automotive vehicles, according to the company's website. Frankfort is located about 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) northwest of Indianapolis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-charged-with-murder-in-2-killings-outside-indiana-plant/articleshow/85501502.cms||---

Doha has been the venue for intra-Afghan peace talks and Qatar has emerged as a crucial player in facilitating the Afghan peace process.

Addressing the All India Management Association on Friday, Shringla said there was a "silver lining" in the Taliban making the right noises and seeking international legitimacy and recognition, which they did not the last time they were in power. Follow live updates on Afghan crisis"We can work with a dispensation that is willing to look after the interests of the Afghan people," he said. Before the Taliban took over, India was working on development projects in all 34 provinces of the country and the message from the new regime has been that they want India to continue. Shringla observed that the new regime in Afghanistan needs both trade and aid from India. The foreign secretary's remarks need to be read in the context of indications that India could consider doing business with Taliban, and even consider recognition, but this will depend on how the regime behaves with its citizens and if concerns over terrorism are adequately addressed. India is unlikely to rush to a decision as it would want clarity on how much leverage Pakistan-based jihadi groups will get in Afghanistan. Foreign minister S Jaishankar drove home India's concerns on Afghanistan becoming a hub of terror at the UNSC during his visit to New York. Shringla also said the US had indicated it would start issuing 'H' category visas for Indian professionals wanting to travel to the US in September. By the end of the year, visas from other categories may also be issued if Covid levels continue to be low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-sees-silver-lining-in-talibans-right-noises-foreign-secretary-harsh-shringla/articleshow/85501934.cms||---

An Amnesty International report quotes eyewitnesses in Ghazni province who recounted how the Taliban killed nine ethnic Hazara men in the village of Mundarakht between July 4 and 6. Six of the men were shot and the rest tortured to death. Hazaras are minority Shia Muslims. Previously persecuted by the Taliban, they had made major gains in education and social status in recent years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/reports-of-reprisals-targeted-killings-by-taliban-fuel-afghanistan-fears/articleshow/85502440.cms||---

In videos that have by now been circulated the world over, shocked men and women on the ground can be heard sending out a prayer to god. Ajay Chettri from Dehradun was one of them. He witnessed the nightmare unfold right in front of his eyes. Chhetri, a former Armyman who was evacuated from Afghanistan on August 17 on an Indian Air Force (IAF) plane, told on Friday that he is still traumatised by what he saw at the Kabul airport as he frantically scurried to leave the city that was his home for over a decade. On August 16, after the Taliban's capture of Afghanistan's capital, Chhetri, who worked as a security officer there, had "packed up his life" in Kabul and like hundreds of others reached the airport. "I was at the military airbase which is next to the airport when I heard gunshots. Bullets were flying all around. It was complete chaos. But that wasn't the worst part," said Chhetri, now in Dehradun with his family. "What I will never forget is how people were running on the tarmac alongside the US cargo planes that were taking off, carrying hundreds of Afghans. One of the planes had left the ground but people were still clinging to its wheel. A little later, I saw two bodies drop down from the sky. It was horrific and I couldn't take it any more," said Chhetri. The 60-year-old, who was accompanied by his sister-in-law, Savita Shahi, decided to turn back from the airport and take shelter in a NATO camp, a few metres away. Shahi, who worked as an assistant to a US medical team in Kabul, contacted the Indian embassy in Afghanistan and found that an IAF plane was scheduled to leave the city the next day with diplomats and embassy staff. "On our request, the embassy officials agreed to adjust five of us on the flight home, but two more Indians joined us later and they were also accommodated in the rescue flight," she said. Their passage to India was secured but reaching Kabul airport while avoiding the Taliban was a challenge and risk. The group of seven left the camp at about 3.30am in the night. "We walked to the airport, praying that no one would stop us. The situation was slightly better that day as there were less people at the airport. Still, we were very tense until we saw the IAF flight touch down at Kabul around 6am," said Shahi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/i-was-at-the-airport-saw-bodies-falling-from-plane/articleshow/85502718.cms||---

In a 20-minute White House press conference, Biden, flanked by vice president Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said there had been no questions about loss of American credibility due to the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan. Describing the evacuation as one of the largest and most difficult airlifts in history, he disclosed that 6000 US troops had been injected to establish control of the Kabul airport, and after a pause in evacuation for a few hours on Friday to organize logistics at arrival stations, outbound flight had resumed again. Dismissing reports that the Taliban were preventing or only selectively allowing people wanting to leave to access the airport, Biden said "we know of no circumstances that Americans can't get to airport." US commanders on the ground we coordinating airport access with Taliban, he said, adding that American forces were not seeking to expand control beyond the airport perimeter because that could lead to "unintended consequences." "Americans who want to leave can get to the airport...any Americans who want to come home, we will get you home...the United States stands by its commitment made to the Afghan people including women leaders and journalists...we are going to do everything to do safe evacuation of Afghan allies and those who will be targeted," Biden said. Acknowledging that the scene coming out of Kabul was heartrending and gutwrenching, Biden said he was convening a meeting of G7 countries to coordinate response to the situation. In what was his second effort to address the crisis in Afghanistan, the US President tried to project poise, strength and assurance amid widespread criticism of the shambolic withdrawal. The question, "What did the President know and when did he know it?" that underscored the Watergate scandal is scorching Washington again after his remarks earlier this week that he was never told that such a rapid collapse in Afghanistan was possible was contested by leaks claiming there were warnings and red flags galore that Taliban would overrun Kabul if the US left too quickly. Vice-president Kamala Harris too is under fire for being indifferent to the plight of women. She is scheduled to leave on an Asia trip, with stops in Singapore and Vietnam, later in the day, trailed by exhortation contained in a letter signed by 85 individuals and groups urging her to "take actions to protect Afghan women and girls and to address this unfolding human rights and humanitarian catastrophe." The crisis buffeting the Biden-Harris administration comes amid a continuing stand-off in Kabul where US forces are struggling to evacuate Americans stranded outside the airport perimeter controlled by Taliban. Reports of periodic skirmishes and firing point to a tense situation, with a CNN correspondent on the spot saying "it is very hard to be an American here." At home, Biden is under several scrutiny after the leak of an internal memo sent though the state department's dissent channel that warned Washington of a potential collapse of Kabul soon after the August 31 troop withdrawal deadline. The July 13 cable signed by a dozen diplomats, first reported in the Wall Street Journal, warned of rapid territorial gains by the Taliban and the subsequent collapse of Afghan security forces, while offering recommendations to mitigate the crisis and speed up an evacuation. Critics of the Biden dispensation say the administration failed to address the urgency of the situation even as it is scrambling to streamline the evacuation, sending special teams to Kabul, Qatar, and Kuwait to help in the effort. Political sniping has intensified in Washington with Biden supporters maintaining that it was the Trump administration's deal with the Taliban committing to an early withdrawal that tied the hands of the incoming President. “Our secretary of state (Mike Pompeo) signed a surrender agreement with the Taliban. This collapse goes back to the capitulation agreement of 2020. The Taliban didn’t defeat us. We defeated ourselves.” Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, was quoted saying in a podcast. Another Trump administration official, former Defense Secretary Mike Asper, told CNN that while Biden “owns” the ultimate outcome in Afghanistan, former President Trump had “undermined” the agreement through his barely disguised impatience to withdraw forces with little regard for the consequences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-pledges-to-evacuate-all-americans-and-afghan-allies-who-want-to-leave-kabul-says-taliban-cooperating/articleshow/85502257.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

Ruma Biswas, sister of BJP worker from Naihati, Santu Mondal, said the High Court's order brought a ray of hope of justice. Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh said After the high court's order, it is now proved that chief minister Mamata Banerjee had told lies many times. "After proper investigation, it is to be ensured that the culprits are punished and the affected families get proper compensation."  "The way Mamata Banerjee, being in a constitutional position, repeatedly denied the allegations of violence is not correct. This time, she is going to the Supreme Court challenging the verdict of the high court. I hope the Supreme Court will uphold this verdict," added the BJP MP.  The Calcutta High Court on Thursday ordered a court-monitored Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the incidents of post-poll violence in West Bengal.  The high court also ordered to set up Special Investigation Teams (SIT), comprising senior officers from West Bengal cadre, for investigation of relatively less serious crimes.  The court also directed the state government to take immediate steps for compensating the victims of the post-poll violence.  Several incidents of violence were reported at various places after the announcement of the assembly poll results on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-post-poll-violence-affected-families-welcome-hcs-order-of-cbi-probe/articleshow/85503107.cms||---
---||India||Meeting of 19 opposition parties calls for stir from September 20||NEW DELHI: Accusing the government of ignoring people's issues and plunging the economy into a spiral, the opposition parties on Friday announced joint protests across states in September with Congress president Sonia Gandhi urging the parties to start preparing for the 2024 elections. Sonia said the opposition must work for an alternative to unveil a government based on "values of the freedom struggle and the Constitution". She urged the parties to rise above "compulsions" and work together while other leaders like West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said the issue of leadership need not be addressed at present. The protests, to be held between September 20 and 30, will be a joint show of 19 parties that attended a virtual meeting called by Sonia Gandhi. The move is a clear bid to translate the coordination established at the leadership level in recent months and cemented during the just-concluded Parliament session, into a grassroots alliance. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said "opposition unity" was not enough and the alliance needed to present an "alternative vision" of what it stands for since the vision offered by the RSS-BJP is being liked by people. While CPM's Sitaram Yechury said "the opposition is united by the Constitution of India", Rahul argued it needed to be fleshed out in people's language that they could relate to and understand why it was important for the country. For the fledgling axis, the planned protests require Trinamool Congress and Left coming together in West Bengal, Congress and JD(S) in Karnataka, SP, RLD and Congress in UP - an early test to the experiment being put in motion. The deliberations attended by TMC, DMK, NCP, Shiv Sena, JMM, CPI, CPM, RJD, JD(S), RLD, NC and PDP, among others, emphasised unity in a joint statement issued after the meeting. Sonia noted that the Parliament session exhibited cohesion among parties, which will be sustained in future. The alliance said SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had sent a letter saying he could not attend the meeting because he was travelling, but expressed his agreement with the statement issued. The tricky subject of leadership of the opposition also came up for mention. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee said the opposition should not dwell on the leadership issue and that "people will lead". She said all anti-BJP parties should be roped in, including those which are at odds with Congress. "Fight is against BJP. Let us set up a core group and work together," she said, in what appeared an allusion to outfits like BJD, TRS, AAP and YSRCP. "Let us keep our personal interests aside," she remarked. Interestingly, sources said the TMC leader appeared annoyed when she asked who drafted the joint statement circulated to the participants, and was informed that the author was CPM chief Sitaram Yechury. All the chief ministers - M K Stalin, Uddhav Thackeray, Hemant Soren and Banerjee - spoke about governing BJP disturbing non-BJP state governments. Soren said there was a need to jointly push back when it happens, and that delayed statements of support were of no help. RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary said meetings were not enough and immediate action plans should be spelt out. Praising the unity during the Parliament session, Sonia said, "But the larger political battle has to be fought outside it. Of course, the ultimate goal is the 2024 Lok Sabha elections for which we have to begin to plan systematically with the single-minded objective of giving to our country a government that believes in the values of the freedom movement and in the principles of our Constitution." In the joint statement, the opposition blamed the government for "arrogant unwillingness" to discuss urgent issues like Pegasus snooping scandal, repeal of farm laws, inflation and fuel hike, which stalled the Parliament session. They said Pegasus was rampant in the run-up to the 2019 elections. It said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day address was recycled from earlier ones that did not touch upon people's issues, which was an "ominous warning" that people's ruin will continue. It noted that the economy had been run to the ground which has led to joblessness and inflation, while poor vaccination level was threatening a third wave of pandemic. In an 11-point charter of demands to the Modi government, the opposition sought release of all political prisoners, including those linked to Elgar Parishad and anti-CAA protests, and in J&K. It sought full statehood for J&K and early free & fair elections there. It also sought a Supreme Court-monitored judicial inquiry into Pegasus and a high-level probe into the Rafale deal. The opposition demanded that the government augment vaccine production, cash transfers of Rs 7,500 per month to families outside the income tax bracket, daily food kits to the needy, withdrawal of central excise duties on petroleum products, repeal of farm laws, stoppage of unbridled privatisation, stimulus to MSMEs, 200 days' work under MGNREGA and introduction of a similar urban scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/meeting-of-19-opposition-parties-calls-for-stir-from-september-20/articleshow/85503028.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: Dad of 2 murdered kids found hanging in house in Sector 70||NOIDA: The father of the two children who were found dead in Sector 34 on Wednesday was himself found hanging from the ceiling of an abandoned house in Basai village in Sector 70 of Noida on Friday. Police said Mahesh's body hung from the swivel meant for a fan. The death probably took place three days back. In a note was found in his pocket, Mahesh had purportedly written that he was responsible for the deaths of his two children - Monu (6) and Tinka (3). Mahesh's body, police said, was spotted by sanitation workers who were passing by and entered the dilapidated building because of a stench coming from inside. Much of the body had decomposed, police said, adding a few bricks lay under his feet. Mahesh had left home with his two sons on Tuesday evening, telling his wife that he was taking them out for a walk and would return soon. The next morning, the two kids were found with their throats slit, possibly with a blade, near Billabong International School in Sector 34. Monu’s fingers were still wrapped around a piece of toffee and there were lacerations near the vein. A blade and a white shirt lay nearby. Mahesh, according to his brother Arun, was upset at not being able to find a job for the past two months. He worked for an export company but lost his job. He joined another firm, but that too shut down after the death of the owner. Although Arun was aware of this, Mahesh hadn’t told his wife that he no longer had a job at hand. Police, however, suspect there could be something more than just job loss that allegedly prompted Mahesh to murder his children and then hang himself. “There seems to be some information that the family is yet to share with us. It is true that he had lost his job. But the entire thing appears to be well-planned. There could be reasons that are yet to be revealed,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional DCP (Noida). Mahesh’s family described him as a subdued person who mostly kept to himself. “But he loved children. Never did he raise hands on them. A few days ago, Mahesh had accompanied us on a trip to Vrindavan. Throughout the journey, he kept holding the hand of his elder son,” Arun said. He, however, admitted that Mahesh would often have fights with his wife over monetary constraints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/dad-of-two-murdered-kids-found-hanging-in-house/articleshow/85503133.cms||Shikha Salaria

The minutes of the MPC meeting released on Friday reveal that, worried by inflation, one member, J R Varma, had voted to raise the reverse repo, the rate at which banks lend to the RBI. This rate is outside the remit of the MPC, which votes only on the repo rate, the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI. High domestic price of fuels has triggered worries over stubborn price pressures and there have been demands to reduce taxes to help calm prices of petrol and diesel across the country. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has blamed the burden of UPA-era oil bonds as an obstacle to bringing down fuel prices. She has said that if she did not have the burden to service the oil bonds, she would have been in a position to reduce excise duty on fuel. Earlier, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had also said that diesel and petrol prices act as cost-push factors across a range of activities. "It's not just that passengers who use cars and bikes. High fuel prices also have an impact on the cost of manufacturing, transportation and other aspects," Das had said in a speech in February. While retail inflation has shown some signs of moderation in July, wholesale price inflation continued to remain in double digits for the fourth consecutive month. Stubborn inflationary pressures have prompted the RBI to pause its rate-cutting cycle, although it has promised to keep an easy stance to help support growth and nurse the economy to a high growth trajectory. The minutes reveal that Das made a strong pitch for continuing monetary policy support, citing slack in the economy and inflation being driven by supply-side factors. "Continued policy support with a focus on revival and sustenance of growth is indeed the most desirable and judicious policy option at this moment," said Das, making a case for maintaining status quo. "On the whole, the economy still requires support in terms of maintaining congenial financial conditions and fiscal boosters. At such a critical juncture, can we really pull the rug and let the economy tumble?" said Das. RBI ED Mridul Saggar estimated that the excise duty hike itself may have pushed headline inflation higher by 60-80 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point), adding to cost-push inflation. Saggar, who along with the others voted for status quo, highlighted the significance of narrative economics in difficult times in producing business cycle movements endogenously. The views of external members reveal that, while all are keen to support the economy, there is some divergence in respect of their view on inflation. External member Ashima Goyal said that if indirect taxes impart persistence to inflation, it could de-anchor inflation expectation and pose challenges to monetary policy. Pointing out that fuel prices do not fall with international prices, she said, "A persistent rise in Indian fuel prices is at odds with inflation targeting." Varma, who argued for withdrawing the accommodative stance, said, "Persistent high inflation means that the monetary accommodation has to be somewhat restrained and, therefore, I argued for raising money market rates towards the repo rate of 4%." Barclays economist Rahul Bajoria said that the minutes indicate a shift within the MPC's narrative and, while the overarching view remains consistently to support the economic recovery, the comfort with inflation dynamics is certainly shifting within the MPC members. He added that there also appears to be a slight divergence visible on inflation persistence between the internal and external members. "But we reckon this gap is unlikely to be sustained, as more inflation prints come through," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/taxes-on-fuel-trigger-worry-at-rbi-policy-panels-meet/articleshow/85503194.cms||---

The trio was also taken for a school visit during their two-day stay in India, played cricket and was escorted to a local mosque for prayers. They were gifted new clothes and numerous other things as a token of goodwill. The children — two from Troti Chattra and another from Lassi Mang Chattra — may have inadvertently crossed over to the Indian side while fishing. As they were minors, the Indian Army didn’t open fire at the eldest, said Brigadier Rakesh Nair of 10 Krishna Ghati Brigade during a press conference in Poonch. “During questioning, these children claimed that they belonged to Troti Darmshall and Chattra areas, located across the LoC, and were working as labourers, excavating sand from rivers in the area,” Brigadier Nair added. The Indian Army had similarly repatriated three girls, who had inadvertently crossed the LoC in December 2020, with gifts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-repatriates-3-pok-boys-with-gifts/articleshow/85503245.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||In shift, Biden taps career diplomat, not politician, for ambassador to China||WASHINGTON: Veteran US diplomat Nicholas Burns has been nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as US ambassador to China, the White House said on Friday, signaling the administration may be looking for the envoy to play a more central role in the increasingly fractious relations between the two global rivals. The choice of Burns, a retired career foreign service officer who served as under secretary of state between 2005 and 2008, marks a shift for the role of the ambassador to Beijing, the ranks of which over the past decade have been filled by former politicians, not seasoned diplomats. If confirmed by the Senate, Burns would head to China as the two countries' ties are at their lowest point in decades, and fill a post left vacant since October, after former President Donald Trump's envoy to China, Terry Branstad, stepped down. The United States and China, currently the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economies, are at odds over issues including trade, technology, US arms sales to Taiwan and Chinese military activities in the disputed South China Sea, with each accusing the other of deliberately provocative behavior. While Burns is not seen as a China policy specialist, neither were the previous four US ambassadors to Beijing. Burns, however, has ties to Biden, having served as an adviser to his election campaign, and has worked closely over the years with some of Biden's most trusted advisers, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Former Republican President George W. Bush appointed him as under secretary for political affairs, historically the State Department's third-ranking official, with global responsibilities, where he served until 2008.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/in-shift-biden-taps-career-diplomat-not-politician-for-ambassador-to-china/articleshow/85503251.cms||---

The duo was part of Hizbul’s hit squad, responsible for civilian murders in south Kashmir, IGP (Kashmir Range) Vijay Kumar said. One of the slain terrorists was identified as Musaib Mushtaq of Pulwama’s Khrew area, involved in killing Lurgam resident Javaid Ahmed Malik, a peon at a girls’ school in Patsuna. “The identity of the other terrorist is yet to be known,” the IGP said. Acting on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists, a joint team of the Army, CRPF and Jammu-Kashmir Police had launched a cordon-and-search operation in Khrew early on Friday morning. On seeing the security forces approaching them, the holed-up ultras opened fire at the search party, triggering an encounter. The Hizbul duo was killed after a brief gunfight, the IGP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-hizbul-terrorists-responsible-for-civilian-murders-killed-in-pulwama/articleshow/85503346.cms||M Saleem Pandit

They were caught near Border Outpost Hakimpur, under Battalion 112 of the BSF, Border Outpost Ghojadanga under Battalion 153, and Border Outpost Samshernagar under Battalion 118. Some of the apprehended Bangladeshis were coming to India, while some were crossing the border to reach the other side, read a BSF statement.  The apprehended Bangladeshi nationals include 14 men.  During the initial interrogation, all have declared themselves to be citizens of Bangladesh.  "Some of these persons were trying to come to India in search of work and some were going from India to Bangladesh to meet their families," the BSF mentioned. It said that some of these Bangladeshis were crossing the border with the help of a tout.  All the apprehended Bangladeshi nationals have been handed over to the concerned police stations along with all their belongings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bsf-nabs-15-bangladeshis-while-illegally-crossing-india-bangla-border/articleshow/85503365.cms||---
---||India||Centre stockpiling critical drugs to fight another possible Covid wave||MUMBAI: The government has kickstarted an exercise to create a national stockpile of critical medicines for Covid-19 to tide over the challenges around affordability and accessibility as it prepares for a possible third wave. To begin with, buffer stocks of 15-odd medicines, including anti-viral Remdesivir, key antibiotics Tocilizumab, and black fungus drug Amphotericin B will be maintained, after supplies are procured through the tendering process, sources told TOI. This could prevent the massive shortages of critical drugs like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, key antibiotics and ICU medication, witnessed during the brutal second wave in April-June this year. The stock-outs led to black marketing and huge mark-ups in prices of certain drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab across the country, which severely impacted the common man. For instance, in the case of Remdesivir, the tenders were floated recently and supplies have been dispatched by companies. Initially, the plan is to create a stock of 50 lakh vials of remedesivir, sources added. The national stockpile is expected to be funded from the Rs 23,123-crore package approved by the Centre in July for improving health infrastructure to fight Covid-19. The Centre has also drawn up an oxygen supply strategy, and is focusing on ICU preparedness. Around 2.4 lakh medical beds and 20,000 ICU ones would be created with a special focus on paediatric care. Under the new package, the Centre would provide Rs 15,000 crore, and states would contribute Rs 8,123 crore. The plan would be implemented jointly by them across 736 districts to improve medical infrastructure. It is understood that certain states, including Gujarat, have also embarked on a similar exercise to shore up inventory of essential Covid-related drugs in apprehension of the third wave. The creation of a stockpile will help companies to plan and manage inventory to strengthen supply chains and resolve glitches in manufacturing of raw materials (active pharmaceutical ingredients), and finished formulations (drugs). Even as stocks are being procured, companies have been asked to maintain sufficient stocks of certain drugs where manufacturing time involves 15-20 days. In December last year once the Covid cases had reduced, companies had cut back on production of key drugs as there was less requirement. "Strategic stockpiling of critical Covid drugs, oxygen and other Covid requirements is critical based on our learning of Covid 2.0. Centre and state governments are working on the same. We need to be prepared so that we are not caught off-guard this time around. Companies are working on their production cycle and inventory management so that there is a faster turnaround of critical drugs in case of an emergency. Manufacturing and supply chain agility has been important and will continue to be important in the unpredictable environment on account of Covid," an industry expert had earlier told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-stockpiling-critical-drugs-to-fight-another-possible-covid-wave/articleshow/85503375.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Intranasal vaccines are administered through syringes, nasal sprays or aerosol delivery straight into the nasal cavity. The commonly used intranasal vaccine is the influenza vaccine. In the two animal studies, the intranasal vaccine has been found to reduce the viral load and lessen the impact on lungs. Unlike the previous vaccines, this vaccine was tested on hamsters on an early mutation (D614G) of the nCoV spike protein and was found to reduce the viral load in nasal swabs. Dr Nanasaheb Thorat, a Marie-Curie fellow at Oxford, said the intranasal method would be a game-changer with possibly lesser side-effects. He said since the vaccine, which is already in use, has been tried through a different route of administration, it would need fewer approvals. "Intra-nasal vaccines are easier to administer. Even children can easily be given the vaccine. The latest research shows that the intra-nasal vaccine reduced virus load and helped prevent the spread of infection to the lungs," Thorat told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxford-starts-human-trials-for-covishield-nasal-vaccine/articleshow/85503479.cms||Swatee Kher

On July 31, Karnataka said even fully vaccinated persons coming in from Kerala must produce an RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours. However, the Centre’s advisory said RT-PCR test reports need not be mandated for fully vaccinated interstate travellers. Kerala has been reporting over 20,000 Covid cases a day and Karnataka’s daily caseload has not crossed 2,000 since mid-July. A few residents from border district Kasargod have moved the Kerala high court against the mandate. Raising concerns over the hurdles in implementing the mandate, experts actively involved in formulating Karnataka’s Covid management policy said individual states must be given autonomy to take decisions on crucial issues that can prevent a Covid surge. On August 5, Kerala wrote to Karnataka seeking permission to produce either a negative RT-PCR report or completed Covid-19 vaccination certificate for interstate travellers. Kerala said it was following the same policy for incoming travellers. Second wave in Karnataka began after Kerala students returned’ On August 8, regular passengers and political parties burnt Covid final vaccination certificates at the interstate border at Talapady, near Mangaluru, opposing the Karnataka move. Experts said a spike in Karnataka’s cases in both waves began after people from Kerala started coming in. “Ahead of a third wave, we must control the spread of infection from places with high positivity rates. Despite heightened border surveillance, there have been reports of people from Kerala entering Karnataka without an RT-PCR report. They could be asymptomatic carriers,” said an expert. Another expert said pressure was mounting on Karnataka to withdraw the RT-PCR test mandate from Kerala travellers. “Tests can’t be mandated for fully vaccinated persons as per the government of India guidelines for interstate travel. However, the state governments must be given the liberty to take decisions on their own. While Karnataka has made the test report mandatory for those coming from Maharashtra and Kerala, the resistance is more from Kerala passengers,” said the expert. Experts claimed the second wave began in Karnataka in March 2021 after students from Kerala returned to their colleges in Dakshina Kannada and Bengaluru. At least 20-25 students from Kerala enter Dakshina Kannada with negative RT-PCR test reports every day, district officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-in-a-spot-over-negative-certs-from-interstate-travellers/articleshow/85503722.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||R-value declines, but Karnataka cautious on easing curbs||BENGALURU: In an indication of Covid-19 infections declining in the state, the R-value has fallen below one after crossing the psychological threshold in the first week of this month. However, with lessons learnt the hard way during the second wave, the government is unlikely to lift restrictions like night curfew anytime soon. “The Covid situation in the state is well under control as fresh cases are stable,” said chief secretary P Ravikumar. “The drop in R-value is an encouraging trend. However, we cannot afford to take it easy and relax curbs. Let us wait for the festival season to get over and observe the emerging situation before taking a call on the status of curbs.” The R-value, a measure of the rapidity with which the virus spreads, had reached six in May when the second wave of infections was at its peak before sliding by the end of June. It reached 1.02 in August, before dropping to 0.92 on August 9. Officials say it slid further to reach 0.89 on August 18. Ensuring an R-value of below one is significant in terms of pandemic management. If it is more than one, it means an infected person can spread the virus to more than one person, leading to a gradual surge. “The decline is a heartening trend especially after it briefly crossed the one mark earlier this month,” said Dr MK Sudarshan, chairman of the state’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). “It is especially significant since schools are set to reopen for regular classes for grades 9 to 12 from Monday.” The sustained low R-value level is reflected in the fact that daily fresh cases have hovered around the 1,500-mark since the last week of June. However, the most encouraging trend is that the overall test positivity rate (TPR) in the state has fallen below 0.8%, with hotspots like Bengaluru recording lower levels (0.5%) than the state average. Even Dakshina Kannada district, which recently entered the red zone after breaching the 5% TPR mark, has shown a declining trend with the positivity rate falling below 3.5%. Hospitalization has also hit a low. On Friday, only 131 of the 1,939 Covid beds in Bengaluru were occupied. However, wary of a surge especially since a string of festivals are around the corner, the government has decided to continue with curbs at least till Ganesh Chaturthi on September 10. While night curfew, which kicks in at 9pm, has been clamped across the state including in Bengaluru, weekend curfew has been imposed in districts that border Kerala, where the pandemic situation is still grim. Kerala has a TRP of over 15%. Pubs have not been allowed to resume business while theatres can operate with only 50% occupancy. Noting the flattened curve, many experts have predicted a further decline in infections and say it also indicates the end of the second wave. “Barring slight fluctuations, the curve has been flat since the end of June,” said noted epidemiologist Dr T Jacob John. “While it will not touch zero for practical reasons, the present trend indicates that the second wave ended somewhere in June or early July.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-not-to-ease-curbs-till-sept-10/articleshow/85503725.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Before realizing the costly gaffe, the minister announced a government job and land even as the kin of the serving soldier — whose house he visited — stood in shock and broke down fearing an untoward incident. As per the itinerary, the minister was to visit the residence of a martyred soldier at Mulgund in Gadag district. Instead, Narayanaswamy visited the house of serving soldier Ravikumar Kattimani. The minister, who was behind schedule, was in a hurry when he reached Mulgund along with Haveri BJP MP Shivakumar Udasi. He went to the house of Kattimani, currently posted in Jammu and Kashmir, and enquired about the health and condition of the family members. Later, he announced that a government job would be provided to one member and land for the family, which left the entire family in a state of shock and confusion. Local BJP men blamed for errorThe soldier’s parents started sobbing uncontrollably as they presumed that he had been martyred. A local BJP worker, who knew the family, immediately made a video call to the soldier. On connecting with Ravikumar, he requested the minister to speak to the soldier. Realising the faux pas, the minister tried to control the damage by praising their son. He also felicitated the family members before leaving their home. After leaving the soldier’s residence, he reportedly took local BJP leaders to task. Sources said local BJP leaders provided wrong information to the minister. According to the tour programme, the minister was scheduled to offer condolences to the family of Basavaraj Hiremath, who died in the line of duty in Pune, Maharashtra, more than one and a half years ago. The BJP’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra in Karnataka to welcome new Union ministers from the state has been in the news for wrong reasons. They faced flak for not ensuring Covid protocol.

The first additional district sessions court said the convicted woman will spend one more year in jail if she failed to pay the penalty. Of the fine amount, Rs 1.5 lakh will be deposited in a bank until the victims turn 18. The convict, Shridevi Sampathrao Korwar, and her immediate neighbours frequently quarreled over a fourinch land used for building a compound. On March 25, 2019, she allegedly lured the girls (a three-year-old and a ten-yearold) with a chocolate into her house and poured boiled oil on them. The child suffered injuries on the forehead, head, hands, legs and shoulder; the other girl injured her face, fingers, legs and thigh. Parents spent nearly Rs 20 lakh on their treatment. The court told the victims’ parents to get claim of money spent on treatment by submitting bills to District Legal Aid Service Authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kburagi-woman-pours-hot-oil-on-2-girls-gets-5yr-jail/articleshow/85503738.cms||---

He had accused the portal of dishonesty and deficiency in service, claiming it had failed to find a prospective match for him after collecting Rs 59,180 as non-refundable enrolment fee. The complainant, who is a resident of Malleswaram, had registered with Elite Matrimony Services on June 17, 2019 in an attempt to find a prospective match. He had paid Rs 59,180 through a cheque and was waiting for the profiles of prospective brides. The aspiring bridegroom claimed the portal, which had advertised to have over one lakh matches for its subscribers, failed to send him profiles despite him being a member for nearly four months. He said when he approached Elite Matrimony’s office with a complaint on the matter, he was treated rudely by a woman staffer. The man approached the Bengaluru Rural and Urban 1st additional district consumer disputes redressal forum in Shantinagar with a complaint against Elite Matrimony Services on October 24, 2019 and sought a refund of his deposit and compensation of Rs 3 lakh for dishonest and deficient service. The complainant presented his case on his own while the portal’s attorney claimed the complaint was frivolous, vexatious and with ulterior motives. Counsel for Elite Matrimony Services stated that the man had opted for the package and was provided profiles of 14 prospective brides, of which he picked two. He further said the agency was not responsible if the match didn’t materialise as it was their job only to facilitate the matter. Dismissing the complaint on July 23, 2021, the judges observed an online matchmaking portal can’t assure positive response at all times and does not guarantee a marriage within the service provided. Moreover, the complainant has not denied the claim that two out of 14 profiles of prospective brides sent by the opposite party were accepted by him, they pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/matrimonial-site-cant-guarantee-marriage-court/articleshow/85503739.cms||Petlee Peter
---||India||Yogi cabinet's expansion next week may amplify OBC push||NEW DELHI: The expansion of the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh slated for next week is likely to amplify the OBC push in the reshuffle of the central council of ministers effected recently. A decision to this effect was taken during a meeting at the residence of home minister Amit Shah on Thursday. Representation for communities like Kurmi, Nishad and Rajbhar is in sync with the central leadership's concerted bid to promote OBC leaders. A record 27 OBC leaders were included in the central government in the recent reshuffle. BJP president J P Nadda, Yogi, state president Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal were present at the meeting which lasted for over three hours. While there is a possibility of allies being inducted, new entrant to the party former Congress member Jitin Prasada, may also get a berth in the ministry. Party sources said the list will be finalised after the Rakshabandhan and oath-taking ceremony will take place within a week's time. While assembly polls are not too far as notification could be issued in December, there has been a discussion within the party about the need to accommodate some allies like Apna Dal and Nishad Party. Sources said at least seven to eight new ministers may be inducted. Although Prasada is not a member of the state legislature, he may be nominated to the legislative council. Prasada is a prominent Brahmin face and his inclusion in the state ministry will be yet another attempt to send a message to the Brahmin community, a sizeable vote-bank in UP. It is believed that the long wait of former IAS officer A K Sharma for a ministerial berth could also end. Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad had another meeting with Shah on Thursday. Apna Dal's Anupriya Patel had also called on Shah before the reshuffle. Her husband Ashish Singh Patel, who is already an MLC, could be party representative.The expansion of the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh slated for next week is likely to amplify the OBC push in the reshuffle of the central council of ministers effected recently.

It also said that the ambush in Bikru village of Kanpur on July 2-3 was a result of "poor planning" and "intelligence failure". An 825-page report of the commission, headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Justice BS Chauhan, was tabled in the state assembly by parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna on Thursday. The report concluded that Vikas Dubey had been informed about the raid on his house in advance and mentions that Dubey had patronage of police, administrative and revenue authorities. Eight police personnel, including a deputy SP, were killed during the raid. Dubey, who managed to escape, was later arrested in Ujjain. The police vehicle bringing him back to Kanpur met with and accident and Vikas Dubey was killed in an encounter when he tried to escape from custody, the police had said. After a magistrial probe, which had also given a clean chit to the police, the UP government set up the Chauhan commission, on the direction of the Supreme Court. Other members of the commission, which completed its report in April this year, were retired Allahabad HC judge Justice Shashi Kant Agarwal and former UP DGP KL Gupta. "The evidence adduced in the case supports police's version of the incident. The injuries suffered by policemen could not be self-inflicted or fabricated. Dr RS Mishra, who was on the panel of doctors, conducted the post-mortem and clarified that the injuries found on his person (Dubey) could be caused as per the version of police," the panel report said. "Nobody came forward from the public and media to contradict the police version and no evidence is filed in rebuttal. Richa Dubey, wife of Vikas, filed an affidavit calling the incident a fake encounter but she did not appear before the commission," the commission has said. Giving a detailed description of the encounter which had taken place on July 10, 2020, the commission said that a herd of cows and buffaloes started crossing the road when the vehicle carrying Dubey reached Kanpur Nagar in Sachendi area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/injuries-on-cops-in-dubey-case-not-self-inflicted-probe-report/articleshow/85503881.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The toll increased to 13,702 as six more patients succumbed to the disease. The latest 10-lakh cases came in a mere 119 days after the state crossed the first 10-lakh case mark on April 23. This is far less than the time taken for the state to record even the first one-lakh cases (137 days) or the ninth one-lakh cases (158 days). To put things in perspective, the state took more than a year (407 days) to log the first 10 lakh infections. The intensity of the second wave can be gauged from the fact that the state accumulated 5.9 lakh Covid-19 cases this May alone, equivalent to 35% of the cumulative cases that surfaced in the state by then. While it took more than six months to reach the peak during the first wave last year, the state surpassed the previous numbers in hardly two months since the presumed beginning of the second wave from the first week of March 2021. Andhra Pradesh reported 11,766 new Covid-19 cases on April 23, just two months into the second wave, outnumbering the earlier highest one-day spike of 10,830 cases recorded on August 26 last year in the first wave. From an average 70 daily infections in February (2021), Andhra Pradesh witnessed a sudden surge in the transmission numbers that reached its peak with 24,171 cases on May 16 in the second wave. The unprecedented spurt in the case numbers in the second wave led to a severe shortage of oxygen and ICU beds and other Covid-19 related facilities between the second half of April and the first week of June. After hitting the peak, the daily case numbers quickly dropped to the 500-1,000 range in the first wave. But even after overcoming the peak three months ago, the daily infections in the second wave have settled around 1,500 to 3,000 range for the last several weeks. There are currently 15,472 active cases with 19,70,864 cumulative recoveries and 13,702 fatalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/state-logs-second-10l-cases-in-just-119-days/articleshow/85505568.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Prerana Khanavali off Hasanamba Road, operational since March 2021, was launched by women who were struggling to lead a dignified life. The donors pooled money to help them set up their hotel. Now, these women are extending catering services to locals too. The donors’ team comprises the following: Roopa Hassan, an activist and the founder of Prerana Vikasa Vedike, Ratna Naik, retired associate dean, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit (USA), Dr Savithri A, gynaecologist and obstetrician (Hassan), Taraswamy, Hemalatha, an academician from Mandya, Venkategowda, writers S Usha, and Balasaheb Lokapure, district Scouts and Guides commissioner Dr Veerabhadrappa and others. Ratna Naik donated Rs 1 lakh, while Dr Savithri bears the hotel’s monthly building rent (Rs 6,500). The khanavali is run by six women — Dharani, Asma, Savitri, Shobha, Jayalakshmi and Indira. Dharani said they start work at 5.30am and usualy end at 10pm. Roopa said these women were initially involved in producing and marketing some home-made products like phenyl. “As they could not find a good market, we thought of engaging them in any work that did not require them to travel or depend on others for marketing. So we started Prerana Khanavali,” said Roopa, who brought together the donors and motivated the women to launch the hotel. Besides running the hotel, the women are also into catering services and production/ supply of various cooking ingredients, mainly masala powders. Ratna, the donor from US, said Prerana Khanavali has empowered women who otherwise would have been suffering. “We, as a community, need to provide financial resources and support for project implementation and sustenance,” she added. Dr Savitri said all are duty-bound to support people who are in distress. “No one should be left behind. We need to take care of all,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/donors-help-struggling-women-establish-a-restaurant-in-hassan/articleshow/85496452.cms||Shrinivasa M

Julie Kumari, a resident of Ishakchak locality, who is admitted at a sadar hospital ward in Bhagalpur, was pleasantly surprised to get nutritious food in hygienically packed utensils provided by the hospital management. Similar, was the experience of Punam Kumari and others in the hospital. ‘Didi Ki Rasoi’ is an initiative in which Jeevika workers have been given charge of the hospital's canteen to prepare quality meals for admitted patients there. Cleanliness and hygiene is maintained and the canteen is inspected by the DM, civil surgeon and other senior officials at regular intervals.

The Union minister was replying to YSRC Rajya Sabha MP V Vijayasai Reddy and a similar request from Anakapalle MP B V Satyavathi. Vijayasai Reddy in his letter to the Union minister said the national highway was constructed in four lanes in 2004 under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model. If the target of the traffic exceeds 40,000 passenger car unit (PCU), which is a measure of the impact that a mode of transport has, then the project is eligible to be upgraded to six lanes. Presently, traffic on the Anakapalle to Annavaram stretch is 42,215 PCU. B V Satyavathi and Vijayasai Reddy urged the Union minister to take up expansion work on the highway.

---||Patna||No university certificate not a ground to deny job: Patna HC||PATNA: The Patna high court has ruled that the failure to produce an educational degree certificate during interview is not a ground to cancel an aspirant’s candidature for a government job. The bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh set aside a decision of Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) by terming it unjustified and unsustainable. The BPSC had cancelled the candidature of at least 13 candidates as they, during the interview, had produced original provisional certificates of engineering degrees issued by their colleges and not by the universities which conducted their examinations. The hearing took place on August 16 and the judgement was uploaded next night. Three candidates — Anamika Asana, Nishu Kumari and Vineet Kumar — had moved the high court last month. They had cleared the PT and Mains examination for recruitment as assistant engineers in different departments of the state government. They were called for interviews but their names were not published in the final selection list. Asana and Kumar studied at BIT Sindri while Nishu passed out from Ram Govind Institute of Technology, both under Vinoba Bhave University at Hazaribagh in Jharkhand. They had submitted provisional certificates issued by the institutes with the application forms. The petitioners urged the HC that the final result published by the BPSC on July 14 this year be quashed and direction be issued to republish it after considering their candidature as valid. The court came to know from the BPSC’s counter affidavit that the candidature of eight more aspirants after holding their interview had been cancelled on the same grounds. Counsel Harsh Singh, appearing for the petitioners, submitted that as per norms of Vinoba Bhave University, provisional degree certificates are issued by respective colleges under it and degrees are conferred during convocations. The court took judicial notice of the fact that convocations are not held in the university for years. Singh also submitted that the BPSC had accepted provisional certificates issued by colleges as a valid document during old selection process in 2012. He also apprised that one of the petitioners’ husband was working in the state water resource department where he had been appointed after selection by the BPSC on the basis of a provisional certificate issued by the college. Advocate general Lalit Kishore argued that recruitment advertisement specifically mentioned that the aspirants must have qualification degree from an Indian university and they were required to furnish certificates issued by them. Kishore submitted that the BPSC had rightly rejected the petitioners’ candidature. The court observed that there was no finding on record that the candidates don’t have required qualification and advertisement didn’t mention that requirement that self-attested copies of BTech/BE certificates must be issued by a university. It also observed that there was no specific requirement of an aspirant to submit a certificate issued by the university to support educational qualification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/failure-to-produce-varsity-certificate-no-ground-to-cancel-candidature-for-a-job-hc/articleshow/85497461.cms||Debashish Karmakar

In an event organized at Sadaquat Ashram to mark th 77th birth anniversary of Rajiv, party leaders hailed his idea of a modern India and also lashed out at the present government for pushing the country backward. Senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar praised Rajiv for bringing revolution in information technology in the country and handling internal disputes and foreign relations. “Even educated people were apprehensive of computers and thought it would lead to unemployment in a country with a huge population. In fact, the opposition tried to create an atmosphere against it. But today, we are able to stand on par with the world because computers were introduced at the right time,” said Anwar while appreciating Rajiv for working for the development of youth and women and his contribution in strengthening the three-tier panchayati raj system and 33% reservation for women. He also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government. “The present PM is an impersonator. He changes clothes, looks and languages with the time. This government has done nothing for the country and its people, except for dividing society and creating communal hatred,” Anwar said, adding, “The PM says he works for 18 hours, but I have seen Rajiv Gandhi working till 4am. In fact, several times we were called for meetings at 1am or 2pm. In his short duration, he did great work.” Bihar Congress in-charge Bhakta Charan Das recalled his initial meeting with Rajiv while the former was a Janta party MLA from Kalahandi, which was suffering because of famine that time. Das realled how Rajiv used to visit the area and meet poor people to know their problems. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha appreciated how Rajiv used to give respect even to his opponents and stated that former PM late Atal Bihari Vajpayee had once said he was alive because of Rajiv Gandhi. A book christened ‘Adhunik Bharat Ke Nirmaata-Rajiv Gandhi’ was also released under the aegis of state Congress research committee, idea committee and Rajiv Gandhi Panchayati Raj committee. This event was convened by Vichar Vibhag chairman Shashi Kumar Singh. Research committee chairman Anand Madhab welcomed the speakers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-leaders-remember-rajiv-on-his-77th-birth-anniv/articleshow/85497143.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Now, boys and girls seeking admission to the undergraduate courses, both in regular and self-financing modes, can submit their applications by August 31, said PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar. Kumar said the date has been extended by vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Choudhary, keeping in view the problems being faced by several students residing in flood-affected areas of the state. Many students were facing difficulties in moving out of their homes and locating cybercafe in their localities due to the floods. He said, for the first time, PU has started online centralized admission for all undergraduate academic programmes. A student is required to fill up only one form, indicating his choice of courses and colleges in order of preference. The list of students selected for admission on the basis of marks-cum-choice would be published soon after the last date of online submission of forms, he said. Till date, nearly 30,000 students have already registered for admission and over 17,000 have made the payments, too.

---||Patna||Many move apex court to get cases listed for hearing before Patna HC||PATNA: As the Patna high court has been taking up urgent matters only and not functioning in physical mode since the second wave of the Covid-19 hit the state as well as the country, many people recently moved the Supreme Court for hearing their cases, including bail matters. The Patna high court has not been either accepting the cases for mentioning considering the matter as not an urgent one for hearing or their cases have been pending for long. The Patna high court has not been functioning in complete physical mode for more than one and a half years owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and taking up only urgent cases for hearing since mid-March last year. The HC tried to reopen in hybrid mode with studio courts where judges sat in one courtroom and lawyers in another, but that worked only for sometime and the court had to switch to complete virtual mode again earlier this year due to the second wave of the pandemic. The most recent one to get relief from the Supreme Court is Kamladiyyta Construction Private Limited, which has been blacklisted by the state government for 10 years. The firm moved the high court, but it’s matter was not taken up for hearing considering that it was not an urgent one. It finally moved the Supreme court. A full bench of Justices R F Nariman, Navin Sinha and Indira Banerjee on August 11 observed that the firm’s matter was extremely urgent and requested the Patna high court to take it up at the earliest. “We are sure that the high court will take heed of this and, at least, pass interim orders on the writ petition filed by the petitioner,” the SC observed. The petitioner apprised the apex court that tenders were to be floated and the firm would not be able to participate due to its blacklisting. Bihar State Bar Council chairman Ramakant Sharma said they have unanimously passed a resolution on Thursday urging Chief Justice Sanjay Karol to soon start physical hearing in the high court as well as in all subordinate courts in the state. “Courts are functioning only in virtual mode due to Covid-19 pandemic. This has increased the backlog of cases. In addition, the Patna high court is running with an extremely low count of judges, who are trying to handle issues with virtual hearing, but the situation is not favourable,” he said, adding that the case of Kamladityya Construction Firm was actually an urgent one. Senior counsel YV Giri said it’s a fact that litigants are moving the Supreme court even at a stage of rejection of mentioning of cases for hearing. “They are suffering due to slow disposal of cases. Pandemic and poor strength of judges are the main reasons behind it,” he said. In another case, one Rajesh Kumar moved the Supreme Court to get his anticipatory bail petition listed for hearing before the high court. On June 4, the division bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and M R Shah directed the high court to consider Kumar’s prayer at the earliest, preferably within three weeks from the order date. Another example is of Om Prakash Dhanuka, who moved the apex court as his anticipatory bail petition was not being listed in the Patna high court despite repeated requests by his counsel. A full bench of then Justice NV Ramana (now CJI) with Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose on March 23 this year requested the high court to list Dhanuka’s anticipatory bail application and dispose it on its merit within a week. An arbitration matter between M/s Dwivedi and Sons and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited is pending for hearing before the high court for long. A division bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari in the Supreme Court ordered the high court on August 6 that the matter relates to arbitration proceedings which should be concluded expeditiously. Senior counsel P K Shahi said the biggest reason for cases not being taken up for hearing is the depleted strength of judges in the HC. “Bihar is a big state. In proportion, HC is functioning hardly with one-third strength of judges. Starting physical court will give no relief,” he added. ‘Sessions courts should start hybrid mode of hearing cases’ The Patna high court on Wednesday issued directions to all district and sessions judges in Bihar to open subordinate courts in the hybrid mode — physical as well as virtual — on an experimental basis in consultation with the inspecting judges concerned. Direction has also been issued to avoid congregation and to ensure minimum footfall on court premises as per the prevailing Covid-19 guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-move-apex-court-to-get-cases-listed-for-hearing-before-hc/articleshow/85497870.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Talking to reporters here during his party’s ‘ashirwad yatra’, Singh said the ministry of power has started working on the plan to ensure 24-hour electricity availability in all the villages. "For this, the central government has approved a scheme of Rs3,03,000 crore. Before this, a scheme of Rs2,02,000 crore was started in which Bihar got Rs22,000 crore,” he said. “At present, there is availability of 22 hours electricity supply in all the villages of the country. Apart from this, we also aim to provide electricity to every agricultural field for irrigation soon. For this, all the government and non-government power undertakings of the country have been asked to work fast,” he said. The minister said, in the year 2015, only 10 to 12 hours of electricity was available in the villages. He said in urban areas of the country, electricity is available 24 hours at some places and work is on to ensure power availability for 24 hours. Singh said there is a demand of 2 lakh MW power in the country while the total power generation capacity has reached 3,84,000 MW. “Altogether 1,42,000km of grid line has been expanded in the country. In a span of just 18 months, 2,82,00,000 households have been given electricity connections. In Bihar, 512 new power sub-stations were installed and 450 sub-stations were upgraded. We have replaced 7.5 lakh km of power lines and installed 6.65 lakh new transformers in the country. Solar grid of 1 lakh MW capacity has also been installed,” Singh said. Earlier, Singh inaugurated various road, health and other development projects worth Rs11.32 crore. Other dignitaries present on the occasion included BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, former minister Ramadhar Singh, former MLC Rajan Kumar Singh, former MLA Manoj Sharma, NTPC east zone executive director Praveen Saxena and NPGC chief executive officer Vijay Singh among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/24x7-power-supply-to-every-village-in-country-soon-min/articleshow/85497911.cms||---

The accused were identified as J Ramakrishna (50), A Lakshmi Narayana (53) and A Guru Prakash (25). The arrests come a day after chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy directed officials to bring those involved in the scam in the registration and stamps department to book. The irregularities unearthed in Kadapa point to a loss of Rs 1.03 crore so far. Similar irregularities have come to light in various districts across the state over the last couple of weeks. Police said the trio had siphoned off Rs 1.03 crore from the Kadapa urban and rural registrar offices by creating 798 fake challans in connection with 241 documents. The accused used five different bank accounts to divert the funds into their own bank accounts instead of remitting it to the state government treasury. Kadapa police seized one CPU, monitor, keyboard, a mouse and two printers from the possession of the accused. A case was registered against the trio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/three-document-writers-in-kadapa-arrested-for-issuing-fake-challans/articleshow/85498455.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Welcoming the move of the high court, ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said railways has prepared a blueprint to build infrastructure for the MEMU terminal. “Railways has planned to develop railway network vertically on this piece of land. The area will be developed from commercial point of view also,” he said. The railways will build office complex and other utilities, including ticket booking centre, at the proposed terminal. A multi-storey building will also be built on the land. According to the CPRO, initial consultations with technical experts focused on the need to develop “crowd management programme” at the Hardinge Park land. “The proposed terminal will be located close to main roads leading towards Patna Junction and other prime locations in the city. Railways intends to build a multi-purpose terminal, ensuring smooth flow of traffic during peak hours,” he said. Kumar added at least four double-discharge platforms would be built at the twrminal. He said railways has also urged the BSNL to hand over a small piece of land adjacent to Hardinge Park for the proposed. “The BSNL has agreed in principle to hand over the land,” the CPRO said. Danapur divisional railway manager Prabhat Kumar said the proposed MEMU terminal would decongest Patna Junction. “The greatest advantage will be that all MEMU passenger trains will originate and terminate from Hardinge Park terminal instead of Patna Junction,” he said, adding railways has been running several pairs of MEMU passenger trains on Jhajha-Patna-Buxar-Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction, Patna-Gaya, Danapur-Rajgir, Patna-Sasaram and Patna-Sonepur routes. Railways has urged the state government to hand it over the Hardinge Park land in lieu of transfer of Patna Sahib-Patna Ghat track land measuring about 19 acres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railways-plans-to-build-memu-terminal-on-hardinge-park-land-in-patna/articleshow/85497074.cms||Kumod Verma

According to police sources, they received a complaint from one Chebrole Sirisha, a resident of Machilipatnam town, alleging her husband was harassing her for additional dowry and questioning her fidelity. Sirisha married Prabhakar in 2011 after he divorced his first wife. The woman first tried to lodge a complaint with the local police station, but after receiving a lacklustre response, Sirisha decided to approach Krishna district SP Siddharth Kaushal via the Spandana grievance redressal programme. The SP immediately forwarded her plaint to deputy superintendent of police of Disha police station Rajiv Kumar, who inquired into the matter, registered an FIR and filed the final chargesheet in 24 hours, setting a record in the state. Since the advent of the Disha Act, cops have been focusing on responding quickly towards crimes against women and the time taken for filing the chargesheet in several such cases has seen a drastic drop from 200-odd days to seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dowry-case-chargesheet-filed-in-a-day-in-new-record/articleshow/85498335.cms||---

Around 30% work has been completed so far. The project had slowed down because of the pandemic restrictions and lack of funds. The Public Works Department (PWD) has said that funds are available now for expediting procurement of material and other works. A timeline has been fixed for completing the six lanes by the end of the financial year. The Wagholi-Shikrapur section is the busiest stretch of the Ahmednagar highway as thousands of vehicles travel daily towards Ranjangaon and other locations. The existing four lanes are proving insufficient to cater to the increased vehicular movement. A PWD official said, “The work is being expedited. There were some issues pertaining to availability of funds. We are sorting out the issue. The funds are required for procuring materials for tarring. We are attempting to complete the remaining work by March 2022. The existing road is of four lanes. One lane is being added on both sides to turn it into a six-lane road.” Sandip Satav, a local resident, said, “We have approached the officials with memoranda to expedite the remaining work. We want the work to be completed on priority on stretches, which witness frequent traffic jams. The authorities also need to check the quality of work,” Satav added. PWD officials said that they have requested the concerned authorities to install safety measures. “We will also carry out inspections to meet safety requirements,” the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wagholi-shikrapur-6-lane-road-likely-to-be-ready-next-year/articleshow/85498631.cms||Sarang Dastane

According to Penamaluru police, Rahul, the managing director of ZXN cylinders pvt ltd, had financial differences with his business partner Korada Vijay Kumar for the past year. Differences between the two aggravated after the company suffered substantial losses due to the lockdown. Cops said Vijay allegedly spent the company’s money to contest the 2019 general elections without Rahul’s consent, and ended up losing even his deposit amount. After his electoral defeat, Vijay sought his investment amount back, to which Rahul refused, citing that his unilateral decisions caused losses to the company. Vijay developed a grudge against Rahul and decided to kill him, cops said.

---||Vijayawada||Many women deceived via social media relationships in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: The recent murder of a B.Tech student shocked many as it happened in broad daylight, with CCTV footage available for the whole world to see. However, cops point out that there was no scope of preventing the crime when the parents themselves weren’t aware of the social media relationship of the victim with the accused. On August 15, N Ramya, a third year engineering student was stabbed multiple times after her jilted Instagram acquaintance Sasi Kumar, after relentlessly stalking her for several days, decided to take the extreme measure. This was not the only jilted love-linked murder in Andhra Pradesh, with at least 16 such incidents reported across the state since 2020. Officials point out the need to sensitise women who are prone to be approached by men who might have ‘two faces’ — one for reel, and the other in real life. On August 2, cops arrested Chennupalli Prasanna Kumar, alias Prashant Reddy, alias Rajareddy, alias Tony (23), who allegedly cheated over 300 women across ShareChat, Facebook and Instagram by extorting money from them. Explaining the trend pertaining to the B.Tech student’s murder, DIG SV Rajasekhar Reddy said the trend of men luring women on social media through deception and lies accounts for most such crimes. “Even in this case (Guntur murder), the accused presented himself as a stylish and charming youth, but the social personality always lacks a sense of originality,” he said. Police data indicate that 30% of harassment cases against women happen to be linked to unrequited love. City-based clinical psychologist RV Shekar told TOI that in most social media relationships, the men tend to keep it a secret from their parents or relatives because they know the previous generation ‘just won’t get it’. “It is important for the parents, government and especially the police to take the initiative and raise awareness among youth about online fraudsters trying to honey trap strangers for financial or even sexual gains,” opined Shekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/many-women-deceived-via-social-media-relationships-in-ap/articleshow/85495920.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

According to a statement by NIPL, this partnership will enable over 2 million Indians, who travel to UAE every year, to make payments using UPI-based mobile applications across shops and merchant stores. UPI is an instant real-time payment system developed by NPCI, facilitating inter-bank transactions. From a Mashreq perspective, the initiative will enable its merchants to draw customers who are used to mobile-based payment systems. The bank has witnessed 20% month-on-month growth in pick-up rate as young and tech-savvy customers seek to use mobile payments systems along with a growing number of retailers across the UAE that accept such transactions. NIPL CEO Ritesh Shukla said that this was part of NIPL’s strategy of taking India’s payments solutions to global markets and collaborate with willing partners. “We are excited about our partnership with Mashreq Bank, which will enable consumers from India transact using UPI.” Mashreq is the first in the market to partner NIPL. It is UAE’s oldest bank and has a footprint across the Middle East. It has international offices in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the US, and a strong presence in the financial capitals of the world. Mashreq Bank EVP (payments head) Kartik Taneja said, “Given the position of UAE as an international commerce and tourism hub, retail merchants in the Emirates always enable the latest payment methods that are expected by our international clients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mashreq-bk-activates-upi-platform-across-uae/articleshow/85500666.cms||---

The toll increased to 13,702 as six more patients succumbed to the disease. The latest 10-lakh cases came in a mere 119 days after the state crossed the first 10-lakh case mark on April 23. This is far less than the time taken for the state to record even the first one-lakh cases (137 days) or the ninth one-lakh cases (158 days). To put things in perspective, the state took more than a year (407 days) to log the first 10 lakh infections. The intensity of the second wave can be gauged from the fact that the state accumulated 5.9 lakh Covid-19 cases this May alone, equivalent to 35% of the cumulative cases that surfaced in the state by then. While it took more than six months to reach the peak during the first wave last year, the state surpassed the previous numbers in hardly two months since the presumed beginning of the second wave from the first week of March 2021. Andhra Pradesh reported 11,766 new Covid-19 cases on April 23, just two months into the second wave, outnumbering the earlier highest one-day spike of 10,830 cases recorded on August 26 last year in the first wave. From an average 70 daily infections in February (2021), Andhra Pradesh witnessed a sudden surge in the transmission numbers that reached its peak with 24,171 cases on May 16 in the second wave. The unprecedented spurt in the case numbers in the second wave led to a severe shortage of oxygen and ICU beds and other Covid-19 related facilities between the second half of April and the first week of June. After hitting the peak, the daily case numbers quickly dropped to the 500-1,000 range in the first wave. But even after overcoming the peak three months ago, the daily infections in the second wave have settled around 1,500 to 3,000 range for the last several weeks. There are currently 15,472 active cases with 19,70,864 cumulative recoveries and 13,702 fatalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-logs-second-10l-cases-in-just-119-days/articleshow/85505569.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Tej alleged that Sanjay did not allow him to talk with his younger brother and vowed to take this fight to a logical conclusion. Tej on Friday visited the 10, Circular Road, bungalow of his mother Rabri Devi where Tejashwi also lives. While talking to TOI over the phone, Tej said Sanjay did not let the two brothers talk despite repeated attempts and he had to come back to his residence. “While we had started talking, Sanjay Yadav intervened and took Tejashwi away. He is not letting me talk to my brother,” said Tej, adding “In a couple of days, I will leave for Delhi on Rakshabandhan and discuss this matter with my father.” He even challenged Jagadanand to stop him from holding a janata darbar at the party headquarters on Saturday. Earlier in the day, Jagdanand had taken a jibe at Tej’s statement that he would avoid taking part in party activities. Jagadanand said people attend the meeting when they are called, meaning thereby that Tej Pratap will not be invited to any party programme. When asked about the ongoing tussle in the RJD and giving opportunity to the rivals to comment, Tej blamed Jagadanand for the entire episode. “Jagdanand Singh should understand this. He is the one trying to weaken the RJD and Tej Pratap can never tolerate any wrong thing,” said Tej. A day before, Tej, in a tweet, had called Jagadanand a sleeper cell of Nagpuria party (BJP). Meanwhile, after the 10, Circular Road bungalow episode, Tejashwi left for Delhi. Though he will be a part of the all-party delegation to be led by CM Nitish Kumar to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Monday on caste-based census issue, party sources said he left a couple of days earlier to avoid any embarrassing situation. “He will also get sufficient time to discuss the entire episode with his father. When in Delhi, he can avoid both Tej Pratap as well as the media,” said a party leader. The ongoing fight within the RJD has given an opportunity to BJP to take a jibe at the Lalu’s party. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi said because of this fight, RJD was not able to concentrate on public issues. “In this internal fight in the RJD, who will become Dara Shikoh and will rule like Aurengzeb, only time will tell,” read a part of his tweet.

Two earth movers, eight bikes, metal detectors and various other equipment were also seized by the police. Anantpaur SP Kaginelli Fakeerappa said the 18 arrested include some seasoned offenders who are part of interstate gangs. “They were arrested by Kanaganapalli, Roddam, and Yadiki police during raids carried out at multiple locations. There were rumours about a possible hidden treasure beneath a huge boulder which exists in an extent of 1.5 acres of land owned by Kesa Vayya and Naga Raju from Daduluru village under Kanaganapalli mandal. Four persons were arrested when they were digging up the place by roping in an earth mover,” he told reporters. The four were identified as A Sabarish (26), Pavan Kumar (21), K Nagendra (23), and Parandhama (32). In a similar incident reported from Roddam, an undeciphered inscription was found on the outskirts of Roddakampalli village few days back, leading to rumours about possible hidden treasure in the area. People of the village believe that the area was part of Vijayanagara emperor Srikrishna Devaraya’s kingdom. One Narasimhulu from the village approached his friend KN Narayana, a resident of Pavgada taluk in Tumkur district of Karnataka, and told him about the possible hidden treasure in the area. Narayana and his gang started digging up several spots using an earth mover, and were arrested by Roddam police on Friday while they were digging one such spot. The other members of the gang were identified as GS Krishna Reddy (49), V Rajaiah (52), Mohammed Iqbal (52), Nagaraju (39), and R Eswarappa (60). Elsewhere, Yadiki police arrested eight persons for illegally carrying out excavations around Sunkalamma temple near Kundanakota in Yadiki mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/18-treasure-hunters-held-in-anantapur/articleshow/85498506.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

About 2.3 lakh students will write the exam in Hindi in NEET-2021, followed by Gujarati (49,943), Bengali (35,118), and Tamil (19,867). J Srinivas, a chemistry faculty at a JEE/NEET coaching academy of Vizag city, said that the aspirants are opting for long-term coaching, if they do not get an MBBS seat in their first attempt. “Due to the same, the level of competition in terms of cut-offs is increasing with each passing year. Many students are not willing to join other undergraduate medical courses other than the MBBS programme,” said Srinivas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fewer-aspirants-sign-up-for-neet-ug-in-ap/articleshow/85496102.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The minutes of the MPC meeting released on Friday reveal that, worried by inflation, one member, J R Varma, had voted to raise the reverse repo, the rate at which banks lend to the RBI. This rate is outside the remit of the MPC, which votes only on the repo rate, the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI. High domestic price of fuels has triggered worries over stubborn price pressures and there have been demands to reduce taxes to help calm prices of petrol and diesel across the country. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has blamed the burden of UPA-era oil bonds as an obstacle to bringing down fuel prices. She has said that if she did not have the burden to service the oil bonds, she would have been in a position to reduce excise duty on fuel. Earlier, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had also said that diesel and petrol prices act as cost-push factors across a range of activities. “It’s not just that passengers who use cars and bikes. High fuel prices also have an impact on the cost of manufacturing, transportation and other aspects,” Das had said in a speech in February. While retail inflation has shown some signs of moderation in July, wholesale price inflation continued to remain in double digits for the fourth consecutive month. Stubborn inflationary pressures have prompted the RBI to pause its rate-cutting cycle, although it has promised to keep an easy stance to help support growth and nurse the economy to a high growth trajectory. The minutes reveal that Das made a strong pitch for continuing monetary policy support, citing slack in the economy and inflation being driven by supply-side factors. “Continued policy support with a focus on revival and sustenance of growth is indeed the most desirable and judicious policy option at this moment,” said Das, making a case for maintaining status quo. “On the whole, the economy still requires support in terms of maintaining congenial financial conditions and fiscal boosters. At such a critical juncture, can we really pull the rug and let the economy tumble?” said Das. RBI ED Mridul Saggar estimated that the excise duty hike itself may have pushed headline inflation higher by 60-80 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point), adding to cost-push inflation. Saggar, who along with the others voted for status quo, highlighted the significance of narrative economics in difficult times in producing business cycle movements endogenously. The views of external members reveal that, while all are keen to support the economy, there is some divergence in respect of their view on inflation. External member Ashima Goyal said that if indirect taxes impart persistence to inflation, it could de-anchor inflation expectation and pose challenges to monetary policy. Pointing out that fuel prices do not fall with international prices, she said, “A persistent rise in Indian fuel prices is at odds with inflation targeting.” Varma, who argued for withdrawing the accommodative stance, said, “Persistent high inflation means that the monetary accommodation has to be somewhat restrained and, therefore, I argued for raising money market rates towards the repo rate of 4%.” Barclays economist Rahul Bajoria said that the minutes indicate a shift within the MPC’s narrative and, while the overarching view remains consistently to support the economic recovery, the comfort with inflation dynamics is certainly shifting within the MPC members. He added that there also appears to be a slight divergence visible on inflation persistence between the internal and external members. “But we reckon this gap is unlikely to be sustained, as more inflation prints come through,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/taxes-on-fuel-trigger-worry-at-rbi-policy-panels-meet/articleshow/85501697.cms||---

The ACB officials said that one Boddepalli Vykunta Rao, working in a private hospital in Vizag city, was accused in a case under Sections 498-A and 324 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. Vykunta Rao approached Srinivasa Rao for bail and for removing the names of his parents and sisters as accused in the case. The cop demanded Rs 10,000 as a bribe for carrying out the favour and later settled for a bribe of Rs 7,000. Unable to bear the harassment of the cop, Vykunta Rao lodged a complaint with ACB seeking action against him. After verifying the facts, the ACB laid a trap and caught the SI when he was accepting the bribe from Vykunta Rao at Arilova police station. The accused was produced before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/si-accepts-bribe-lands-in-acb-net/articleshow/85498474.cms||---
---||Business||Sensex slides on taper talks||TNN Mumbai: Heightened possibility of US central bank scaling down its ongoing $120 billion-per-month bond buying programme — popularly called tapering of quantitative easing (QE), or taper — pulled down the sensex by over 600 points in early trade on Friday. But it recovered some of the losses in late session to close 300 points, or 0.5%, lower at 55,329. On the NSE, at the end of a volatile session, the Nifty index closed 118 points, or 0.7%, down at 16,451. Late on Wednesday, the minutes from the US Fed’s policy meeting showed that several of its members were in favour of scaling down the magnitude of the bond-buying programme from its current level. As and when the Fed takes that route, it would become more difficult for global investors to have access to cheaper funds. This unnerved investors across the world and led to selling in several markets, including here. This also impacted investor sentiment on Dalal Street. In addition, rising Covid cases also led to selling, brokers and dealers said. According to Siddhartha Khemka, head, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, global markets continue to be under selling pressure as investors fret over signs of US Fed considering reducing stimulus this year while new lockdowns in countries facing surging cases of the Covid-19 Delta variant dampened the outlook. “Further, slowing Chinese growth and regulatory intervention along with the Afghanistan turmoil continue to spook the market,” Khemka said. Beyond the leading indices also substantial selling is taking place. At the close of Friday’s session, the BSE’s midcap index was down 1.9%, while the smallcap index closed 1.8% lower. As a result, on Friday, investors’ wealth, as measured by the BSE’s market capitalisation, fell by Rs 2.76 lakh crore to Rs 240.4 lakh crore, according to official data. The day’s session also witnessed the listing of CarTrade Tech and the weak market sentiment had its impact on this. The shares of tech-enabled automobile listing portal listed at Rs 1,600, compared to its IPO price of Rs 1,618 and closed the session at Rs 1,500, down 7% on the offer price. On Monday, Nuvoco Vista, the cement manufacturing arm of the Gujarat-based Nirma group is expected to list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-slides-on-taper-talks/articleshow/85501402.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Water row: Expect a stormy river board meet on August 27||AMARAVATI: The next board meeting of Krishna River Management Board (KRMB), which is scheduled to be held on August 27, is expected to be a stormy session as both AP and Telangana are believed to have sharpened their arsenal on various issues. Water sharing ratio will almost certainly dominate the session, as Telangana has renewed its demand for 50:50 quota. However, AP is in no mood to compromise on the issue, as it feels that such an argument is not only irrational but also impractical. AP has, in fact, asked KRMB to share Krishna waters on 70:30 basis between the two Telugu states rather than the previously agreed upon quota of 66:34. The issue is likely to further escalate tempers between the two states. AP is also insisting on deducting the entire water utilised by Telangana for power generation without taking permission from the KRMB and AP government, from the neighbouring state’s quota in Krishna waters. “Telangana has been creating unnecessary controversies with a political agenda. In fact, even the Centre turned a mute spectator when Telangana unilaterally withdrew water from Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala and did not pay heed to repeated advices from the Centre, KRMB, and the AP government,” said a senior official of AP irrigation department. Telangana, which had signed an agreement to have a working arrangement and share the water on 66:34 basis after the bifurcation, has now suddenly raked up the demand of sharing the water on 50:50 ratio. It also stirred another controversy by requesting KRMB to allow it to carry over the unutilised waters to the next water year. AP has argued that the unutilised or surplus water should be treated as common reserve and shared between the two states. Subsequently, KRMB referred the issue to the Central Water Commission (CWC), which observed that since the Krishna water dispute tribunal (KWDT-I) declared its award much before the bifurcation of the state, the issue needs to be resolved either with consensus or by referring it to KWDT-II. The board has also proposed to discuss the measures to be initiated on utilisation of surplus water during the monsoon season. With no consensus arrived on resolving the issue, the KRMB referred the issue to a high-level committee of the Jal Shakti ministry, which is yet to finalise its report as the required data has not been provided by the two states. The board may seek the nod of both AP and Telangana for the gazette notification issued by the Centre recently on the jurisdiction of KRMB. While Telangana has opposed the notification, AP is seeking some amendments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/water-row-expect-a-stormy-river-board-meet-on-aug-27/articleshow/85495981.cms||Samdani MN

Kallam, chairman of the state-level steering and implementation committee for the comprehensive survey, said that chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy is closely monitoring its progress. He said any delay in completing the mission would not be allowed. Speaking at a review meeting, Kallam said the high-level steering committee is ready to grant all permissions required to speed up the project implementation. “Senior officials should take the project implementation as a matter of prestige. AP is the first state in the country to take up the comprehensive land survey to settle all grievances of the public related to land,” said Kallam. He said they have also approved the requests for procurement of Bhu Raksha stones for use during the survey. Survey and settlement commissioner, Siddarth Jain, said they have readied the stage to invite tenders for procurement of additional material and machines for completion of the survey as per deadlines fixed by the chief minister. Jain said they would acquire drones for speeding up the project. “We have completed survey in Tadepalligudem urban area where the project was launched on pilot basis for urban areas,” he said. Kallam asked officials to switch to advanced technologies and software for making the programme transparent as well as fool-proof.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fast-track-land-survey-cms-advisor-urges-officials/articleshow/85498295.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Nitish Kumar takes along all sections of society: JD(U) Bihar chief||PATNA: JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha on Friday said CM Nitish Kumar always thinks of taking along all sections of the society to make a developed Bihar. As part of this thought, the JD(U) is welcoming the leaders from all sections of the society to its organization and giving them adequate honour and respectable positions in the party. Kushwaha was addressing a meeting of party workers soon after former state minister and BJP leader Sonadhari Singh and former HAM(S) leader Satya Narain Sharma joined the JD(U). Kushwaha provided them the JD(U) membership. State’s building construction minister Ashok Choudhary and transport minister Sheela Mandal were also present on the occasion. Sonadhari, who was the state’s forest and environment minister in the Lalu Prasad’s first ministry between 1990 and 1995, had also been the state executive member of the BJP. He came down heavily on the BJP soon after joining the JD(U). “BJP is a party of deceivers and fraudsters. I have seen everything -- right from top to bottom -- after remaining in the BJP for 8 years. Nothing has been left in the BJP, except poison. But I have no complaints with PM Narendra Modi, who is a good person. Other BJP leaders are not like him,” he said. Sharma, an extremely backward class (EBC) leader, was earlier with the HAM(S) led by Jitan Ram Manjhi. But he was expelled from the HAM(S) during the last assembly polls for indulging in anti-party activities. Welcoming Sonadhari and Sharma, Kushwaha said his party has made a vital strategy to strengthen the organization under the leadership of the party’s newly-appointed national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan. “Necessary steps are being taken within the organization to ensure that the JD(U) makes a better electoral performance in the 2024 general elections and 2025 assembly polls in Bihar,” Kushwaha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-takes-along-all-sections-of-society-jdu-bihar-chief/articleshow/85497599.cms||Madan Kumar

More than 250 delegates, including the party’s national office-bearers, MPs, MLAs, state presidents and other senior leaders from 23 states and union territories, would participate in the national council meeting, JD(U)’s national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan told TOI over phone on Friday. “A meeting of the party’s national office-bearers has also been convened on August 28,” Khan said. JD(U)’s all top leaders, including Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, national president Lalan Singh, Union steel minister & former JD(U) national president RCP Singh and party’s national parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha would be present at the meeting. “It would be for the first time that Lalan and RCP would sit together at a meeting after the recent bitterness among their supporters over the issue of their photographs missing from one another’s posters put up to welcome them,” a party leader said. The national council meeting is also significant because it is being held ahead of the assembly elections in Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand early next year. As the JD(U) has already made up its mind to contest Manipur and Uttar Pradesh assembly polls in a bid to achieve the status of a ‘national party’, the issues related to the state polls are likely to be discussed at the national council meeting, sources said. Lalan, while addressing a meeting at the party office here on August 6, said JD(U) has the status of the ‘state party’ in Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh, it needs to achieve the ‘state party’ status in two more states to become a ‘national party’. He also called for contesting the forthcoming assembly polls in UP and Manipur. Moreover, Lalan held a meeting with senior party leaders in Delhi on August 13 to discuss issues related to the north-east states, especially assembly polls in Manipur. At the meeting, it was also decided that Jhanjharpur MP Ramprit Mandal would visit Manipur in the first week of September to take stock of the political situation there. The meeting on north-east states was also attended by Khan, Mandal and party’s national treasurer and Gopalganj MP Alok Kumar Suman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-to-hold-national-council-meeting-in-patna-on-august-29/articleshow/85497527.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Three Bihar varsities still without regular VCs||PATNA: Even as chancellor has appointed four new vice-chancellors and four pro-vice chancellors in different universities in the state, three universities are still functioning without full-time regularly appointed VCs. Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) does not have a regular VC ever since Dr A K Agrawal vacated the office after completion of his three-year-tenure on September 20 last year. Its pro-VC S M Karim officiated as the VC till the middle of June this year. Since then, the university is being looked after by L N Mithila University VC Surendra Pratap Singh. The post of AKU VC was advertised by the chancellor’s secretariat well before Agrawal’s exit, but, owing to some technical reasons, the advertisement was cancelled. The post was re-advertised in January this year and the chancellor’s secretariat also received several applications from eligible candidates. But, even this re-advertisement was cancelled on July 10 this year probably due to the proposed amendments in the AKU Act. Similarly, the office of the VC of Patliputra University is also lying vacant since its founder VC Gulab Chand Ram Jayaswal resigned in January this year. LNMU vice-chancellor S P Singh has been officiating as its VC since then. The post had been advertised by the chancellor’s secretariat, but due to non-receipt of sufficient number of applications, the interaction of applicants with the search committee did not materialize. The office of the vice-chancellor of Bihar Agricultural University is also lying vacant for the last seven months after the exit of Ajoy Kumar Singh. Meanwhile, thanking the chancellor as well as the chief minister for giving preference to the sons of the soil in Thursday’s appointment of VCs and pro-VCs, the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar has requested the new incumbents to justify their selection by expediting the pending development activities in their respective universities. FUTAB working president K B Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh hoped that the regular VCs and pro-VCs would be able to resolve many of the academic and administrative problems being faced by the universities for some time. “Universities can’t prosper under ad-hoc arrangements,” they added. Meanwhile, K C Sinha took over as the new VC of Nalanda Open University on Friday. Addressing the officers and staff of the university, Sinha sought the cooperation of all the stakeholders in ensuring its all-round development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-bihar-varsities-still-without-regular-vcs/articleshow/85497267.cms||B K Mishra
---||Business||Draft rules for e-tail queer pitch for Tata, Adani’s super app plans||Reeba.Zachariah@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Indian conglomerates will find their e-commerce play significantly impacted, especially their development of apps, if the draft consumer rules that prevent “related parties” from selling on their marketplace-based online platforms are enacted. The proposals throw a spanner in the works of the Tata Group’s super app, an all-in-one mobile application, that is being tested on key stakeholders, including employees. Adani Enterprises is also gearing up to launch a super app. A super app can bring all products and services of a conglomerate onto a single platform — allowing users to order grocery & medicine delivery, book flights & hotel rooms, and access investment instruments — from one place. The Companies Act defines a related party as any body corporate which is a holding, subsidiary or associate of such a body and has a common chain of shareholders and directors. Under proposed rules, Tata Group entities such as Titan, Trent, Tata Motors and Taj cannot be a part of its super app. Ditto for Adani Group companies. Tatas have formally communicated concerns to the consumer ministry, while Reliance has conveyed that it is supportive of the draft rules. Last week, consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal had criticised the Tatas for objecting to the draft regulations and overlooking national interests involved in protecting brick-and-mortar businesses. The draft rules also impact relationships between app operators and related parties. Tata Group entities will not be able to sell products such as Tata Salt and Tata Sampann on their own e-commerce sites like Bigbasket. Likewise, Reliance will also not be able to host Hamleys on JioMart. Legal experts suggested that conglomerates could modify structures by creating two super/normal apps — they could sell their own inventory on one and list third party products on the other. The draft rules also restrict super/normal apps from having sellers that share brand names. This means Tata and Adani will not be able to launch namesake super apps. Historically, business houses have grown and built a large customer ecosystem by foraying into diverse sectors leveraging on their flagship brand names.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/draft-rules-for-e-tail-queer-pitch-for-tata-adanis-super-app-plans/articleshow/85501513.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The water level in the river, however, continued to show declining trend at all other places in the state. The Ganga water was seen accumulating in its eastern stretch in Bhagalpur and Katihar districts up to the Farakka barrage. The river was in menacing form along the 60km eastern stretch from Bhagalpur. The flood situation has not yet eased in Begusarai and Munger districts. At present, the areas worst affected are in Kahalgaon and Pirpainty blocks in southern Bhagalpur, Gopalpur, Rangda, Naugachhia, Kharik and Bihpur blocks in north Bhagalpur and Kursela, Barari and other areas in Katihar district. The three rivers which carry their water into the area are Kosi, Ganga and Mahananda, which are flowing above the danger level in this stretch. Due to the expected rain in the basins of the rivers in Bihar and also in Nepal till August 23, the flood situation might get exacerbated along the Ganga basin, again, it is feared. The water resources department (WRD) is also working on meeting the challenge during the third peak that might occur in the last week of August or early September. On Friday, the Ganga was flowing below the danger level only at Buxar and Digha, while the water level is expected to slide below the danger level at Gandhi Ghat on Saturday, as the fall is expected to be by 43cm. Otherwise, the river was flowing 90cm above the danger level at Hathidah and 84cm at Bhagalpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-1-43m-above-red-mark-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/85497783.cms||Abhay Singh

Water-borne diseases like typhoid, hepatitis A, dengue and diarrhoea have also kept doctors on their toes in the city. Health experts said such cases were on the rise primarily because of change in weather conditions. “Many people are getting rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests done only to find that they are Covid-19 negative and they come under the influence of seasonal flu,” they said. Dr Chandra Mohan Kumar, additional professor of paediatrics department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, said many patients are complaining of skin and fungal infections due to hot and humid weather conditions. “Cases of mosquito-borne diseases are on the rise especially in flood-affected areas. Every day, 3-4 dengue patients come to the hospital. Similarly, 4-5 hepatitis A and at least two typhoid cases are reported per day,” he said. Dr Kumar said common cold and influenza cases are also on the rise, leaving patients in a dilemma as Covid-19 has similar symptoms. “Viral fever and seasonal flu, however, subside in 4-5 days. But people are more concerned about Covid-19 and they rush to hospitals on experiencing even minor symptoms. During this time of the year, people need to maintain hygiene around home and source of drinking water,” Dr Kumar added. Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, former head of paediatrics department at Patna Medical College and Hospital, said most patients come with upper respiratory tract infection, skin infection and diarrhoea. “People should keep their rooms cool, wear cotton clothes and drink sufficient water to keep seasonal diseases at bay,” he said Dr Narain said children in the age group of 5 to 12 years and below two years mostly catch these diseases. “Children should be encouraged to take proper bath, especially when schools are open, as they are more prone to skin infections and boils.” Dr Binod Kumar Singh, superintendent of NMCH-Patna, said among the patients visiting OPD of the hospital these days, around 40% are the ones suffering from seasonal flu. “Cases of diarrhoea are also on the rise, especially among kids,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hospitals-see-spike-in-seasonal-flu-cases/articleshow/85497020.cms||Faryal Rumi

The night curfew was being imposed from 10 pm to 6 am as part of prolonged restrictions imposed during the second wave. The state government issued orders on Friday giving a one hour relaxation from the night curfew across the state. As per the new schedule, curfew would be imposed at 11 pm and relaxed at 6 am. Principal secretary, health, Anil Kumar Singhal, issued the orders and directed district collectors and the SPs to ensure that Covid-19 restrictions are strictly imposed. Shops and other establishments would be allowed to be kept open till 10 pm as the curfew would be clamped from 10 pm. The principal secretary said the relaxation is to enable people on the road to reach home. However, the guidelines issued for shops and establishments, business houses, hotels and restaurants would remain the same. Entry with face mask would continue to be compulsory in all shops and other establishments, Singhal said in the order. He further said that the government would take stern action against shops, malls and theatres if they were found allowing customers without a mask. Restrictions on marriages and other gatherings too would continue be the same where the organisers would have to strictly adhere to the protocol. The decision was taken as the number of positive cases are coming down slowly, in addition to the number of people getting vaccinated.

They are set to submit a mass memorandum with the police following the incident of an 18-year-old being chased and molested on a New Town road earlier this week. Cops are yet to arrest the accused of this case. A residents’ body in New Town has started collating the case studies and already given cops a list of the stretches where women have to face such incidents. They are also demanding more police patrol in these areas. “Two weeks back I was walking to my home from Akanksha crossing when a man on a bike stopped near me and groped me from behind. I raised an alarm but since the place was desolate, he sped away without being accosted by anyone,” said a New Town Action area II resident. She didn’t lodge a police complaint due to the lack of any proper evidence. A young girl, residing in Action Area I, shared an experience of being followed by a stranger in a car. “While cycling near Newtown school, a man who was driving a car followed me. When I stopped and waited for him to drive ahead, he again stopped and waited till I started cycling again. Later, on seeing the crowd near a market place, he fled,” she said Residents said that suspicious people move around in several lanes in New Town, which are dimly lit and where trucks remain parked through the day. “We have been regularly raising our voice on this issue. We hope that cops will take a serious action to make the roads safer for women,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of the NGO New Town Forum and News (NTFN). The New Town deputy commissioner Bishop Sarkar welcomed the move but said cops regularly undertake patrol duty on all the vulnerable stretches in the township.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-women-plan-mass-appeal-to-cops-turn-spotlight-on-desolate-roads/articleshow/85498640.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

No death has been reported due to Covid. State’s overall toll stands at 8,954. Core team of Covid care and management stated that no death has taken place in this month so far, which is a good sign as those infected also recovered. The state had witnessed a Covid death on July 30 and since then, no death has been reported. This has made many doctors and the core team of Covid care and management to believe that vaccines are working. “We have had patients who had either taken their first dose or both the doses. They were admitted with some symptoms but we did not witness mortality in this month so far, as majority of these patients had no major or severe symptoms,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital, who is also part of the core team. Singh stated that RUHS is now left with merely four to five patients and these are those who were admitted for past two months. “They are on the path to recovery. On day-to-day basis, we are getting patients without severe symptoms and this is of course due to the vaccination,” he added. Meanwhile, Sawai Madhopur on Friday reported four Covid cases, followed by Udaipur (4), Alwar (3) and one case each was reported from Bhilwara, Bikaner and Jaipur. In Jaipur, there have been less than 10 cases for past one month and no death has been reported. This scenario has also relaxed the health authorities, who are asked to judiciously use their leaves and some of them have started being relieved to their previous postings. The state is now left with 155 active cases and as many as 12 districts have zero active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vaccines-reduced-mortality-among-patients-say-doctors/articleshow/85501023.cms||---

Yet, some have to wait till the next day to get their first or second dose. On Friday, the state received 6,36,150 doses. Authorities of the health department stated that they are expecting a good supply in the remaining 10 days of the month. On Friday, 3,07,780 people received the jabs at various centres across the state. TOI visited various centres early morning, where people were seen queued up to get the vaccine shots since 5.30am. “My second dose is due since August 16. I came on Wednesday but could not get it. Hopefully, I will get it today,” said Raunak Singh(19) who is pursuing B.Tech and was seen in the queue at a vaccination centre at Kanata Chauraha of Jhotwara. Like Singh, there were several others in the queue since 5.30am, even as they would come to know about the availability of the vaccines around 10am. “ Ab lagwani to hai hi, isliye thoda time bhi lage to kya (We have to get the shot anyway, so if it takes time so be it),” said Sushant Roy, a 45-year-old man at a vaccination centre near Vaishali Nagar. Though the supply of vaccine has been regular in past one week, the number of those whose second dose is due is very high. “We had placed a requirement of nearly 80 lakh doses to the Centre for August. Hopefully we will get them,” said an officer with the health department. Meanwhile, on Friday 3,07,780 people got the jabs, out of which 2,22,120 got their first dose, while 85,660 got their second dose. “Till date, 94,56,739 beneficiaries in the state have received both the doses. We have received 6,36,150 doses of Covishield which are now in the process of distribution,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-queue-up-for-jabs-before-daybreak-in-city/articleshow/85501043.cms||---

However, all his fear faded with large scale awareness by the health department, social media and newspapers. He got his first dose in July and is now awaiting to get his second dose. Now, health department is distributing 65% of its vaccines to the rural belts and 45 % is in Urban areas. Like him several others in the rural areas of Rajasthan who were little apprehensive on taking the vaccine are seen queued up to get their jab. A vaccination centre at a villageHealth department on Friday stated that the vaccine hesitancy has now faded away from the rural areas and even from the tribal districts like Baran, Banswara and Dungarpur. According to an estimate by health department, in the month of July, 55 % of the vaccine distribution was at the rural areas while 45 % confined to urban area. “In this month so far we have distributed 65 % of the vaccines in the rural areas while 45% was given in the Urban areas,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination. “I think through media, social media, our awareness camps and the fear of third wave has attributed in fading away the vaccine hesitancy. All during the second wave many people lost their kin. Deadly second wave is also responsible for fading away the hesitancy,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination. Now, rural belts are vouching to get their lot of vaccines and follow up with the health department on the delivery of vaccines on daily basis. “Some people in my village told me that with the vaccine I would be impotent. However, gradually when people of my villages too started taking the jab from June and it was found that vaccine caused no harm I too took my first dose on July 18,” said Chotya Meena, a native of Dharbheeji village in Kota. Similarly, at the centres at Banswara, Dungarpur and Baran where locals used to confront the health authorities whenever the vaccination sites were made in their villages are now seen requesting them and motivating people to get the jab. In April and June, the vaccination was mainly at the urban areas while rural areas were showing their resistance and hesitancy. “They now vouch for their vaccine doses. We get calls from sarpanchs and others to timely allot their vaccine is actually a good sign,” Singh added. Authorities stated that health workers and Aasha Sehyogini workers too have worked hard in letting the fear fade away from the minds of people living in villages and hamlets. When contacted, Sidharth Mahajan, secretary, medical and health on the changed scenario, said, “No, they ask and complain when their vaccine lot gets over. Our men in these districts are continuously following up with people engaged in vaccine distribution to know when they will get the vaccine and they ask for the quantity specifically. So, as far as Rajasthan is concern the vaccine hesitancy no longer persists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-vax-hesitancy-fades-in-rural-tribal-belts/articleshow/85501056.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Allahabad||Those lauding Taliban are traitors of country: ABAP||Prayagraj: The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders of the country, has demanded strict action against the Muslim religious leaders supporting the Taliban and its takeover of Afghanistan. Seeking action, ABAP president Mahant Narendra Giri on Friday described the religious leaders supporting the Taliban as “traitors of the country”. Giri’s comments on Friday came days after Samajwadi Party MP Shafiqur Rehman Barq was booked for sedition following his recent remarks, allegedly defending the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan and equating it with India’s freedom struggle. He said that after registering a case of sedition against such religious leaders, they should be put behind bars. Giri also added that it is the government’s job to decide on affairs of another country and how to have relations with that particular nation and not the work of Muslim religious leaders. “Indian government is monitoring the situation in Afghanistan closely and is also doing what needs to be done,” he said. He also said that the Yogi government in the state had taken appropriate measures to not let terrorist organisations manipulate the people which would help in curbing “the spread of Talibani ideology”. He also supported the government’s recent decision of opening ATS training centres at 12 places in the state, and said that it will help in fighting and uprooting any kind of terrorist activities in the state. Responding to poet Munawwar Rana’s alleged support to the Taliban, Giri took on the poet for supporting the radical organisation. “It seems that he (Rana) has lost faith in the Indian Constitution and the people of India. I advised him to leave India and go to Taliban controlled Afghanistan as he supports the invaders of Afghanistan,” said Giri. On Thursday, the renowned poet also called the Taliban “rotten like right-wing groups”. Giri further said that looking at the history of injustice and atrocities committed on women in Afghanistan by the Taliban, Muslim women living in India should also oppose and boycott Muslim religious leaders who support the Taliban. He demanded the “toughest punishment for those who support the Taliban so that others can learn from it and avoid taking any such stance”. Giri also challenged the Muslim religious leaders who support the Taliban and dared them to “leave India for the Taliban-led Afghanistan”. Giri added that as far as bringing back the stranded Indians in Afghanistan is concerned, the Union government was taking steps in the right direction and claimed that a large number of people had been brought back to India already.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/those-lauding-taliban-are-traitors-of-country-abap/articleshow/85497453.cms||---

The festival is ushered in amidst much fanfare with people practising a variety of traditional rituals like decorating their courtyards with ‘Pookalam’, a rangoli made of flowers, preparing feasts known as ‘onasadya’ and staging performances like traditional dance and music called ‘onakalikal’. However, much like in 2020, this year the celebratory plans will remain subdued due to the Covid pandemic. People have opted to spend time with their families and close friends. Past president of Keralayee Samajam, Manoj PV, said a few families will be heading to a farmhouse to ring in the festival. “People will dress in traditional clothes and families will prepare onasadya together. Last year there were more restrictions and so we were not able to revel in all the festivities,” added Manoj. City president of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Pavithran Karat said, “Earlier, various organizations used to celebrate Onam with the entire community. Due to the lockdown, we will be observing the festive occasion at home with our family rather than participating in huge public functions. Relishing traditional Onam cuisine will be an important part of this auspicious day.” Ancie Wilfred, a homemaker, said, “Every year, the highlight of Onam has been the grand sadya at our family friend Kurup Uncle’s house. We are joined by two other families and we feast on the irresistible food which Kurup Uncle serves us with a lot of love. These things are now just another sweet memory to cherish since the lockdown has denied us the opportunity to indulge our hearts and tastebuds for two consecutive years.” Revealing her Onam plans, she said, “We will get select items from Kerala Store, put together a few Kerala dishes and have it with just our immediate family.” For principal of Essence International School Beena Menon, too, the celebrations will be low-key. “Since we are not in a position to go out and meet relatives, I will be spending time with my husband and mother-in-law watching Onam special programmes which are telecast on Malayalam TV channels. We will be designing the Pookalam at the entrance of our house and gifting new clothes to family members,” she said. Menon believes the festival need not be a grand celebration always. “The delicacies are an important aspect of the festival. We plan to prepare 4-5 key dishes with ‘payasam’ or kheer being the highlight. We try to get papadams and banana chips from the nearby Kerala Store,” she said. “Since my parents are with me this time around, I have decided to spend the day with them and organize the Onam feast,” said Rekha Nair, principal of School of Scholars, Atrey Layout. “Lockdown posed certain restrictions on going out and purchasing items required for the festival but thanks to e-commerce sites, hassle-free online shopping is taken care of,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-dampens-onam-celebrations-this-year-too/articleshow/85498822.cms||---

A communication to all airline and private operators by the authority stated that from Tuesday, the rapid RT-PCR test can be conducted at the departure airport within six hours of departure, to provide flexibility to airlines. The rule is applicable to passengers from India, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Uganda. The authority also further emphasised that the airline should ensure that the rapid RT-PCR report is based on molecular diagnostic testing intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid for SARS-Cov-2 viral RNA. This comes as a big relief for smaller airports, and even larger airports, where infrastructure is limited, or there would be chaos in case two to three international flights are scheduled to depart to the UAE or other destinations, that require such tests in a matter of hours. This would also help the airline staff to streamline the process of checking in and issuing boarding tickets to passengers who test negative in the rapid RT-PCR test. The earlier circular of the authority dated August 8 had stipulated rapid RT-PCR to be taken four hours before the departure of the flight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/uae-extends-rapid-rt-pcr-test-timeline-to-6-hours-instead-of-4/articleshow/85496395.cms||Stanley Pinto

Deputy CVO Ankur Chandra gave a brief introduction of both the players and narrated their struggles and journey till the Olympics. The GM also shared that the process of promotion of both the players in officer cadre had already started and announcement for the same would be done in due course of time. A short clipping of 2.5 minutes which had some memorable moments of the Indian team during hockey matches in the Olympics was played. It left everyone emotional and instilled a sense of patriotism. Gurjit and Nisha, while speaking on the occasion, said that they never expected such a warm reception and expressed their gratitude to all.

---||Delhi||BJP not paying for hoardings, corpns lose Rs 1,320cr: AAP||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday alleged that the municipal corporations of Delhi are losing out on revenue of at least Rs 1,320 crore due to hoardings and banners of the Bharatiya Janata Party being put up for free at paid spots. “Most of the hoardings we see in the capital, especially the ones put up on corporation sites, belong to BJP. Crores of rupees that can be earned from these hoardings are robbed off by the party. The BJP politicians don’t pay a single penny for these hoardings,” Bharadwaj alleged in a press conference. “We sent our team to do some preliminary findings on this matter. The surveyors found out that all the hoardings they saw were occupied by banners of BJP and its functionaries,” he said, showing some samples. “Not a single penny has been earned by the civic bodies because of it,” he alleged. He said that if these hoardings were paid for and put up following the due process, there must be bills and receipts, which he said the BJP functionaries must present to prove that they paid for the hoardings. The AAP member added that there are 1,100 km PWD roads in Delhi — 2,200 kms including both sides — where hoardings can be put up. “Taking a very conservative estimate of 5 hoardings per kilometre in Delhi at a minimal amount of Rs 1 lakh per hoarding, then a theft of Rs 2,640 crore has been committed. Even if we assume that the hoardings aren’t put up throughout the year even then the corporations could have earned Rs 1,320 crores had these hoardings were paid for,” he claimed. However, standing committee chairman for North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Jogi Ram Jain, said that advertisement clusters are outsourced to contractors and even now, only 8 out of 38 clusters have been taken up after open bidding. “The total revenue from this source in the last 7 month is Rs 7 crore,” Jain said. EDMC mayor Shayam Sunder Agarwal said that if Rs 2,640 crore loss is happening in the advertising department, Bharadwaj should come forward to take the contracts. “Do they pay anything for using the bus depots, schools for their advertisements? Delhi is full of illegal political hoardings from AAP politicians too,” he said, adding advertisement clusters and unipoles are sold through open tendering process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-not-paying-for-hoardings-corpns-lose-rs-1320cr-aap/articleshow/85498818.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||India||CAG flags Meerut babu's allotting self 30k-sq-ft bungalow||MEERUT: A former vice-chairman of the Meerut Development Authority (MDA), Rajesh Kumar Yadav, approved for himself a plush 30,000-square foot bungalow with a swimming pool, gym, sauna, and snooker and table tennis rooms when he was in office. He was entitled to a square footage of just below 2,500. Yadav is now special secretary (sports) in the UP government. The CAG flagged the "imprudent" plan in its audit report on the 'Economic Sector & Public Sector Undertakings, government of Uttar Pradesh' that was tabled in the assembly on Thursday. In two orders of 2009 and 2011, the UP government had decided on the 2,426-square foot cap for residences of officials in bracket to which the vice-chairman of MDA belongs, the report said. The approval for an official's residence comes from the MDA board, where the vice-chairman comes after divisional commissioner. In 2013 and 2014, Yadav was MDA secretary and in 2015 and 2016, the vice-chairman. Construction began in May 2015. It was a grand project - a 20,000-square foot house and a 9,700-square foot "recreation" area. The area was over 12 times what the vice-chairman was entitled to. More than Rs 8 crore was spent - the land had cost over Rs 5 crore and construction nearly Rs 3 crore - when the project was dropped in December 2016. visited the abandoned house on Friday. It was surrounded by overgrowth, its tall pillars visible from a distance. Yadav, for whom it was being built, never lived here. The MDA tried to auction off the property twice in 2019 but there were no takers. "It was imprudent and against established norms of propriety on the part of the authority to incur expenditure of Rs 8.3 crore... for a residence for the vice-chairman," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cag-flags-meerut-babus-allotting-self-30k-sq-ft-bungalow/articleshow/85504290.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Varanasi||Panel submits action plan to restore Varuna, Assi in Varanasi to NGT||VARANASI: A high-powered independent monitoring committee has submitted an action plan for the rejuvenation and restoration of Varuna and Assi rivers in Varanasi in compliance with a recent National Green Tribunal (NGT) order. The NGT’s principal bench comprising Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Justice Sudhir Agarwal, Justice M. Sathyanarayanan, Justice Brijesh Sethi and expert member Dr. Nagin Nanda had passed the order on June 17 and set up the committee to look into the issue of pollution in rivers Varuna and Assi in Varanasi by discharge of untreated sewage and unauthorized constructions. The issue was raised by a local advocate, Saurabh Tiwari. The committee included the officials from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and district magistrate of Varanasi. The committee was for the preparation of a report that may cover status on water quality of Assi, Varuna, action taken on diversion and treatment of sewage, water quality of upstream and downstream of confluence of Assi and Varuna to river Ganga, demarcation of flood plain zones of Assi, Varuna and Ganga, in accordance with the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016. Tiwari said that the committee submitted its report on Wednesday. The committee identified the issues and possible gap areas to be addressed in the modified action plan. According to the report, encroachment is a pertinent issue especially for river Assi due to unauthorized constructions and such constructions should be removed/demolished before laying interceptor sewers or putting any kind of interventions in effect. However, it was recommended that a survey could be conducted to understand the level of existing encroachments in the catchment of both the rivers. Problem of pollution in rivers Varuna and Assi seemingly pertains more due to sewage rather than industrial pollution. For understanding state-of-the art pollution situation of entire stretch of both the rivers, pollution mapping may be conducted to identify polluting sources such as small-scale industry cluster(s), additional drains as well as help to identify sites for non-conventional treatment (such as constructed wetlands, waste stabilization pond, bio and phytoremediation) that can substitute STPs. The present flow of river Assi is estimated to be about 100 MLD. The recently constructed STP at Ramanna has a 50 MLD treatment capacity that was based mostly on earlier flow measurements of the Assi river. In the present scenario, this treatment capacity is inadequate. Therefore, proper measures have to be undertaken to deal with the problem of under-treatment. The pollution of Varuna river water in this stretch is insignificant and doesn’t require any major intervention. The only problem apparent in this stretch is that a significant portion of the origin (a wetland) is under either cultivation/agriculture land, paddy land as well as fallow land that has changed not only the land-use but also the land cover of the area. This wetland also receives run-off from vast agricultural fields and is highly silted. This has resulted in a lack of flow of river from its origin. The committee recommended that the most suitable intervention is to acquire the cultivated land and convert it back into wetland as well as biodiversity park. Also, there are massive wetlands in the downstream (about 60 km from point of origin) and other wetlands located in the unpolluted stretches of the river, where desilting could be carried up to appropriate depth (original bed level). The desilted material can be used for making natural embankments without disrupting the natural drainage pattern stream. These wetlands receive water from catchments and feed to the river. It was identified that the Assi river once originated through an outlet at the south-east corner from Kardmeshwar Kund, near Kardmeshwar Mahadev temple. Continued illegal constructions along the river course and encroachment of the river path, obstructed the flow of the river. This blockage of the river path led to back flow of wastewater into the Kardmeshwar kund that caused pollution of the kund. Therefore, about 10-15 years ago, the locals with the help of administration sealed the outlet of the Kardmeshwar kund that led to change in the origin of river Assi and ultimately affected the flow and pollution status of the river. The river is trained by passing it through between RCC wall embankments in encroached areas. All along the path of the river, untreated wastewater joins the river indiscriminately increasing the pollution load of the river, however, it is difficult to find out the exact number of inlets that discharge raw sewage and or household wastewater. It is recommended that the first step, towards the rejuvenation of this stretch of Assi river, should be the removal of the encroachments (wherever required and possible) through coordinated action by state and district administrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/panel-submits-action-plan-to-restore-varuna-assi-in-varanasi-to-ngt/articleshow/85501128.cms||Binay Singh
---||Goa||Justice Gustavo Couto, first Goan HC judge, dies at 93||PANAJI: Justice Gustavo Couto, the first Goan judge of the Bombay high court, passed away on Friday at 93, after a brief illness. The departed legal luminary had a ringside view to some of the most important moments in Goa’s legal history — he was the Procurador da Republica (advocate general) till the Liberation of Goa in 1961, and also the last judicial commissioner of the state. Long respected for both his legal acumen and integrity, Couto began his career in 1954, in the Portuguese overseas judiciary, and served in various courts in Angola and Goa. He completed his legal studies in Lisbon. After Liberation, he served in the state judiciary in various capacities as a career judicial officer. In 1982, when the jurisdiction of the Bombay high court was extended to Goa, he served on the bench in Bombay and Goa — also as an administrative judge — till his retirement in 1990. “Justice Couto was a great judge and a strict disciplinarian, both in court and out of it, and blazed a trail for other Goan judges to follow,” said Justice N A Britto, who served as a junior judge under Couto before being elevated as a high court judge himself. Britto also recalled the “privilege” of appearing as a young prosecutor before Couto in the 70s. “Lawyers did not dare try and outsmart him, as his intellect was razor-sharp and he tolerated no dishonesty.” Couto is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/justice-couto-first-goan-hc-judge-dies-at-93/articleshow/85501154.cms||---

Domestic air traffic, which includes both arrivals and departures, are picking up at a faster pace since August, as compared to July and June. The gradual lifting of lockdowns by various states and starting of flights, has given a boost to air traffic, said a MIA spokesperson. MIA, the second busiest airport after Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru, in Karnataka, which was almost back with 80 % of its domestic passenger load after the first wave of the pandemic, saw the passenger load dipping in the beginning of April, due to the second wave of the pandemic. The latest data shows that 12,717 passengers departed from MIA between August 1 to August 15, as compared to 7,784 passengers from July 1- 15, a jump of 63%. In the same period of June, there were 4,989 departures. Similarly, 13,924 passengers arrived in the first fortnight of August, as compared to 8,495 passengers between July 1-15, again a rise of 64%. In the same period of June, there were 3,818 arrivals at the airport. The growth in both passenger numbers, as well as increase in flights is because of gradual opening of offices across India. The numbers are likely to increase further in coming days, especially once the festive season begins, according to the airport spokesperson. On more domestic flights being started, the spokesperson said that a private airline will soon start services to Hyderabad and Mumbai. There is also the possibility of another flight being started to Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mia-sees-rise-in-domestic-passenger-traffic/articleshow/85496461.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Varanasi||‘Managing nucleus of Ganga sand bed could control flood’||Varanasi: As Varanasi and other places in the Gangetic plain faced flood fury, eminent river engineer and former head of the department of civil engineering at IIT-BHU Prof. UK Choudhary has claimed that “floods can be controlled if the nucleus of the river sand bed is properly managed before the rainy season”. “The flood is not a natural calamity, but is like human’s vomiting phenomenon caused by growth of tumour in the stomach,” said Prof. Chaudhary, explaining further that this is the function of excessively enhanced drag forces of the convex-bank side floodplain of undilutedly rising sand-bed having the reverse slope as compared to that of the river bed. “The sand bed has a nucleus, which is the highest level of the bed responsible for damping out the turbulence in the most vigorous way causing heavy deposition of sand. This ensures conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy, the enhancement in flood height,” he added. According to him, in Varanasi, the nucleus of the sand bed in the Ganga lies in front of Ramghat/Panch Ganga Ghat. Its height and location changes every year. Usually, the maximum height remains between 7 to10 m above the maximum level of the bed in front of the Assi Ghat. This nucleus with its surroundings is causing the dissipation of kinetic energy of the stream and its conversion into the enhanced potential energy. The integration of this energy loss in the upstream region defines the flood in Varanasi, he explained. “The flood height in Varanasi can be well minimized if the nucleus of sand bed here is properly managed before the rainy season,” said Prof. Chaudhary, adding that the friction, form and pressure drag forces of the sand bed are the responsible factors for flood. “The control over the mechanics of sand bed formulation is not within the human endeavour as it is a function of sinuosity of the river and the strength of the secondary circulations. But minimization of drag forces is well within human control when the flood plain is in lean period,” he added. “As such, flood is not a natural calamity. The theory is known as flood plain management technology for flood control. This is similar to removing the tumour from the human stomach and to manage the digestive potential and to control the vomiting,” he said and added that the management of the nucleus of sedimentation is the technology for flood mitigation. “This is known as the outflow management for flood control,” said Prof. Choudhary, who is also the founder director of the Mahamana Malaviya Institute of Technology for Ganga Management (MMITGM) in Varanasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/managing-nucleus-of-ganga-sand-bed-could-control-flood/articleshow/85501150.cms||---
---||Allahabad||HC tells Auraiya judge to attach suit property||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Thursday directed the civil judge (senior division), Auraiya to undertake an inspection of the suit property and hold an inquiry as to whether any construction of police chawki has been raised or attempted in violation of this court’s order of temporary injunction dated March 14, 2019 passed in this appeal. It was further directed that the civil judge, Auraiya shall put the entire suit property under immediate attachment. Hearing a second appeal filed by one Satyawati Devi of Auraiya district, Justice JJ Munir directed the civil judge (senior division), Auraiya to obtain requisite photographs and also record necessary statements of persons well acquainted with the facts, alleged by the applicant relating to the raising of construction in violation of this court’s order. It is further directed that the civil judge, Auraiya shall put the entire suit property under immediate attachment and entrust the same to an officer of the civil court within 48 hours. All the machinery and tools on the spot shall also be attached within the same period of time after preparing an inventory thereof. The aforesaid orders shall be carried out by the civil judge (senior division), Auraiya in the presence of Auraiya district magistrate, superintendent of police, sub-divisional magistrate and the chief executive officer, Nagar Palika Parishad. The attachment will be carried out within 48 hours but in all events before 05:00 p.m. on August 22, 2021. The court directed to list this matter on August 25, 2021. During the court proceedings, appearing on behalf of the applicant, senior advocate Pradeep Kumar alleged that an order of temporary injunction passed by this court on March 14, 2019 is being brazenly flouted by the Nagar Palika Parishad, Auraiya under the directions, aid, assistance and active participation of Auriaya district magistrate and the superintendent of police. It is stated that the order of status quo to be maintained on the spot regarding the suit property has been violated with impunity, though it was served by speed post under covering memo dated July 19, 2021, dispatched on July 20, 2021 upon the Nagar Palika Parishad, Auraiya through its executive officer, and also upon Auraiya district magistrate and superintendent of police. He further contended that a copy of the order has also been served upon the pargana adhikari, Auraiya. It is submitted that a notification was issued on July 20, 2021 in a Hindi newspaper, advertising that on the suit property, a police chowki shall be constructed despite knowledge of the interim injunction order passed by this court dated March 14, 2019. It is stated that the injunction order has been violated by raising construction over the suit property, where JCB machines have been deployed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-tells-auraiya-judge-to-attach-suit-property/articleshow/85497502.cms||---

According to reports, Sangeeta alias Priyanka, a resident of Chhatral village of Kayamganj Kotwali area, was bitten by a snake in her house on Wednesday morning. According to police, when the woman got unconscious, her relatives took her to the Community Health Centre. The doctors after giving her first aid referred her to Lohia Hospital where she was declared brought dead but her relatives did not agree to accept that the woman was dead. Later, they took her to a tantrik in Aliganj town of Etah district where the tantrik after performing some rituals claimed that the dead woman would come back to life within 24 hours and asked the family members to take the dead body back home. When no miracle happened, the relatives took her to another tantrik in a village near Dhai Ghat in Shamshabad area. There too when the tantrik failed to infuse life in her, they then brought Sangeeta's body to her home, the police said. As the woman's maternal uncle hails from West Bengal and reportedly practiced sorcery, her relatives after consulting him on mobile phone performed another ritual by tying clothes around her dead body. When they failed again, they assumed Sangeeta to be dead, and informed the police to conduct a post-mortem examination of the woman in order to get compensation. Her last rites were performed nearly 32 hours after her death, the police further said. On coming to know about the rituals for treating cases of snakebite, a huge crowd thronged the victim’s house to take note of the things. According to the police the people of the village were superstitious as such incidents had been reported earlier also. “Instead of going to the doctor after a snake bite, the superstitious people risk their lives by getting trapped in the vicious circle of tantrik. In this particular case, we have tried to sensitize the family members of the victim," said inspector Kaimganj Sanjay Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/superstitious-villagers-get-woman-treated-by-occultists-who-died-of-snake-bite-in-farrukhabad/articleshow/85501271.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Akot Municipal Council CO shows door to amended Trees Act||NAGPUR: The Akot Municipal Council (AMC) may perhaps be the first civic body in the state to violate the amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975. The amended Act mandates declaring 50-year-old trees as ‘heritage’ trees to increase forest and tree cover. Besides, if any project involved a felling of 200 and more trees then such proposals are to be sent to the state-level committee. “Last week, the PWD (NH Division), Akola, felled 117 trees in 3km patch to widen NH-161-A between Akot-Akola. Most of these trees were over 60-years-old,” said complainant Sheikh Munna Sheikh, president, Sarpamitra Nisarga Savwardhan Bahuuddeshia Sanstha, Akola. “The trees that were felled and the standing ones were counted by me on Friday. Now, 67 huge trees remain to be felled. If trees on farm fences are considered, the number of trees that will need to be felled mounts to over 200,” said Sheikh. The large-scale tree felling violates the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975, which mandates the civic corporations and municipal councils to declare 50-year-old trees as heritage trees, and if at all these are felled, the project proponent will have to plant trees equal to the age of the felled ones. However, the chief officer (CO) of AMC, Shrikrishna Wahurwagh, said, “The permission to allow felling was granted on August 4, 2021, and the amended GR was issued on August 6. I was not aware of the new amendments. When I was told about it by some green activists, I immediately stopped the felling.” However, green crusader Munna Sheikh says, “It is simply shocking that a chief officer who heads the municipal council is unaware about the new rules. The amendment to Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975, was granted approval by the cabinet on July 6, and a gazette notification was issued on July 16. The GR issued on August 6, is just a formality.” “Under the Akot municipal limit, there were 77 tall trees on the left side of the road while 116 trees are on the right. These trees were indeed over 60-years-old. The PWD had sought permission to cut all the trees but after a joint survey, the number of trees to be felled was brought down to 153. We have asked the PWD to compensate by planting over 750 trees,” said Waghurwagh. Akola PWD executive engineer Raosaheb Zalte said, “The permission to fell the trees was first sought in 2018, but as the contractor was terminated for violations, renewed permission was granted recently after a new contractor was appointed. We felled only those trees that were coming in the way. In the last three years road work was stopped. We are going to plant double the number of trees where space is available.” A section of PWD officials admitted that contractors bagging road contracts are interested in civil works and are least interested in taking up plantations hence road and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has directed to the agencies while preparing estimates, 1% of the project cost should be spared for planting trees. But greens say this amount should be at least 3-4% for better results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/akot-mpl-council-co-shows-door-to-amended-trees-act/articleshow/85498879.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Teenage girl’s viscera not preserved as forensic dept found no signs of foul play||Panaji: Goa police are yet to find the missing pieces in the case of the 19-year-old girl whose body was found on the Calangute beach last week, but the option of relying on viscera findings has been ruled out as the teen’s viscera was not preserved for chemical analysis. Last week, North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena had said the police were open to further forensic investigations based on the girl’s preserved viscera if the family demanded for it. An official from the forensic department, however, said there wasn’t an iota of evidence to suggest that the teen had been murdered and/or sexually assaulted, due to which her viscera had not been preserved, but added that it would have been retained anyway had the police instructed the department to do so. “The police believed there was no foul play and that the manner of her death was suicidal. So where was the question of preserving the viscera?” he said. The forensic department, he said, would have nevertheless retained her viscera for further analysis had there been injuries on her body and even if the police had declared absence of foul play in preliminary findings. “However, there were no gross wounds on the body — except for a few superficial ones on her legs and forearms — to believe that somebody had killed her. The body was clean and when it was brought to the mortuary, a white froth from her nose and mouth was observed. This is a typical sign of drowning. Sand particles were also found in her trachea,” he said. The postmortem report cited the cause of death as asphyxia due to drowning even as the girl’s father had alleged a foul play a day after his daughter’s last rites had been performed and urged that she be given justice. The police are yet to throw light on the girl’s movements after she was seen by a witness at the Mapusa bus terminus on the day she went missing. So far, the police have not succeeded either in tracing her clothes or finding any evidence to show where she travelled from the Mapusa bus terminus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teenage-girls-viscera-not-preserved-as-forensic-dept-found-no-signs-of-foul-play/articleshow/85501366.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Kanpur||Anti-dacoity court set to hear final arguments in Behmai case on Aug 24||Kanpur: The famous Behmai massacre trial has once again hogged the limelight after the anti-dacoity court of Kanpur Dehat on Thursday fixed August 24 for hearing the final arguments. The case had been fixed for judgement by judicial official Sudheer Kumar two times in the year 2019, but due to some technical issues raised by the defence counsels, the final verdict was postponed. Thereafter, due to Covid-19 pandemic, hearing could not take place and only general dates were being fixed in the trial. District government counsel (criminal) Rajiv Porwal, talking to TOI on Friday stated that the last date in the trial was August 19, 2021 and the defence counsel had put up a demand that copies of the case be provided to him. Porwal strongly opposed the move and said that the police had filed a chargesheet in this case on May 22, 1981 and thereafter as per procedure of CrPC, copies were provided to the accused. He further argued that the prosecution had commenced the trial in 2012 and had produced as many as 15 witnesses in this case. All were cross-examined by the defence counsel. Later, they argued before the predecessor judicial official of this court in the argument stage. Therefore, demand for copies was infructuous and it was a delaying tactic. Special judge Sudhakar Rai thereafter rejected the submission of the defence and fixed the date for final argument. The district government counsel (DGC) said that the case had reached the stage of judgement in 2019, but the CrPC states that a judge should deliver the judgement within 14 days after hearing the final arguments. Also, the second aspect was that the judicial official had been changed. Therefore, the case was once again fixed for final argument. When the DGC was asked that last time when the case was fixed for judgement the defence had raised the issue of case diary and had claimed that it had been lost and hence the judgment could not be delivered, he replied that he had pointed out that the case file had been sent to the Supreme Court and as per practice, a photocopy of the file including case diary was made and kept secured. “However, the original case diary is missing but is not lost. I had moved an application in this regard and the court had ordered the reader to investigate the matter and he had reported that a copy of the case diary was in the court file,” he added. The IG police too had made an inquiry in this matter and it was found that the case diary was filed in the court and thereafter it was misplaced, perhaps in transaction to the high court or Apex Court, Porwal said. “I am ready for final arguments and try my best to get a verdict in this 40-year-old case,” he added. Bandit queen Phoolan Devi along with more than a dozen dacoits had raided the Behmai village on February 14, 1981, and gunned down 20 men of the village to take revenge for her humiliation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/anti-dacoity-court-set-to-hear-final-arguments-in-behmai-case-on-aug-24/articleshow/85501207.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Water dept’s 2021 report advises against free supply||PANAJI: Over twenty years after Goa got its first water policy, a team under the water resources department (WRD) has drafted a revised 2021 policy document to ensure future water security for the state. The contents of the policy may, however, come as a surprise to the state government. While chief minister Pramod Sawant recently promised 16,000 litres of free drinking water supply per month to each household, the new policy advises against providing water free of cost, calling it a resource that belongs to the community. It states that charging for water ensures its economic use as it is a resource that is linked to the state’s future growth. “Water is a common property of the people and therefore, every user should pay for the water she/he uses, even if the user is procuring the water at her/his own cost. The state has to make considerable investment in infrastructure required to extract the water from its natural source, process it, and bring it to the user. And at least part of this expenditure should be recovered from the users,” the state water policy reads. The document goes a step further and recommends charging consumers based on use of the volume of water in a bid to ensure its judicious use. “Pricing of water is an instrument to bring economy to its use. A structured system of water charges on volumetric basis shall be introduced. All water charges, whether surface water or groundwater, shall be rationalised and updated periodically.” Better planning of the resource of water is important as it is among the resources that will determine the state’s growth and development, according to the policy. “Human requirements are not to be limited to mere subsistence. The people of Goa are proud that the state ranks number 1 in per capita GDP, and the water policy has to support maintaining this position, even improving on it,” the draft reads. Goa adopted its first water policy in 2002, but implementation of its recommendations did not take off as expected. The new document states at the outset that it has been drafted to be “more realistic and achievable”, unlike the usual “wishful” policy documents. The 2021 recommendations also state that the rivers of Goa, including the Mhadei, need new master plans as the existing ones are over two decades old. “Master plans have been prepared for the Mhadei, Zuari, Galgibaga and Talpona basins. These master plans are now more than 20 years old and will have to be revisited and updated, and demand for water for all human uses will have to be reassessed for all of Goa.” A scientific assessment of the quantity of water required for human uses and environmental needs will have to be carried out on a high priority basis, the policy states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/water-depts-2021-report-advises-against-free-supply/articleshow/85501223.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Delhi||Sealed zones in Delhi: From 57,800 in May to 234||NEW DELHI: With Delhi witnessing a sharp dip in new Covid-19 cases and positivity rate, the number of containment zones has also dropped below the 250 mark. Exactly three months ago, the number of red zones stood at a staggering 57,800. Currently, three out of the 11 revenue districts have zero containment zones. An exponential growth of Covid-19 cases was witnessed during the second wave that swept the city in April and May. The number of containment zones skyrocketed and reached a peak of 57,800 on May 18. The numbers came down drastically to 500 in mid-July and decreased to 234 on Thursday. Out of these, 76 were in the process of being scaled down and the rest were active. Exactly a month ago, when the number of containment zones was below 500, New Delhi district had the highest number at 176. On Thursday, the district still had the highest number of containment zones at 115. The number of active zones was 73. The most active containment zones were in Nanakpura and Moti Bagh. Satya Niketan, Shanti Niketan and Anand Niketan had four active containment zones each. South Delhi’s Vasant Kunj and Hauz Khas also had four active red zones each. Gole Market in New Delhi district had the second highest number of active containment zones at 9, followed by Ashok Vihar (7) and Nihal Vihar (5) in north and northwest districts, respectively. South (35), West (22), North (18), North West (18) and Shahdara (16) were other districts with the number of containment zones in double digits, while South East, North East and Central districts — one of the most densely populated areas — had zero containment zones. The decline in the number of containment zones and active cases has led to higher contact tracing and surveillance. “The number of containment zones is very low now and a very close watch is being kept not only inside the zones, but also in areas around them. Regular and intensive testing is being carried out in these areas ,” said an official. “In April and May, our manpower was stretched thin due to the very high number of Covid-19 cases. However, since the number of cases being reported started dipping, it became possible to trace more contacts of those testing positive for the viral illness,” a district official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sealed-zones-from-57-8k-in-may-to-234/articleshow/85498918.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Police have arrested the minor rape survivor's father and his friend Dinesh for the murder of Vijay Mer, a resident of Kanak Nagar in Rajkot. Police said that Mer was out on bail. Mer's brother, Ashwin Mer (35) lodged the murder complaint against rape survivor's father (42) and his aide Dinesh Rangpara (30). According to the police complaint, Mer had eloped with the minor daughter of the accused in October 2020. The girl's father had then filed a missing complaint against Mer under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and under The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Later, the girl's father filed a habeas corpus petition in the Gujarat high court, following which the police traced the minor and Mer who were living in Manavadar town of Juangadh and brought them back in March 2021. Mer was arrested and was also booked for raping the minor. He had been in jail since then. Police said that Mer was released on bail a few weeks ago. "Ever since he was released on bail, he would call up the girl's father and threaten to elope with his daughter again. The girl's father had vowed not cut his hair till he killed Mer. So, he took the help of his friend Dinesh and attacked Mer on Thursday night near his house with sharp-edged weapons," said police. CCTV camera footage showed that Mer was attacked by the accused when he was sitting with someone near his house. The accused hacked Mer to death. Police said that they found more than a dozen wounds on Mer's body. Both the accused are in police custody and are being interrogated.

The boys, sons of a fisherman, who suffer from muscular dystrophy, now have a house with facilities addressing their disabilities, thanks to the efforts of a government recognized non-governmental organization (NGO) and good Samaritans. Their house at Kannamaly was destroyed during the cyclone Tauktae in May. When Tauktae moved along the coast, the seawall collapsed and the backside of their house, including the kitchen and bathrooms, were destroyed. When volunteers and officials came to shift the family to a safe place, they realized that the children needed special attention and could not be kept in a rescue camp. The difficulty in managing their children made the parents Joseph Siju and Soniya introvert and reluctant to mingle with neighbours. “Though we had asked them to move to a relative’s place, it was not a comfortable decision for the parents as well as the boys who need full support to get things done,” said Mary Anitha, chairperson of the NGO centre for empowerment and enrichment (CEFEE), which works for disabled people. “We went to clean the house but there was no way the children could stay there in that condition. Our NGO had decided to help rebuild the damaged portions as well as repair the house. While doing it, we incorporated changes in the bathrooms and made it disabled-friendly. The situation was so bad that they had no interactions with the neighbours and they had no livelihood too,” she said. Anitha had decided to use all the award money she had received from the state government and other organizations for her services during the pandemic. She had received an award for voluntarily opting to go on a month-long quarantine, away from her own family, to take care of a small infant, Unni, whose parents had tested positive and were admitted to GMC Kalamassery. No relatives were ready to look after the boy and Anitha volunteered after the district administration and child welfare committee sent out an SOS seeking support from good Samaritans. With support from their chief patron M G Rajamanickam IAS and his close friends, CEFEE made the house colourful and happy for the kids. Anitha said that they used the housewarming function as an event to connect the family with their neighbours. All the guests who came were given Onam kits and children were given toys of their choice. “As Soniya bakes well, we helped her to connect with some professional bakers,” she added. “Though I am a fisherman, I had to stop going in boats as my wife cannot manage the kids alone. I used to go for small masonry works, but that too stopped due to Covid. We were depressed by the entire turn of events and suddenly God sent someone to help us,” said Siju.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/for-this-family-at-kannamaly-this-years-onam-is-special/articleshow/85496556.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Goa||Calangute teen death: No foul play, say cops||PANAJI: A week after the body of a 19-year-old woman was found washed ashore on Calangute beach, the police, on reaching the final stage of the investigation, have said they have not found “any evidence to indicate foul play”. A senior officer said that they have investigated all angles brought to their notice by the deceased woman’s family. “After investigating (all) the angles, we have found no evidence to indicate foul play in the case,” he said, adding that they are now probing other angles. Goa police have urged people to come forward if they have any “fact-based lead” in the case. “We will continue the investigation to ensure that the family is satisfied that there is no foul play,” the senior officer said. The woman’s family and neighbours suspect foul play in her death. He also said that they are open to investigate any new leads that come up, and added that police have conducted an investigation along the bus route along with the conductor, but not a single person has given a clue. He said that the conductor told them that since passengers now wear masks, it’s difficult to say if the woman travelled in their bus. The police have also examined CCTV footage from Nerul to Baga, including on the beach, for clues. The family and neighbours of the teen have been demanding justice in the case. Her body was discovered on the morning of August 13 on a busy stretch of Calangute beach in a semi-nude condition, with her clothing nowhere in sight. The police have also been trying to locate her clothes. Police had launched an investigation into various angles, including murder, suicide and accidental death, following public uproar. The sister of the deceased recently submitted details of call records and messages to the police for investigation. Based on these, police summoned several people to the Calangute police station for inquiry. A senior officer had said that even after questioning the people who had contacted the girl before her death through calls or messages, they have not been able to draw any inferences. Police had also examined the CCTV footage of beach shacks located near the area where the teen’s body was found but, had not found anything useful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-teen-death-no-foul-play-say-cops/articleshow/85501258.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Nagpur||‘Sena purifying Thackeray memorial after Rane visit shows Taliban mindset’||Nagpur: Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said some Shiv Sainiks’ move to ‘purify’ Balasaheb Thackeray’s memorial in Mumbai after Union minister Narayan Rane’s visit on Thursday reeked of ‘Talibani’ mindset. Rane started his much publicized Jan Aashirwaad yatra by visiting Thackeray’s memorial and praising him during media interaction which followed afterwards. Not willing to let Rane score political brownie points, some Shiv Sainiks went on to clean the memorial and termed it as ‘purification’. Fadnavis said, “The Sena members who did this have not understood Balasaheb’s Shiv Sena. Frankly, to me it seems such a narrow-minded approach and Taliban-like thinking.” He said this entire issue seems even more strange when looked into with context of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “Shiv Sena is somehow okay with sitting together with people who tried to put Balasaheb in jail. But at the same time if someone visits the memorial with genuine faith to pay homage, then Sena claims that the place has become impure. I feel this entire episode is unacceptable,” said Fadnavis. It was under Chhagan Bhujbal’s tenure as state home minister that Thackeray faced arrest, but was granted reprieve from the court. Commenting further on the Sena’s ‘purification’ move, Fadnavis said, “Such kind of behaviour is regrettable and does not suit the (political) culture we have in Maharashtra.” Rane’s campaign to seek the public’s ‘blessing’ started off with much pomp from Thackeray’s memorial. On Thursday, Rane said, “I visited the memorial and remembered (Thackeray) saheb. I wish he would have been here, as saheb would have definitely blessed me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sena-purifying-thackeray-memorial-after-rane-visit-shows-taliban-mindset/articleshow/85498928.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Hyderabad||Karvy Stock Broking Limited scam: Two years on, investors yet to see their money||HYDERABAD: Two years after the Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL) scam came to light, hundreds of investors are still waiting to get their hard-earned money back. What’s distressing is that these investors have been relentlessly lodging complaints with market regulator Sebi, NSE as well as the company but all their pleas have been falling on deaf ears. In November 2020, NSE had said that funds and securities worth Rs 2,300 crore belonging to over 2.4 lakh KSBL investors with fund balance up to Rs 30,000 were settled. Mumbai-based retired professional V Lamba, 62, is in dire straits as his entire retirement fund of nearly Rs 95 lakh is stuck with Karvy. “Karvy is a big name and its clients include large corporates. There is no way an investor like me would have doubted its credentials. Today, I have no other source of income and have been going through a harrowing experience because of Karvy and I do not know how to get my money back…,” he said. Most of the investors pointed to the repeated breach of deadlines by Karvy in settlement of accounts. Karvy has been repeatedly assuring investors that it is in the process of raising funds and once it gets money, it will be able to settle accounts, but nothing has materialised yet. Bengaluru-based Sivaraman Hariharan, 52, who has suffered losses to the tune of around Rs 1 lakh said, “I have sent over 30 complaints to Sebi, NSE as well as Karvy, but I am yet to receive any concrete answers from them. Even my cousin has been hit by this scam as his shares worth around Rs 1.5 lakh have been stuck in Karvy’s pool account,” he said. Hariharan also said that the arrest of KSBL chairman C Parthasarathy does not mean much to a small investor like him because earlier also corporate honchos were sent behind bars but they managed to come out and start their lives all over again. Kakinada-based investor Dr BK Santosh, 39, too said that post the Karvy scam, he does not wish to continue with any trading activities and now would only depend on his income from the medical profession. Mohit Todi from Dibrugarh Assam, said three members from his family had accounts with Karvy and last year, one of them, Laduram Agarwalla, his grandfather died, making matters more complex for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-yrs-on-investors-yet-to-see-their-money/articleshow/85501295.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Goa||Goa: Expect mining jobs in next 3 months, says CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Stating that his government was committed to resuming the mining industry in the state, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday that the passage of the Goa Mineral Development Corporation Bill, 2021, in the recently-concluded session of the state legislative assembly was a step towards that direction. He assured the gathering of largely mining-dependent people that they can hope to get occupation in the mining industry within the next three months. “Some say that the passage of the Mining Corporation Bill is just lip service by the government. But the government’s efforts are sincere. As I also come from the mining belt, I can well understand the pain of the mining-dependents. My government is committed to ensuring that everybody who lost their livelihoods after the closure of the mines finds gainful employment soon in the industry,” he said, speaking at a public meeting at Dharbandora during his tour of Sanvordem constituency. He said that while auctioning of mining leases and transportation of the already-extracted 20 million tonnes of ore will happen within the next three months, a “permanent solution” for mining will be worked out through the Goa Mining Corporation once it is formed. The Bill passed in the assembly will facilitate the formation of a state-run corporation “to carry out mining operations in an orderly, scientific and ecologically-sustainable manner,” he said. The Bill is awaiting the governor’s assent. The Supreme Court, last month, dismissed a petition filed by the state government seeking review of its February 2018 order that cancelled the operation of 88 mining leases of the state on the grounds that there were irregularities in their renewal process. The apex court did not consider a similar petition of a mining company as well. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018, following the apex court’s judgement quashing the second renewal of 88 mining leases. The state government, through the proposed state-run mining corporation, is considering opening new iron ore mines, other than the 88 leases which are a subject of litigation before the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expect-mining-jobs-in-next-3-mths-cm/articleshow/85501290.cms||---
---||Pune||Citizens move HC to scrap transfer of amenity spaces||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation’s proposal to transfer amenity spaces for development has run into stiff opposition from NGOs and residents’ associations across Pune who want it scrapped and have approached the Bombay high court. The petitioners have objected to the PMC’s move saying that “the quality of life in Pune will permanently deteriorate if the PMC is allowed to proceed in its move.” The civic standing committee had approved the leasing of the amenity spaces. These portions of land will be handed over to private parties who will develop them using the public-private partnership model. As many as 270 public amenities will be developed under this policy. The petitioners include Kharadi Residents’ Association, Baner-Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust, Pune District Co-operative Housing Societies’ Federation Ltd, National Society for Clean Cities- Pune, Pashan Area Sabha, Bavdhan Citizens Forum, Aundh Vikas Mandal and Association of Nagar Road Citizens’ Forum. “Amenity spaces are the last remaining public spaces in the city and are deemed reservations which cannot be tinkered with, and this has been ruled by a landmark SC judgment,” the press statement said. The petition said the reasons PMC has cited for transferring the land portions are incorrect. “The civic body has cited the pandemic, encroachments and lack of funds in its coffers. But, on August 13, 2021, corporators demanded funds after PMC’s income increased. These are only false excuses to hand over prime real estate to private entities,” the statement said. The petitioners have sought an urgent hearing in this matter. “The PMC’s proposal lacks details and clarity about how it is going to develop the amenities. We have opposed this proposal and want it scrapped,” Satya Mulye, advocate for the petitioners, told TOI. The BJP, which has a majority in the civic body, has been supporting the leasing of amenity spaces saying that long pending development of these facilities will gather pace via the public-pprivate partnership model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-move-hc-to-scrap-transfer-of-amenity-spaces/articleshow/85498999.cms||---
---||Delhi||City court convicts man of attempt to murder||New Delhi: A Delhi court has convicted a man in an attempt-to-murder case, saying the motive was not always so relevant in criminal jurisprudence, when there was a clear and cogent eyewitness account corroborated by medical evidence. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav convicted Wasim under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Wasim’s target was identified as Asif. “The fact that gunshot injury caused to Asif by accused Wasim has been sufficiently proven. The weapon of offence was indeed a firearm. The circumstances of the case clearly indicate that there was an intention to murder,” the judge said in his order. “I am of the considered opinion that the prosecution has been successful in bringing home the guilt of accused Wasim beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. Accordingly, he is convicted for offence punishable under Section 307 IPC,” the judgement added. With regard to the accused’s contention that the motive as per the prosecution was weak, the court said that motive was not always so relevant in criminal jurisprudence. “When there is clear and cogent eyewitness account corroborated by medical evidence, then motive becomes secondary,” it said. Regarding non-joining of public witnesses in the matter, it further said that it was a matter of common knowledge that local persons are not interested in becoming witnesses in criminal cases when they have no concern or interest in the outcome of the matter, and in the current days of deteriorating law and order situation, strict compliance of such rules demands a rational approach. As per the statement of victim Asif, in 2015, he was taking a walk along with Wasim when they noticed two minor boys sitting near an electric pole and watching a video-clip on the phone. Asif alleged that Wasim had given beatings to the boys and in the process one of the boys slapped him. The boys left when Asif intervened. He further alleged that on the same day Wasim asked him to meet him. The accused then told him to call the boys to apologise to him, to which Asif had tried to calm him down. Asif further said the accused took out a country-made pistol and fired a shot at him and fled from the spot. The accused had claimed he was falsely implicated in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-court-convicts-man-of-attempt-to-murder/articleshow/85498987.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Our country is capable of facing any situation", he said. The deputy CM was talking to the media in Hamirpur where he had gone to inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of projects and schemes worth Rs 684 crore. When asked to comment on the statements given by some leaders in support of Taliban, Maurya said, “Such leaders are anti-India. Those who like Taliban rule should immediately leave India and go to Afghanistan," he further said. Earlier, while addressing a gathering at Police Parade ground at the district headquarters, he said that with the BJP's basic mantra of 'sabka saath and sabka vikas', this time people would not even let the accounts of opposition parties open in the forthcoming assembly elections. “Kalyug was prevailing during the regimes of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati. Due to collusion between contractors and political leaders the state’s development work was only on papers, but in the double engine government, work is being done on the ground on the mantra of `sabka saath and sabka vikas' (Collective effort and inclusive growth)", the deputy CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/centre-closely-watching-situation-in-afghanistan-deputy-cm/articleshow/85501289.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Six financial firms order audit on Karvy Stock Broking Ltd dealings||HYDERABAD: Six financial firms, including three banks, which lent Rs 780 crore in loan to Karvy Stock Broking Ltd (KSBL), have engaged a firm to ascertain how the money was diverted, even as police said they will seek custodial interrogation of KSBL chairman and managing director C Parthasarathy. Probing the bank default case, the Hyderabad police said on Friday they are also waiting for the audit report, before taking further action. While three banks came forward to lodge a police complaint, three more financial companies have also lost their money by issuing loans to KSBL, who in turn allegedly pledged its client shares as security deposit for the loan. “In 2019, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) got a forensic audit done on KSBL to know how the company diverted the clients’ shares in violation of SEBI rules. Now, the six banks which lent loans to KSBL, is conducting forensic audit to know, how the loan amount was diverted by its management,” a senior official in Hyderabad police told TOI. KSBL chairman and managing director C Parthasarathy and other accused, have allegedly diverted the money into the accounts of their subsidiary firms and related accounts. The investigation agency has asked the Income Tax department to furnish the PAN details and tax returns of KSBL directors, who have defaulted. Police suspect that the loan amount, which was allegedly diverted were again put to trading through different firms. “To ascertain the facts, the audit report is going to throw light about the diversion,” another official said. CCS officials are also receiving fresh complaints that KSBL authorities allegedly misappropriated the money in trading accounts of some clients, who requested for sale or purchase of shares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/6-financial-firms-order-audit-on-karvy-dealings/articleshow/85501339.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Mangaluru||Rise in seal level to impact Mumbai faster than Mangaluru||MANGALURU: Though the impact of a rise in sea level will be felt across the globe, the coastal city of Mangaluru seems to be better off than Mumbai and Kerala on the west coast of India. The effect will be more pronounced and faster on the northern part of the west coast, which includes Mumbai, than the southern parts, which includes Mangaluru. This is according to a research paper published by the department of marine geology, Mangalore University, three decades back. It predicts the northern part of the west coast is characterised by extensive tidal flats and mud-flat deposits that indicate submergence, whereas tide gauge data corroborate the land being higher around Mangaluru, relative to Mumbai and Kochi. Though the research by B R. Manjunatha and R Shankar of the department of marine geology was on ‘Factors controlling the sedimentation rate along the western continental shelf of India,’ it offers a corollary on the impact of rise in sea level. R Shankar, member, International Union of Geological Sciences’ Commission on Geosciences Education, Training and Technology Transfer (IUGS-COGE), told TOI the rising of land due to sedimentation may delay the inevitable here. The paper notes suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in the river’s southern area are significantly lower than those for the northern area. For example, the SPMs in the Nethravati and Gurpur rivers are 53.9 and 52.3mg/I, respectively, are about two orders of magnitude lower than those in the Narmada and Tapti rivers. “Global warming due to harmful emissions not only melts ice caps, but also expands sea water, contributing to temperature increase and rise in sea level. In this part of the west coast, the sediment deposition is low along the Mangaluru coast at 0.7 mm/year, as against 2.6 mm/ year off Karwar and 2.5 mm/year off Mumbai. Over time, continuing sedimentation in the water and the additional weight causes subsidence or sinking,’’ said Shankar. “We have done the damage and results are seen.’’ He advocated four R’s, refuse, reduce, reuse and recycle, applied to five types of resources, water, fuel, food, power and metals to be judiciously followed, to delay the inevitable. However, the effect of sea rise due to increasing temperatures will have a far-reaching effect on the livelihood of fisherfolk and marine resources. The policy brief by E Vivekanandan of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on ‘Climate Change and Indian Marine Fisheries,’ published a decade back, notes that depending on the marine species, the area it occupies may expand, shrink or be relocated. “This will induce increases, decreases and shifts in the distribution of marine fish, with some areas benefiting while others will lose out,’’ indicating climate change and sea level rise will have a profound impact on the fishing community and its resources, apart from its impact on mangroves and creating an environment, particularly suited to harmful algal blooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rise-in-seal-level-to-impact-mumbai-faster-than-mluru/articleshow/85496627.cms||Stanley Pinto
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Congress will go solo in civic polls, says Nana Patole||PUNE: Reiterating that the Congress would go solo in the upcoming civic polls, Nana Patole, the party state unit chief, said a decision on the panel system would be taken by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi. “The policy about civic elections is final. We will fight it on our own. The details will be finalised in the days to come,” he said while speaking at a press conference to mark the birth anniversary of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi on Friday. Patole blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party for the “mismanagement” of the government. He also said that the Jan Ashirwad Yatra was an irony. “The inflation has gone up. Petrol prices have crossed Rs100. Amid such a scenario, why are the BJP leaders going on this rally? I guess they want to take the blessings of the people to push up the price of petrol to Rs200,” Patole said. The BJP has become an epitome of corruption from the local level to Delhi, he said. “The BJP was talking of doing away with corruption. The black money has increased by 300 times since 2014,” he said. He also said that the policy of leasing out amenity spaces was wrong. The PMC should scrap it. Patole blamed the “wrong policies” of the Union government for deaths caused by Covid-19 across the country. Regarding the change in the name of the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, he said even though the name of the late prime minister has been removed from the medal, he still lives in the hearts of youngsters and people. Patole said that the interference of the central investigating agencies was causing delay in key investigations in Maharashtra, including Narendra Dabholkar’s murder. “A lot of time has passed, but the killers are still at large. It is wrong to state that the killers have not been found. It is an open secret that the Union government’s investigation agencies are interfering in the matter,” the Congress state unit prsident added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/congress-will-go-solo-in-civic-polls-patole/articleshow/85499011.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Opposition protests lack of funds for devlopment works||NAGPUR: With an eye on next year’s civic polls, opposition parties have started campaigns to highlight various issues against the BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Three opposition-led demonstrations were held at the NMC’s headquarters in Civil Lines on Friday. Congress corporator Neha Nikose along with over 50 residents from her Prabhag number 2 (C) gheraoed standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar for approval of four works worth Rs 1.8 lakh even though no funds are available under the heads. “How could you mislead me even when I’m also a member of the 16-member standing committee,” asked the miffed Congress corporator. “Sewer lines are choked and damaged. Being a corporator, every morning I face the public wrath over civic issues that remain unresolved due to non-allocation of funds,” she said while expressing her anguish Bhoyar. “Like the prabhags represented by ruling party corporators, residents from my constituency too are demanding I-blocks on footpaths and urgent repair of broken chambers and manholes. What should I tell them?” she said. “If you cannot provide equal funds for standing committee members then I will be constrained to quit as I’m finding it difficult to face voters and provide redressal to the issues raised by them,” an angry Nikose said. As Bhoyar was unable to respond to Nikose’s volley of questions, senior BJP corporator and ruling party leader Avinash Thakare came to his rescue. Thakare said had Bhoyar earmarked funds for various works in Nikose’s constituency. It is the responsibility of the civic administration to release funds for various works. “If the superintending engineer Ajay Pohekar is saying there are no funds left for works proposed by Nikose then she should seek a written reply,” he suggested. “The role of the standing committee chairman is only to approve works and funds. However, it is the duty of the administration to make the funds available for the same,” Thakare clarified. Congress corporators Sandip Sahare, Manoj Sangole, Sneha Nikose and Bhavna Lonare staged a protest in the porch of mayor Dayashankar Tiwari’s office and in front of the new administrative building demanding action against those who illegally demolished Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Bhavan at Ambazari garden. BSP corporators led by party leader and senior corporator Jitendra Ghodeswar raised slogans against the BJP and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B for discrimination over allocating funds for development works by the ruling party and civic administration supporting the former.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/oppn-protests-lack-of-funds-for-devlopment-works/articleshow/85499014.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Nearly 120 Rohingya refugees, including 65 women, from 40 locations in New Delhi, Haryana, Hyderabad and Jammu & Kashmir were surveyed for the report on Covid-19 emergency statelessness fund. The report was discussed during a webinar on humanitarian and protection issues of Rohingya refugees in India during the Covid-19 pandemic, held on Friday. It also stated around 64.29% Rohingya refugees across the country faced barriers in accessing health services during the lockdown due to financial difficulties. The analysis, which has been prepared by Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, said the refugees living in settlements that are located in rural or isolated areas are the most vulnerable, and most of the aid organisations and humanitarian initiatives often fail to reach them. “Therefore, the refugees in rural or isolated areas require urgent attention and assistance,” the analysis said. During the webinar, the detention of refugees was also discussed as it has “created fear among the community.” It was also said that all refugees should be given basic facilities like food and education. Sabber Kyaw Min, founder and director, Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, said, “We Rohingya left our homes and country to save our lives. As India is one of the largest democracies in the world, we request authorities in India to help us by showing humanity. Detaining and harassing these already persecuted people is like punishing them again for being persecuted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/56-rohingya-refugees-lost-jobs-during-pandemic/articleshow/85499019.cms||---

Before realizing the costly gaffe, the minister announced a government job and land even as the kin of the serving soldier - whose house he visited -- stood in shock and broke down fearing an untoward incident. As per the itinerary, the minister was to visit the residence of a martyred soldier at Mulgund in Gadag district. Instead, Narayanaswamy visited the house of serving soldier Ravikumar Kattimani. The minister, who was behind schedule, was in a hurry when he reached Mulgund along with Haveri BJP MP Shivakumar Udasi. He went to the house of Kattimani, currently posted in Jammu and Kashmir, and enquired about the health and condition of the family members. Later, he announced that a government job would be provided to one member and land for the family, which left the entire family in a state of shock and confusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/minister-lands-in-wrong-soldiers-house-to-pay-respects/articleshow/85504433.cms||---

The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) civil engineer will check these structures and take steps accordingly. Transport body officials told TOI that they have completed a survey of all the “Pune pattern” bus stops and sent letters to the Pune Cantonment Board and the Khadki Cantonment Board, requesting them to remove one bus stop each in their jurisdictions. These bus stops were found to be structurally weak. “We have done an initial survey of the ‘Pune pattern’ bus stops of the PMPML in the city. Some of these bus stops, including the one that collapsed earlier this week, are more than 20 years’ old. Around 12 of them maintained by the PMPML have been categorised as doubtful, meaning their structures appear weak and there are chances of them falling,” an official of the city transport body said. Earlier this week, a bus stop in the Camp area, collapsed, resulting in two peole sustaining injuries. Transport activists said that the bus stops under advertisement agencies needed the most care. “It is strange that such actions take place only after an accident happens,” PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/survey-identifies-12-bus-stops-structurally-weak/articleshow/85499036.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Delhi: Soon, driving tests at automated tracks at night||NEW DELHI: It will soon be possible to give tests for a permanent driving license at night, with Delhi government’s transport department starting preparations for carrying out the exams in a second shift. The number of driving test slots has been reduced at automated driving test tracks to ensure social distancing in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. This has led to a longer waiting period to get an appointment for a driving test, which could be two months or more at the busy zonal offices. To reduce the waiting period and ensure social distancing, the department is upgrading the automated driving test tracks and additional lighting arrangements at these facilities are going to be provided for carrying out driving tests in the second shift. As part of the initiative, high-mast light poles will be installed at the automated test tracks at Sarai Kale Khan, Viswas Nagar, Mayur Vihar, Shakur Basti, Burari, Loni Road, Raja Garden, Rohini Sector-28, Dwarka Sector-22 and the new facility that has come up at Jharoda Kalan. The department will get 350 watt LED floodlight fixtures, which will provide strong illumination to enable night-time tests. The project is expected to cost around Rs 96.7 lakh and will be completed within 45 days after the work is awarded. The high-mast lights will be 12.5-metre-tall, with a 12-sided polygon cross-section and steel plate thickness of 3 mm. The high mast will have a diameter of 360 mm at the base and 150 mm at the top and strong enough to withstand heavy wind velocity. “For carrying out the automated tests, cameras on high poles need to capture the driving test, apart from sensors on the ground. Both are needed for a computerised analysis and then finding if an applicant has cleared the test or not,” an official said. “Very powerful lights are required at the centres to ensure that the cameras are able to capture images as efficiently as they do it in daylight,” he said. At present, driving tests start between 8 and 8.30am at test tracks and goes on till 1.30 to even 2pm, till all the applicants for the day have given their tests. “There will be separate shifts in the near future to cater to more demand while ensuring there is no crowding at test centres. Initially, the timing of the tests will be increased to 8pm and if possible, even up to 10pm in the next phase,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/soon-driving-tests-at-automated-tracks-at-night/articleshow/85499070.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||After court verdict, GMR plans Nagpur airport takeover||NAGPUR: After the high court ruled in its favour, GMR plans to go ahead with taking over of Nagpur airport and carry out the expansion as planned for the first phase. The court has quashed Maharashtra Airports Limited’s (MIL) order, which set aside GMR’s allotment of contract after it won the deal to privatize Nagpur airport through a tender process. A press release by GMR says that during 2019-20, Nagpur airport ran close to its full capacity handling about 30 lakh passengers and 9,500 metric tonnes of cargo during the financial year. In the first phase that would be spread over a period of four years, GMR plans to construct a new terminal building. It will have a facility to handle 40 lakh passengers in a year. The other facilities would be a new taxiway, apron, car parking, approach road and a cargo terminal. The existing building will also be refurbished. The GMR has put up the initial capacity of cargo at 20,000 MT a year . It plans to develop a cargo hub based on the models in major air cargo hubs in Memphis, Paris, Hong Kong and Dubai, the release said. The long-term plans include a second runway and building a capacity to handle 30 million passengers annually. However, sources in the MIL said as against GMR statement of Nagpur airport handing 30 lakh passenger in 2019-20, the actual numbers were below 60% of what has been mentioned in the company’s release . During the peak period, there were as much as 4,400 arrivals and departures each in a day. This has come down to 1,900 to 2,200 due to Covid-19. MIL has only recently started compiling the cargo figures. At present, 2.2 to 2.8 tonnes of cargo is being handled. The accounts are being finalized but there are chances of losses during the fiscal, a source said. GMR had won the tender for privatization of Nagpur airport in 2018. However, MIL, a state government agency and the current operator of airport, had annulled GMR’s allotment and scrapped the bid. The bids were to be made on the basis of percentage of revenue to be shared with MIL by the private player. Earlier, GMR had offered a 5.76% share on revenues which was later increased to 14.49%. MIL, however, cancelled the allotment even after that. The grounds were that MIL already got a higher revenue by running the airport on its own, as against what was offered by GMR. Even Union ministry of aviation in 2019 had questioned the need of privatization if the revenue was so low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-court-verdict-gmr-plans-nagpur-airport-takeover/articleshow/85499061.cms||Shishir Arya

On Wednesday, the team had seized 90g of MDMA worth Rs 1 crore and arrested five people, including a woman, from the apartment. Ernakulam deputy excise commissioner Ashok Kumar said that the drug was found hidden in a waste bin kept at a corner in the apartment. “The arrested people, Sreemon, Mohammad Favas and Shamna of Kozhikode, Aju alias Amal of Kasaragod and Mohammad Afsal of Ernakulam, who are in judicial custody, will be brought in our custody for further interrogation,” Kumar said “The contraband was kept in small packets of 50 and 100g. It was hidden in such a manner that it would look like waste being abandoned carelessly. Moreover, as it was kept at the place where the dogs were tied, nobody would care to notice it. It is suspected that they sold small quantities in retail while driving back to Kochi. We have recovered around Rs 5,000 from the flat,” said Ernakulam excise inspector (antinarcotic and enforcement special squad) N Sankaran. Based on the information we received, the accused had brought nearly 4kg of MDMA from Chennai and Puducherry for sale in Kerala. Only 1.2kg MDMA was recovered so far. The modus operandi adopted by the gang was to travel as family along with furious dog breeds like Rottweiler and Doberman to evade inspection by law enforcement agencies at checkpoints. Three dogs were also detained during the search operation and the car they used to travel was confiscated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/excise-team-seizes-1kg-more-mdma-from-vazhakkala-flat/articleshow/85496671.cms||---

The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on Friday announced the certification after examining the proposal submitted by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) for the Swachh Bharat Mission Water Plus City Certification under Swachh Survekshan 2021. This certification is given to cities that achieve safe and sustainable sanitation by ensuring that no untreated wastewater is discharged into water bodies, ensuring adequate capacity of sewage treatment facilities apart from using treated and recycled water. The final field assessment report by the Union ministry reveals that certification was achieved after the inspection teams checked various indicators including safe discharge of sewage or septage (faecal sludge), safe cleaning of sewer and septic tanks through mechanised equipment and availability of PPEs and safety equipment in case of manual entry in unavoidable circumstances, re-use of treated water, among other factors. However, contrary to the assessment report which shows that city has passed all the indicators that need to be checked to achieve the ‘Water Plus’ certificate, experts pointed out how the situation on ground was different in several cases. Meanwhile, while appreciating the efforts of the those responsible for achieving the feat, municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao tweeted, “Congratulations to the citizens of#Hyderabad on our city getting the coveted “Water plus” status of Swachh Bharat Mission from Govt of India. Hyderabad is already recognised as ODF++ city. We will continue to endeavour to make it cleaner & greener (sic).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-first-urban-body-in-t-to-get-water-plus-city-tag/articleshow/85501385.cms||Moulika.KV

As per a complaint lodged on Thursday by the woman, the fraudster siphoned off Rs1.57 lakh from her account through six transactions. The Pimpri police have registered a case under the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act. A police officer said that since May 17, the woman had been receiving SMSs from two unknown mobile numbers, urging her to update her KYC details with the bank failing which the account would get locked. “The SMSs contained a link, but the woman did not click on it,” he officer said. On June 13, the woman wanted to transfer Rs3,000 to her husband account through netbanking. “But due to technical issues, she was not getting OTPs. So, she downloaded a public sector bank’s app and completed the transaction,” the officer said. The same day, a man claiming to be a bank employee called her. “He said the bank was aware that she had trouble getting OTPs and told her to update KYC details through a link he would send her. He said she would then not face this problem again,” the officer further said. Believing him, the woman clicked on the link and received six OTPs on her cellphone. “she claims she did not share the OTPs with anyone, but Rs1.57 lakh were transferred from her account,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudster-uses-kyc-ploy-steals-rs-1-6-lakh/articleshow/85499049.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Nagpur||20-storey station will be a challenge for other Metros: CM Uddhav Thackeray||NAGPUR: While constructing the elevated route of the Metro in Nagpur, focus should be given on beautifying and making best use of the space below for the benefit of citizens, stated state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday. The minster was making a virtual address at the inaugural function of the 1.6 kilometre-long Nagpur Metro’s Sitabuldi–Zero Mile–Kasturchand Park route and Freedom Park. Stressing that there should be no shortcomings in development, Thackeray added, “The Zero Mile Freedom Park Metro station is a first-of-its-kind. It is the country’s first 20-storey Metro station and it will now kick start a competition among other cities.” Stating that world-class infrastructure is being built in Nagpur, Union minster for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari said, “For the first time in our country, a two-tier Metro has been set up. Apart from this, the world’s largest fountain is coming up at Futala lake where MahaMetro is constructing a spectator gallery and multi-level parking.” The minister also informed that the proposal for the second phase of Nagpur Metro has been sent to the Union cabinet for approval. Union minister for urban development and petroleum Hardeep Singh Puri, who too joined the inaugural function virtually, said that the phase-I of Nagpur Metro will be completed “by or hopefully before December 2021”. “Nagpur Metro is capable of being a clean and sustainable project as it uses green energy. It will have a major role in urban transport in the coming days. Nagpur Metro’s 60% revenue will be non-fare box, which is commendable. Moreover, 65% of its electricity requirement will be met from solar energy,” the minister added. Making an announcement, Gadkari promised funds from Central Roads Fund (CRF) for building an underpass to reach Zero Mile Station from Cotton Market without any hindrance of traffic. “Once I sanction the funds, MahaMetro can use this money to execute the work,” he added. Talking on the historic importance of Zero Mile, leader of opposition in the state legislative and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “Nagpur's Zero Mile holds significant historic value. The Great Trigonometry Survey was started by the British in 1907 from Zero Mile.” Guardian minister Nitin Raut said that Zero Mile Freedom Park and Kasturchand Park stations have added to the beauty of the city and contributed to its development. Both he and state minister Sunil Kedar congratulated MahaMetro chief Brijesh Dixit and his team for the “splendid work”. Kedar further said that work on Pune Metro was also progressing fast. “Metro is doing the work of connecting everybody and the state government will provide all possible help to development works,” he added. The 1.6 km long Sitaburdi-Kasturchand Park line has started operations from Friday giving easy access to Vidhan Bhavan, Reserve Bank of India, Central Museum, Sanvidhan Chowk and Morris College. According to MahaMetro officials, the architecture and façade of the Kasturchand Park station is inspired by the park itself, which is “a classic example of traditional Indian Rajput architecture”. Also, the 40,000 square feet area surrounding Zero Mile station has been converted into public park named ‘Freedom Park’. “The very aesthetically done park is a perfect example of urban landscaping which comprises of urban public plazas connecting the heritage precincts and event spaces with a careful streetscape, markers like the history wall, war trophy – T55 Battle Tank, totem poles and plaza entrance areas,” added officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cm-20-storey-station-will-be-a-challenge-for-other-metros/articleshow/85496730.cms||Manka Behl

---||Kochi||An Onam song for elderly parents at old age homes||Thiruvananthapuram: Though the outbreak of the pandemic has cast a pall of gloom on Onam season, Malayalis are all geared up to celebrate it. Like last year, this time also music composer Vidyadharan master and the team have come up with a music video to make this Onam more meaningful and vibrant. Titled ‘Onathinenkilum’, the song penned by Sasikala V Menon, is sung and composed by Vidyadharan master himself. The music video, released on Thursday on YouTube channel-Vidyadharan Master Official, is a clarion call to children who have abandoned their parents in old age homes. It successfully depicts the harsh realities of life and makes us realize Onam is not all about colourful festivities. “Children who consider parents as a burden must understand that there is no life without parents. Even if parents are aged, they are real assets of children. No matter how rich we are, we should live grounded and be aware of the bonding between parents and children. At least from now on, sons and daughters must stop abandoning their elderly parents,” said Vidyadharan master. The song shot at Abhayam, an old age home in Shoranur, stands out for its concept and cast. Along with Abhayam inmates, Mahadevan has excelled in the role of a father who suffers the pain of being abandoned by his children. The musician says the song has a life as it includes real parents from the old age home.  “All abandoned parents crave to see their children and grandchildren at least during the Onam time. With this video, we aim at stopping the social evil of abandoning parents,” said Sasikala, who has worked with the master in nearly 60 songs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/an-onam-song-for-elderly-parents-at-old-age-homes/articleshow/85496751.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Political bullfight over bull race in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: The political bullfight over bull racing in Maharashtra seems to be getting fiercer, as senior Congress and BJP leaders locked horns on who is to blame. As of now there is a ban on bull racing, which is seen as a part of rural tradition across the state. Congress leader and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said the central government must amend the law to make bull racing legal, while leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis called him out for “blaming the Centre” for everything. Thorat, who was on a visit to Nagpur and Amravati, said, “In rural areas, the bull racing event was always celebrated in a positive way. There was never any form of cruelty involved for the bulls during the race.” He added, “To say that the bull is being harassed for racing is like saying that Olympic athletes who sprint are facing the same issue. It’s a very clean and transparent event and it is time to reconsider the decision (ban).” Thorat alleged that BJP was playing both sides by criticizing the ban on bull fight while not doing anything to amend the law at the Centre. When asked about BJP’s allegation that a notification effectively banning bulls’ use in such races was issued during senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s tenure as Union minister, Thorat said, “Whatever happened then is another issue. Now, the Centre must act on it.” After the Ramesh-led ministry of environment and forests’ notification in 2011, a Supreme Court (SC) order in 2014 sealed the fate of bull racing. Then in 2017, the Fadnavis-led government in Maharashtra removed the ban. Fadnavis said, “We brought in the Act (amendment) for bull racing but later it was stayed by the court. Even then we followed it up and submitted a detailed report titled ‘Running ability of bull’ at SC. As of now, this issue in pending at the apex court and hence there is absolutely no connection to the central government.” Fadnavis also trashed Thorat’s allegations, saying, “There are some people who have got into the habit of blaming the Centre for everything.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/political-bullfight-over-bull-race-in-maharashtra/articleshow/85499115.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Pune||Doctors seek change in system to avoid visit to RTO for verification||PUNE: Amid mixed reactions from the medical fraternity in the city on the transport department’s regulation under which only doctors recognised by the Regional Transport Office (RTO) would be able to issue medical certificates to driving licence seekers, senior transport department officials said that the same will be made mandatory from October 1. “There are some hiccups in any new plan that is to be implemented. To ensure that doctors approach the RTOs and get registered, the implementation deadline is now October 1. The plan is extremely important from the road safety point of view,” state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne told TOI. TOI report on Aug 20, 2021The regulation applies for those renewing their driving licences and those over the age of 40 years applying for a fresh licence. On Thursday, authorities at the Pune RTO had said that the regulation would be made mandatory from September 1. While city-based doctors appreciated the decision, they also stated that they would prefer to get verified online. “We have seen some so-called doctors line up near the RTO distributing medical certificates to everyone approaching them for a hefty amount. The move by the transport department aims to get rid of the phenomenon. However, the current deadline is still too short. Also, there must be a system, so doctors can be verified without visiting the RTO,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune. Thomas Jacob, a doctor, slammed the move asking if RTO is qualified to check doctors’ degrees. “What they can do is register doctors working for larger hospitals and certificates issued by them should be considered valid,” he shared. RTO officials said that if doctors were hesitant to come to the office, they would send their inspectors to them. “The process of making the registration process online is in the pipeline. However, doctors must come to the RTO office to collect their logins for the Sarathi portal. They should bring their certificates that will be verified by the IMA or any recognized medical body. If doctors are hesitant, we would send our inspectors to their location for the same,” said Sanjiv Bhor, deputy RTO in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctors-seek-change-in-system-to-avoid-visit-to-rto-for-verification/articleshow/85499105.cms||Joy Sengupta

The migration started around 2003, when NATO and US military bases started to be established. “The offer was too tempting to resist. I was offered US$1,000 (around Rs 45,000 then) in 2010, to work in Camp Leatherneck in Helmand province. Without thinking twice, I decided to work in a war-torn country for nearly four years,” said Jackson L D’Souza, a resident of Nagori. He worked for Morale, Welfare and Recreation facility. It’s not Jackson alone, a lot of youths from Udupi and Dakshina Kannada were eager to work in Afghanistan to make a career. “Though there were bombings near the camp, life was not hard, as we lived inside the camp most of the time. Most importantly, we saved our entire earnings, and also enjoyed life amidst military personnel, including good food,” says Jackson, who is now an entrepreneur. Joyson Anthony D’Souza now runs Inkspired Tattoo Studio, a chain of tattoo studios in the district, and says that working in Afghanistan for seven years made him stand on his own feet and turned him into an entrepreneur. “In 2008, I landed in Afghanistan after paying Rs 8 lakh to agents that was borrowed from my friends and family. I was recruited as a foreman with a starting salary of Rs 28,000 per month, and when I left India good for good, I was earning around Rs 2 lakh per month. If I had rejected the offer, I would not have been where I am today,” he says. He worked in Kabul, Kandahar and Helmand provinces. Many of them have been working inside the base, and were never allowed to step into red zones. Thulasidara, a resident of Kavoor says that he has visited almost all the army bases in Afghanistan. “I landed in Afghanistan in 2011 and worked till 2020. As a maintenance personnel, I had to visit army camps across the country. Life was good, and we earned handsomely,” he added. “I am now worried and praying for my old colleagues who are stranded in Afghanistan after the crisis,” said Anil Pinto, a resident of Padil, who worked there for three years, and is now employed in UAE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/afghanistan-was-once-a-sought-after-destination-for-jobs/articleshow/85496706.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Chandigarh||Only 2 routes served by 20 buses comprise city bus service||Ludhiana: The city residents who are struggling for clean air in one of the most polluted cities of the country are yet to find better transport system in the city. Despite so many announcements about enhanced transport system, the residents are still travelling in auto rickshaws and the civic body is unable to ply the city buses due to legal complications. As of now, only two routes have bus service and only 20 buses are plying at these routes. The city bus service has been caught in a legal dispute over bus fare. The civic body is contesting the case against the contractor in the high court. Municipal corporation (MC) had handed over 83 buses to the contractor, but only 20 buses are in use and the rest of the buses are lying unused in the workshop. At the moment, bus service is available from Bus stand to Kohara and another to Meharban. Last week Sahnewal route was also dropped because of resentment shown by the auto rickshaw union at Sahnewal. The firm has to pay Rs 4 crore (Rs 2 crore rent and Rs 2 crore for advertisement tax) to municipal corporation if they lose legal battle. A resident of Civil Lines, Kripal Singh said, “There was a time when we were peddled dreams of metro rail in the city but in reality the authorities could not even run the bus service properly. There is no bus service in the internal routes of the city.” He said with fuel prices escalating, proper bus service is even more essential as people would have preferred the buses over their own vehicles. Another resident from Chander Nagar Subhash Verma said electric buses are a good concept and civic authorities must see if they could emulate what Chandigarh has done. Pointing out the ongoing legal battle, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said civic body is helpless in this regard. “As you are aware, we are fighting against the firm in the court and after court decision we can reach any conclusion. As far as electric buses are concerned, MC does not have funds to take any such step.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/only-2-routes-served-by-20-buses-comprise-city-bus-service/articleshow/85494177.cms||---

BJYM state president Vikrant Patil said, “Pandemic has caused loss of jobs and businesses for innumerable people due to which the national commission for protection of child rights has asked education departments across states and union territories to ensure there is no harassment of children and parents for failing to clear the outstanding fees.

The incident took place between 3.30pm and 6.30pm. Gawas said that when her boyfriend reached the rented room, he found the main door latched from inside, and no response from the deceased. He then climbed over the metal roof and entered the room through the gallery. “After lowering the body, he shifted his girlfriend to PHC Siolim, where she was declared brought dead.

The domestic and industrial waste are being treated and to reduce the impact on pollutants in water, regular release of 200 cusecs of fresh water from Sirhind Canal has been planned. The water was supposed to have been released in April, but it got delayed due to Covid and monsoon. Now it is fixed for August 22. The officials claimed if they will release water in the morning, by evening it will reach in Ludhiana city limits. In the present scenario, it will take three to four days to show results and it is expected that water colour will turn from black to brown. But the dairy units, which are throwing waste directly into Buddha Nullah are posing challenge for the officials. Despite claims Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials could not resolve this problem. Chief engineer of PPCB Gulshan Rai said they have taken action against 65 dairy units located at the banks of Buddha Nullah and legal action has been taken against dozen dairy units. Superintending engineer of municipal corporation (MC) Rajinder Singh said waste coming from dairy units will be a major problem and they will approach the dairy farmers within MC limits to support MC and help in reducing the pollution level in drain. He said they will take action against the defaulters if they will continue their practice. Meanwhile, PPCB member secretary Karunesh Garg on Friday visited the site from where water will be released into Buddha Nullah. A trial run was conducted. Garg said Buddha Nullah is a non-perennial water body, as such it does not have sufficient assimilation capacity. He said there is a need to release at least 200 cusecs of water from Sirhind Canal to achieve the mandate with regard to quality of water meant for organised outdoor bathing. This will further lead to improvement of water quality in the Sutlej.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dairy-units-need-to-mend-ways-for-release-of-fresh-water-to-show-result-in-buddha-nullah/articleshow/85494226.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He added the state had the capacity and necessary infrastructure to inoculate 15-20 lakh people per day, but supply was not satisfactory.The CM avoided mentioning either the central government or BJP while expressing concern over irregular supply of doses. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar also highlighted short supply of doses, though they mentioned the central government.Thackeray, health minister Rajesh Tope and Thorat dedicated 200 Mobile Vaccination Vans (titled Samruddhi Jeevan Raths) facilitated by energy minister Nitin Raut through CSR funds of Mahatransco, on Friday. CM and Tope graced the programme online whereas Thorat, Kedar, women and child welfare minister Yashomati Thakur and others were present at the Divisional Sports Complex, Mankapur, on Friday.Thackeray also said, “We are able to inoculate people as soon as we get supply of doses. But supply of doses is a problem. But I am satisfied that over 5 crore people have been administered two doses in the state. We could vaccinate 9 lakh people in a day.”Thackeray said, “We are praying there is no third wave. We should keep our soldiers ready and equipped with weapons if there is one. Raut and his team facilitated vans for vaccination, which is equipping soldiers with weapons. It is our responsibility to work for the people, but the effort by Raut and his team was appreciable as was need of the hour and executed timely. Making available 200 ambulances and taking vaccination closes to people are very important steps.”Thorat said, “MVA government, right from CM to all guardian ministers, have done a commendable job to end two waves. We need to be alert for third wave. Vaccination could not happen as per expectation till date. We are requesting the centre for sufficient stock of doses. Request has been made for 15-20 lakh doses per day but it is not being received.”Stating that Raut’s project was the first-of-its-kind in entire country, Thorat said vaccine should reach each and every person in the state, which will be possible with such projects.Kedar said, “Vaccination is the only available solution to beat the pandemic. I have even declared reward of Rs10 lakh to gram panchayat which ensures vaccination of all eligible people in its area. But problem is availability of doses, which is known to all. People who can get sufficient supply of doses should take the lead.”Stating Raut’s project was a role model for others, Tope said, “Vaccination means important part of preparations for third wave. Centre and ICMR are predicting 60 lakh cases in third wave after projected 20 lakh in first and 40 lakh in second wave. The government under CM had given many relaxations so all need to ensure vaccination and Covid appropriate behaviour.”Raut said the vans will be utilized for vaccination of those people who are unable to turn up at centres. “Vaccination of bedridden people, senior citizens, pregnant women and other such needy people will be done using these vans. Right from tribal areas to urban localities, vans have been provided to all 11 districts of Vidarbha,” he said.Mahatransco has provided Rs25 crore CSR funds to Vidarbha Relief Society under divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3rd-wave-likely-in-sept-state-can-vax-15-20l-per-day-but-no-supply-cm/articleshow/85496756.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||Plot To Attack Tihar Official Foiled: Cops||New Delhi: The plot to attack a jail superintendent was foiled after Satender alias Satte, a member of the Rohit Chaudhary gang, was arrested a few days ago. Police discovered that Satte was planning to execute a Tihar jail official to avenge the recent killing of Ankit Gujjar in the prison and had procured an AK-47 rifle for the purpose. Police say that Govindpuri resident Satte, 28, who was out on interim bail in the case related to the murder of a Prince Teotia gang member, is previously involved in over 20 other cases of murder, robbery, snatching, threat, criminal intimidation and illegal possession of firearms. A semi-automatic .32 bore pistol with six live cartridges was recovered from him. Pramod Kushwaha, DCP (Special Cell), said Satte was arrested on Tuesday around 9.15pm on Outer Ring Road near Chirag Delhi. “His arrest foiled a conspiracy to kill a deputy superintendent ranked officer of Tihar Jail,” said Kushwaha. “We discovered that Satte is an associate of gangster Ankit Gujjar, who was found dead in Tihar’s Jail No 3 on August 4. Gujjar's family has alleged that he died following assault by the jail staff and an FIR for murder was registered against the Jail No 3 personnel.” Kushwaha revealed that in a recent audio conversation one person could be heard asking the other to arrange an AK-47 rifle to kill someone to settle a personal score. The person also talked to “causing harm” to a deputy superintendent of Tihar Jail to avenge the death of Gujjar in the jail. While Satte was identified as the caller, the receiver was identified as Ajay Gujjar, said the DCP. “Police teams mounted surveillance on the movements of both the persons identified,” added Kushwaha. “On Tuesday, following a tip off about Satte’s possible arrival at a park in Chirag Delhi, plans were made to apprehend him. He was spotted at around 9.15 pm and was immediately overpowered and was disarmed.” During interrogation, Satte disclosed that he had planned to attack the jail official to avenge the death of Ankit Gujjar. He further disclosed that he had discussed his plan with an associate named Ajay Gujjar. DCP Kushwaha said, “Satte had asked Ajay Gujjar to arrange an AK-47 rifle to show off his firepower and to establish supremacy in the south Delhi areas. Satte is an active member of the gang led by the notorious Rohit Chaudhary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plot-to-attack-tihar-official-foiled-cops/articleshow/85499139.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Fresh charge, dept enquiry not permissible for same misconduct: HC||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has ruled that a fresh enquiry and departmental proceeding for the same misconduct for which a person has already been given punishment, is not permissible. The bench of Justice Ravindra Ghuge and Justice Sanjay Mehare quashed and set aside the Railway Protection Force (RPF), Bhusawal division's orders of June 19 and 25 last year to serve a fresh charge-sheet and a full-fledged departmental enquiry proceeding against an assistant sub-inspector (ASI), who was already given minor punishment for the misconduct of claiming excess travel allowance. "We have concluded that the impugned action of the Force (RPF) in issuing the orders dated 19.6.2020 and 25.6.2020 of preparation and issuance of a fresh charge-sheet and a full-fledged departmental enquiry being initiated under Chapter XII of the Rules cannot be sustained under Rule 219.4 (b)," the bench said while partly allowing ASI Ramrao Shinde's petition. The HC observed that the issuance of a fresh charge-sheet so as to commence a fresh departmental enquiry would not be permissible, "though such an enquiry is not a second enquiry being conducted by the Force taking into account that there was no departmental enquiry conducted in the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the petitioner which resulted in the order of punishment dated 22.7.2019." In May 2019, assistant security commandant at Bhusawal initiated a departmental inquiry against ASI Ramrao Shinde for getting excess travelling allowance. After being found guilty, senior divisional security commissioner, considering Shinde’s track record, granted him minor punishment in the form of withholding six months of increment. Accordingly, an amount of Rs 19, 350 was deducted from Shinde’s salary. However, on November 08, 2019, RPF’s chief security commissioner exercising the powers under Railway Protection Force Rules 1987 termed the earlier granted punishment to be insufficient and issued a notice calling for Shinde’s say. The chief security commissioner on December 2, 2019 passed an order for withdrawal of earlier punishment of stopping six months of increment and directed senior divisional security commissioner, Bhusawal to issue a fresh charge-sheet for major punishment. Accordingly on June 25, 2020, another charge sheet was filed by the disciplinary authority and divisional security commissioner and issued directives for reimbursement of amount deducted in view of earlier minor punishment. Shinde challenged this move through his lawyer Swapnil Patil on the grounds that a fresh charge-sheet and enquiry was not legally tenable. ends||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/fresh-charge-dept-enquiry-not-permissible-for-same-misconduct-hc/articleshow/85496752.cms||Mohammed Akhef

While being at Badnapur, union minister of state for railways Danve stoke controversy after he referred Congress’ Rahul Gandhi as a useless bull that is given away to the temple. He made the statement while comparing him to prime minister Narendra Modi who he claimed is working so much for the people. His statement attracted sharp criticism from Congress’ state as well as central functionaries while BJP leaders downplayed the statement citing that the minister was just giving an example so that the rural population easily grasps what was being said to them. BJP supporters carried out mass felicitation at almost all crossroads along the way before the Yatra toured different parts of the city till evening. Soon after entering Aurangabad, Danve said, “BJP will single handedly wrest Aurangabad municipal corporation from all the political parties put together.” The tour started from Gopinathgadh in Beed on August 16 and covered about a dozen talukas in the districts of Nanded, Parbhani, Hingoli and Jalna before entering Aurangabad. A large number of supporters and party workers tailing the tour caused traffic snarls on the busy Jalna road after the rally entered the city during the day. Union minister of state for finance Karad said, “We are carrying out a campaign for personally reaching out to the beneficiaries of government’s various schemes.” He said that through this campaign, BJP is seeking blessings of the masses and trying to establish connect with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bjp-jan-ashirwad-yatra-enters-aurangabad/articleshow/85496800.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Nagpur||Hospitals shifting focus from Covid, start different cells||NAGPUR: The Covid situation is now well under control in city and many private hospitals have literally zero admissions in their Covid wards. Hospitals have now started shifting their focus from Covid. The recent developments in big private hospitals in city confirm this change. The Orange City Hospital and Research Center (OCHRI) started its dedicated dengue division earlier this month. “This time, one in four dengue infected patients are getting sick while one in 20 is landing up with severe dengue. Hence, one should not be careless and reach early to hospital. Timely treatment can prevent fatalities,” said Dr Mohit Gharpure, who coordinates ICU at OCHRI’s dengue division. OCHRI dengue division is looked after by Dr Rajesh Atal, Dr Devyani Buche, Dr Vina Bang and Dr Hemant Waghmare, who played important role during Covid waves. KRIMS hospital started post-Covid cell from August 20. Director Dr Ashok Arbat said that the post-Covid complications are of different types and need to be addressed under one roof. “People experience different types of complications, but the root cause is Covid. Our centre will be beneficial for many such needy patients,” he said. Psychiatrists, dietitians, physiotherapists and specialists of respiratory diseases will be available at post Covid Care Center. At the same time, a meditation center will be started for patients and their relatives. KRIMS has also launched a chain of diagnostic laboratories. Nelson Hospital is launching its Neurosciences center on August 21. Neuroscience focuses on the brain and its impact on behaviour and cognitive functions and also investigates what happens to the nervous system when people have neurological, psychiatric, and neuro-developmental disorders. “Neuroscience affects many human functions. It also contributes to a better understanding of a wide range of common conditions. The hospital will now open for brain and spine care facility, at OPD, IPD, surgeries, and various diagnostic services,” said Dr Satish Deopujari. Several other private hospitals are now shifting their focus from Covid to non-Covid treatments. After Covid, social organizations have also geared up to help people in treating non-Covid ailments. North Nagpur’s first charitable dialysis centre was opened at Kamal Phool Chowk earlier this month. Sant Govindram Sahib Dialysis Centre will help all the patients suffering from kidney disorders who require frequent dialysis. “We are conducting dialysis at affordable rates of Rs500. Soon, it will be done free of cost,” said president of the organization Shrichand Daswani. These developments are some of the finest indicators that the Covid conditions are under control and the projected third wave is either not coming, or not going to be very intense, say experts. In government hospitals, the Covid dedicated sites are now being handed over to non-Covid activities. In Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC), the surgical complex is already handed over to the residents for non-Covid surgeries and treatments. Residents in GMCH are also demanding that the trauma centre building, which was converted into the Covid hospital during the first and second wave, should be handed over for trauma related works now. Final decision in this regard is expected to come by next month.

---||Nagpur||At 26%, Nagpur division records second-highest school attendance||NAGPUR: Almost 26% of eligible school students in Nagpur division are back in classrooms as Std VIII-XII continue to remain open in rural areas. In terms of numbers, it means around 1.53 lakh students are back to their classrooms in Nagpur division making it the second-highest in the state after Aurangabad which recorded 1.94 lakh students. The state government had issued a GR permitting reopening of schools in urban areas (VIII-XII) while also allowing in rural areas students from Std V onwards to attend school. Though the GR was issued on August 10, it was put on hold after members of the state’s Covid task force expressed concerns over the reopening. Speaking to TOI earlier this week, education minister Varsha Gaikwad said a final decision regarding implementing the GR will be taken soon. In terms of the percentage, Nagpur still retains the second slot in the state but this time around, it’s behind Latur which clocked 56.58% attendance though in terms of numbers, it was around 1.28 lakh. The lowest attendance figures were from Mumbai division at 2.31% with just over 20,000 students attending classes. Schools have reopened only in Thane and Palghar districts. Pune division marked 5.37% attendance with 39,322 students. Attendance was reported from Solapur, Ahmednagar and Pune districts. “These numbers are encouraging even though it’s only 15% of the eligible students who are back in classrooms. That’s because we are coming from a very lethal second wave and memories of that devastation are still fresh. The second point is that only rural schools have reopened, whereas the high density urban areas remain closed. The third point is that the recent floods in certain parts of the state have further put the brakes on academic normalization,” said an education officer. The official added that due to apprehensions of a third wave affecting children, parents are a bit wary. “Anyway, the main purpose of reopening was to benefit students who could not access online education. We believe that’s on track,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-26-nagpur-division-records-second-highest-school-attendance/articleshow/85499205.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||Stop symbolic opposition to upper caste, Dalits will get nothing out of it: Limbale||Nagpur: Sharankumar Limbale, a veteran Marathi novelist, poet, critic and short story writer and a recipient of Saraswati Samman, a prestigious literary recognition in India, said that symbolic opposition to Hinduism should stop as it is going to give nothing productive to the Dalit literature.Limbale was felicitated by Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh (VSS) Nagpur branch on Thursday. One of the senior Dalit authors of Maharashtra, Limbale made some interesting statements on the backdrop of recent incident in which veteran Marathi poet Yashwant Manohar refused to receive VSS felicitation just because there was a portrait of Goddess Saraswati on the dais.“Rejecting the symbols like Saraswati portrait or the award named after the Goddess is unwise. This spreads nothing but hatred. We will get nothing in the end. We are here to voice the concerns of deprived and suppressed people and this mission will suffer a setback due to the symbolic protest,” said Limbale, who has authored 40 books of novel, poetry, stories and criticism. He has also written critical essays and papers for many seminars.The Saraswati Samman, instituted by KK Birla foundation, is considered as the highest recognition in the field of Indian literature. Limbale got this award for his 2018 Marathi novel Sanatan. He faced criticism from the Dalit literary scenario for accepting the award named after Goddess Saraswati. “Rejecting award named after Saraswati is also like accepting the existence of this fantasy. I have accepted this national award as recognition to my literary contribution in last four decades. When I accepted this honour, it helped in taking the Dalit literature to a national level,” said Limbale.While speaking on the term ‘Dalit’, he said he feels proud to be called as Dalit writer. “The word Dalit does not represent any caste or community but it represents a condition. Even a deprived Brahmin can be a Dalit,” he said, while adding that there is a need to end differences between Dalit and mainstream literature. He also said that there are many differences in Dalit writers and the conflict is killing the spirit of Dalit literature which was strong during the 1960 and 1970s. Limbale is the second Dalit writer in recent times to express such views after Padmashri awardee Namdeo Kamble. In a first event organized physically after Covid crisis, VSS president Manohar Mhaisalkar felicitated Limbale. Vrushali Deshpande and Snehal Shinde coordinated the open house session with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stop-symbolic-opposition-to-upper-caste-dalits-will-get-nothing-out-of-it-limbale/articleshow/85496816.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In a letter dated August 19, N Umadevi, assistant director of panchayats, Coimbatore, said it had come to her attention that some people, who were not appointed by the government, were working with panchayat unions and the public were forced to see them before they could meet elected presidents of panchayats. She said her office too had received several complaints in this regard. Umadevi has made it clear that panchayat union offices shouldn’t have anyone other than panchayat presidents, secretaries, elected representatives, sanitary workers and overhead tank operators. “If someone else is found in the office, strict action will be initiated against the elected representatives under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994.Welcoming the move, activists said it was high time the “representatives” of the elected representatives were done away with and urged officials to focus on the issue routinely, instead of stopping with a communication, as the impact was unlikely to last for a month.S P Thiyagarajan, an activist, said such “representatives” were kept in the office to strike deals with the public and receive bribe on behalf of panchayat staff, who often go scot-free. When contacted, the panchayats department played down the communication. Umadevi said it was a routine communication and not related to any specific issue. The officer said she would often write to the department staff, communicating the instructions received from higher officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/panchayat-officials-to-face-action-if-they-employ-touts/articleshow/85501507.cms||---

However, chief minister Amarinder Singh, while responding to Randhawa's sharp remarks, asked the ministers and party colleagues to "check facts" before making any statement. The HC had on Thursday night ordered the release of Saini, who was arrested on charges of cheating, forgery and corruption among others. He was released from vigilance custody early Friday. A single bench of Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi had pronounced the verdict. Randhawa, the jails minister, also tagged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu in his tweet seeking the removals. Saini was arrested by the state's vigilance bureau on Wednesday night in connection with a case registered in September 2020 for cheating, forgery, corruption and other offences. Reacting to Randhawa's remarks, the CM asked his ministers to discuss issues, especially sensitive ones, with him or at the party platform before going public. Earlier, Randhawa had criticised the CM on the issue of poll promises, including alleged delay in justice in the 2015 sacrilege and post-sacrilege police firing incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rift-in-punjab-cabinet-out-in-the-open-over-ex-dgp-arrest/articleshow/85504454.cms||---

Air quality index of Bhopal on August 1 was 47 that rose to 94 on August 16. In Indore AQI was also 47 on August 1 that went up to 83 on August 16. Track the pollution level in your cityIn Gwalior the AQI was 32 on August 1 that went up to 96 on August 16 while in Jabalpur AQI was 41 on August 1 that rose to 78 on August 16, as per the central pollution control board. Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Officials said the air quality remained best during the showers. Officials said, dust gets heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. The vehicular pollution also gets down as tyres could not lead to flying of pollutants and dust in air, as it settles down on ground. It is the reason why pollution levels come down during rains. Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others. Officials said PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/air-pollution-doubles-in-aug-thanks-to-dry-spell-road-dust/articleshow/85499249.cms||---

The total cost of the project has been estimated at Rs 2,826 crore. Of which, the central and the state governments will be bearing 50% cost each. The Centre has already provided Rs 1,398 crore, while the state has provided Rs 1,169 crore for the project.

Keeping aside their affiliations, the protestors actively participated in the agitation, that was carried out from the Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue to the district collector’s office. They carried large cut-outs resembling railway bogeys with ‘Ushira Express’ written on it, which means a late-running express and raised slogans against the poor political will. Jaiprakash Aghav, the president of YRAC, said the issue of connecting Beed with the railway line has been pending since 1952. During each of the elections, politicians from across the parties have been assuring to fulfil the railway track related promise, but in vain Committee vice president Ganesh Karande said the failure in the laying of the railway track has derailed the development of the district for decades. Committee secretary Sangmeshwar Andhalka and other members including Shaikh Shafique and lawyer Ambadas Aage recalled how foundation stone ceremonies and surveys of the railway work have been carried out more than once in the past few decades.

Gopalakrishna worked for Anham, a company that looked into supplying food for the NATO forces outside Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. He has worked in Afghanistan in different companies, for almost a decade. He told TOI, “I reached home on July 26 after winding up operations. We had an indication that the US may withdraw from the country, by looking at the situation around. We were a bit worried, because we were located right outside the airbase, though we had our own security guards provided by the Afghanistan military. We were trained and briefed on evacuation plans regularly.” Staying in Afghanistan is life-changing, because the region has frequent earthquakes, and living in the war zone is definitely an adventure. “The safety checks were frequently reviewed.

---||Coimbatore||Breach in lower Bhavani canal inundates acres of agri land||Erode: Several acres of agriculture fields in five villages along the lower Bhavani project (LBP) main canal were inundated after the newly-laid concrete lining of the canal suffered damage on Friday.Villagers had noticed water leaking from the canal on Thursday evening, which later turned into a wider crack on the concrete lining. Water began gushing out of the crack, further widening the breach, early on Friday. Public works department Officials visited the spot and alerted their superiors, who stopped water release from Bhavanisagar Dam. It was only on August 15 that water was released from the dam. But by the time water discharge was stopped, a large quantity of water had flowed out of the canal through the breach.Erode collector H Krishnanunni and senior PWD officials visited the spot and ordered immediate plugging of the breach. Villagers living close to the canal were asked to move to safer locations.When an earthmover was pressed into service, the concrete lining gave way, further resulting in the breach getting wider and more water gushing out.In Malaipalayam village, the closest to the canal, knee-deep water entered as many as 50 houses. In four other neighbouring villages including Karaikadu and Varavankadu, water entered coconut groves and inundated paddy fields. Though there was no damage to houses, hens and goats were washed away, said villagers.M Shanmugam, a representative of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, said that a probe should be ordered on the quality of the concrete work on the entire stretch of the canal.The project to concretise the canal was inaugurated along with other development works by Prime Minister Narendra Modi through video conference when he visited Coimbatore in February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/breach-in-lower-bhavani-canal-inundates-acres-of-agri-land/articleshow/85501559.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Fire fighters now wait for inauguration of long-demanded equipment to use them||Ludhiana: Earlier, the fire fighters were waiting for upgraded equipment. And now they are waiting for the spanking new equipment to be “formally inaugurated” before they could use them. But the authorities, when contacted, claimed that there were no such plans for formal inauguration and these can be used anytime. To upgrade the fire department, the civic body had purchased four quick response vehicles, aluminium fire suits, combi tools, live detectors (victim locators) and five inflatable lights under the smart city mission. But sources said these equipment are not being used or even distributed among the fire fighters. The senior officials claimed that they were waiting for a formal inauguration before handing over vehicles and fire suits to fire sub stations. Requesting anonymity, one of the fire officials claimed that aluminium fire suits that are purchased are oversized and it is difficult to fit inside these suits. He said earlier the officials were talking about getting the vehicles registered but now even after registration of vehicles these are still stationed in the central fire station. When contacted, municipal corporation (MC) commissioner cum CEO of smart city mission Pardeep Sabharwal said, “There is no point in inauguration of these vehicles and they can be used anytime. I will ask the officials concerned to look into the matter.” However, regarding oversized fire suits, superintending engineer of MC, Rajinder Singh said, “These suits were available in standard size and were purchased accordingly.” City still waiting for more fire stations There are five fire stations in the city to handle fire incidents, but as city is growing rapidly at least 10 fire stations are required, said experts. For now, the proposal to establish two more fire stations is going on and the sites have been selected at Bahadur K Road and Tajpur Road. No fresh recruitment in fire brigade for a long time With every passing month number of regular fire fighters in fire department is reducing. As per sanctioned posts, a total of 147 officials and firemen are required in the department but 108 posts are filled out of which 35 are regular posts while rest firemen are hired through PESCO. The fire officials claimed that under smart city mission authorities are purchasing devices but manpower is equally important as without firemen they cannot use the devices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fire-fighters-now-wait-for-inauguration-of-long-demanded-equipment-to-use-them/articleshow/85494341.cms||---

The cyber cell of Kolkata Police has arrested the accused — identified as Jayesh Patidar — who allegedly hacked a WhatsApp identity of a Kolkata citizen, used a temporary IP address of Pakistan and duped a businessman worth Rs 6 lakh. Kolkata Police has warned citizens, asking them to be careful of messages received even from close acquaintances. “You must treat your WhatsApp messages with caution,” said a cyber cell officer. Police commissioner Soumen Mitra, in his last crime meeting, has asked his officers to concentrate on busting these fake WhatsApp gangs. This is the second such incident reported in the city in a span of four months. “In this case, the accused posed as father of a child who studies in the same school and class as the victim’s son. He then demanded Rs 6 lakh claiming it was an emergency back home,” claimed an officer. The cops believe Patidar might be involved with organized gangs from Bharatpur. “Either these gangs have advanced technically or it is a separate gang in operation now,” said an officer from the Lalbazar cyber cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-warn-against-rising-whatsapp-fraud/articleshow/85499240.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Coimbatore||Stray dogs unleash terror on streets||Coimbatore: Residents seem to be living in fear of stray dog attack in many parts of the city. Some people, who spoke to TOI, said they were afraid to go for both morning and evening walks, and ride on two-wheelers at night, as stray dogs come running towards them with incessant barking. The unchecked growth of stray dogs on the city streets is to be blamed for the present scenario. Abdul Rashid, a resident of New Rose Garden, said stray dogs were posing a real threat to them. In his locality, a stray dog had chased a boy and bitten him recently, instilling fear among the children. “We had made several representations to the city corporation to address the increasing stray dog menace, but officials haven’t done anything so far. Lots of dogs could be seen on the streets at any given point of time,” he said.Malarvizhi J, a resident of VG Rao Nagar near Ganapathy, said stray dogs chasing motorists was a common sight in her locality. “The dogs are not a threat to the residents, but they go after strangers, especially motorists. However, we can’t stand their barking and howling at night, as that deprives us of sound sleep.” The dogs mainly feed on the garbage that residents dump in roadside bins. While some residents used to feed them initially, they have stopped the same as the number of stray dogs has increased. “They start fighting with each other when we try to feed them,” said a resident. G Lakshmi, another resident of VG Rao Nagar, said the stray dog menace could be brought down significantly by clearing garbage bins regularly. “Dogs could be seen near the bins most of the time, looking for food.” A health official with the civic body said they hadn’t carried out animal birth control programmes in the past couple of years because of the new rule that allows only licensed NGOs to do the process. “We have two sterilisation centres, one at Ondipudur and another at Seeranaickenpalayam. Only one NGO has come forward to take up sterilisation so far. We are looking for one more NGO to run the animal birth control programme. We are hopeful of bringing down the numbers in a few months. Meanwhile, a study to enumerate the stray dog count will be carried out,” the official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/stray-dogs-unleash-terror-on-streets/articleshow/85501543.cms||V Devanathan

Khatik, who arrived in the state capital on Friday morning with the Jan Ashirwad Yatra, sought blessings of the public and met members of social and cultural organisations during his daylong tour. “Rising inflation is a global problem.

On the purpose of his yatra, the Union minister said that it was aimed at reaching out to people and seeking their blessings. Khatik said as a tradition, the Prime Minister tried to introduce the newly-inducted ministers in Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha after cabinet reshuffle, but the opposition did now allow and created ruckus in the Parliament. The party then decided to send these ministers to the meet the public on Jan Ashirwad Yatra in their respective states. “Prime Minister Modi works for the upliftment of poor and marginalised classes. The Congress never allowed implementation of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission. It was BJP that played an important role in giving constitutional status to the OBC Commission," he said. Khatik also highlighted the welfare schemes launched by the Centre and the achievements during last seven years of the NDA government. Three union ministers of NDA government, Khatik, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Satya Pal Singh Baghel have embarked upon the Jan AShirwad Yatra in Madhya Pradesh from August 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/centre-trying-to-address-rising-inflation-union-min/articleshow/85499277.cms||---

But in some of the wards excess lights have been counted so we are counting again. Moreover, there is shortage of manpower so it is taking time.” He also said in some of the wards the LED street lights have been stolen.

But one year down the line, it has failed to reach students.Absence of physical classes and reluctance on the part of teachers to take up the additional subject became a bottleneck that prevented the subject from reaching students in an effective manner.The new course was a project initiated by former higher education secretary S Apoorva. The Professional English book was taught to students of all four streams – Physical Science, Life Science, Arts and Social Science, and Commerce and Management. The Tamil Nadu State Council for Higher Education (TANSCHE) prepared the new syllabus and came up with the learning material after several rounds of consultation with experts.The new subject is being taught as an additional one hour a day as an add-on paper on par with the major paper. Completion of the subject is mandatory for students to continue higher studies. But there wasn’t much support for the programme from faculty members. “The new subject has come as an additional workload in the midst of existing work,” said an assistant professor of a government arts college here. “What is the logic behind making Computer Science teachers like me teach English?”The objective of making subject teachers to teach Professional English was to make them enhance their English language proficiency, said a senior faculty member of Bharathiar University, who was part of implementing the subject in colleges here. “Several teachers were given training to handle the subject. But We received poor response from students, which shows that it has not reached them properly. Teachers need to be ready to walk the extra mile to take the subject to students,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/students-of-arts-science-colleges-fail-to-warm-up-to-professional-english/articleshow/85501602.cms||Sampath Kumar

A case of murder was registered against unknown persons at Pernem police station. “It was found during investigation that the case was completely blind, and the only clue was that of a CCTV video showing that the deceased gave a lift on his two-wheeler to an unknown, unidentified person,” said North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena. Several teams were formed to scour through the area for clues, and also to collect CCTV footage and question suspicious persons. After intensive analysis of technical and human intelligence, a suspect was traced in Amrawati, Maharashtra. Immediately, an interstate operation was initiated by a joint team of North Goa police and crime branch led by PIs Rahul Parab and Lakshy Amonkar. Finally, on conclusion of a 48-hour-long interstate operation, the main accused identified as Gosai was apprehended in Ahmedabad. “Upon interrogation, Gosai revealed that he had come to Goa in June 2021,” Saxena said. “When he ran out of money, he decided to return to Ahmedabad, and while on his way back, he had asked for a lift from the deceased near Patradevi. Upon seeing his gold chain, he was tempted to rob it and in order to rob it, he stabbed the accused and fled with his valuables.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cops-arrest-ahmedabad-local-say-he-killed-man-for-gold-chain/articleshow/85501707.cms||---

The chief minister was speaking to the media on the present flood situation in the state, when he fired a salvo at the veteran Congress leader. PCC media cell general secretary KK Mishra replied to Chouhan’s claim and said, “Shivraj ji, it will be the misfortune of Kamal Nath ji if you advise him not to do politics on twitter. How grounded you are, was proved by the people in 2018. He (Kamal Nath) did not run the government on false promises. We are unfortunate that you are today the chief of a forced government. Wait for 2023.” Mishra was referring to the BJP’s defeat in the 2018 assembly elections and the party’s formation of government again in 2020. The next assembly election is in 2023. Chouhan on Friday morning accused the Congress party of playing politics over every issue. “Congress does politics over floods. Whether floods or development, for them every issue centres around politics,” the chief minister accused. “I used to visit flood affected areas even when I was not chief minister,” he said. Launching an attack on former chief minister Kamal Nath, he said, “My friend Kamal Nath ji had visited the flood affected areas, but he did not venture to meet the flood affected persons. He stands on the tarmac and would review the situation from there.” The chief minister further alleged that PCC chief Kamal Nath posts one tweet every morning. “Early in the morning, he posts one tweet. What can be easier politics than that? He won’t visit any place, just post one tweet in the morning. He doesn’t see that during his regime, no one visited Mandsaur for an entire week. Not even a minister of state.” Mandsaur was in the grip of floods in August 2019. Chouhan claimed that former chief minister reached Mandsaur after Chouhan sat on protest there after the floods. “The compensation announced by the Congress government was not paid and they are accusing me of not giving financial aid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nath-did-not-run-govt-on-false-promises-cong/articleshow/85499336.cms||---

The Mumbai police commissionerate that owns 2,900 tenements in the BDD chawls stands to lose 1,800 of them on redevelopment due to a decision to allow families of policemen occupying the bulk of the service quarters to get permanent ownership after redevelopment. After redevelopment, 1,800 tenements occupied by families of policemen in service, retired or staying on on compassionate grounds since January 1, 2011 shall be entitled to 500 sq feet flats, provided they pay the construction cost. For the rest, Mumbai police will be compensated with flats meant for Project Affected Persons in various parts of the city wherever made available by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. These flats are 300 sq feet carpet area in size as against the 500 sq feet BDD flats. “For seven years the project has been stalled as no decision was taken on the status of these families. We want the project to be implemented and hence we took this decision,” said housing minister Jitendra Awhad defending the move to give service quarters as permanent housing to families of police personnel. Awhad said there were families of policemen residing here for generations and whose male members have successively served in the police force. The Government Resolution says the decision will be informed to the Bombay high court where these families have filed two petitions. Activist Salil Rameshchandra said it is a big giveaway and would set a unhealthy precedent. “Government employees living in quarters in Bandra East have for long been demanding the quarters be converted into ownership flats. The tenure of an officer in a post is for three years and then they are transferred, hence these are service quarters. …in Mumbai, housing is a huge issue. What happens to serving officials?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-to-own-bdd-service-quarters-under-new-rule/articleshow/85503220.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Lucknow||‘We always fight on issues, hope BJP will address Nishad quota demand’||With UP Assembly elections just a few months away, all parties have intensified efforts to woo the Nishad (boatmen) community which forms a sizable chunk of population in east UP. Sanjay Nishad, president of the Nishad Party, which is in alliance with the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, was recently in news for his tough stance when the community did not get representation in the Modi cabinet expansion. Nishad has softened his stand after meeting Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda in Delhi on August 14. In an interview to Rajiv Srivastava, Nishad spoke on the party’s plans in view of elections and his ties with the BJP. Excerpts: Do you deliberately make efforts to stay in news or it just happens? Anyone who has an office, funds and workers can join politics. When you stay in the news, only then you can manage funds. Nishads have a history of being the talk of the town. They also contributed to the freedom struggle. When Nishad Raj helped Lord Ram in crossing the river, he became popular. There were talks that you wanted to be deputy chief minister. Is it true? The suggestion came from the Nishad community and there is nothing wrong in it. Without political power, no battle can be fought. If we have a party, its leader has to be strong. You have been talking about reservation for Nishads for ages. You managed a Lok Sabha seat for your son Pravin Nishad on SP ticket in 2018 bypolls. Again in the 2019 elections, you managed a BJP ticket for him. Now when the elections are round the corner, you are talking about reservation. There is a lot of difference between then and now. Currently, we are discussing the issue with BJP’s top leadership. There is hope with the BJP. Previous governments gave us pain, I am now asking for treatment. Will BJP agree to your demand before the 2022 elections? Reservation for Nishads was on BJP’s agenda. Now they feel that not doing so would harm them politically. This is what we discussed with the top leadership. BJP has two more tasks at hand – nominate four MLCs and go for a cabinet expansion in UP. Which one is your preference? It is BJP’s subject. They will decide. Will you be happy with an MLC seat or ministerial berth? We have never fought for a seat. We have always fought on issues. You ensured Lok Sabha seat for your son with the help of SP and then the BJP, and now you say you don’t run after the seat. In Praveen Nishad, Nishad Party has an advocate who can raise the problems faced by the community. We need such advocates. Our workers have supported the Nishad Party in every way they could in the last seven years. They expect us to be in the House. So many senior BJP leaders had talks with you. What did they discuss? They have promised to do whatever they can to keep Nishad party workers happy. They have said whatever happens in future, Nishad Party’s participation will be ensured. You were very upset when your party was not given representation in the Union cabinet. Where has the anger gone? Our community will get back everything with interest. All top leaders sat to discuss the issue of reservation. Are you ready to wait till 2022? Who knows, we may get a ministerial berth before the 2022 elections. They have promised to look into all our issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-always-fight-on-issues-hope-bjp-will-address-nishad-quota-demand/articleshow/85503135.cms||---

In a fresh development, Gathwala, a prominent khap of the region, is experiencing a vertical ideological split between Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) and BJP. One faction of the khap supports BKU chief Naresh Tikait while the other group is tilted in its opinion towards the BJP. On Saturday, Malik’s motorcade was attacked in Sisauli village, the BKU’s bastion and the native village of the Tikait brothers. After the incident, Malik and his supporters had approached police and submitted a complaint against BKU workers. Later, Union minister Sanjeev Balyan also visited the Bhorakalan police station, following which a case was registered and several farmers were booked. A day later, Naresh Tikait, who is also the chief of Balyan khap, told the Union minister to “sort out the issue and take back the case”. “Otherwise Balyan will not be able to enter Muzaffarnaar district,” Tikait had said as the leader of the Balyan khap. Following this, Gathwala khap chief Rajendra Malik came out in support of Balyan and Umesh Malik. “On Tuesday, a meeting was called to condemn Naresh Tikait’s statement. We have decided that members of Gathwala khap won't go on the BKU dharna being held on Gazipur border and we will also boycott the upcoming mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on September 5,” Malik said. This led to a split in the ranks of the Gathwala khap. The khap’s other leaders called a meeting on Wednesday in favour of BKU in Shamli district. Naresh Tikait was also called in the meeting. Baba Shyam Singh, another leader of Gathwala khap, said, “Every man who belongs to this khap will join the mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/khap-leaders-call-for-support-to-bjp-leads-to-split-in-ranks/articleshow/85491000.cms||Mohd Dilshad

In videos that have by now been circulated the world over, shocked men and women on the ground can be heard sending out a prayer to god. Ajay Chettri from Dehradun was one of them. He witnessed the nightmare unfold right in front of his eyes. Chhetri, a former Armyman who was evacuated from Afghanistan on August 17 on an Indian Air Force (IAF) plane, told TOI on Friday that he is still traumatised by what he saw at the Kabul airport as he frantically scurried to leave the city that was his home for over a decade. On August 16, after the Taliban’s capture of Afghanistan’s capital, Chhetri, who worked as a security officer there, had "packed up his life" in Kabul and like hundreds of others reached the airport. “I was at the military airbase which is next to the airport when I heard gunshots. Bullets were flying all around. It was complete chaos. But that wasn’t the worst part,” said Chhetri, now in Dehradun with his family.

Vishal Fireworks, which runs the factory, had filed the review petition. The NGT had acted on a new report about the ‘blast’ in the fire cracker unit. On June 25, the NGT had issued advance notice to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), district magistrate, Palghar, and director of industrial safety and health, apart from the review petitioner. The reports of the authorities established that safety norms and rules were flouted in operation of the unit and the injured were entitled to compensation, the NGT had said. The NGT had held the industry was liable to pay compensation. The NGT’s June order said, “The compensation for victims has to be on the same scale i.e. Rs 15 lakhs to persons who have burns in excess of 50%, Rs 10 lakhs for persons who have burns from 25 to 50%, Rs 5 lakhs for persons who have injuries between 5 to 25%. and Rs 2 lakhs to victims who were treated as outpatients and who had minor degree of burns or other forms of simple injuries.” The NGT had ordered that the payout initially be done by the state within a month, and the government will be at liberty to recover it from the occupier or owner of the premises. The tribunal had also directed a review and study by the director of industrial safety with MPCB and CPCB in three months for remedial steps and to ensure there is no repeat of such accidents in future. “Hazardous activities need to be regulated in terms of quantity of material to be used in the process of hazardous activities, number of persons to be allowed to work and safeguards to be followed and monitoring compliance of such safeguards. Apart from the measures suggested by the Committee, there is also need for a study of the potential for accidental, occupational and environmental hazards from such activities in the State,” said the NGT bench headed by Justice A K Goel and comprising Justices Sudhir Agarwal and Brijesh Sethi, with Dr Nagin Nanda as technical member, quoting from the previous order. The NGT had also said MPCB may prohibit banned chemicals and include insurance policy for workers likely to be affected by fire and ensure a proper compliance mechanism. Vishal Fireworks said it was unable to file its response or participate in the June 25 hearing. But NGT noted, “Facts on the basis of which the tribunal proceeded have not been disputed.” “No ground has been stated which may call for review,” said NGT and dismissed the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ngt-rejects-review-plea-on-its-relief-order-in-palghar-fire-case/articleshow/85503619.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Bhopal||Schools shut, kids may miss personality milestones||BHOPAL: Schoolchildren are losing their personality due to closed schools. Experts said that this is not good for them. Notably, former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has also recently warned that any further delay in reopening schools and getting children back up to speed with their education could haunt the country for decades to come. Experts said that keeping away children has snatched several important personality developments among kids. “Schools are not just meant for academics only. It helps children in developing their overall personality development,” said senior psychiatrist Dr Satyakant Trivedi. He added that children learn several important things like discipline, proper behaviour, friendship, decision making and such others. “Online classes are limited to academics only. In the absence of the schools, students are not able to learn various behavioural things which is dangerous. If we keep the campuses closed for another year a full generation will miss a lot that is not good for their future,” Dr Trivedi warned. He added that several students have reported behavioural changes. “I have been receiving several calls daily from the parents. Their common complaints have been that their children are not listening to them and their focus has also distracted. This is because students are doing only one thing and that is online classes. Attending schools have become a must for them to bring change in their life,” suggested Dr Trivedi. He suggested that the state government should start thinking about opening schools. Even school owners feel that keeping schools closed was not in the favour of the students. “Students are going from one to another with only a school marksheet. They have no school friends around. No school memories to share with their families. This is very dangerous for their personality also,” said Vinny Raj Modi, vice-president, MP association of unaided private schools. Notably, students are also shifting towards several online games in the absence of the schools. “This is not a good trend. We need to open schools at the earliest,” said Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/closure-of-schools-affecting-kids-personality-experts/articleshow/85499456.cms||---

However, in terms of population coverage, about 15% of the total population of Gujarat has received both doses, compared to 11.5% in Maharashtra, putting the state in first position in per million vaccinations of both doses. Analysis of the trend also reveals that 21% of eligible population (4.93 crore) of Gujarat have got fully vaccinated (1.03 crore), whereas 65% (3.19 crore) have got the first dose. Out of the total vaccination (4.22 crore), 24.6% or about one-fourth of vaccinations took place just in four cities – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. In fact, out of every 100 persons vaccinated in Gujarat, 10 were from Ahmedabad city and 8 from Surat city. In terms of coverage, 80% of eligible Ahmedabad residents and 78% Surat residents have at least got the first dose of vaccine. The progress in some districts however is slow. Coverage of first dose is 39% in Dang, 52% in Chhota Udepur, 56% in Tapi, and 59% in Botad among others. While Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, could not be contacted, the state health department officials said that they have roped in local leaders and community members to mobilize population for inoculation. “It’s the best period for Gujarat to boost vaccination when the cases are relatively lower and some districts have zero active cases. While the cities are better covered, need of the hour is to popularize vaccination among villages by dispelling myths and motivating prominent social persons to get vaccinated to set example,” said a city-based public health expert. “Full vaccination will play a pivotal role in protecting population for possible third wave.” Among the total vaccinated in Gujarat, the 18-45 years population now accounts for 48% of the total vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/21-of-adults-in-gujarat-got-both-jabs/articleshow/85499513.cms||Parth Shastri

Residents said they have complained numerous times but their complaints have not been acted upon. The street lights between The Doon School and Bindal police outpost have been defunct for weeks, posing a major threat to commuters at night. Around a week back, a family passing the stretch in a car met with an accident in the dark. Sunil Goel, a resident of the area, said, “There shouldn’t be dark spots on any roads, especially at crucial points. A major accident is imminent if the lights aren’t repaired soon.” Local shopkeeper Surendra Bijalwan said, “The road is hardly visible at night. The situation gets worse after rain. I see several motorists losing balance while passing through the stretch. Authorities must make commutes safer and fix the lights at the earliest.” It’s the same situation in Johri village, Jakhan, where more than 30 street lights are out of order and repair work has not been started despite complaints. SP Sharma, a resident, said “We lodged a complaint with the CM helpline but nothing came of it. Travelling at night, especially after rains, is not safe in the city.”  Dehradun Municipal Corporation officials told TOI that they have received the complaints and the defunct street lights will be “repaired or replaced soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/defunct-street-lights-cause-accidents-rains-make-it-worse/articleshow/85497110.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The police team, led by Rani Talab police station SHO Vimlesh Kumar Paswan, was attacked during raids on receiving information about illegal sand mining and its transportation from Sone river. Police later raided the hamlet and recovered a large amount of smuggled liquor from the houses of the two accused. The river flows hardly a kilometre away from the spot where the raiding team had come under attack, police said. Besides the SHO, the other injured police personnel are assistant sub-inspector Naresh Kumar, constables Kishun Dev, Jitendra Prasad Yadav and Tarkeshwar Singh, special auxiliary police (driver) Umendra Singh and chowkidar Hridayanand. The police team was first pelted heavily with stones when they intercepted a tractor loaded with illegally mined sand from Sone river. The sand smugglers, which included women, from the hamlet gathered and assaulted the raiding team with stones, sticks and rods. On getting information, senior officers rushed reinforcements from the neighbouring police stations at Paliganj, Bikram and Dulhin Bazaar to the spot. Paliganj SPDO Ajay Kumar also reached the spot. The Rani Talab SHO said Mithilesh Yadav, Sadhu Yadav and at least a dozen others from Berar were evading arrest. “They pelted stones and attacked us with rods. Mithilesh was with the tractor. He is accused in another case of sand smuggling and attacking policemen. He was presently on bail,” Paswan said. The SHO said when they stopped the sand-laden tractor, its occupants first started pelting stones and bricks lying near the spot. “Raids were conducted on the houses of Mithilesh, Sadhu and several others in the village. Large quantities of IMFL and countrymade liquor were recovered from the duo’s residences,” he said. Paswan said additional force has been deployed in the village. An FIR has been lodged against all the attackers. The state government has been trying hard to stop illegal sand mining and smuggling. Two IPS officers and several other officers had recently been suspended for their alleged nexus with sand smugglers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sand-smugglers-attack-rani-talab-police-team/articleshow/85498722.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Ahmedabad||‘Praying for safety of Afghan friends’||AHMEDABAD: For Dr Kranti Vora, associate professor at the IIPH Gandhinagar, the lingering memories of Afghanistan are vast plains in the shadows of towering mountains, friendly locals and ‘delicious fruits.’ As she made several friends during her short trips to the country as a public health expert in 2017 and 2018, the first thing she did after getting to know about the takeover of the country by Taliban was to check on them. “Thankfully most of them responded, and said that they were safe. While women have still not started work, the male health workers had resumed duties. I wanted them to know that they were not alone in prayers for normalcy,” she said. Her work took her to various provinces of Afghanistan such as Kandahar and Bamyan for capacity-building projects. The participants were primarily doctors and healthcare workers who earlier came to India for short-term course in public health – primarily focusing on reproductive and child health and data analysis. “We travelled in armoured vehicles and got a few opportunities – like one in Bamyan – to visit the markets. But the people were very friendly, children so beautiful and landscape breathtaking. People had great respect for India,” said Dr Vora. The shadow of Taliban was still present in some of the provinces, and thus the team motivated the locals to devise their own strategies suitable for specific areas. The engagement was fruitful, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/praying-for-safety-of-afghan-friends/articleshow/85499543.cms||Parth Shastri

The accused had merged two images including his and the impersonator using photoshop to mislead the examiner. However, to his bad luck, during the exam his biometric did not match with that in the application form, but the candidate was given a chance by the invigilators who did not rule out the possibility of a technical glitch. But, during the medical checkup in 3rd Battalion Bhilai, he was caught. Complainant SI Vishal Kumar, who was posted as vigilance inspector at CISF Bhopal told TOI that the exams were conducted in March 2021. Dharmveer, a resident of Gwalior, filled the job form, but sent another youth named Ambrish, a resident of Morena to appear in the exam on his behalf. The examiner found Ambrish’s biometric was different from the submitted biometric, but they gave him a chance to appear in the exam and kept his biometrics for investigation. He was also video graphed as it was a suspected case.SI Kumar further added that during the medical checkup of Dharmveer in Bhilai’s third battalion it was found that his biometric and candidate, who appeared in exam were different.  Then his video footage from exam centre were checked and for verification and he was caught and the two were different. The accused was handed over to Govindpura police and a case of fraud and criminal conspiracy was registered against him on Thursday, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/youth-uses-impersonator-in-cisf-cop-exam-caught/articleshow/85499542.cms||---

According to the MoU, the SLRE Foundation would develop various amenities for tourists and visitors at the heritage site. These include construction of roads, installation of street lights, garbage disposal system, availability of clean drinking water, development of a parking area and facelift of the entrance and boundary walls around the temple complex. Earlier this year, the site had been identified for the tourism ministry's Adopt a Heritage project. Uttarakhand tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said, “Adopt a Heritage project is helping ancient monuments, archaeological sites, temples to regain its lost glory. The development of facilities will have a direct impact on increasing the number of visitors and creating jobs for local youths. Gartang Gali, Pithoragarh Fort, Chaysheel Bugyal, Chaurasi Kutiya, Sati Ghat, Narayankoti temple have been identified as the state's important heritage sites.” Narayankoti is a group of ancient temples, about 2 km from Guptkashi on the Rudraprayag-Gaurikund highway.

---||Ahmedabad||Pull, cover, forget: NIDian designs bike blanket out of parachute fabric, strings||AHMEDABAD: What’s the biggest hurdle for two-wheeler owners when it comes to covering the vehicle? Carrying the plastic, unfolding it to cover the vehicle and again folding it for the next usage. But what if it can be attached to the vehicle itself and folded or unfolded in less than a minute? This was the idea that struck Adarsh Maradiya, a second-year product design student at National Institute of Design, and took the shape of his final project ‘Pull It’. The concept consists of a metal box with parachute fabric and two strings. “India has a large number of two-wheelers. The owners face issues ranging from bird poop to people sitting on it when parked. But covering it all the time is cumbersome. So, no one bothers to do it as much as they do it for cars,” said Maradiya, a resident of Ahmedabad. “I figured out that time, space and look were the main constraints.” He devised a mechanism where the user pulls the cloth out and fixes it on two wheels with two hooks. When the strings are pulled back, the cloth folds into the box in seconds. The box is compact and can be attached to or detached from the back of a bike in a jiffy. The user can pull the cloth out of the box and fix it on the wheels with hooksMost importantly, said Maradiya, the cost would be very less due to the absence of moving parts and easy availability of raw material. NID faculty members that guided him have encouraged him to undergo product incubation due to its practical design and possible market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pull-cover-forget-nidian-designs-bike-blanket-out-of-parachute-fabric-strings/articleshow/85499637.cms||Parth Shastri

The number of daily fresh cases was 57 with a positivity rate of 0.08%, states the health department. Earlier, on July 18, 24 and 29, and August 2, 4, 8, 11-13 and 16, no death due to Covid-19 was reported, according to the official data. On March 2, Delhi had reported zero death due to the virus and the number of single-day infections stood at 217 with a positivity rate of 0.33%. Then the second wave swept the city during April-May. Both the fresh cases and the positivity rate on Friday were slightly higher than Thursday’s figures when new cases stood at 25 with a positivity rate of 0.04%. Two deaths were reported. Thursday’s new case count was the lowest since April 15 last year, according to the official data. On Wednesday, the city registered 36 cases and four fatalities, while the positivity rate stood at 0.05%. On Tuesday, the counts were 38 cases and four deaths, while the positivity rate was 0.07%. The infection rate, which had reached 36% in the last week of April, has come down to 0.08%. On February 16, 94 people were diagnosed Covid-positive while the daily tally was 96 on January 27.Despite the dip, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal recently cautioned that the chances of a third wave were quite real. He also asserted that his government was preparing on a “war footing” to combat it. Delhi had battled a brutal second wave that also swept the country, claiming a massive number of lives daily. A severe oxygen crisis at most city hospitals only added to the woes. Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had spiralled up, with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20. Two days later, the city recorded 306 fatalities. On May 3, Delhi registered a record 448 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-covid-deaths-in-last-24-hours-but-57-fresh-cases-positivity-rate-at-0-08/articleshow/85497287.cms||---

This means every second eligible person above 18 years of age has taken the two-dose vaccine course. District’s adult population is around 36 lakh. Of these, 18.09 lakh persons have been administered at least a dose so far. TimesViewThe milestone achieved in covid vaccinations will boost confidence of the people, but we should not be overconfident and allow complacency to set in. In fact, it's a crucial phase where covid appropriate behaviour is required more than ever. Any mutation of virus in a vaccinated person may prove detrimental to the efforts done so far.However, overall, only 16% (5.9 lakh) of the adult population are fully immunised with two doses, while 12.1 lakh have received a shot and are waiting for the second dose. This also means that about 18 lakh have not taken any dose so far. Health department officials said there is nothing to worry as of now because the vaccination campaign is going on in full swing. Besides, in the recent serological survey, antibodies have been found in 55-60% of the adult population of the state capital. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said, “As nearly 50% of the population has got inoculated with at least a dose and a large number of people have natural antibodies, we are well equipped to tackle probable third wave of Covid-19.” However, further he said that everyone must continue to follow Covid control protocols. A government epidemiologist emphasised on covid appropriate behaviour. “Once a virus enters into a vaccinated host it’s attacked by antibodies. Antibodies neutralize most of the copies of the virus. However, during the fight against the immune system virus evolves and becomes stronger. If this stronger variant finds a new unvaccinated host it might be fatal,” he said. “Vaccination can reduce mortality by providing protection against critical illness, but cannot stop a person from contracting infection. Therefore, like all the passengers coming on air are being tested, travelers coming to the city through bus, train or private vehicles from high case load areas must be tested through RT PCR test,” he recommended. Ex-head microbiology department Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU, Dr Anil Kumar Gulati said, “Cases are rising in the United States and other European countries despite the fact that a large section of the population there has been fully vaccinated. Recently, a woman died due to delta plus variant in Maharashtra. Therefore, we cannot let our guard drop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/over-50-in-city-have-taken-at-least-one-dose-of-vaccine/articleshow/85501887.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Consequently, activities related to bootlegging have also come down in the nine central districts. According to a police statement, central zone police led by inspector general of police (IGP) V Balakrishnan identified 299 villages as black spots in the nine districts – Trichy rural, Pudukottai, Karur, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagappattinam and Mayiladuthurai where liquor-related offences were rampant. Trichy topped the list with 80 black spot villages followed by Ariyalur with 73, Tiruvarur 30, Karur 29, Perambalur 26, Mayiladuthurai 20, Nagappattinam 19, Pudukkottai 15 and Thanjavur seven. The closure of state-run Tasmac shops during the first and second wave of Covid-19 for months paved the way for the return of illicit liquor brewing at several places. The police seized materials for brewing several thousand litres and the offenders were booked under The Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937. Sensing that the trend was worrying, central zone police prepared the list of notorious villages through prohibition and enforcement wing (PEW) and the local police. Officials said many took up the illegal brewing of liquor for livelihood. Hence the police devised a strategy to create awareness among them about the legal complications. The police department in coordination with the respective district administrations also rehabilitated over 50 people by providing them job opportunities and loans for self-employment. The list of their children who were deprived of education was also being prepared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/illicit-liquor-brewing-checked-in-over-200-villages-say-cops/articleshow/85499639.cms||---
---||India||Monitor glacier movement to save lives: Parliament panel to government||NEW DELHI: Noting the impact of climate change on glacier movement in the Indian Himalayan region, a parliamentary panel has asked the government to take suitable steps such as constant monitoring through setting up early warning systems and various adaptation measures to save lives and properties from disastrous consequences of global warming in future. The panel, standing committee on water resources, suggested that the government must make concerted efforts to set up and widen the network of high altitude meteorological and discharge stations equipped with modern technology including ‘synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to automatically detect changes in water bodies, including new lake formations, glaciers, glacial lakes and watersheds in the region. The panel's report, tabled in the Parliament early this month, assumes significance in view of the recent report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that projected how snow-covered areas and snow volumes will decrease in the Himalayan region during the 21st century due to rising global average temperature, leading to extreme weather events and disruption in the water cycle. “Rising temperature and precipitation can increase the occurrence of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and landslides over moraine-dammed lakes,” said the IPCC in its report on August 9, predicting that the snowline elevations will rise and glacier mass is likely to decline, causing disastrous events in the region. India had, in fact, witnessed such tragedy on February 7 when an avalanche in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand led to a flash flood, causing deaths of over 100 people and damage to an under-construction power plant. In the backdrop of such risk in the Himalayan region, the parliamentary committee, headed by BJP Lok Sabha MP Sanjay Jaiswal, noted that the disasters such as flash floods, GLOFs and landslides are “expected to become more common in the future due to climate change”. “In general, glaciers have been rapidly melting and retreating resulting in the formation of a number of moraine-dammed glacial lakes, posing numerous threats particularly to the population and infrastructure located nearby due to their outbursts,” said the panel while suggesting different agencies to work in collaboration on glacial management. In India, glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region are a crucial water supply for 86 million people who live in the region. Glaciers such as in the Lahaul-Spiti region of western Himalaya have been losing mass since the start of the 21st century, and if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions do not fall, glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalaya would decline by two-thirds. The IPCC report notes that human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and almost all of the world’s glaciers, including Himalayan ones, have retreated since the 1950s in an unprecedented manner. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/monitor-glacier-movement-to-save-lives-parliament-panel-to-government/articleshow/85504685.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Finally, as Akshay Kumar-starrer ‘Bell Bottom’ was released across cinema halls across the city this week, multiplexes and cinema halls across Ahmedabad saw a drastic improvement in footfalls. Cinema halls, which saw less than 10% footfalls since they opened after the restrictions were lifted, the footfalls increased to at least one-third over the past two days. “Against less than 100 tickets sold the day after reopening, the new release has worked really well to bring people back to multiplexes. We sold some 400 tickets on Thursday alone and the bookings are looking good for the weekend. If good movies continue to release, we will fare much better,” said Manubhai Patel, president, Gujarat Multiplex Owners’ Association who also runs a multiplex in Ahmedabad. Another multiplex owner from Ahmedabad, Bharat Murali, also said that the business has remained good of late thanks to the new release. “We had not opened till two days ago because people do not come to watch old films and it only adds to our cost of operations. However, with the latest Bollywood release, the response we got was good and we were near-fully booked in accordance with Covid-19 guidelines and with the festive weekend coming up, we are expecting more footfalls,” Murali told TOI. Multiplex owners are hopeful of a good weekend and claim that if new movies continue to release, and Covid cases remain under control, there is a huge chance of revival in business. “The next 2-3 months are the ones to watch out for. If Covid-19 cases continue to remain under control this way and new movies keep releasing under popular banners, people will come back to theatres. Watching movies in a theatre is a different experience and people want that after bingeing on films at home over the past 17 months,” said another multiplex owner from Ahmedabad. Multiplexes were among the worst hit in terms of business as their revenue streams had dried up and most were compelled to conditionally let go of their staffers to cut down on operational overheads and be able to run business smoothly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-release-reels-in-amdavadis-to-theatres/articleshow/85499685.cms||Niyati Parikh

Battered roads have made commuting a nightmare for Bhopalis and TOI has repeatedly highlighted this. On Friday, the CM convened a meeting to discuss the pothole-riddled roads of Bhopal and demanded answers for why roads are in such a terrible condition, say sources. When divisional commissioner Kavindra Kiyawat tried to explain that the stretches dug up for laying sewage lines could not be restored due to the rains, the CM pointed out that it should have been done before the monsoon. Restoration must be simultaneous, he said. ‘Why no coordination among agencies?’Restoration work goes simultaneously with excavation. You dig up and restore a stretch before going ahead with excavation elsewhere,” the chief minister is heard telling officials in a video that has gone viral. “Why is there no planning, no coordination among agencies?” Chouhan asked. Asking PWD principal secretary Neeraj Mandloi to take responsibility for repairing roads, Chouhan sought to know which agencies are responsible for road maintenance. Mandloi reeled off the names -- PWD, CPA, BDA and BMC. “Why are there so many agencies?” the CM asked. When Mandloi replied that they have traditionally been doing the job, Chouhan said, “Don’t stick to tradition anymore. CPA has no business to be in existence. It is scrapped with immediate effect.” Chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, district collector Avinash Lavania and BMC commissioner KVS Chaudhary were also present in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/angry-over-craters-on-bhopal-roads-shivraj-scraps-cpa/articleshow/85499676.cms||---

He was received by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and the party's state president Madan Kaushik. Nadda reached Haridwar in the afternoon and first met with party leaders and district presidents and later the MPs and MLAs. His day's final meeting was with the members of the state cabinet. Providing a victory mantra of “booth jeeta, chunav jeeta [win the booth to win the poll]“, Nadda reviewed the party's organisational work from the state to the booth level and discussed ways to strengthen it. “A state official should take charge of a district, a district official should be appointed in-charge of a mandal, a mandal office-bearer should hold a shakti kendra's charge and a shakti kendra official should be responsible for a booth to rejuvenate the entire party structure,” Nadda said. Motivating the party workers, he advised the respective organisational heads at various levels to regularly visit the areas allotted to them once in a fortnight. During the visits, they should hold meetings with frontal organisations and party affiliates and also interact with members of the Sangh Vichar Pariwar, including the RSS, he added. Nadda told the party MPs and MLAs to live up to the peoples’ expectations, ensure completion of pending projects in their constituencies in the next three months and build a positive image of the party. He took particular interest in people-based welfare schemes and projects launched by the state's different departments, sources who attended the interactions told TOI. Nadda also told BJP leaders to carry forward the message of how the party workers reached the people during the second Covid wave when "other political parties stayed away".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nadda-arrives-in-uttarakhand-to-review-poll-preps/articleshow/85497319.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

---||Bhopal||Grandparents fight off leopard, snatch toddler from its jaws in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: A couple in Madhya Pradesh fought off a leopard to save their two-year-old granddaughter in a village close to Kuno National Park on Thursday night, literally pulling the baby from its jaws. The leopard had sneaked into the backyard of their house where they were sleeping on the floor. Around midnight, 50-year-old Basanti Bai Gurjar woke up to the wails of Bobby, who was sleeping by her side. She was horrified to see the toddler’s right foot in the jaws of a leopard, which was dragging her away. In reflex, she kicked the leopard even before an involuntary scream escaped her throat. And went on kicking. The leopard wouldn’t let go. Basanti’s husband, 55-year-old Jai Singh Gurjar, woke up to the screams of his wife and grandchild and the growling of the leopard. “I kicked it with all my strength,” he said. The couple grabbed Bobby and tried pulling her out of the leopard’s mouth, while kicking the animal in the nose and eyes. The big cat let go of the toddler but turned on the couple, biting and slashing them. Leopard attack: Forest dept increases security detail in areaBoth Basanti and Jai Singh were injured in their legs, but kept fighting the leopard till neighbours came running, armed with sticks. The leopard scampered back into the forest. The village, Dhura in Karhal block, is barely 8km from Kuno National Park, which is the proposed site for the cheetah translocation project. When people living in the vicinity of the park heard that they would have cheetahs for neighbours, they began objecting, fearing that they would attack humans, like leopards do. Forest officials spent weeks convincing them that there is no danger of that happening, and there is no record of any cheetah attacking a human in Africa. The Gurjars and Bobby are shaken by the ordeal but recovering after first-aid. "We have lived here for a long time, and this is the first time a leopard attacked us," they told local mediapersons. Kuno divisional forest officer P K Verma said, "Security has been strengthened in the area after the incident. We will ensure the injured get proper medical care."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/grandparents-fight-off-leopard-snatch-toddler-from-its-jaws/articleshow/85499715.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Pedestrians can beat congestion at ITO junction by walking in air||NEW DELHI: Pedestrian movement at the ITO junction will become a safer experience with a connection of the traffic intersection with Tilak Bridge railway station via a foot overbridge interlinking the skywalk at the W junction near the Supreme Court metro station. An official disclosed on Friday that the new pedestrian bridge was being erected near the ITO intersection as a part of the skywalk project. "This bridge is not connected to the core skywalk at the W junction near the Supreme court,” the official said. “We plan to connect it to Tilak Bridge railway station through a network of bridges to boost the utility of the walkway system and safety of train commuters. The 5-metre-wide FOB lying perpendicular to the railway line will be linked with ITO junction at one end and the existing skywalk at the other." The consultant had proposed two different options for connecting the two ends of the skywalk via Tilak bridge before the final plan for improving walkability at ITO junction was approved last month. The plan approved was to create a single bridge parallel to the railway tracks near Tilak Bridge and to link it with the existing FOB and a proposed FOB. Officials said this option involved minimal construction and least cost inputs. A PWD official said that the reason for erecting the skywalk was to reduce jay-walking on the gradient level that often caused traffic jams during peak traffic hours while making road-crossing unsafe for pedestrians. “This new connecting FOB network will improve the use of the skywalk and people will no longer have to walk down to cross Tilak Bridge. Overhead connectivity will be available from ITO to Tilak Bridge and finally up to Supreme Court metro station and Pragati Maidan," the official added. A large number of daily commuters who come to offices located in ITO area via the local railway station will now have a safer and direct option of reaching ITO. To reduce the traffic congestion at the ITO junction, the UTTIPEC governing body had asked the private consultant to prepare an overall walkability plan along with PWD, DDA and traffic police. Officials revealed that the consultant provided two options at the February meeting. “In the first option, two FOBs parallel to the railway lines were proposed in order to link the system of overhead walkways. The second option was for a parallel FOB connected to an FOB perpendicular to the lines,” said an official. “At the UTTIPEC meeting held on July 15, the second option was approved due to cost effectiveness. This system will be connected to the existing FOB on Tilak Bridge railway station. This T-shaped FOB system will act as a bridge between the skywalk and ITO junction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pedestrians-can-beat-congestion-at-ito-junction-by-walking-in-air/articleshow/85497347.cms||Paras Singh

---||Trichy||Police track down man who abducted, married girl to Kerala||Trichy: A special police team from Thanjavur arrested a 40-year-old Madurai resident from Kerala on charges of abducting and marrying a minor girl, suspected to be missing from January. The case which has been dragging on for eight months was cracked by a special police team in 5 days, police said. Central zone IG V Balakrishnan felicitated the police team for arresting the accused. According to the police, the accused identified as Syed Ali, a resident of Mehaboopalayam in Madurai, allegedly married three women from various places fraudulently. One of the women from Madurai had filed a complaint with SS Colony police, they added. Police booked him under Pocso Act and remanded him in prison after producing him before in court on Thursday evening. Syed Ali worked at a plastic shop in Tirupur and was shifted to another shop in Natchiyarkoil near Kumbakonam by the owner in December 2020, following Ali’s misconduct at the workplace. Ali befriended a 16-year-old girl – a native of a village near Kumbakonam - who was working at a shop near the plastic shop. The girl went missing on January 12 and her parents lodged a complaint with Natchiyarkoil police. A special team probing the case found that Syed Ali also went missing the same day. However, there was no breakthrough in the case till August first week. As there was no progress, Another special team headed by Medical College Hospital station inspector Franklin Undro Wilson was formed. The team travelled to Tirupur after confirming Ali’s mobile phone had gone silent near a mobile shop. During interrogation, it came to light that the accused had sold his mobile at the shop. Based on some clues the team went to Pollachi where the accused had worked in a bakery for one day. As Ali did not leave even a small clue, with the help of a message in his mobile about cash withdrawal from an ATM in Palakkad in Kerala district by Ali, the team headed towards Koduvayur in Kerala, Wilson said. “After questioning several people in Koduvayaur, the team travelled to Idukki and zeroed in on the accused at a house located in a secluded place and arrested him along with the minor girl. As the accused kept changing his location frequently, it took nearly eight months to trace him,” Franklin told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/police-track-down-man-who-abducted-married-girl-to-kerala/articleshow/85499729.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Rakshabandhan brings life & business back to Lucknow markets||LUCKNOW: With Rakshabandhan just a day away and Sunday lockdown curbs lifted, the city markets are buzzing with activities again. Aminabad, Yahiyaganj, Bhoothnath, Chowk, Aliganj and Rajajipuram markets among others are once again seeing the kind of footfall they used to witness before the pandemic, said traders. In high demand are cartoon rakhi, eco-friendly rakhi, ornamental and single thread rakhis, rudraksh and gold rakhi. Apart from normal thread-based rakhi, women are also opting to buy ornamental bracelet rakhis for their sister-in-law's instead of tying the usual 'lumba rakhi'. Priced Rs 5,000 onwards, the main attraction at Chowk's Saraffa market is the silver, gold and diamond rachis. The gold and diamond rakhis are being made on order and are priced according to the weight and design. At Bhoothnath market, the sale of rudraksh and cartoon based rakhi's are high, along with designer and crafted 'thalis' to go with it. “Plain and simple rudraksh rakhis or bracelets with ‘Om’ and ‘dumroo’ made on it are attracting the customers. Kundan rakhis are also being preferred. Since rakhi is worn by brothers for a day or two only, rudraksh rakhi or bracelet is one such thing which can be worn by men anywhere, even in offices. They are relatively cheap too. That's why the demand is more,” said Shilpi, a seller in Bhoothnath market. “People are ready to buy costly rakhis too only if they are not thread-based but one with bracelets. Similar is the case with lumba rakhi. They wish to take home bracelets with ornamented beads, American diamond ones, and phoolon wali rakhi. They are all priced above Rs 500,” said Ajay Gupta, a shopkeeper in Aminabad. “Last year, we couldn’t go out and buy rakhis due to Covid but this year we can go to the market like old times. I've bought two 'chhota-bheem' rakhis for my daughter's, and Kundan rakhi's for my brother and cousins,” said Anamika Srivastava, a customer. City residents are also preferring out-of-the-box ideas for rakhi and looking for options on social media and e-commerce sites. “Assorted and customised hampers along with rakhis with 'superman logo', 'bada bhai', resin-art customised rakhis with brother's name written on it are being purchased by many,” said a resident. “These kinds of rakhis are different and interesting. Online sites are filled with them and they can be customized,” said Shruti Rai, a city resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rakshabandhan-brings-life-biz-back-to-markets/articleshow/85502004.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: How new traffic challan rules will change policing||NEW DELHI: Following a notification by the Union road transport ministry that traffic violation notices would have to be sent to the offenders within 15 days of the offence being recorded, senior traffic police officers said while some of the things mentioned were already in place, other steps would be implemented soon. The notification under the amended Motor Vehicle Act also stated that the evidence should be kept in the records until it was disposed of, in case a violator wished to appeal against a specific challan. The order also stated that traffic police would have to put up a warning sign that one was approaching an area where there was camera surveillance. Regarding this, traffic police said boards had been put up at several places and they would conduct a review to ensure that the signs were duly visible. The SOP for body-worn cameras would also be modified with the new notification. Special commissioner (traffic) Muktesh Chander said, “We already have a system in place where we immediately send a message alert through which one can access their challan. There is also a grievance system in place for those who have issues with their challan or if they have been issued the fine wrongly. Regarding the other sets of rules, we will incorporate them in our existing system and ensure transparency between commuters and police officers.” While the new rules encourage use of body-worn cameras, traffic officers would have to inform the offender that they were being recorded. Senior officers said the use of such cameras would help them record misbehaviour by offenders. “Usually, in many cases of a motorist being stopped, they start misbehaving or arguing with the policemen. In some cases, traffic cops have been grievously injured as violators end up driving with them clinging onto the bonnet. However, now we will alert commuters that their actions are being recorded so as not to breach their privacy,” said a senior officer. The officer added, “On most stretches, we have put up speed limits as well as boards with camera signage so that one knows they are under surveillance. But we will inspect all stretches again to see if there is a need for a signboard to be placed for awareness of commuters.” One of the prime reasons for amending the MV Act was to ensure transparency and electronic evidence to support it, said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-new-traffic-challan-rules-will-change-policing/articleshow/85497425.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Four women held selling 5-day-old baby in Nadiad||AHMEDABAD: The Nadiad Special Operations Group has arrested four women from Nadiad who were selling a five-day-old male baby for Rs 6 lakh. The mother of the baby was a tribal woman from Madhya Pradesh who had lost her husband five years ago. Those arrested include a medical student dropout who has completed three years of medical studies. In-charge superintendent of police Kheda, Arpita Patel, who supervised the entire operation said that the SOG Nadiad, acting on a tip-off, had sent its team with a decoy, who posed as a customer and worked out a deal for Rs 6 lakh for a baby boy. Patel said that the SOG team was given options about the age of the child, whether they wanted a newborn baby or an older baby and preference for sex of the child. “For a girl child the price was less, while the same for a male child was on the higher side,” Patel said. She said that the team worked out the entire operation within a week after speaking to a local broker Monica Shah. She said that the cops showed preference for a male child and the rate was fixed for Rs 6 lakh. Among other arrested was Pushpa Pateliya who was working with Monica, Maya Dabla who had left studies after studying medicine for three years. Dabla does not have a medical degree and Radhika Jayram who had mothered the child and was a widow. Jayram is from Nagpur, Maharashtra and was staying in a chawl in Nadiad. SOG police Inspector V K Khat, who headed the entire operation said that SOG woman team member PSI R D Chaudhary and two other women constables were sent as decoy. Chaudhary stated that she wanted to adopt a child. Later, according to the deal on Friday the newborn baby was delivered to Chaudhary and all the four were arrested by the SOG team. The in-charge SP said that while the deal was being worked out, Monica and Pushpa informed the SOG team that the baby was of a Brahmin and the family was totally vegetarian. She said that the cops have the call recording while they were talking to the women for the deal. Nadiad Police said that of the Rs 6 lakh the mother Jayram was to get Rs 1.5 lakh while the other three would distribute the remaining among themselves. Cops have registered a case under IPC Section 370 (whoever, knowingly or having reason to believe that a minor has been trafficked), Section 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment), Section 144 (unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon) and Section 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/four-women-held-selling-5-day-old-baby/articleshow/85499800.cms||---

Justice Lalit, who is also the executive chairman of National Legal Services Authority, recently expressed that putting up the boards or posters with the information of availability of free legal aid services is a first step in the direction to ensure that no accused remain unrepresented at any stage of investigation or trial. Police commissioner Chandragupta said the city police will definitely abide by the direction. “Display board about free legal aid services will be surely be displayed in police stations. As of now, awareness about the availability of the free legal services is being done regularly by police officers in association with district legal services authority,” he added. Police stations currently have boards with information on child and women helpline numbers. Welcoming the move, advocate HN Venkatesh said it would be certainly helpful to kin of the accused if boards on the availability of the free legal aid services are put up at police stations. “Along with the information, it should contain contact numbers and address of the District Legal Services Authority so that they can seek the service without any hassles,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/police-stations-to-display-boards-about-free-legal-aid-services/articleshow/85496237.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Hyderabad||Some gaps in party, nothing serious, says Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar||Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar is optimistic that his long walkathon, starting on August 24 will change the political landscape and expose the TRS government’s shortcomings over the last seven years. In an exclusive interview with Sribala Vadlapatla, he said that disagreements within the party are minor and can be easily resolved. Q- Many parties in the state declared padayatra; what are your goals? A-. The priority will be to stay in contact with ordinary people and their problems. The TRS government failed on all criteria. People lost their lives in the fight for a separate state and now the youth are committing suicide as they fail to get employment. Unfortunately, right from river water concerns, many promises like double bedroom houses, and three acres of land to each Dalit household, there is nothing TRS can be proud of in recent years. They always flip-flop. We have been pushing the government to designate September 17 as Telangana liberation day. They supported us prior to the formation of the state but have now gone back on it under the influence of AIMIM. Q- There is big talk about the widening gap among local BJP party leaders A - We have some gaps in the party, but nothing serious. Many newcomers to the party are unaware of the party’s discipline and rules. Even the PM adheres to the protocol. I would not have gotten authorisation for the padayatra from national leadership without the rest of the party’s leaders at the state level supporting it. Q-TRS working president KT Rama Rao tweeted that everyone in the state should apply to the BJP for Rs 15 lakh in Jan Dhan accounts, as promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi… A- It is a misconception; the PM never said that. All he said was if all black money owned by Indians was returned to the country, the sum would be equivalent to it. But we will not cease accepting applications from citizens about their difficulties in the state. Q-What is BJP’s stand on Dalit Bandhu ? A-While we support the initiative, we are sceptical of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s commitment. He launched the Rythu Bandhu scheme as a pilot project in Karimnagar. Farmers across the state received benefits on the same day, so why not the same for this scheme? In Huzurabad, only a few families are provided (Karim Nagar district). Tribals and BCs require such assistance, but TRS derives no political benefit from the proposal. I will traverse through Huzurabad for at least one week Q- Why is the BJP launching programmes from the Bhagyalakshmi temple in Charminar when it is communally sensitive? A- When other religions launch programmes from their places of faith, why shouldn’t we? There are many political parties in the country that talk about others, but we are the only one that values the sentiments of the majority||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/some-gaps-in-party-nothing-serious/articleshow/85501123.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

This is in addition to at least 15 to 20 pubs, service apartments and a flood of upscale restaurants, show market records. In comparison, the city’s central business district (CBD) — the Begumpet-Punjagutta stretch that was once Hyderabad’s social epicentre — has seen only a handful of players make an appearance. In fact, many outlets have now shut shop in the CBD and taken their operations to ‘hitechabad’. “We shut the Begumpet branch within two years of its opening as we realised that the crowd was moving towards Hi-Tec City and beyond. We saw a drop in footfall as even those living around Begumpet were travelling all the way to the IT corridor for social events. That’s when we decided to open a branch in Gachibowli (in December, 2020) where the business is steadily growing,” said Tabeer Osmani, associate partner and marketing head, Heart Cup Coffee. Like him, there are others too who are looking towards the western corridor, to expand their business. “In two months, we are opening a new outlet in a mall in Kondapur. Due to the IT industry, Hyderabad welcomes new people from different cities every day. Considering the variety of choices that people have in terms of food and experiences, we thought it’s only wise to expand to this area,” said Ayush Agarwal, co-founder, AirLive that’s currently limited to Jubilee Hills. Ten downing street, popularly known as 10D — synonymous with Begumpet since the early 90s — too has made Kondapur its home. “Today, Gachibowli and its neighbouring areas are a high activity zones where people step out even during weekdays. In the same building where we started, there are four other outlets. Yet, that doesn’t dampen our business,” said Pranay Reddy, executive director, 10D. Not surprising then, the Gachibowli -Hi-Tec City-Chandanagar-Kukatpally belt has seen eight new malls come up in the last five years. During the same time, not a single new mall has opened in the CBD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pubs-hotels-drive-out-to-hi-tech-hyderabad/articleshow/85501425.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Delhi||GPS Mapping Of Drains Likely To Contain Toxic Assault On Yamuna||New Delhi: Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) is planning to use GPS to map all drains and measure water quality at their outfall points to identify the minor drains that contaminate the Yamuna the most through discharge of effluents or sewage. The capital has around 100 drains, out of which 18 major drains fall directly into the Yamuna. The water quality status of around 30 drains is currently being monitored by DPCC on a monthly basis. “The plan is to identify the locations where considerable pollutants are entering the Yamuna. We are considering mapping of all the drains and increasing the monitoring stations at the outfall of all drains to regularly check the water quality,” a DPCC official said. “The water quality will help us in ascertaining the small drains that are the most polluted. Once we identify these drains, we can figure out the industrial clusters causing pollution in the Yamuna via drains.” TOI had reported that a study by DPCC on the assessment of water quality of drains says 16 out of the 30 drains, which go into the Yamuna, were not meeting the prescribed parameters in respect to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The report said some drains were also flouting prescribed standards for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS). “After we know the polluted drains, action can be taken accordingly. The authorities concerned can take steps to improve the water quality and we will act against the industries discharging untreated effluents,” said an official. “The proposal of measuring water will be presented to the higher authorities for approval,” the official added. The latest water quality status report, which is based on the samples collected this June, stated that the Sweeper Colony drain was the most polluted. It contributed 120mg/l BOD, 544mg/l COD and 310mg/l TSS, while the prescribed standards for drains is 30mg/l for BOD, 250mg/l for COD and 100mg/l for TSS. The Molarband, Sahibabad, Maharani Bagh and Shahdara drains were also found polluted with high levels of BOD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gps-mapping-of-drains-likely-to-contain-toxic-assault-on-yamuna/articleshow/85497566.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Although attaining the post of mayor in the case of an urban local body or a president in a panchayat is regarded as being just a step away from entering the state legislature, the post of the mayor of the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) appears to have turned into a cul-de-sac, with none of those who occupied the office having managed to win the assembly elections. In fact, only three corporators in the HDMC council have been fortunate to win the assembly elections – SR Morey and AM Hindasgeri of the Congress and Ashok Katwe of BJP. Morey, who served as a corporator in 1972, not only won the assembly elections in 1983, ’89 and 2004 – he even served as a minister under chief ministers S Bangarappa and Dharam Singh. Hindasgeri, who served as a corporator in 1983, was elected to the assembly in 1985 and ’89, and served as a cabinet minister twice. He was also elected as an MLC. Ashok Katwe, who rose to become the deputy mayor of the HDMC in the 1980s, was not as lucky as his Congress counterparts. Although he managed to enter the assembly in 1994, he was defeated in the 1999 polls. Since its inception in 1962, the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation has had 39 mayors – senior advocate Giriyappa R Nalawadi was the first to occupy the mayor’s post. Of the 39 who held the mayor’s post, six unsuccessfully contested the elections to the assembly. Among them, are former chief minister Jagadish Shettar’s father SS Shettar, who served as the mayor in 1975. SS Shettar unsuccessfully contested the assembly  from Hubli city constituency in 1985. IM Javali, Pandurang Patil, BS Patil, Hanumanth V Dambal and Anilkumar Patil were the other mayors who tried, and failed to enter the assembly. In fact, there have even been instances wherein corporators who have set their sights on entering the assembly have refused the mayor’s post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/no-hdmc-mayor-has-won-assembly-polls-so-far/articleshow/85495127.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

Social distancing and other Covid-19 norms including mandatory wearing of masks are not being adhered to properly. The government is turning a blind eye to this issue while it continues to deny self-financed schools to re-open for primary level,” the association said, in a statement. However, the self-financed schools are following all Covid-19 related rules, the government is yet to give a green signal to open primary classes -open or in-person classroom studies, it said. The state government had earlier said it will decide regarding re-opening of schools for Class 6 to Class 8 students soon after August 15. But, a week later the government is yet to announce a decision in this direction. Last month, about 20 students from two schools in Ludhiana tested positive for Covid-19 disease following which the schools were shut down for two weeks. Earlier in March this year more than 12 students in Surat tested positive for Covid-19 after schools were allowed to re-open after a gap of 9 months. They were soon shut down along with other educational institutions in the state with Covid-19 cases going up. The state government has recently decided to conduct RT-PCR tests in schools and colleges to check the spread of Covid-19 caseloads amid talks of a third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-informal-schools-allowed-but-not-private/articleshow/85499873.cms||---

Later, the racketeers compelled Shende to cough up an additional Rs 98,000 on the pretext of various loan processing charges. The two amounts were deposited in the account of Puja who is now behind bars.Assistant police inspector Sheetal Kumar Gaikwad of Ajni police station said Puja had switched off her cellphones but was arrested on the basis of the KYC details mentioned in her bank accounts.It’s learnt that police from Delhi and other states, too, tried to nab Puja but she managed to hoodwink them. “A search conducted at her residence enabled us to get evidence,” said Gaikwad.Ajni police, under the supervision of zonal DCP Akshay Shinde, are now trying to arrest the other suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/home-makerwith-8-bank-a/cs-5-cell-phones-sans-income-held/articleshow/85497570.cms||Soumitra Bose

An accident case has been registered with the Karveer police station. Nitin Mane, a resident of the Rajputwadi village of Karveer taluka in Kolhapur, was an electrician by profession. On Friday night, he had gone out on a job with his friend. They were returning home in the early hours of Saturday when the accident took place While crossing the Shingnapur barrage across the Panchaganga river, Mane’s friend lost control of his bike and hit a stone column fixed over the barrage. As a result, the bike and the rider fell on the bridge. Mane, however, fell into the river water and drowned. The incident was reported to the Karveer police, who called the district disaster management team to find the body. Prasad Sankpal, the head of the district disaster management committee in Kolhapur, said, “Around 3.11 am on Saturday, our team received a call about a person falling into the Panchaganga river at Shingnapur.

---||Mumbai||Sitaram Kunte trying to put blame on me: Ex-intel chief to Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Rashmi Shukla, ex-commissioner, state intelligence department, contended before the Bombay high court on Friday that former additional home secretary of Maharashtra and currently state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte is trying to absolve himself and put the blame on her for her phone-tap report into alleged corruption in the state over police transfers and postings. Senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Shukla in his submissions on Friday, said she is even willing to take a lie detector test to prove she never told anyone, including the chief minister, then home minister Anil Deshmukh or Kunte that she had made a ‘mistake’ and had offered to withdraw her report, as mentioned by the ACS in a report dated March 25, 2021, a day before the FIR was filed. She is being made a scapegoat, he argued. The interceptions were authorized by Kunte himself when he was the ACS (home), and he is expected to have applied his mind, said Jethmalani. Kunte is now the chief secretary of the state. Before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, Jethmalani said Kunte sanctioned the tap, so why is the state “witch-hunting” Shukla now? On March 26, 2021, the cyber police registered a First Information Report (FIR) against unknown persons for the alleged ‘leak’ of Shukla’s confidential phone-tap report and the letter of August 25, 2020 submitted by her to the then director general of police Subodh Jaiswal. Shukla petitioned the HC to have the FIR quashed.Jethmalani said Shukla had done her duty faithfully as directed. He contended “mala fide” by the state. He argued that the advocate general had also submitted earlier that nothing was found in the report, and if it is “innocuous,” then why was there an file an FIR about its ‘leak’? Jethmalani submitted the assumption is that Shukla is the “focus” of the probe, and the purpose of the probe is nothing “except to keep it hanging over her and not give to CBI the documents which state is otherwise bound in law to give.” Jethmalani read from Kunte’s report annexed to her petition. Kunte said Shukla misused the law, which cannot be used for “case of difference of political opinion, business disputes or domestic disputes etc” and Shukla personally met him, the then home minister and the chief minister and “expressed her regret…and admitted her mistake and sought to withdraw the report.” She also mentioned a family tragedy—the death of her husband. Jethmalani said her husband had died in 2018, why would she raise it now, and also Kunte invoked her gender, saying “she is a woman officer and admitted her mistake, no further step is taken” barring her transfer. “It is disgraceful,” said Jethmalani. Kunte said Shukla in July 2020 said “some persons can cause danger to public order and took permission” to tap phones of unknown persons. “Danger to public order means acts like terrorism, riots etc” but she tapped via “intentional misguiding,” a term which Jethmalani questioned, saying the state was “stooping so low.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ex-intel-chief-to-hc-kunte-trying-to-put-blame-on-me-in-mumbai/articleshow/85503223.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Lucknow||UP: 21 crucial case documents on Bikru don Vikas Dubey missing||LUCKNOW: Mandated to probe the status of police investigation into 65 criminal cases slapped against slain gangster Vikas Dubey, who orchestrated the Bikru massacre, the three-member judicial commission led by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan noted in its report that police failed to table documents on at least 21 cases, citing missing files. The commission recommended an inquiry against errant officials for misplacing documents on heinous crimes committed by the don, including attempt to murder, arson and rioting with deadly weapons. Majority of these cases were registered at Kanpur Nagar and Kanpur Dehat. The commission observed that loss of Dubey case files is a serious matter, which entails administrative action against erring public servants after inquiry. The judicial commission, which was set up in July last year, had directed officials to provide details of cases on Vikas Dubey along with copies of FIRs, chargesheets, list of witnesses along with their statements in 65 cases. But police and administrative authorities told the commission that files of some cases between 1991 and 2017 were untraceable or under search and would be submitted soon. But the files have since not been found. Of the 21 cases, 11 cases are registered in police stations of Kanpur Dehat and 10 in Kanpur Nagar commissionerate and pertain to imposition of Goonda Act on the gangster in 1999, 2000 and later in 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/21-crucial-case-docus-on-bikru-don-dubey-missing/articleshow/85502215.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Comorbidity-related deaths again form bulk of fatalities||MUMBAI: Since the start of the pandemic, it has been known that those with underlying medical conditions face higher risks for severe illness and death. However, a disproportionately higher number without an underlying health condition died during the peak of the second wave in the city. As the wave ebbs, this worrying trend has started to reverse. In April and May 2021, considered the city’s worst period in the second wave, deaths without underlying comorbidities accounted for 41% and 42% respectively of all Covid fatalities. It was concerning since the proportion of healthy individuals succumbing to the infection had seldom crossed 25-30% since the outbreak. As deaths of those without comorbidities rose, comorbidity-related deaths dropped to 58% in April and May. Civic data now shows that the trend has reversed with comorbidity-related deaths once again accounting for 75-80% fatalities. Deaths among healthy individuals dropped to 30% in June and 35% in July. In August so far, 27% of deaths have been in individuals with no known ailments, while 73% has been in those with comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, hypothyroidism. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the city’s Covid death audit committee, said majority of deaths recorded now are among senior citizens with underlying ailments who have been hospitalised with Covid for weeks. The city is clocking an average of 30-35 weekly Covid deaths, of which almost 65% is of those above 60 years. With the city’s high diabetes and hypertension burden, it is unlikely that Covid deaths would come to naught, he said. A senior civic intensivist said the city had faced a brief crisis of beds in April when more than 9,000 cases were being detected every day. “It is possible that there could have been a delay in seeking care by young healthy individuals, or they may have struggled to find a bed on time, or perhaps the severity of the disease itself could have caused more deaths,” said the doctor. He believes the Delta variant caused a rapid progression of the disease in young people. “We had young and healthy patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome in a span of 3-4 days. So even with a slight delay in reaching a hospital, those cases would have had a bad outcome,” the doctor added. At SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, which is recording 3-5 deaths daily, the trend is evident. Dean Dr Balakrishna Adsul said they had recorded many deaths in the younger age group in May, but now mortalities are once again concentrated in the elderly. “In the rare deaths that we see in young patients now, delay is the biggest reason. They don’t get tested till day 9 or 10 of the onset of symptoms. Some waste a day or two doing a HRCT scan before going for a RT-PCR test,” he said. SevenHills, he said, mainly gets patients who have exhausted their financial means after spending several days in private hospitals, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-comorbidity-related-deaths-again-form-bulk-of-fatalities/articleshow/85500022.cms||---

---||Goa||Bicholim vendors violating Covid norms to face action||Bicholim: The Bicholim Municipal Council (BMC) has decided to initiate stringent action against market vendors not adhering to social distancing norms. On Wednesday, the weekly market was overcrowded, this despite BMC’s directives against the same in light of the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Taking cognizance of the situation, BMC's market inspectors instructed the vendors to shut down their businesses. Following this, most of the vendors, including the locals, left the market. However, some of the non-local vendors re-opened their business prompting the market inspectors to visit the market again. At this juncture, one vegetable vendor abused a market inspector. The latter reported the matter to the chief officer Kabir Shirgaonkar who decided to initiate action against the defaulting vendors. On Thursday local vendors met Shirgaonkar and BMC chairperson Kundan Falari, requesting them to protect their interest. After listening to their grievances, BMC authorities assured them that action will be initiated only against those violating social distancing norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-vendors-violating-covid-norms-to-face-action/articleshow/85502256.cms||---
---||Delhi||Foreign language ad hoc teachers stare at job loss||New Delhi: The UGC Regulations 2018, which state that it is mandatory to have a PhD to be appointed as an assistant professor, are likely to cause a lot of problems for Delhi University’s Department of Germanic and Romance Studies. The department teaches five foreign languages — French, Spanish, German, Portuguese and Italian — from UG to PhD levels, but has just 10 permanent faculty members for close to 1,200 students. It is the only university in the country that offers Italian at the undergraduate level. Till 2020-21 academic session, there were 12 ad hoc teachers. Now, with this regulation being in place, they would lose the chance of re-appointment as some are still pursuing PhD. Even when vacancies for the post were advertised, the department could only get two candidates. The university has been sent a communication that if this matter is not resolved, it would be difficult to conduct UG/PG admissions this year. Out of the 12 ad hoc teachers, some teaching for close to nine years, only three are likely to be retained. The others would be petitioning the department to take up the matter with the university. Vijaya Venkataraman, a Spanish professor, said, “These courses provide employment opportunities in various sectors, like MNCs, embassies, teaching, etc. The department has asked the university to intervene and seek relaxation from UGC for the PhD clause as candidates are not available. The registrar has given us assurance in this regard.” DU also stopped new ad hoc positions after the implementation of the EWS reservation. As a result, two positions have been vacant since 2019. Without the new ad hoc positions, the department would be forced to manage with guest faculty, but they can only teach for a maximum of eight hours per week. Ad hoc faculty members can teach for 16 hours a week. Ad hoc faculty members pursuing PhD said when UGC gave them an extension for submission of the thesis due to the pandemic, why couldn’t they give some relaxation for teaching? An ad hoc teacher doing the job for the past nine years, who has now been considered ineligible, said she was the only earning member of the family with two children. She was staring at uncertainty even though her PhD thesis was nearing submission. “The libraries are closed. We are putting in close to 16 hours of teaching. We don’t get study leave. I don’t know how I’ll manage the rent and school fees of my children,” she added. A reserved category faculty member who teaches Italian said he could not enroll for PhD as one of his parents was suffering from cancer. Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) has also written to the UGC chairman. “Teachers wishing to complete their PhD thesis have faced many hardships in the last two years, especially due to the pandemic, owing to the closure of the university and unavailability of facilities like libraries and laboratories. UGC has extended the deadline for submission of PhD thesis. Similarly, UGC must extend the date of implementation of this mandatory requirement to prevent job losses,” said the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/foreign-language-ad-hoc-teachers-stare-at-job-loss/articleshow/85497703.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Oxford initiates human trials for intranasal Covishield vaccination||PUNE: The University of Oxford has started phase 1 clinical trials on 54 healthy adults for an intranasal Covishield vaccine after positive findings in studies on hamsters and rhesus macaques, said a group of researchers in a paper published in Science Translation Medicine earlier this week. Intranasal vaccines are administered through syringes, nasal sprays or aerosol delivery into the nasal cavity. The most commonly used intranasal vaccine is the influenza vaccine. This mode of vaccination is easier to administer than the intra-muscular injection. In the two animal studies, the intranasal vaccine was found to reduce viral load and lessen the impact on lungs. Unlike the previous vaccines, this vaccine was tested on hamsters on an early mutation (D614G) of the nCoV spike protein and was found to reduce viral load in nasal swabs. Dr Nanasaheb Thorat, a Marie-Curie fellow at Oxford, said the intranasal method would be a game-changer with possibly lesser side-effects. He said since the vaccine is already in use and is only being tried through a different route of administration, it would need fewer approvals. “Intranasal vaccines are easier to administer and handle. Even children can easily be given the vaccine, like in case of the influenza vaccine. The latest research shows the intra-nasal vaccine reduced virus load and helped prevent the spread of infection to the lungs. Since the vaccine has not been changed, it should not face regulatory checks again,” Thorat told TOI. Oxford University started the human trials after the researchers, including Sarah Gilbert who designed the vaccine, found it effective against infected hamsters. The research paper was published earlier this month. The research further states that the intranasal vaccination of rhesus macaques also resulted in reduced virus concentrations in nasal swabs and a reduction in viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and lower respiratory tract tissue. The researchers tested the intranasal vaccination route against the nCoV strain containing the D614G mutation. The spaper says both studies demonstrated that the vaccine protects against SARS-CoV-2 containing the D614G mutation. It is likely that this translates to other vaccine platforms as well. The researchers said the data presented in the paper supports the investigation of intranasal delivery of Covid-19 vaccines and that it shows a reduction in virus detection in nasal swabs of hamsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-oxford-initiates-human-trials-for-intranasal-covishield-vaccination/articleshow/85500096.cms||Swatee Kher

A civic official said 20 notices and challans had been issued during this special drive. The vulnerable bus depots include DTC cluster bus depot, those at sectors 2, 22 and C in Dwarka, Sukhdev Vihar, Khanpur and Vasant Vihar. “The main reason behind mosquito breeding was collection of rainwater in scrap items lying unattended, tyres, flower pots, desert coolers, etc. Mosquito larvae were destroyed on the spot while insecticidal spray was carried out by staff. DTC employees were also made aware about how to prevent water stagnation,” the official said. All district health officials have been directed to coordinate with caretakers/managers of bus depots and workshops for taking anti-mosquito measures on the premises. Around 10 days ago, another drive was carried out at 118 police stations and malkhanas and mosquito breeding was detected at 62 of them due to collection of rainwater. SDMC had issued notices in 58 cases and a challan was issued to a caretaker.

---||Mumbai||BMC to carry out Rs 430 crore road work in Mhada layouts||MUMBAI: BMC will soon carry out road work worth Rs 430 crore in Mhada layouts across Mumbai. The roads will be repaired by BMC after several years as BMC stopped repairing roads in these enclaves after Mhada was notified as a planning authority in 2017. Most Mhada layouts are in the western and eastern suburbs. “Since the state government has directed BMC to provide civic amenities and infrastructure in these layouts, we are going ahead with work. These will be major and minor roads, in concrete and asphalt,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects). Pending road work will be cleared soon. In fact, proposals for work worth Rs 1,200 crore will be tabled before the standing committee soon for approval. “We will also carry out other road work worth Rs 750 crore in the next few months,” Velrasu said. The state government recently issued a directive to BMC to take up responsibility and upgrade infrastructure and civic amenities, like laying roads and sewage lines in Mhada colonies in Vikhroli, Bandra, Ghatkopar, Kurla, Goregaon and Andheri. These colonies were long deprived of BMC facilities as Mhada has been designated an independent planning authority by state government. Officials said there are over 50 such colony layouts in Mumbai that are home to lakhs of residents. BMC was recently under fire for Rs 1,200 road work projects in the city starting October 2021 was kept pending. Officials had said that as the volume of work was huge, they want to moderate it and decide which need to be taken up on priority. But Opposition party corporators had alleged that BMC was spending “lavishly” on large projects while essential road work was ignored. “Mhada colony residents have suffered due to poor roads. BMC must not give them bad roads like the rest of the city,” said corporator Vinod Mishra (BJP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-carry-out-rs-430cr-road-work-in-mhada-layouts/articleshow/85503918.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||Panel proposes dedicated team to crack crime cases||Lucknow: For swift and focused investigations into criminal cases, the three-member judicial commission probing the Bikru massacre suggested a police commissionerate system in Prayagraj, Agra and Meerut, while strongly recommending a dedicated team at the thana-level to focus on investigation, without deployment for routine law and order duty. This will enable police to crack cases within a deadline, the panel stated. The commission also suggested ways to efficiently mobilise manpower, ramp up infrastructure, transport, communications and weaponry, while proposing setting up more forensic laboratories, modernising police, raising training facilities and reducing workload. The commission also sought enactment of a special law like Control of Organized Crimes Act as in vogue in states like Maharashtra and constitution of a special police cell to deal with organised crimes under these laws. It also suggested strengthening of local intelligence units with enhanced supervision. While proposing guidelines to raid and nab criminals, the commission specifically mentioned adoption of precaution and strategy. The commission also sought a time-frame for posting of officers to curb conflict of interest in commercial, financial and personal matters. Advocating a policy to prevent undue influence of administrative and revenue officers on the police force over issuing licences for arms and mining, the panel stated the state should set up a committee at the district level to examine cause of acquittals and recommend filing of appeals or revision pleas. The committee should also examine whether a bail order should be challenged or a cancellation appeal be filed. The commission sought analysis of the functioning of commissionerate systems in Lucknow and Noida and a comparison of crime graphs in both districts between January-September 2019 and January-September 2020. Data shows a sharp dip in heinous crimes, the panel stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/panel-proposes-dedicated-team-to-crack-crime-cases/articleshow/85502254.cms||---

Highlighting the growing unemployment and high cost of living, AITUC said that resumption of mining will provide employment and help mining dependants meet their daily expenses. AITUC will be organising a protest meet at Azad Maidan on August 25 to protest against the Farm Laws and anti-worker policies of the Centre. AITUC Goa general secretary has also demanded that every mining dependent family should get Rs 25,000 to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi. “We demand that the government must immediately operationalise the corporation, take over the mining leases and start mining. Those mining workers who have been unemployed since 2012 should be re-employed,” said Fonseca. He said that since the Goa Mineral Development Corporation Bill was passed, no further development has taken place, which raises questions about the government’s seriousness in allowing mining of iron ore to resume. AITUC has also demanded that the Goa government must increase the minimum wages for daily wage workers from Rs 362 to Rs 750 per day. “The government is trying to clip people’s wings who are trying to fight against oppression. Inflation and household expenses have also increased,” said Fonseca. He said that during the pandemic, nearly 25,000 workers have lost jobs in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/make-corporation-functional-restart-mining-operations/articleshow/85502435.cms||---

---||Chennai||2.4 lakh tonnes of coal worth Rs 85 crore missing from Chennai plant||CHENNAI: Alleging discrepancy between records and stock on hand, Tamil Nadu electricity minister V Senthil Balaji on Friday said that about 2.4 lakh tonnes of coal has gone missing at the North Chennai Thermal Power Station (NCTPS). The loss is pegged at Rs 85 crore as per initial estimates. “This has happened because of the inefficiency of the AIADMK government. We will set right the irregularities and provide a transparent administration,” the minister said. The state-run power utility, Tangedco, has ordered a probe into coal stocks at the Tuticorin and Mettur thermal power stations. A committee of senior Tangedco officials, which held an investigation on August 4 and 9, found discrepancies as the records did not reflect the actual coal stock as on March 31, 2021. “A probe is on to find out whether coal was unloaded from ship or not, or if the registers were manipulated. The offenders, whoever they are, will face action,” the minister told TOI. While the NCTPS I and II handles 9.9 lakh tonnes of coal per month received from coalfields of Talcher and IB Valley in Odisha, the Mettur TPS gets coal from Singareni Collieries in Andhra Pradesh. Coal is also imported from Indonesia. Sources told TOI that the panel was set up by Tangedco on August 2 after it was brought to the notice of officials that the coal stock at NCTPS-1 and Tuticorin TPS was less than what was reported. The team was assigned to inspect and review the coal stocking procedures, accounting, stock as per stores book and actual coal stock, and reason for variations in the five thermal power stations. The report was to be submitted within a fortnight. Director (generation), chief financial controller and chief engineer (non-conventional energy sources) were members of the committee and superintending engineer (coal handling) was the convenor. The Tangedco team has also started a probe at Mettur and Tuticorin TPS. The power utility had purchased 111 lakh tonnes of domestic coal and 12 lakh tonnes of imported coal last year, sources said. The August 2 order of Tangedco said that considering the seriousness of the matter, there was a need to inquire about the reasons for the shortage and “fix the responsibility with the officers” for the lacunae. Balaji said the power utility was facing a severe financial crisis with an outstanding debt burden of Rs1.59 lakh crore due to mismanagement of the AIADMK regime. Governor’s address to the assembly mentioned a detailed strategic study of the finances and governance structure. “Wrongdoers will be punished. None can escape,” the minister said, indicating that reports of the team on other stations will throw light on the magnitude of the scam. Meanwhile, former electricity minister P Thangamani disputed the claims of Balaji. In Namakkal, the AIADMK leader said the minister was only reporting the findings of a committee set up by the previous regime after getting to know about discrepancies in stock. “How will the minister know about the missing coal as on March 31, when he deputed a team only on August 6? He is doing this to defame the previous government. We are ready to support him if he takes fair action,” the former minister said, denying any wrongdoing. He said the debt burden of TNEB increased due to the outstanding debt of Rs 36,000 crore when the DMK government demitted office in 2011 and implementation of new projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/2-4-lakh-tonnes-of-coal-worth-rs-85cr-missing-from-city-plant/articleshow/85500110.cms||Julie Mariappan

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath misleading students on tablets, says SP chief Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Describing BJP’s announcement to give away one crore tablets and examination allowance to students as a blatant lie, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said CM Yogi Adityanath has shattered all records of misleading people. He said the BJP has not fulfilled the promises it had made in its election manifesto and had gone ahead to make more promises with barely six months before polls. “BJP and the CM have spoken lies in Vidhan Sabha. With six months to go for the elections, the government has announced it will give one crore tablets and examination allowance to students. The fact is that the government has not fulfilled a simple promise like internet data to students. What happened to the Vivekanand Internet Sewa?” Akhilesh questioned. He said the government has not been able to spend even 20% of the budget, but it presented the supplementary budget to mislead people by promising them something or the other. He said the government has failed to complete PWD project involving laying of 640km of road on the Indo-Nepal border that is yet to be completed 10 years after it began. “The CAG report presented before the state assembly has exposed the poor state of affairs of 11 public units of power department. The accumulated losses of these units have reached Rs 162,180.07 crore,” he said. ‘Akhilesh doesn’t control SP cycle’Government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh on Friday hit out at Akhilesh Yadav for his tweet on BJP’s “double engine government”, saying that SP’s cycle had already been trashed and he should stop worrying about BJP. “Why are you so scared of the double engine government? Passengers on this ride are safe. People say the handle of this cycle is with someone else in your family,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-misleading-students-on-tablets/articleshow/85502300.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Six held from Delhi for duping 70-year-old of Rs 74.6 lakh with ‘better’ insurance lure||MUMBAI: A gang of six youths, mostly in their twenties, was held in New Delhi and has been brought here on charges of cheating a 70-year-old retired businessman of Rs 74.6 lakh on the pretext of offering his family and friends better insurance policies. The police suspect the youths, all working for a private firm to which an insurance company had outsourced customer service duties, had duped others too during the pandemic and are interrogating them in police custody. Seven bank accounts of the six have been frozen. The sleuths also learnt about a property in the capital where the gang leader had invested Rs 25 lakh. The racket came to light when the septuagenarian who stays near Grant Road lodged a complaint with the central region cyber police station on August 2. The senior citizen, whose son stays abroad, was called by one of the gang members about his policy. The gang later decided to target him with fake offers of better returns and lower premium, and soon had “sold” 10 policies to his family and friends and pocketed the money. “All the accused were working for a company which was sub-let customer care service by an insurance firm. These accused got contact numbers of the policy holders and contacted them through phone, WhatsApp and email. We are questioning the accused,” said DCP Rashmi Karandikar, head of the city cyber police stations. Gang leader Adnan Khan, 20, Saurabh Kanhaiyalal, 19, Parsoon Sinha, Harshit Chhikara and Mohit Mittal, all 21, and Pankaj Shah, 32, conspired to misuse the contacts and called up the policy holders, collected details about their Aadhar card, Pan card, bank accounts, debit card, etc. Later, pretending to be the policy holders, they called up the insurance firm and gathered more information about particular policy holders, said police. They then called back the policy holders, especially senior citizens, and lured them with generous offers. They asked the victims to pay premium, and fees for affidavit, policy tax, GST, NOC, updating the policy, top-up etc. “They took the money into their own bank accounts. We have traced seven bank accounts so far. We are trying to get more details,” said inspector Sanjay Govilkar, in-charge of the cyber police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-6-held-from-delhi-for-duping-70-yr-old-of-rs-74-6l-with-better-insurance-lure/articleshow/85500134.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The police said Mohammed Naeem Malik (42) and Shahzad Ansari (26), originally from Incholi in Merut, Uttar Pradesh, said their small-time trade suffered during last year’s lockdown. The police said the duo then decided to opt for an easier way for making money during the pandemic. Malik would approach the targets by identifying himself as “Baba Miyan Ali Shah, gold medalist”. He reached Aurangabad with Ansari about 25 days ago and was living in a rented accommodation in the Jadhavwadi area. Malik and Ansari started their operation from a set-up in the vicinity of the Doodh Dairy signal, got pamphlets printed with the message on their ability to solve domestic, financial and black magic problems and distributed the documents. They would charge Rs251 from each person visiting them with their problems. The accused came on police’s radar after one such pamphlet reached the former. The police laid a trap for two days and arrested the duo on Friday under relevant sections of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013. Kranti Chowk police senior inspector Ganpat Darade told TOI, “Preliminary probe revealed that the accused belonged to poor families and were scrap traders. After losing their business during the pandemic, they adopted the way to fool people and make money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scrap-dealer-aide-try-black-magic-fraud-after-lockdown-blow-held/articleshow/85495329.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||Pune: Tomato at Rs 2 per kg in Gultekdi, rate to catch up in fortnight||PUNE: Tomatoes are selling dirt cheap, cheaper than one kg of salt or a packet of chips, in the Gultekdi Market Yard and in other wholesale markets across the district because of a glut in supply, forcing growers to throw away the kitchen staple in several places. The Agriculture Produce Market Committee-run wholesale market in Gultekdi received 1,356 quintals of tomatoes on Friday which traders bought from Rs2 to Rs10 per kg, depending on the quality. Similar rates were reported from the Narayangaon market, among the largest markets for tomatoes in the state. The slump in the wholesale price had little or no effect in the retail markets or at local mandis in Pune, where it was still being sold for Rs10 per kg or more, depending on the quality. Sandesh Gupta of Vishrantwadi said he was bought tomatoes for over Rs12 per kg on Friday. Pimple Saudagar resident Amit Singh said, “I bought them in the range of Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg.” Datta Kalamkar, head of the vegetables section in Gultekdi Market Yard, said, “The market has been getting tomatoes in large quantities from various tehsils of Pune district and from the other neighbouring districts causing prices to crash in the last few days.” They received about 30,000 crates of tomatoes on Friday. One crate contains about 20kg. “Each crate with good quality tomatoes was auctioned from Rs30 to Rs100. But, the crates with medium and sub-standard crop were not auctioned as the traders did not bid for them. As a result, the farmers had to throw away their harvest in open areas,” Sanjay Kale, chairman of the Naryangaon market, said. Kale said a new virus that affected tomatoes in Junnar tehsil halted the export of the crop. Growers had to invest extra capital on pesticides to tackle the virus, he added. Climate change has triggered more virus attacks on the tomatoes, according to scientists from the Indian Agriculture Research Institute in Pune. Exports to other countries have dwindled in the last year during the pandemic. Santosh Kolhe, a tomato grower from Junnar tehsil, said he had to put up Rs2 lakh to cultivate tomatoes on three acres of land. “Most of it was for pesticides. I have 200 crates that were not sold in the auction on Friday. I cannot even recover my transportation cost. There are hundreds of farmers who are in the same situation,” he said. Some growers had abandoned their plantations as they could not afford to pay labourers. “Plucking, packing and transportation costs run into several thousands of rupees. At the current rates, we will not able to recover the costs. As a result, I had abandoned the plantation and told local citizens to take it away for free so that I will not have to rope in labourers for plucking,” Vikas Bhujbal, a grower from Khed tehsil, said. Wholesale traders and officials from the various markets in Pune said tomato prices will increase after two weeks. “Restaurants, hotels, food courts and eateries have re-opened and are operating for longer hours. It will increase the demand for tomatoes, and the prices will go up,” Ajay Tengle, commission agent at Chakan vegetable market, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tomato-at-rs-2/kg-in-gultekdi-rate-to-catch-up-in-fortnight/articleshow/85500126.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Pune||Pune records marked rise in dengue cases in August||PUNE: The city is witnessing a significant spike in dengue cases this month, besides chikungunya, though the latter’s number is comparatively on the lower side. Going by the records of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), private hospitals have registered 274 dengue cases in the last 20 days as against 200 cases throughout the last month (July). Pathologist Avanti Golwilkar Mehendale, head of A G Diagnostics Lab — one of the accredited and biggest private laboratories in the city, said, “We had detected 422 patients with dengue IgM antibody in July this year. The number has gone up to 505 this month — in the last 20 days.” An administrative official of Jehangir Hospital said, “A sizable number of patients are coming positive for dengue antigen and antibody tests. We have recorded about 62 positive dengue cases since June. Sporadic cases of chikungunya are also being seen.” Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans said, “We have about 10 dengue patients admitted. Most of them are stable.” “Dengue patients turning critically ill has not been observed much this year,” he added. Rainwater accumulation and poor upkeep have sent dengue cases soaring in some parts of the city. Activists underlined that the unprecedented number of Covid cases in April-May led to half-hearted pre-monsoon measures, leading to the rise in mosquito-borne illnesses. PMC’s insect control department has recorded a total of 1,692 dengue cases this year, so far. Of them, private hospitals reported 1,557 cases and the government-run sentinel centres reported 135 cases. Besides, PMC recorded 84 cases of chikungunya at the sentinel centres in the city. General physician Sanjay Nagarkar of Apollo Spectra Hospital said, “The majority of the patients coming to the outpatient department (OPD) for treatment suffer from fever. Their number has increased significantly over the last two weeks.” Kirti Prakash Kotla, a consultant pathologist at Apollo Diagnostics in Pune, said, “In July, we had detected 10 dengue patients and a chikungunya patient. Now, the number has increased. Daily around 10 to 15 patients are coming for testing and around 50% of them are turning out to be positive for dengue, typhoid and chikungunya. If diagnosed early, the patient can be successfully treated with timely intervention. So, if you have a fever, seek medical attention instead of ignoring it.” Physician Aniket Joshi, a member of the Association of Physicians of India, Pune branch, said, “Most hospitals across the city have dengue patients admitted in them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-records-marked-rise-in-dengue-cases-in-august/articleshow/85500145.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Parents and teachers, especially in districts with a low weekly positivity rate or in those registering hardly any cases, wanted children to attend in-person classes in schools, added Pawar. Earlier, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced that classes 8 to 12 in schools in Covid-free urban areas would reopen from August 17. In rural areas, those classes had started earlier, and they were allowed to re-open physical teaching for classes 5 to 8.

Public works minister Eknath Shinde also announced that the revised deadline for the stretch from Nagpur to Shirdi is now December 2021, and for up to Thane it is December 2022. He ruled out cost escalation due to delay in completion of the eight-lane project. Shinde, Gaikwad, additional collector Nishikant Sukhe, Ramtek MP Krupal Tumane, Ramtek MLA Ashish Jaiswal, Sena leaders including Kiran Pandav and others inspected package-I of the 701km project on Friday. Gaikwad said, “Toll will be as per guidelines issued by central government in 2008. Light vehicles will be charged Rs1.65 per km. Toll will be for exact km used on expressway. Toll for heavy vehicles will be thrice the rate for light vehicles.” He also said, “Financial progress of the project is at 64%, while physical progress is 79% on the Nagpur-Shirdi stretch and 70% for entire project. Deadline is 36 months from initial stage, and will be achieved if one considers exact date of commencement of work.” Gaikwad said 40% labourers left work due to Covid-19. “Now, everything has been streamlined; 35,000 are working on the project and 5,500 machines are engaged,” he said. During his visit last December, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had set deadline of May 1 for completion of work from Nagpur to Shirdi. Shinde, also urban development minister, said efforts were made to meet the deadline but could not be possible due to the pandemic. Shinde said work of three-four of 20 nodes (townships) has been started. “The project is very important and will be a game-changer for the state. The expressway will also be connected to JNPT and areas not falling on the corridor like Konkan through various ways. It will encourage industries and other sectors to come to Vidarbha and Marathwada. Sectors like textile, tourism, IT and agriculture will be boosted by developing 20 nodes,” he said. Shinde said the plan is to establish solar power plants of 250MW along the corridor. “We have planned to plant over 11 lakh trees. This is in addition to existing greenery,” he said. Shinde said there will be no comprise on quality. “We are developing the project so that vehicles will operate at a speed of 150km per hour. Travel timing from Nagpur to Mumbai will be reduced from 15 hours to 6-7 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-1100-toll-for-one-way-trip-on-mumbai-nagpur-e-way/articleshow/85503273.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Pune||Pune: One more abduction-extortion case against gang of 6, including woman||PUNE: Interrogation of a six-member gang, including a woman, charged with abducting, and extorting a Panvel-based builder revealed that members of the group were repeat offenders. The Kondhwa police said the gang members — with three more accomplices — had entrapped a 20-year-old student from Hadapsar last year and extorted his family of Rs20 lakh. This had happened at Inamdar Vasti, Koregaon Mul and Uruli Kanchan between October 15 and 20 last year, police said. A fresh case was registered in this regard against nine people with the Loni Kalbhor police on Thursday. The gang had deployed the same modus operandi — the woman would first get in touch with the target on social media and become friendly with him. Then, she would invite him to meet her at a specific spot after which, the others would waylay and attack the victim, and threaten to implicate him in a false rape case if he did not pay them. “The student in his FIR said he had become friendly with the woman and had a physical relationship with her. The last time he met her, in Uruli Kanchan, her accomplices — including her brother — set upon the youth and robbed him of Rs3,000,” sub-inspector Nitin Shinde from the Loni Kalbhor police said on Friday. “The suspects then forcibly drove the student around in a car, halted it outside the Yavat police station in rural Pune and threatened to register a rape case against him and demanded Rs 50 lakh to settle the matter. The student called up and sought help from his parents,” Shinde said. The student told police that his parents negotiated with the suspects and agreed to pay Rs 20 lakh. “They borrowed money from friends and paid the suspects. The youth did not register an FIR back then out of fear of defamation,” Shinde further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-more-abduction-extortion-case-against-gang-of-6-including-woman/articleshow/85500168.cms||---

The court was hearing the habeas corpus petition filed by the transman before HC Madurai bench seeking to set the woman at liberty. He said he and the woman were in love and decided to continue their consensual relationship. According to him, the woman had left her parental home in April after intimating the police that she wanted to lead her own life. They both left their native places and went to Chennai. In May, the woman’s parents arrived along with police officials and forcibly separated them and took her to their home. Alleging that the police action was illegal and the woman has been illegally detained by her father, the petitioner had moved the court. Pursuant to the earlier direction, police produced the woman before the court. A division bench of Justices V Bharathidasan and J Nisha Banu observed that when they inquired with the petitioner and the woman, both stated that they have been in a relationship for more than three years. The woman also stated that she was aware that the petitioner was a transman and wanted to live with him. She also stated that she was not willing to go with her father. The petitioner was also willing to take the woman with him. Taking into consideration the fact that the woman was a major and she is willing to go with the petitioner on her own volition, the judges set the woman at liberty to go along with the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-order-helps-transman-to-reunite-with-woman/articleshow/85500174.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Nashik||Highway stretch between Ghoti to Kasara proving risky for motorists||Nashik: A 20-km stretch between Ghoti and Kasara, on the Kasara ghat, is proving to be risky for motorists due to the massive potholes left after heavy rainfall. This year, already, 24 people have lost their lives here so far. Last year, 27 people lost their lives in this section, according to the data provided by the Nashik division of the highway police. While rash driving is one of the main reasons for the accidents, the poor condition of the road makes driving difficult for the motorists. API Amol Valzade of the Ghoti traffic aid post of the highway police said over-speeding, wrong-side driving, illegal parking on the road-side were the main causes of accidents on the stretch. “We have been taking continuous action against these offenders. We also have a speed-gun enabled vehicle to check speeding motorists. They are issued challans daily,” said Valzade. Every year, during the rainy season, the highway in this section gets damaged due to the heavy rainfall in the Igatpuri taluka. Even now, this stretch of the highway has several potholes. Valzade said the continuous rainfall in Igatpuri section causes damage to the road every year. “This is despite the fact that every year, pre-monsoon work is carried out by the toll company,” he said. Abhay Kulkarni, president of the Nashik First organization which operates the Children’s Traffic Education Park in the city, said, “The condition of the road is extremely bad. There are potholes all over the highway, but mainly near Igatpuri and Shahpur. The practice of NHAI of filling potholes with paver blocks is also wrong.” Kulkarni added the distance from Nashik to Thane, which is approximately 150 km is usually covered by motorists a little over two hours. Now, it is taking around six hours. Vivek Kolgaonkar, a Nashik resident who frequents Mumbai, said the potholes begin immediately after the toll nakas. “Motorists end up meeting with accidents while trying to negotiate the potholes. I have also made verbal complaints at the toll nakas to repair the roads since they are collecting the toll for giving good roads to motorists,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/highway-stretch-between-ghoti-to-kasara-proving-risky-for-motorists/articleshow/85495348.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by V Lakshmanan, a resident of Kalvirayan Viduthy village in the Pudukottai district. He stated that his daughter L Gowri, who is studying Class XI in a government school in Thanjavur district, had developed a project titled ‘National Rural Development Research Project’. The government counsel submitted that the authorities had appreciated the petitioner’s daughter who came up with the project, however, it is a policy decision to be taken by the state government, which would have monetary involvement. The counsel submitted that if the government takes a policy decision in this regard, then the project proposal would be taken into consideration. He further submitted that consideration by the state government should not be mistaken for accepting the proposal given by the petitioner’s daughter. In view of the submissions made by the government counsel, the counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petition may be closed. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar closed the petition. It maybe recalled that during the earlier hearing, the court appreciated the girl on seeing her comprehensive data collection about her village and asked her to be present before the court. Gowri who appeared before the court through video conferencing explained about her project. When the court asked while there were officials such as VAOs available for this purpose, Gowri replied that the post of ‘village collectors’ with knowledge about the rural areas should be created as they could directly deal with the villagers and redress their grievances. The court had asked the girl to submit a revised report by highlighting the salient features of her project for the same to be looked into by the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-closes-plea-to-implement-girls-project-to-develop-villages/articleshow/85500163.cms||---

The report ranks UP fifth among all states by value of exports during 2020-21. The report attributes the achievement to a conducive policy environment for manufacturing and exports. The state’s exports amounted to USD 16.4 billion in the financial year, it says. However, despite registering an annual average growth of 6% from 2016-17 to 2020-21, Covid-19 played a spoiler for the state in the past financial year where merchandise exports fell by 3.5% compared to the previous financial year where it had exported goods to the tune of USD 17 million. On Saturday, Sitharaman will also launch 'Ubharte Sitaare Fund' for export-oriented small and mid-sized companies jointly sponsored by Exim Bank and SIDBI and a report on the Sports Good manufacturing in UP. “During 2020-21, merchandise exports from UP registered a year of decline of 3.5%, after several consecutive years of growth. The decline was largely on account of the Covid-19 associated disruptions to international trade,” the report says, adding however, that the decline during the year was relatively muted as compared to the decline in merchandise exports from India as a whole. The report also highlights UP’s massive untapped potential for merchandise exports, pegging it at nearly USD 12.2 billion. “UP has the potential to achieve exports of USD 30 billion in the short to medium term. While sectors in which the state is traditionally strong shall continue to be important from the exports perspective, there is a need to diversify the exports basket. In the short to medium term, the focus of the exports strategy should be on sectors where the state possesses comparative advantage,” the report recommends. It adds that the state will have to provide incentives for encouraging capacity building in sectors where there is a rising global demand but in which the state’s exports are currently not competitive. During 2020-21, UP accounted for nearly 90% of the country’s exports of saddlery and 12% of harness. In categories such as silk carpet, processed meat, buffalo meat, sheep and goat meat, telecom instruments and finished leather, UP accounted for more than half of the merchandise exports. Sports goods is also an important export item for UP, with the state accounting for nearly a third of the overall exports from India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-merchandise-export-grew-faster-than-natl-avg/articleshow/85502363.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Mumbai, incidentally, conducted 56,566 tests in the last 24 hours, the highest since the pandemic began. In contrast, the state reported a significant dip on Friday in cases and deaths — 4,365 and 105, respectively, taking the total caseload to 64.2 lakh and the death tally to 1.4 lakh. The city’s overall numbers are 7.4 lakh cases and 15,941 deaths. BMC officials attributed the slight rise to 50-thousand-plus testing over the past two days. On Friday, close to 38,000 of the 56,566 tests were rapid antigen tests and the remaining RT-PCR. On Thursday, 52,482 tests were run. “We decided to step up testing as a trial run as in future we may have to upscale our daily testing capacity,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The BMC had been conducting around 35,000 tests during the week, while the number dips during the weekend. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid task force, said: “The daily caseload in Mumbai hasn’t reduced as much as it has in, say, Delhi. This proves the endemicity of the virus in Mumbai and underlines the need to take vaccines and wear a mask.” State government officials said there has not been any significant rise in cases in the first week since the easing of curbs, but the health department is keeping a close watch. “The main challenge will be during the festivals,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-runs-highest-ever-tests-cases-climb-above-300/articleshow/85500216.cms||---

The incident took place within Badavane police station limits near Channapatna Circle, and has created a sense of fear among people living in the area. The video was made by an unknown person sitting inside a car. In the video, two miscreants were allegedly assaulting a youth lying on the ground amid heavy rain, at the junction of Mysuru road and the NH-75 bypass. A man who tried to intervene was also thrashed. Superintendent of police R Srinivas Gowda said, “The incident in the viral video happened a fortnight back, and the accused were under influence of alcohol. The three youths in the video are locals who are known to each other. It was a case of revenge. The youth who was beaten, sustained no major injuries, and is safe now. We have registered a suo motu case, and an investigation is on. Those involved in the assault have been identified and will be taken into custody after being interrogated. It was raining heavily when the incident took place, and hence the public didn’t notice it, and those crossing the junction didn’t inform us.” The SP urged the public to call 112 if they come across any illegal activities in their area, including online fraud and chain snatching. He said that the identity of the people who bring these crimes to their notice will be kept confidential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/video-of-assault-in-hassan-goes-viral/articleshow/85495904.cms||---

---||Agra||Former Uttar Pradesh minister accused of triple talaq by fourth wife jailed||AGRA: Chaudhary Basheer, 45, a former minister in the Mulayam Singh government who switched parties three times before becoming an Independent politician has been sent to jail after his fourth wife accused him of pronouncing triple talaq. “Basheer was arrested on Thursday and jailed on court orders. A case was registered under Section 504 (intentional insult giving provocation) of the IPC and sections 3 and 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act (talaq void and illegal, and punishment for it) after his wife Nagma filed a complaint,” Agra SSP Muniraj G said. Nagma, 30, had married Basheer in 2012. The couple has two sons, aged seven and eight. “On July 23, I came to know that my husband was going to marry for the sixth time,” she wrote in her complaint. She had been living with her parents for three years, she added, because she “was harassed by him and his sisters who would beat me up, abuse me and torture me mentally.” She finally decided to go home to Basheer and confront him. “He abused me again and pronounced triple talaq, forcing me to leave. I sought help from police but did not get any. As a former minister, he is influential,” she said in her complaint. She had been posting videos on social media, asking police for help. In response, Basheer had also started sharing audio clips in which he denied her allegations and said he was being framed for political reasons. “He has a dozen criminal cases pending against him for rioting, attempt to murder, loot and abduction,” a police official said. Basheer had started out as a shoe trader. With his hold over the local Muslim community, he first ran for elections in 2002 as a BSP candidate from Agra Cantonment and won. A year later, he married Gazala Lari, MLA from Salempur. It was his first marriage. That year, 2003, he and Lari switched over to SP and he became a minister of state. In 2007, he contested the Agra Cantonment seat again but lost. In 2012, he jumped ship again and joined Congress. The party didn’t give him a ticket and he dropped out. In 2017, he contested the Agra South seat as an Independent and lost. That year, he also ran for Agra mayor but lost. The streak continued in 2019, when he contested the Firozabad Lok Sabha seat as an Independent, losing again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ex-up-minister-accused-of-triple-talaq-by-4th-wife-jailed/articleshow/85495379.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PGI to be part of global study on Covid impact on childhood cancers||CHANDIGARH: PGI is one of the seven centres to be selected for the first multicentric global study on the impact of Covid on childhood cancers. Recruitment recently started in the institute to understand if there was any impact of Covid on such children from March 2020 till December this year. The study will continue till the middle of next year. Oher centres in India include AIIMS Rishikesh, Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana, AIIMS Bhubaneswar, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna and King George's Medical University, Lucknow. The Global Health Research Group on Children’s Non-Communicable Diseases (Global Children’s NCDs) is currently undertaking this first international study to determine variation in paediatric cancer management during the Covid pandemic and the impact on childhood cancer outcomes in India as well as globally. “We had seen that non-Covid treatments were neglected during the pandemic. Children with cancer is a small and vulnerable group which has been affected quite a bit. So we thought to participate in this international trial, where we would understand how low and middle income countries have been affected,” said Dr Nitin James Peter, one of the investigators from the department of paediatric surgery, PGI. He added, “We would see if they missed consultation, surgery or treatment during this period. Unlike other cancers, paediatric cancers are treated for curative intent as we have to look at the next 60 years and above for future impact.” There would be around 250 children from PGI who can be found eligible for recruitment in the observational study. The department of surgical sciences at Oxford university is the primary host institute. The primary aim of the study is to undertake the first large-scale, geographically comprehensive, multicentre, international cohort study to determine variation in paediatric cancer management in lower middle and higher income countries across the globe during the pandemic. The secondary aims are to determine short and medium-term outcome of paediatric cancer patients during the Covid pandemic and build global research capacity to empower individuals to conduct further research into children’s non communicable diseases globally. Patients will be recruited consecutively into the study, with a 12 -month follow-up period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-to-be-part-of-global-study-on-covid-impact-on-childhood-cancers/articleshow/85497830.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Lucknow||No Sunday curbs in Uttar Pradesh, but night curfew stays||LUCKNOW: Rakshabandhan celebrations on August 22 will not be hampered by the Sunday curfew being continued since April. As active Covid-19 cases in the state came down to 408 on Friday, CM Yogi Adityanath issued directions to lift all curbs, except the night curfew which will remain in place from 10 pm to 6 am. This will be implemented from the coming Sunday. “The positivity rate in the state has been 0.01% for several days now and active cases in the state are nearly 400. With festival season starting, the CM decided that there was no need for restrictions during the day and hence, curfew on Sunday’s is also lifted. Markets will now be shut on days during which they observed their weekly closure before the Covid-19,” said a government spokesperson. The relief comes for the state after more than four months. When the second wave started peaking in April, the government permitted district magistrates to implement a night curfew. On April 8, the night curfew which had been implemented across the state by then, was rolled into a prolonged curfew which was lifted only about a month later while weekend curbs remained. On August 14, the government did away with Saturday restrictions and now, with Rakhi being observed this Sunday, all curbs have been lifted. The state is preparing to start holding offline school for classes 1-5 from September 1 and for classes 6-8 from Monday, August 23. Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma had earlier said that if cases start rising again, teaching could move online once again. The restrictions have been removed, said the official, on the condition that people continue wearing masks, observing physical distance and using sanitizers. If active cases in any district rise above 500, the government has said that restrictions will be brought back. Currently, the highest number of active cases in any district is 37 --- in Mainpuri and Prayagraj. The government has also allowed holding of coaching classes. Swimming pools continue to remain closed. Malls, restaurants, bars and street food stalls can open, subject to a maximum of 50% occupancy. Cinemas can also function, subject to a maximum occupancy of 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-sunday-curbs-in-up-but-night-curfew-stays/articleshow/85502420.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Madurai||Police aspirant’s appeal dismissed||Madurai: The Madras high court has upheld the order of a single bench which had dismissed a plea by a police aspirant challenging the physical efficiency test coding sheet with respect to the 400m running event conducted during recruitment process to the post of sub-inspector of police. S Krishnamoorthy had participated in the recruitment process including written exam, physical efficiency test, and had obtained 63.50 marks. Since he belongs to the MBC/DNC and the cut-off mark fixed for the category was 64 marks, he was not called for the interview. Claiming that he had completed the 400m running within 69 seconds which was within the stipulated time of 70 seconds, he had filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench seeking to verify his physical efficiency test coding sheet and the video footage with respect to the event. However, the TNUSRB contended that he had completed the race in 70.47 seconds. Referring to a full bench order of this court which held that a writ petition for correcting any error may ordinarily be not maintainable, involving factual disputes, the single bench had dismissed the petition. Challenging the order, the aspirant (appellant) had preferred the present appeal. Hearing the appeal, a division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar took note of the fact that the coding sheet was signed by the appellant as well as the chairman and members of the sub-committee appointed for the selection of sub-inspectors. Refusing to accept the contention of the appellant who stated that he had signed a black coding sheet, the judges observed that he cannot challenge the said document now. Observing that they do not find any ground to interfere with the order passed by the single bench, the judges dismissed the appeal on the ground that it is devoid of merits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/police-aspirants-appeal-dismissed/articleshow/85500200.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Pune||Framing of charges put off till Sept 3 as defence seeks copy of forensic report||Pune: Special UAPA judge S R Navander on Friday adjourned the proceeding for framing of charges in the Narendra Dabholkar murder case till September 3 after the lawyer appearing for Vikram Bhave, one of the five charged accused, moved a plea that the CBI had not yet furnished to the court or the accused a copy of the Gujarat forensic science director’s report related to a firearm recovered from one of the alleged two shooters. Veteran rationalist Dabholkar was shot dead on August 20, 2013. The CBI took over the investigation of the murder case in 2014. It first arrested Panvel-based ENT surgeon and Sanatan Sanstha activist Virendrasinh Tawde in June 2016. Later, the agency arrested Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, both accused of opening fire at Dabholkar, and Mumbai lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar and his assistant Vikram Bhave, both charged with assisting the shooters in various activities related to the crime. Punalekar and Bhave are out on bail. The CBI has so far filed chargesheets against all the five accused more than a year-and-a-half ago. The case has since been pending for framing of charges that marks commencement of the much-awaited trial. When arguments over framing of charges were to begin on Friday, lawyer Prakash Salsingikar, representing Bhave, moved the plea regarding the Gujarat forensic report. “We brought to the court’s notice the Bombay high court’s order of January 20, 2017, related to the Gujarat forensic report and submitted that the CBI must clarify its position on whether or not it was relying on this report as it was crucial for the defence to prepare its case,” Salsingikar told TOI. Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi said, “The special court sought reasons from the defence lawyer as to under what provisions of law the plea (for forensic report) was being filed. The court asked the defence to argue on draft charges based on the documents supplied by the CBI. The judge further brought to the defence lawyer’s notice that bail pleas on behalf of the accused were filed before him (in Pune) and the Bombay high court (HC). The judge asked the defence if they were withdrawing either of the pleas from Pune and HC.” Suryavanshi said, “The judge also observed that the defence was filing new pleas (every time). The court took Bhave’s plea regarding FSL report on record and directed the CBI to seek if the report is there or not and deferred the hearing on draft charges till September 3.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/framing-of-charges-put-off-till-sept-3-as-defence-seeks-copy-of-forensic-report/articleshow/85500207.cms||Vishwas Kothari

In the two-page letter, Gadkari, who is the Union minister for road transport and highways, wrote that a group of Sainiks were threatening contractors and officials working on NHAI projects in the state. Directly addressing Gadkari during his online speech at the inaugural function of an additional stretch of Nagpur Metro network, Thackeray said, “You are a soft man to speak to but your written words are very harsh. You are committed to work and so are we. We will follow our party’s morals of never allowing obstruction in public welfare work. I assure you that I will not let anyone come in the way of development.” The CM added that the state is taking efforts to ensure that Nagpur is counted among the best cities of the country. “To make sure that the development is fast, all parties need to join hands. We need to keep aside politics and bring people together,” said Thackeray. Gadkari, who was among the earlier speakers, promised to provide Rs 1 lakh crore for the development of Mumbai and Thane cities. “I am ready to provide Rs 1lakh crore for development works in Maharashtra. I have already sanctioned Rs 1,500 crore for Samruddhi Mahamarg. The work of Nagpur-Mumbai Samruddhi Mahamarg has been started by my ministry along with the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation. All the funds required by the state will be provided by the Centre,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/want-development-no-speed-breakers-cm-tells-gadkari/articleshow/85499871.cms||Manka Behl

Annamalai was talking to reporters at Tuticorin airport before taking part in various events in Tirunelveli on Friday. Commenting on the 100 days of the DMK rule in the state, he said that it was a mixture of “little sweetness and a lot of bitterness and hotness.” The little sweetness is the good coordination they had with the Centre to fight the second wave of Covid-19 and in bringing down the cases. Poll promises remaining unfulfilled were among the bitterness he listed out against the state government. The BJP leader accused the DMK of lot of unnecessary comments starting with mentioning the BJP government at the Centre as ‘Union government’. He also accused the DMK of targeting and arresting the BJP cadre, especially those in the IT wing who had made posts (in social media) and active functionaries. “We took a lot of efforts to bring them out,” he added. He justified the BJP supporting the AIADMK MLAs in walking out of the assembly over the Kodanad estate case. “There is nothing wrong in what the AIADMK MLAs did. Taking up the case clearly looks like political vendetta,” he said. Annamalai was accompanied by Union minister of state for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying and information and broadcasting L Murugan and other senior party functionaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stop-vendetta-politics-focus-on-third-wave-annamalai/articleshow/85500236.cms||---

The flat had been locked for the past six months. Though the burglars had blackened the nine CCTV cameras in the society, footage retrieved by the police showed that they arrived in a Hyundai Santro car. Police said the family that owns the two-bedroom flat has relocated to Germany. “Six months ago, the flat owner had come to Pune following a death in the family. It has since remained closed. Laxman Koli, the caretaker of the flat, has registered a complaint,” an officer from the Hinjewadi police said. The burglary was discovered early on Friday when a resident on the third floor was not able to open his front door. ““He called our watchman to open the door. When he came out, he saw two nearby flats were locked from outside and the lock of one flat was broken,” Rahul Kamble, a resident, told TOI. The house was found ransacked; the police and caretaker were immediately alerted. “I contacted the owner, who said he kept Rs2 lakh in a bag inside a cupboard. We found that bag, but the cash missing,” Koli told TOI. “We have 12 CCTV cameras installed in our society. We found nine of them blackened and one broken,” Kamble said. The society retrieved footage from the three other cameras. “Four men arrived around 1.30am in a car. They scaled the wall of the neighbouring society and entered our compound,” Kamble said. The men were masked and wearing jackets. Another resident said, ““One resident busy in office work had heard some noise, but paid no heed,” he said. The society’s watchman locked the main gate around 11pm. “I sat outside till midnight and then went to sleep,” the watchman said. A police officer said the car used by the burglars was reported stolen in Chikhali. He said that the same car was spotted at a society. “They made an unsuccessful attempt of burglary in that society,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-drive-to-bavdhan-flat-in-car-flee-with-rs-2-lakh/articleshow/85500254.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The farmers say the distributary is of no use when they are not getting water from it. They have threatened to oppose any political leader visiting these villages and to block roads. These villages are situated at the tail of Kotla branch originating from Sirhind feeder canal which gives supplies to Ghuman distributary, from where two minors provide canal water to seven villages in the area. Out of these two, Bhai Bakhtaur minor supplying water to these three villages has not been working for long and farmers have to use agriculture pump sets to extract water. In Punjab, 73% underground water is used through tubewells for irrigation purposes and in 27% area canal water is used to irrigate the fields. “Earlier too we have held protests and water resources department officials come and return after making assurances. Now we have decided not to sit back and organise bigger protests and stop entry of political leaders in our villages,” said Ramgarh Bhundar farmer Gurmail Singh and Nachhatar Singh of Kotbhara village. Water resources department executive engineer Jagmeet Singh said, “The 2km long link channel was constructed and underground pipes laid to supply canal water to these villages. There was some leakage and there is also some scarcity of canal water in the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/not-getting-water-for-irrigation-farmers-of-3-bathinda-villages-fill-canal-with-sand/articleshow/85500248.cms||Neel Kamal

It also said that the ambush in Kanpur district’s Bikru village after July 2 midnight was the result of "poor planning" and an "intelligence failure". The commission’s 825-page report was tabled in the state assembly by parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna on Thursday. The commission has concluded in the report that Vikas Dubey had been informed about the raid on his house in advance and that Dubey had the patronage of the police, administrative and revenue authorities. Eight police personnel, including a DySP, were killed during a raid on Dubey’s house at Bikru village in the intervening night of July 2-3, 2020. Later, Dubey, who had escaped after the ambush, was arrested in Ujjain and shot dead in an encounter when a police vehicle carrying him to Kanpur met with an accident and he tried to escape from custody, the police had said. After a magestrial probe, which had also given a clean chit to the police, the UP government had set up a judicial commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, on the directions of the Supreme Court. Other members of the commission, which completed its report in April this year, were retired Allahabad HC judge Shashi Kant Agarwal and former UP DGP KL Gupta. "The evidence adduced in the case supports the police’s version of the incident… Dr RS Mishra, who was on the panel of doctors, conducted the post-mortem and clarified that the injuries found on his person (Dubey) could have been caused as per the version of the police," the judicial commission’s report says. "Nobody came forward from the public or media to contradict the police version and no evidence was filed in rebuttal. Richa Dubey, wife of Vikas, filed an affidavit calling the incident a fake encounter but she did not appear before the commission," the report says. Providing a detailed description of the July 10, 2020 encounter, the commission says in its report that a herd of cows and buffaloes began crossing the road when the vehicle carrying Dubey reached Kanpur Nagar in Sachendi area. "The driver of the speeding vehicle carrying Vikas Dubey tried to avoid an accident and braked to stop the vehicle, but it skidded and turned over to the left after hitting the cemented divider. This sudden accident caused momentary unconsciousness to some of the police personnel sitting in the vehicle. The accused, taking advantage of the situation, snatched the revolver of Ramakant Pachauri and came out by opening the door fitted in the back of the said vehicle," the report says. The findings state that "Dubey started running to his left on a kutcha road. On being chased, he started firing from the looted pistol. He was challenged and asked to stop. He did not stop firing and did not heed warnings to surrender. He injured two policemen, and one bullet hit Tej Bahadur Singh in the chest but he was wearing a bullet proof jacket so he escaped injury. In self-defence, the police fired at the accused who fell to the ground on being injured," the report states. The commission’s report also states that some members of the police team from Chaubeypur police station, which went to raid the house of Vikas Dubey in the intervening night of July 2 and 3, 2020, had warned him in advance about the raid, which gave him the opportunity to summon armed associates and prepare to retaliate. "There was total failure on the part of the intelligence unit in Kanpur in collecting information about the criminal activities of and possession of sophisticated weapons (legal and illegal) by Vikas Dubey and his gang," it says. "No proper caution was taken in preparations to conduct the raid as 38 to 40 police personnel reached village Bikru and none of them was wearing a bullet-proof jacket. Only 18 of them had arms (firearms), the rest had gone empty-handed or with sticks," the report states. The commission has also said that "it is evident that Vikas Dubey and his associates were involved in all sorts of criminal activities, and had the patronage of the police, administrative and revenue authorities. Some of these authorities had very good relations with them and rendered assistance in getting arms licences and passports, and in land-grabbing, and for other facilities, such as fair price shop licences, etc. Such assistance was in utter disregard to the statutory provisions of the Acts and Rules, as the same had been violated with impunity…" The report adds that "no authority had ever investigated any case properly so far as Vikas Dubey and his associates are concerned". The report also mentions that "some independent people" deposed about Dubey’s criminal activities and "also his proximity to leaders of the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party" but didn’t corroborate their claims. The commission mentioned a deposition by Sanjai Mishra that the late Harikishan Srivastava, BSP MLA from Chaubeypur, "had extended his blessings and patronage to Vikas Dubey". But the report said that this was done based on "hearsay, as both of them stated that they were deposing on the basis of information received through media — print and electronic". The report said that "they did not have any personal knowledge about any political patronage by any politician" to Dubey. The report also says that the investigation into the murder of Santosh Shukla, chairman of the Contract Labour Board with minister of state rank, was "a total farce". Dubey was an accused in the case. The commission has concluded that the "investigation in any case lodged against them (Dubey and his associates) was never impartial". The commission’s report also says that Dubey and his associates got bail orders from courts easily and quickly as there had been no serious opposition from the state authorities and government advocates. "There is nothing on record to show that his (Dubey) cases had ever sincerely been contested by government advocates before the high court," the report says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dubey-encounter-judicial-panel-gives-clean-chit-to-police/articleshow/85502462.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Quoting two letters recovered from Pingle’s bag, Gupta said, “The victim had developed suicide tendency as he was in depression. A detailed inquiry will be held on the plea filed by his wife with the Bundgarden police.” Gupta said, “The letters read that Pingle was facing numerous problems related to his sister’s death, her in-laws, job, police verification and other issues for six months.” Pingle on Wednesday had set himself ablaze on the city police commissioner’s office premises over alleged delay in granting him a character verification certificate. He succumbed to 75% burn injuries at a private hospital on Thursday. “Investigations have revealed that Pingle had applied for the post of an office boy in a private firm. He was asked to submit a police verification report. On July 1, Pingle had filed an application for verification with the Khadki police, but he had mentioned wrong address. He again applied for it on July 22,” he said. The Pune commissioner of police (CP) said, “The verification process takes 30 days to complete inquiry. An inquiry into Pingle’s case revealed that a person with similar name had criminal cases registered with Kothrud, Samarth and Sahakarnagar police stations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/khadki-man-ended-life-due-to-domestic-issues-top-cop/articleshow/85500294.cms||---

The initiative will help avoid crowding at immersion spots in the city. Last year, the NMC provided ammonium bicarbonate to people at its six divisional offices, but the response was quite poor. Therefore, this year, the civic body has decided to distribute ammonium bicarbonate at Ganesh stalls in the city so that people can get it while purchasing idols for their homes. Ammonium bicarbonate is mixed with water in a bucket, after which the idols are immersed in it, thereby facilitating easier and complete dissolution of the idol. The remains of the idol can be used as manure or soil conditioner for gardens. The NMC authority wants people to opt eco-friendly immersion at their homes if they install Ganesh idols made of Plaster of Paris (PoP) by using ammonium bicarbonate. Director of the solid waste management of the civic body Avesh Palod said that, this year, they are focusing on in-house immersion of Ganesh idols to avoid huge crowd at immersion spots in the city. “Every year, the NMC auctions stalls for sale of Ganesh idols at various locations in the city. We have plans to make available ammonium bicarbonate at every location where Ganesh idols are sold during the ten-day-long festival,” said Palod. “This will help boost household immersion and will help to avoid overcrowding at immersion spaces in the city,” he added. Last year, the NMC had distributed 9.25 tonne ammonium bicarbonate to around 2,000 people for household immersion of idols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-provide-ganesh-idol-buyers-with-ammonium-bicarbonate-for-immersion/articleshow/85495467.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: All residents mark Muharram in Hindu-majority Sivaganga district||MADURAI: Muthuvanthidal near Thirupuvanam in Sivaganga district stands as a shining example of religious harmony with Hindus observing Muharram and participating in rituals including ‘Poomithithal’ on the day. The Fatima Nachiar mosque or dargah is said to have been constructed in 1952 and the Muslims in the village were maintaining it. Ever since a small population of Muslims migrated from the village, it has been a Hindu-dominated area. People here believe Fatima Natchiar is their guardian angel and they constructed the new mosque near the old one and have been maintaining it ever since. While Muslims come to the dargah for Muharram, the people of the village observe the day by fulfilling their vows to their deity by walking on burning coal. Rituals such as ‘Poomithithal’ and ‘Poomozhuguthal’, where women wear a shawl over their heads and burning coal pieces are put on it, are held. Since the coal pieces slip off the shawl this ritual is performed within a few seconds. “Nobody has sustained any injury due to this ritual as the goddess protects us,’’ said S Shanmugapriya from the village. Burning coals being dumped on the head of a woman during the festival on Friday morningAbout twenty women and 15 men redeemed their vows at the festival this year. Ganeshan from the village said the pit for the fire walk is prepared about a week in advance, where they dug to about three feet deep and ten feet wide. People then fill it with firewood over the week, and it is set on fire in the afternoon before Muharram. The fire walk and Poomuzhuguthal are performed around 2 am on the day of Muharram. This year the villagers said they prayed for the world to become free of Covid. As most of them are farmers, they believe in leaving their first produce from the year’s harvest at the doors of the mosque, before taking it to market. “She brings prosperity and protects us”, said Palani, a villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/in-this-sivaganga-village-hindu-residents-celebrate-muharram/articleshow/85500290.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

This statement comes amidst strong protests staged by fishermen of the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu over the last few weeks, citing aspects in the Bill that would affect their livelihood once it is enacted. Interacting with reporters in Tirunelveli, the Union minister said that wrong information was being propagated among the coastal populace with regard to the Bill with the intent of tarnishing the image of the Union government. He added that BJP cadre would dispel all the misconceptions in this regard. Murugan said that the Bill was being discussed at various levels with fishermen and the other stakeholders of the sector before it is tabled before both the houses of the Parliament. Ascertaining that Centre is for the welfare of fishermen, he recalled that Rs 20,000 crore was allotted by the BJP government to benefit the coastal populace through various schemes during this financial year. The minister said steps would be taken to construct metal multi-day deep sea mechanised fishing vessels under the 70% subsidy scheme (Rs 56 lakh out of the total cost of Rs 80 lakh) in Tamil Nadu. Fishermen switching from trawler boats to such boats under the scheme are now dependent on boat yards in Kochi and Puducherry to build the boats. The Union ministry would take the required steps to create such infrastructure in the state, he added. Murugan did not respond to questions raised by journalists on the delay on the part of the Union government in taking a call on leasing the integrated vaccine complex at Chengalpet to the Tamil Nadu government to produce Covid-19 vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fisheries-bill-a-boon-for-fishermen-l-murugan/articleshow/85500269.cms||---

Airport operations will be closed from 11pm to 4:30am daily, confirmed airport chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Bhardwaj. However, he said that no civil flights operations would be affected as no flights were operating during these hours in which the Air Force had sought closure. Bhardwaj said, “Runway closure has been sought by the air force for installation of lights on the runway and annual maintenance. Work is already going on and we hope that the new powerful lighting system will be made functional by September 18.” He said no flights would be affected as the last flight arrives from Bengaluru at 10:05pm, which stays overnight to depart for Bengaluru the next morning at 7:15am. He added that at present, there are 32 flights operating and footfall has increased from 3,000 per day to 5,500 per day. Runway length was increased in 2018, after which Indian Air force (IAF) closed it from February 12 to February 16, 2018. During this period, no civil and military flights operated from Chandigarh airport. Work is being done to cater to wide-body aircraft, which will facilitate long haul flights from Chandigarh. This will fulfill the longstanding demand for flights to Europe, USA, Canada, UK and other countries. At present, Chandigarh International Airport can only cater to middle body aircrafts which can only fly to nearby destinations. A wide-body aircraft is a jet airliner with a fuselage wide enough to accommodate two passenger aisles, also known as twin-aisle aircraft, with seven or more seats abreast. The biggest wide-body aircraft are known as jumbo jets due to their very large size like the Boeing 747 ("jumbo jet"), Airbus A380 ("superjumbo jet"), and upcoming Boeing 777X ("mini jumbo jet"). The phrase, "jumbo jet", derives from Jumbo, a famous circus elephant in the 19th century. Such aircraft have around 400 seats.

Gadkari on Thursday night tweeted the development, which is going to bring a huge relief to the daily commuters between Nashik city and Nashik Road railway station separated by the 7km stretch of Nashik–Pune national highway. The stretch of road is the only connectivity between the two places with a parallel road running at least at a distance of 5km. The carriageway remains congested due to the mix of heavy vehicles with light and two-wheelers. Traffic snarls and accidents are also frequent along the stretch. Nashik MP 0Hemant Godse, who has been pursuing the issue with Gadkari, said, “The ministry of road transport and highways will set up a flyover from Dwarka Circle to Datta Mandir chowk that will completely ease the traffic congestion of Nashik Road. The heavy vehicles can take the flyover between the two points and travel across the city.” Nashik is a part of the Mumbai-Agra and Mumbai-Kolkata corridors of the project. The project does not include the Nashik-Pune connectivity. “The National Highways Authority of India had not funded the project on the ground that it was in the corporation-limits. The corporation said it did not have funds to take forward the project. As a result, I had purused with the minister for the development of the stretch,” Godse said. Nashik Road resident Sanjay Nair said, “There is no alternative travel route between the two important areas of the city. There have been assurances for long. We hope the situation changes now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/centre-includes-nashik-road-stretch-in-bharatmala-project/articleshow/85495491.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Hubballi||Poor roads, slow pace of works to form oppn plank||Hubballi: The poor condition of the twin cities’ roads, the snail’s pace at which work on several smart city projects are being executed, are among the issues that will form the plank for the opposition parties – the Congress, AIMIM and Aam Aadmi Party – in their campaign for the forthcoming Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) Council elections. The poor condition of the roads has been exposed in the aftermath of the monsoon, and the opposition parties are likely to capitalise on the situation to woo voters away from the BJP, which has been in power in the HDMC council. President of AAP’s Dharwad district unit Santosh Nargund said the party would draw the public’s attention to the poor roads, and the lack of drive in ensuring speedy completion of smart city projects. “It is corruption that is at the root of all problems. The negligent and lethargic attitude of the BJP will be highlighted during our campaign. We are ready with an outline for our manifesto, and once we have revised it, we will release it to the public,” Santosh said. President of Hubballi-Dharwad Mahanagara Zilla Congress Altaf Hallur added the unhygienic atmosphere and lack of attention to cleaning to the list of problems facing the twin cities. “We will highlight these woes when we visit the residents at their homes, and convince them how the BJP has failed miserably in developing the twin cities. Dust pollution has resulted in many people contracting disorders. Road accidents too have been on the rise,” Hallur said. Roads marked for refurbishment under the Smart City project are in a poor condition, particularly thoroughfares in Hubballi such as Koppikar Road, Station Road, Dajiban Peth Road, et al. Worse still is the condition of the roads in Old Hubballi, which have not been fixed for many years now, he added. Vendors, meanwhile, are upset with the lack of a dedicated zone. The construction of Janata Bazaar has been progressing at a snail’s pace, leaving them nowhere else but the sides of the road to ply their wares. Unfortunately, this has added to the chaos on the streets. Former CM Jagadish Shettar, at a meeting of party workers, attributed the failure to complete several projects to the Covid-induced lockdown, which had made it difficult for HDMC to enlist the services of skilled labourers. “Hubballi-Dharwad will witness the execution of various development projects in the next six months. We are holding discussions with officials to expedite work on many projects,” he said. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel was among those present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/poor-roads-slow-pace-of-works-to-form-oppn-plank/articleshow/85495526.cms||J Abbas Mulla

A: We have prepared a detailed project under Swachh Bharath Mission - 2. After approval it will be implemented with funds from central and state governments. Q: Bin-free Madurai was said to be an initiative of Madurai corporation to beautify the city. A: Going totally bin-free is not feasible in some parts of the city, which has a mix of commercial and residential areas. So, we are trying to minimize the use of bins and clean them more frequently. Q: So the bins will remain on roadsides? A: We are trying to replace the dumper blazers with compactors, which also improve segregation as it would have separate compartments for dry and wet waste. Q: The corporation has been struggling to make people comply with solid waste management rules. A: We are conducting door-to-door awareness sessions and there is fairly good compliance in some places where we have started working now. Q: What plans have the corporation got to improve waste management in the city A: We have already increased our daily waste collection. Segregation is also improving. Recently, we had a preliminary discussion with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre regarding usage of biodegradable waste to generate biogas. The byproduct would be manure which can be made in 19 days instead of 45, and the generated gas could be used to generate electricity to light up street lights. Q: Will you be implementing this technology? A: The discussion is in a preliminary stage. We have shortlisted four places for setting up the biogas units which will require about four cents of land. We have planned to set them up at one location, mostly at Vellaikkal yard ,or at some markets where there is bulk garbage generation, on a trial basis. We may try to use the gas to light up street lights there on a trial basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cant-go-bin-free-will-minimize-its-usage-clean-up-regularly/articleshow/85500310.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||With over dozen viruses, doctors struggle to decipher and treat||HYDERABAD: Over a dozen different viruses are at play currently, with each mimicking the other and putting the entire healthcare system under extreme stress. The many viruses have made doctors’ life tough as it often takes 3-5 days to even understand the trajectory of fever, the most common symptom, before a test could be prescribed. This could prove dangerous in case of dengue as even a delay of 48 hours can be fatal. The viruses include dengue, malaria, chikungunya, H1N1 (swine flu), influenza A, rotavirus, viral gastroenteritis among others. “While dengue and Covid-19 are most common now, other viruses can be adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, reovirus, marburg virus and enterovirus. Usually, these are self-limiting and not life threatening, so we wait for a day to see if the patient heals on his own,” said Dr Jagadeesh Kumar Kanukuntla, senior consultant physician, Medicover hospitals, who is seeing 15 fever cases daily. While all these bring fever with varied levels of respiratory distress, pain and gastrointestinal symptoms, experts stress on testing for the two prominent ones — Covid-19 and dengue. “The most important thing is do rapid tests for dengue and Covid-19. Both can be done in 10-30 minutes. Also, people should not to wait beyond 24 hours to seek help and tests should be run in 48 hours. While most viral fevers generally subside in 24 hours, in case of dengue, especially for children, waiting beyond 48 hours could be fatal,” said Dr GVS Murthy, director, Indian Institute of Public Health. “This year clinics are full with various kinds of viral diseases. It is very difficult to diagnose, which puts a lot of pressure on the system. The main difference in Covid and other viruses is the oxygen saturation levels become low and fall rapidly in Covid. These nuances need to be observed for diagnosis,” said Dr Ranga Reddy Burri, professor, School of Medical Sciences, University of Hyderabad. “Also, last year pollution was less and people were mostly indoors and had fresh home-cooked food. In fact, the difference in environmental pollution is the main difference from last year to this year, which might have become more conducive for various viruses to thrive,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-over-dozen-viruses-docs-struggle-to-decipher-and-treat/articleshow/85500370.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Budget homes pushed to Hyderabad’s fringes as land prices hit the roof||HYDERABAD: The rapid rise in land prices has pushed ‘budget’ homes to the fringes of Hyderabad. Available in the Gachibowli-Kokapet-Narsingi belt until three years ago, buyers now have to drive at least 20 km away from ‘hi-tech’ Hyderabad, to find a house in the Rs 60 lakh to Rs 80 lakh budget. Their new locations: Kollur, Kismatpur, Shamshabad among others. On the eastern corridor, the budget destinations have shifted to areas along the Nagarjuna Sagar Road – about 30 km from the Secunderabad Railway Station. “This is deeply rooted in land costs that have doubled in some locations in recent times. Since developers are paying such high rates, they are using the unlimited FSI (floor space index) to the fullest to build high rises – nothing less than 30 floors. This has, subsequently, escalated the construction cost,” said Sumanth Reddy, managing director of India Institute of Real Estate. He added: “This additional expense is being passed on to the customer.” According to Reddy, majority of homes in the core IT corridor now come with a price tag of no less than Rs 1 crore. A quick scan of property portals corroborates this claim. Search for homes below Rs 90 lakh throws up limited options in Tellapur and Nallagandla. Most others are either in Kollur and its surroundings or locations like Karmanghat and Adibatla – over 50 km from the IT belt. “There has been an at least 30% rise in cost of construction, post pandemic, with a jump in steel, cement, labour and other rates. This, coupled with inflated land values has increased the price of a Rs 80-lakh to Rs 1 crore,” said Ashwin Rao of Manbhum Constructions. But the distance notwithstanding, these budget homes are high in demand, Rao was quick to add. “That’s courtesy Hyderabad’s road infrastructure, which had made travelling 25-30 km easy,” he said. While seconding the city’s connectivity advantage, Veera Babu, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield (Hyderabad) said that this trend has put the city’s distinction of being an “affordable and quality residential segment under review in recent months”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/budget-homes-pushed-to-citys-fringes-as-land-prices-hit-the-roof/articleshow/85500321.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Congress is part of the Sena-led MVA government in Maharashtra along with the NCP. Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who accompanied Thackeray, told TOI that it was a sound meeting. “...at the meeting, he [Thackeray] said that the opposition should ‘unite’ and that it should be long-lasting. The people of the country should feel confident that we are all together and will remain together,” Raut said. During his 10-minute speech, Thackeray covered key issues like the problems faced by distressed farmers, the Pegasus scam and inflation. While asked about Sonia’s response, Raut said, “To have an interaction on a regular basis is important. We are sure we will get a response later.” He added that they also discussed the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who also participated in the virtual meeting, later posted on social media: “With the initiative of Smt Sonia ji Gandhi, an online meeting of like-minded parties was held today. I truly appreciate the steps taken to organise this much needed meeting in view of the present circumstances in our country.

---||Mumbai||No Maharashtra nod yet for BVoc even as 2nd year admission looms||MUMBAI: Come September, a fresh batch of students will join the various Bachelor of Vocational Education (BVoc) courses started last year across colleges of Mumbai University, unaware that these are yet to get a nod from the state government. “While the UGC approved the proposals and admissions were taken, the state government is yet to clear the decks to permit Mumbai University to give its nod to run these programs,” said Tukaram Shiware, chairman, non-government college principals’ association. In 2020, the University Grants Commission encouraged colleges across the country to launch the vocational programmes. A total of 12 colleges from Mumbai University sent their proposals to the UGC and, once approved with new curricula, the courses were launched last year. Maharashtra sent the largest pool of applications -- 34 -- to start these skill-based programmes. The university prepared the curricula for all the courses and the board of deans cleared it. Exams were held for the first year batch of students and results declared. This inaugural batch will now move to the second year of the undergraduate course. Shiware said most principals were concerned about the silence at the state’s end. As a second round of admission season started, many were wary of admitting students in the various BVoc courses. “If the state clears the file, it will put many people’s anxiety to rest,” he added. A letter sent to the state government on February 5 to clear the affiliation process has not yet moved and the fate of thousands of students has been left hanging. A UGC official explained that the body had long felt the need to align higher education with the emerging and immediate needs of the economy and the requirements of various industries. Hence, the UGC launched the scheme on skills development based on higher education leading to a BVoc degree with multiple exits such as certificate or diploma or an advanced diploma and degree. Each of the 12 colleges of MU admitted students based on the UGC’s nod. Soon after, it wrote to the university for affiliation. While the highest body of the university cleared all the requests, the state is yet to put its stamp on the same. “Multiple reminders from the Mumbai University have met with stony silence. Unfortunately, no one was able to exit from the programme, defeating the course’s flexibility,” said a principal whose college is offering BVoc in tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-state-nod-yet-for-bvoc-even-as-2nd-yr-admission-looms/articleshow/85500356.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Most of them had applied for a review, hoping to get higher scores that would help them better their chances of securing seats in preferred subjects in colleges of their choice, especially when merit list cut-offs were likely to increase than that last year. Since all other dates remain unchanged, the revised application submission deadline leaves only two days to publish the first merit list. According to the original schedule, first merit lists have to be published on August 31. Though Friday was the deadline for submitting application forms, authorities at several colleges said many students were still waiting for their revised mark sheets, which they wanted to submit for college admissions. Principal of Surendranath College Indranil Kar said, “We have received at least 10-12 mails from students, saying they wanted to upload their revised mark sheets. We allowed them, advising them to submit fresh applications.” After board exams for classes X and XII were cancelled due to the pandemic, the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, like other boards and councils, adopted a formula to compute the marks of Class X and XII students. After HS results were declared, it was found that more than 20,000 students had failed and many alleged that they had been marked less than what the formula showed. Later, the council declared that all candidates would be awarded pass marks and 14,000-plus students applied for a review. Many of these candidates are yet to receive their revised mark sheets. President of HS Council Chiranjib Bhattacharjee said the “matter would be sorted by August 27”. Principal of Jogamaya Devi College Sarbani Sarkar said, “I have received eight-10 mails, requesting us to allow them to upload revised mark sheets. Many are calling on out help desk, too. Many more students are asking to submit revised mark sheets than that previous years.” Jogesh Chandra Choudhury College principal Pankaj Kumar Roy said, “We have so far received one request for uploading revised mark sheet. We have allowed the candidate to do so.” On Friday afternoon, hours before the application portal was to close, the higher education department declared that the deadline would be extended to August 27. A higher education department official said, “Only the submission date has been extended. Other dates will remain unchanged.” So, this is a breathing space meant for those who are yet to receive their revised mark sheets, another official said. Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan principal Sunita Sen said, “Ten students are still waiting for their mark sheets. An extension is always positive for children. We are still waiting for the revised mark sheets as we have nothing to do in this matter.” “A seven-day extension of the date is good for students but everyone has to receive their revised mark sheets by then. That must be ensured,” said Sougata Basu, general secretary, West Bengal Govt School Teachers’ Association. Many principals admitted the extended deadline might help students but they would be would be rushed to publish the merit lists within two days. “Submission date extension is good for students but two days won’t be enough to prepare merit lists,” a principal said. Jadavpur University registrar Snehamanju Basu said, “Students will get the chance to submit their revised mark sheets. But we will get less time for merit lists. We hope that date will be extended, too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/deadline-for-ug-applications-extended-by-a-week-to-aug-27/articleshow/85500320.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Computer hacked, alleges Sam Pitroda at Rajasthan government session||JAIPUR: The computer of Sam Pitroda, the chief guest who was to virtually address a session on 'IT for Good Governance' organised by the state government, was allegedly hacked during the function, forcing him to attend the meeting using his mobile phone on Friday. The advisor to former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was attending the meeting held to celebrate the late PM's 77th birth anniversary. Pitroda, who had joined in from Chicago, said, “It seems some people do not want me to join this function.” The programme was marked with technical glitches. Earlier, while showing a short film on the government’s IT achievements, the screening had to be paused for about five minutes following technical issues. As soon as Pitroda started his speech, his audio stopped functioning. Since it took time to establish contact, the chief minister filled the absence with his speech. Pitroda later joined the function using his mobile. He said his computer has been hacked and locked, and alleged a conspiracy behind it. Lamenting the current political situation in the country, he said, “Institutions are being captured and civil society has been sidelined with very little role to play under the current political dispensation.” Besides, he said, there was no effort to promote scientific temper. During the Covid-19 pandemic people were able to get on with their lives online due to the initiatives taken by the then Rajiv Gandhi who promoted computers and information technology, he said. Information and communication technology should be increasingly used for speedy justice, providing quality education, health, public service and governance. “Rajiv Gandhi was ‘a man in a hurry’. We lost Rajiv Gandhi too early. If he was around, the situation would have been different,” Pitroda said. He lauded the efforts made by the state government in digitising governance and administration. “Rajiv Gandhi would have been proud of what the state government is doing if he was alive.” But he said the state still had a long way to go and there was a need to understand the role of hyper connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/computer-hacked-allegespitroda-at-raj-govt-session/articleshow/85500393.cms||---
---||India||Now, Facebook removes Rahul Gandhi’s post related to Delhi rape-murder||NEW DELHI: After Twitter, social media giant Facebook has removed a content posted by Congress member Rahul Gandhi that identified the family of a nine-year-old girl of alleged rape and murder in Delhi, saying it violated the social media platform's policies. Facebook informed Gandhi and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights about the removal of the posts from Facebook and Instagram. Earlier this week, Facebook had written to Gandhi asking him to remove the said post from Instagram - Facebook's photosharing platform. "We have taken action to remove the content as it was in violation of our policies," a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Friday. Facebook takes action against a content if it violates its community standards or upon receiving a valid legal request according to Indian laws. Last week, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked Facebook to take appropriate action against Gandhi's Instagram profile over "violation of provisions" of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, Pocso Act, 2012, and the Indian Penal Code. and demanded the removal of the post from the platform. Following the communication from Facebook to Gandhi earlier week, NCPCR withdrew its direction to the company to appear before the commission with an explanation over non-action regarding Gandhi's post. Earlier this month, Gandhi had met the family of the nine-year-old girl and asserted that he is with them on the path to justice and "will not back down even an inch". Later, he posted a picture of his meeting with the girl's parents on Instagram. Similar posts were also shared on Twitter. The microblogging platform had locked accounts of Gandhi as well as many other Congress leaders who tweeted the post. On August 14, Twitter restored Gandhi's account after the Congress member submitted a consent letter from the family of the minor girl. However, Twitter continues to withhold the tweets that contain the images saying they violate India's laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-facebook-removes-rahul-gandhis-post-related-to-delhi-rape-murder/articleshow/85504772.cms||---

Only if they have a good season this year, they would be able to repay heavy debts running into lakhs of rupees, the idol abd doll mmakers have said. Ganesha idols for Vinayaka Chathurthi and a variety of dolls for the Navaratri festival are the specialty of these traditional doll makers. Some of these makers have been in the trade for over 65 years, like R Harikrishnan, treasurer of the Kullalar Kaivinai Kalaignar Nala Sangam. P Deivakani, an employee in one of the units that make dolls here, said that during the festival season, they make good money. “Last year at least there was some relaxation and we managed to sell some of the Ganesha idols, but this year the government seems to be strict in closing temples during festivals. So, I don’t know how we will fair this year. We have not even recovered from last year’s losses,” she said. Female workers like Chinammal, who has been making these idols for 12 years and Deivakani, who has been making idols for 15 years, earn between Rs 150 to Rs 250 per day. M Ramalingam, who has been making the dolls for over 35 years, said that they have Ganesha idols ready but customers are hesitating because of the information that the third wave of Covid-19 is coming. “Last year too, temples were closed, but people purchased idols for homes. However, this year I do not know how it is going to be,” he said. About 100 idol and doll makers are involved in this industry and work out of tiny sheds making these. Ramalingam said that while each shed made more than 100 idols before the pandemic, they now make only about 60 to 90 idols. The idols they have made are seen in various sizes from six inches to just over one foot ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 550.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vilacheri-idol-makers-keen-to-make-up-for-last-years-losses-this-festive-season-without-curbs/articleshow/85500381.cms||---

In his message, the chief minister said that the name of the freedom fighter, who was the commander of Puli Thevar, will be unforgettable in the history of Tamil Nadu that is known for its bravery. On behalf of the state government, ministers K K S S R Ramachandran (revenue and disaster management) and M Mathiventhan (tourism) garlanded the Ondiveeran’s statue at his memorial in Palayamkottai, in the presence of MLAs and MPs from the DMK and officials from the district administration. “Ondiveeran was the commander in chief for the army that fought many battles against the British,” Ramachandran said. He listed out many brave freedom fighters from the Tirunelveli region who sacrificed their lives by fighting against the British at various stages of the freedom struggle. He said that the DMK regime under M Karunanidhi issued the GO to establish the memorial for Ondiveeran in 2010 and laid the foundation stone in January 2011. BJP state president K Annamalai and Union minister of state for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying and information and broadcasting L Murugan also paid homage. District-level AIADMK functionaries and the state election wing secretary of the AMMK S V S P Manikaraja were among those who paid a floral tribute to the statue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/freedom-fighter-ondiveerans-250th-birth-anniv-observed/articleshow/85500417.cms||---

He was entitled to a square footage of just below 2,500. Yadav is now special secretary (sports) in the Uttar Pradesh government. The CAG flagged the “imprudent” plan in its audit report on the ‘Economic Sector & Public Sector Undertakings, Government of Uttar Pradesh’ that was tabled in the assembly on Thursday. In two orders of 2009 and 2011, the UP government had decided on the 2,426-square foot cap for the residences of officials in the bracket to which the vice chairman of the MDA belongs, the report said. The approval for an official’s residence comes from the MDA Board, where the vice chairman comes only after the divisional commissioner. In 2013 and 2014, Yadav was MDA secretary and in 2015 and 2016 the vice chairman. Construction began in May 2015. It was a grand project —a 20,000-square foot house and a 9,700-square foot “recreation” area. The area was over 12 times what the vice chairman was entitled to. More than Rs 8 crore was spent — the land had cost over Rs 5 crore and construction nearly Rs 3 crore — when the half-finished project was dropped in December 2016. A month before that, a committee the MDA had set up had said “the building cannot be used for residential purposes due to its impractical design having several architectural flaws, high maintenance costs.” TOI visited the abandoned house on Friday. It was surrounded by overgrowth, its tall pillars visible from a distance. Wooden frames for windows were in place and the walls had been plastered, but were peeling off now. The vice chairman for whom it was being built never lived here. The MDA tried to auction off the property twice in 2019 but there were no takers. Yadav denied the allegations. “There is no government order on the size of official accommodation a VC can live on.” The MDA, too, defended itself. Executive engineer Rajiv Singh, who wasn’t associated with the project, said, “It wasn’t just a residence. It would also become a guest house and camp office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ias-officer-allotted-himself-30k-sq-ft-bungalow-12-times-his-entitlement-cag/articleshow/85495529.cms||Sandeep Rai

The vaccination drive for the pregnant women started on July 20. The inoculation was supposed be done after counselling. Officials said 261 pregnant women in the rural areas have received the first dose. Of them, 38 have received the second dose of the vaccines. In the Nashik city limits, only 56 pregnant women were administered dose 1 and five beneficiaries received the second dose. The officials added the administration was yet to ascertain the exact number of pregnant woman to be vaccinated against Covid. “On an average 80,000 women are registered for pregnancy in the rural areas on an annual basis. The corresponding number in the city is around 35,000. Various vaccination camps as part of routine immunization are conducted for the women. We are using these camps for raising awareness among the women,” said additional district health officer Dr Ravindra Chaudhary. “There is hesitancy towards Covid vaccine among the women, as many of them do not want to take any chance with their pregnancy. However the number of beneficiaries taking up the vaccines is slowly increasing,” Dr Chaudhary stated. In Chandwad, the taluka health office had oganised a special camp for the pregnant women. Fifty beneficiaries received the vaccine at the camp. Dr Ajita Salunke, the reproductive and child health officer of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said, “The number of pregnant women getting vaccinated is low considering the availability of the vaccines as well as the awareness. We are taking necessary measures,” Dr Salunke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vaccination-of-expecting-mothers-low-in-nashik/articleshow/85495530.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Kolkata||Back from queues, helps spark Cov scare||Kolkata: Many families in the city who had given leave to their domestic help, cooks and babysitters are scared that the support staff might come back with Covid infection, picked up from the crowded queues where they stood for hours to get themselves registered for the Lakshmi Bhandar scheme. Many are asking them to stay home for a few more days and see if they develop any symptoms before allowing them to resume work. Others are changing the nature of the work so that they do not come in direct contact with the children and the elderly. The scare is amplified by the fact that most support staff have received just the first dose of vaccination and are waiting for their second one. Householders say had they received both doses, it might have been slightly safer. Sukanya Das, a management faculty, has decided to do all household chores herself and allow her maid to only wash utensils at a place that is not connected to the interiors of the house. She feels that her elderly mother-in-law and two sons will otherwise be at a risk. Soumi Sinha, a public relations professional who lives in Phoolbagan, will allow both her cook and her 24- hour maid to take leave. “My maid is from the Sunderbans. So I will have to release her for a few days. But I am not sure if I will allow her to come back immediately because I have two children at home and since she resides with us, the chance of infection spread is higher,” she said. Almost on the same lines, brand strategist Luna Chatterjee said she was scared when she saw the queue of women at a registry centre near her residence at Jadavpur. “My maids who serve my aged in-laws have asked for leave but we are scared of the virus that they might carry back with them. It’s just not Covid, it can be an ordinary flu too. That will also affect the seniors in the family,” she said. At the Siddha Pines complex in New Town, almost every second household has either given leave or is about to give leave to their household help. “Not only our help but even our driver has taken leave. He will take his wife for registration. I have told them not to resume duty if they develop symptoms but to inform me. Even after that, I will check their temperature with a thermal gun that I have acquired,” said Manav Mehra, president of the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/back-from-queues-helps-spark-cov-scare/articleshow/85498004.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Property worth Rs 4 crore destroyed in 5 years||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As many as 7,318 cases have been registered and public properties worth more than Rs 4 crore have been destroyed in the state in the last five years in connection with various anti-government protests, as per the statistics. According to the assembly records, properties worth Rs 4,01,34,242 have been destroyed in the state in connection with various anti-government protests in the state. The government has also registered cases against present MLA T Siddique and former MLAs K S Sabarinathan, Eldho Abraham and P K Abdu Rabb in connection with these protests. As per the evaluation of the destruction, more than half of the destruction happened in 2017, when Rs 2.04 crore worth of public properties were destroyed. The state had registered 838 cases, in which there were 4,470 accused for destruction of public properties alone in the said period. As many as 85 accused have been penalized in these cases till now. The year 2017 had witnessed some intense agitations against the LDF government, particularly when the first Pinarayi government was celebrating its first year in office. The youth organizations of both Congress and BJP, the opposition parties, —Youth Congress and Yuva Morcha— had taken out agitations against the government for “anti-people policies”. The year had also witnessed protests against the GAIL pipeline project, especially in the northern districts like Malappuram and Kozhikode. Close to 100 hartals were called by various political and other non-political organizations in the state citing several issues in 2017. Interestingly, it was not just by the two opposition fronts in the state that came up with protests, but the ruling LDF as well. The LDF had undertaken wide protests against the Centre citing subjects like the beef ban in 2017. Interestingly, when the anti-government protests were at its peak in the state in late 2018 and 2019, after the Sabarimala verdict and related issues, the destruction of the public properties were comparatively lesser. In 2018, public properties worth Rs 71.61 lakh were destroyed, while it was pegged at Rs 67.08 lakh in 2019. In 2016, the year when the LDF government took over, the destruction was quantified at Rs 31.83 lakh. In 2020, the figures were low compared to other four years, thanks to Covid-19, though even Covid could not fully put an end to such unruly acts. Public properties worth Rs 17.25 lakh were destroyed in 2020, while till August this year, property destruction worth Rs 9.5 lakh has been reported. As a deterrent, the government in 2019, came up with a law against such destruction, that banned those participating in communal riots, hartal, bandh demonstration, march, processions, blockade of roads or any similar assembly, from destroying public properties. The penal provisions for such acts are imprisonment of five years and a fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/property-worth-4cr-destroyed-in-5-yrs/articleshow/85498075.cms||KP Saikiran

Unlike earlier, when residents were given pamphlets and notices with rules of solid waste management and details of biodegradable wet waste and non-biodegradable waste, the sanitary workers now go to households and conduct practical awareness sessions. Workers, in their uniforms, make residents of a few houses gather at a place and then spread out a mat. The residents are asked to bring their waste which is dumped onto the mats and they are shown how it can be segregated into two. ``Now I have started putting only plastics and paper into the waste basket and putting the wet waste in my garden,’’ said Shanthi, a resident of Melaponnagaram who participated in an awareness session. Gnaneswary, a resident of Pulanthopu, says that sometimes they have trouble deciding which is biodegradable and which is not. ``Now these awareness sessions are helping a lot in this regard,’’ she said. The sessions were conducted at Chockalinga Nagar, Bypass road, Mela Ponnagaram, Duraisamy Nagar, Karimedu, Suyarajyapuram, Pulianthoppu, Alwarpuram among other places. Duraisamy Nagar Residents Welfare Association secretary M Pushparajan said they are continuously creating awareness on source segregation and most of the residents were now handing over only plastics to sanitary workers. Madurai corporation has established 40 micro composting units in its limits, mostly in parks of the wards. Of these, 23 were set up under Swachh Bharat Mission at a cost of Rs 19 crore and the remaining under smart city programme for Rs 14.50 crore. The corporation has started making 27 of these units functional. Sanitary Officer for zone one, N Vijayakumar, says they had made some strides earlier in making people segregate the waste, but it all came to a standstill during the lockdown. ``Now we have revived the activities, and people are also segregating the waste to some extent,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-gives-source-segregation-of-waste-a-push/articleshow/85500394.cms||---
---||Kolkata||RBU may lose its first Afghan student in vocal music||Kolkata: Rabindra Bharati University might lose its first Afghan student in vocal music, who had secured an undergraduate seat on an Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarship this year, after the Taliban established their control on the country. RBU vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Basu Roychoudhury said, “It is really a great loss. Right now, the situation there does not seem conducive for the student to come.” He pointed out that the youngster had won the ICCR scholarship to study vocal music as part of the India-Afghanistan efforts to bolster ties through academic exchanges. The university, he added, was supposed to sign an agreement with Kabul University for an academic exchange programme in August, which “unfortunately would not happen”. RBU’s vocal music department’s head Kankana Mitra said, “I cannot immediately recall any student from Afghanistan studying vocal music in the university. We were looking forward to this for two reasons. First because many Afghani instruments, with some structural modifications, are used here and so, music has influence from the country and secondly, it would have been a mutually beneficial cultural exchange.” Roychoudhury, who had met former Afghanistan higher education minister Abdul Tawab Bala Karzai when he had visited the RBU Jorasanko campus in 2019, said it was partly Karzai’s admiration for Rabindranath Tagore that sowed the seeds of the collaboration between RBU and Kabul University in music and arts. “It was decided that departments, like painting, sculpture, music and dance, would collaborate. A student exchange programme was also being planned for later,” he said. “We collaborate with many foreign universities and get students from abroad. But to the best of my knowledge, we had not had ties with any Afghanistan university so far.” Tahir, another youth from Afghanistan, who had come to Kolkata to study English at Jadavpur University last year but could not do so due to procedural gaps, has requested the state government to help him enrol in the university to complete his Masters. “I am very worried about my study. I want to complete my Masters here but don’t know how to,” he said. “I have just managed to get a shelter here, but I am neither earning nor studying. I do not even know what will happen to me in future. I appeal to the government for help.” Staying in Baranagar, Tahir said that given the situation back home, he would not be able to return. His family, he said, lived in Paktia province, now under the Taliban, and he had not been able to contact any relative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rbu-may-lose-its-first-afghan-student-in-vocal-music/articleshow/85500422.cms||---

The safety data of the trials on children in the 2-18 years age bracket was found to be very good and now immunogenicity studies are underway as part of the Phase II/III trials, sources said. The data from the trials is expected to be available in a month’s time after which the vaccine could be available in the market in October if the regulatory authorities grant their approval, sources added. Covaxin was the first vaccine in India and the world to begin testing on children as young as 12 years of age in the Phase II trials way back in September 2020 ahead of global giants like Pfizer and Moderna. As part of the Phase II/III trial, the two-dose Covaxin has been administered to 525 children 28 days apart. Bharat Biotech had received the drug regulators’ nod to conduct the children’s trial in May this year. Meanwhile, the company has ramped up its Covaxin manufacturing capacity to about 2.8 crore doses per month in August, with Indian Immunologicals Ltd starting production of 3-4 million doses per month of Covaxin drug substance. Covaxin output is all set for a quick ramp-up in September with doses from the Bengaluru and Ankleshwar facilities expected to be available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-may-be-available-for-kids-by-oct/articleshow/85500403.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||‘Vaccine complete’ certs for colonies, stickers for homes||Hyderabad: With nearly 90% of the eligible population receiving the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) areas, including parts of border districts, the state health authorities will issue ‘vaccine complete’ certificates to colonies and stickers to homes. As the city accounts for more than 60% of the total case burden, the state government devised a 100-day action plan for the Covid-19 immunization drive. Currently, 90% of the eligible population in the GHMC areas have received their first dose, but just 27% completed their second dose. For a total population of over 90 lakh in GHMC areas (Hyderabad, Medchal, Rangareddy and Sangareddy), more than 55 lakh people (aged 18 years and above) are eligible for the immunization drive. During a review meeting with higher-ups, state chief secretary Somesh Kumar directed the GHMC and health authorities to expedite the city’s vaccination programme on a priority basis. Officials were instructed to include MLAs and corporators in this effort and regular campaigns on the importance of vaccine will be taken up. He asked authorities to go door-to-door to identify eligible people who are yet to receive their first vaccine dose. He also directed that mobile vans be used to intensify the immunization drive. From the current 90, the number of mobile vaccination administration vehicles will be increased to 150. Every day, 15,000 individuals are immunized at the government’s 50 vaccine centres, while another 20,000 are receiving vaccination via mobile vaccine vehicles. On Monday, health and GHMC officials will begin house visits to identify persons who have not yet been vaccinated. Only five lakh people in the city are yet to receive their first dose of vaccine. The state health department has set a goal of finishing the 100% immunization drive by September 9 (at least one dose). “Expediting vaccine distribution is part of a strategy to deal with any provable third wave in the coming days,” a top official stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccine-complete-certs-for-colonies-stickers-for-homes/articleshow/85500389.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: No plan to name successor as long as I am healthy, says BSP chief Mayawati||LUCKNOW: In a strong rebuff to those conjecturing on the next leader of BSP, party chief Mayawati on Friday said that she won't be appointing any successor for the time being as she is absolutely healthy and will remain so for many more days. She also made it clear that she will be replaced only by a Dalit. In a strong statement to end any speculation, the BSP leader referred to an interview in which Mishra was being asked about Mayawati's successor and he said that she was absolutely healthy right now and won't appoint a successor till she is unfit. “Right now, I am fit and it will take me years to become unfit. Covid has been around for the past two years but I didn't even get that. People should also know that till Kanshiram ji was fine, he did not appoint a successor. I was appointed successor only when he was ill. All those trying to corner Mishra ji into revealing a name should know that I will not do it till the time I am healthy,” she said. Mayawati also reiterated that whenever she did appoint a successor, it would only be a Dalit, a claim she has made even earlier. “The Dalit community has stood by me through thick and thin. Our party has gone through several ups and downs and Dalits have always supported us. Whenever I take the decision, I will let everyone know,” she added. In January 2019, days after the public appearance of her nephew Akash Anand at her birthday made headlines, fuelling speculation that he was being groomed to be her political heir, Mayawati had adopted a defiant stance. She had said that she would definitely induct him into politics because of the rumours, even appointing him the party’s national coordinator a few months later. Currently, Anand has been assigned to hold meetings with party workers in Delhi, away from poll-bound UP, and making his presence felt on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-plan-to-name-successor-as-long-as-i-am-healthy-maya/articleshow/85702466.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The district had as many as 1,030 active cases on July 30 and it had rose to 1,127 on August 13. But in the last seven days the cases have declined and has reached to 1,022. “The difference is marginal, but the trend is significant as it indicates what lies ahead. The situation again appears to be easing,” Dr Anant Pawar, nodal officer of civil hospital, said. The number of cases are on the decline in both rural as well as urban areas. The major difference has been observed in Sinnar taluka where the cases rose sharply from 92 on July 30 to 140 on August 13 and now have reduced to 120. The number has also come down in Niphad taluka after they shot up to 98 from a low of 68. Most of the cases were found in Niphad, Yeola and Sinnar belt where health teams carried out surveys to find Covid patients and treat them. “At this point in time the change in active case is directly proportional to the change in active case. Hence, health officials are keeping a close watch on the development,” said another health officer. The weekly deaths in the district, however, have remained unchanged as 10 people have died every week for the last 14 days. Talking about the weekly positivity rates, the officer said it shows a rise from 1.2 to 2.3%, but that was the result of drop in tests being conducted. The tests have reduced from over 9,000 to less than 4,200 tests per day. On the backdrop of more relaxations in Covid norms being given by the state government the health authorities are keeping a close watch on the rise in number of cases. “The effect, if any, could be visible in the next week and the cases are being monitored closely. The health officials have been also asked to increase daily testing,” an officer from rural health department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-cases-drop-slightly-in-nashik-after-two-week-spike/articleshow/85495514.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Separate Hadapsar civic body unlikely before polls: Dy CM||Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said a separate Hadapsar municipal corporation was unlikely before the civic polls in the coming year despite its growing demand after the merger of 23 villages in Pune civic limits. “With the civic polls due in the coming year, this cannot be considered because there is too little time to divide the corporations’ jurisdictions,” he said, on the sidelines of the district’s Covid situation review meeting. On the ward system, he said, “It will be a single candidate ward system in the BMC. The state government will take a final call for Pune in the state cabinet.” Earlier, NCP had hinted at being tilted towards two-member ward system for the next year’s civic polls in the state after Ajit Pawar had expressed his personal view on it. The change in ward-system can play a key role in the outcome of civic polls. The previous state government had introduced the four-member ward system before the 2017 municipal elections in nine local bodies, including Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations. In Mumbai, there was a single-member ward system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/separate-hadapsar-civic-body-unlikely-before-polls-dy-cm/articleshow/85500378.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: ‘10 people’ norm makes for long jab wait at pvt hospitals||PUNE: As a bulk of vaccinations in Pune shift to free government sites, the wait for a jab at private hospitals is now for a different reason — waiting for 10 people to walk-in for jabs before a vaccine vial is opened. If the vial contains doses for 10 people and only 4 turn up, six doses can go waste. To avoid this wastage, the Union government had advised states to mobilise people and not to open the vials if they do not have 10 beneficiaries. A Covishield vial, the most widely used vaccine in India, has 10 doses in total. Once opened, all 10 doses have to be consumed within four hours. Several beneficiaries said they were recently made to wait for hours at some private hospitals involved in the drive to get a jab as the site did not have enough (10 beneficiaries) to open a vaccine vial. City-based nutrition coach Chirag Barjatya had to wait for two-and-a-half hours for his shot at a private hospital recently, despite having an online appointment. “I had a 5-6pm slot. When I reached the hospital at 5pm, the authorities said till they had 10 beneficiaries, they would not open the vaccine vial. By 6pm, six more people had arrived, but we were still seven in all. The other beneficiaries then called up more friends to push this number to 10. I could only take the shot at 7.30pm. There should be some alternative to making beneficiaries wait if there aren’t enough numbers for jabs,” he told TOI. Another beneficiary, who did not wish to be quoted, said, “During my second shot, I had to wait for three hours till more people were arranged to get the jab. We tweeted and called up people to get the vaccine.” Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said, “Private hospitals currently do not have a flurry of beneficiaries turning up for jabs one after the other, like before. If a couple of people walk in, the hospital naturally has to wait for more to open a vial. There isn’t a free flow of vaccine beneficiaries any more at any point in time. For instance, if a small private hospital has a target of vaccinating 100 beneficiaries per day, they are just having about 25-30 people per day. Three vials have to be used for this number and thus for better management, beneficiaries are asked to wait for a while till sufficient numbers walk in.” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said at one point in the past, private sites were contributing almost 40% to the vaccination drive, which has dropped to nearly 18-19% now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10-people-norm-makes-for-long-jab-wait-at-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/85500431.cms||Neha Madaan

District collector Dr K Senthil Raj said that the initiative was carried out with funds from corporates under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds as part of the government’s strategic initiatives to strengthen peripheral hospitals for the third wave of Covid-19. “This will ensure better and swift and timely treatment of Covid-19 patients from peripheral areas. It will also help avoid transporting patients all the way to the medical college hospital (in Tuticorin city) and the district headquarters hospital (at Kovilpatti) and overcrowding at these tertiary care centres,” the collector said. He added that such well-equipped peripheral government hospitals enable early hospitalisation, ensure quality of treatment at the doorstep and thereby prevent morbidity and mortality. All the 60 beds in the Vilathikulam GH are connected to a centralised oxygen supply through 8x8 manifold D type cylinders and six remote controlled ICU cots with 2X2 manifold D type connection. Oxygen supply has been provided to the paediatric corners to treat babies and an alarm has been installed at every floor to note any dip in oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vilathikulam-peripheral-hosp-gets-100-oxygen-supply/articleshow/85500427.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Give priority to second dose to finish vaccination, says Ajit Pawar||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday directed the district health authorities to speed up the Covid vaccination process and give priority to administering the second dose to ensure that more people were completely vaccinated. “I have directed the administration to focus on completing the second dose and then focus on those seeking their first jab,” Ajit Pawar told reporters after the weekly Covid-19 review meeting of the district. About 70 lakh people have vaccinated in the district so far. Ajit Pawar said the district administration had approached the private hospitals having some vaccine doses, which would expire soon. He said they had expressed their interest in sharing the doses with the government, which would be replenished once fresh stock arrived. The deputy chief minister also said the divisional commissioner had spoken to the Serum Institute of India (SII) authorities for some additional supplies for Pune. “They said they would be considering the request despite being under tremendous pressure of supplying vaccines to the entire country,” he said, adding that the extra doses from SII would be used in the slum areas in the city. He said the state would also follow up with Bharat Biotech, which would conduct the pilot run of manufacturing vaccine at its Pune unit in the end of September or October. “Whenever it is ready for inauguration, the state would put forth its demand for more supplies,” he told TOI. ‘Booster shot only after entire population vaxxed’  Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the state government was positive about the booster dose of Covid vaccine, but the priority right now was to complete vaccinating people with two doses. Reacting to SII chairman Cyrus Poonawalla’s emphasis on the booster dose recently, Ajit Pawar said it would be discussed once the vaccination of the 18 and above was completed. As it was done earlier, a decision would be taken on who would get the booster dose on priority, he added. Existing relaxations to continue The existing relaxations would continue in the district this week as it registered less than 5% weekly positivity rate (WPR). The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas registered 2.5% WPR, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits recorded 3.2% and the Pune rural areas registered 3.9% WPR. The deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar, said the district was gearing up to ensure adequate infrastructure, especially an oxygen plant in every taluka, to ensure that there was no shortage of oxygen supply in case there was a third wave||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/give-priority-to-2nd-dose-to-finish-vaccination-ajit-pawar/articleshow/85500478.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hyderabad||IIIT-H devises new low-cost location tool without GPS||HYDERABAD: Next time you misplace something and kick yourself for being forgetful, a nifty low-cost tool conceptualised by IIIT-Hyderabad may help you locate it. Once commercialised, the sensor device could be placed on any item or even children’s clothes and the location tracked via mobiles/apps or browser as long as they are within the network area. Developed by researchers from the Processes Architecture and Technologies Research in IoT (PATRIoT) lab at IIIT-H, the novel localisation approach is GPS-free and uses LoRaWAN technology. This method is based on the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) – a well-established geolocation technique that can locate a signal source from different arrival times at three or more receivers. The patent for the concept is pending. “Our method can even be used on Mars where there is no GPS,” said Aftab Hussain, principal investigator of PATRIoT lab, adding that the concept was not limited to LoRaWAN and can be replicated with any other wireless technology. Where it scores over other devices is its near-zero recharging condition. “One of the reasons we don’t have a lot of asset trackers that you could put in your purse or bag is because they have to be recharged after a day or two. Whereas a tracker that can be deployed without the hassle of recharging for the next couple of years is a game-changer,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-hyd-devises-new-low-cost-location-tool-without-gps/articleshow/85508976.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Delhi||Soon, pay toll on part of Delhi-Meerut e-way||New Delhi: In what could come as a big relief “for some time” for a large number of daily office goers using the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, the NHAI won’t charge toll from commuters for using the barricaded or access-controlled stretch from Nizamuddin Bridge up to Dasna. However, those going up to Meerut will have to pay the toll soon, which will be notified by the road transport ministry soon.To begin with, the tolling will be done on the greenfield stretch from Dasna to Meerut. Officials said those travelling up to Meerut will have to pay the full toll charge for the distance travelled from their origin on the expressway. Since the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will go for “closed tolling”, the commuter will have to pay for the exact distance covered on the expressway.The toll charge will be automatically deducted from the FASTags fixed in the vehicles and commuters will end up paying double charge, if their vehicles don’t have FASTags.“Eventually, all commuters using any portion of the barricaded stretch will have to pay the user fee. But currently we don’t want to collect this charge from those travelling up to Dasna. First, we are aiming to stabilise the new system of non-stop travel on the expressway and automatic deduction of toll charge from the FASTag wallet,” explained an official.The 60 km stretch of the e-way has eight entry and exit points — Sarai Kale Khan, Akshardham, Indirapuram, Dundehera, Dasna, EPE (near Masuri), Bhojpur and Meerut. NHAI is deploying the Automatic Number Plate Recognition system for tolling to make it seamless.However, to check non-payment, toll booths will be placed on the stretch between Dasna and Meerut. “We can’t do this within city limits as it may cause congestion considering the traffic volume,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/soon-pay-toll-on-part-of-delhi-meerut-e-way/articleshow/85496806.cms||Dipak K Dash

On water from Mettur, Ramakrishnan said that with the current storage in the reservoir, there is a possibility of water shortage for the delta cultivation. The shortage of fertilizers like urea also prevailed in delta districts. So, the state government should take appropriate action to streamline the situation, he said. To a query on Afghanistan, he said that the country is completely under the control of the Taliban and added that several Indians including Tamils from across the state, are stuck in that country.

---||Kolkata||Actor Anindya Chatterjee on bicycle hit by car on Kolkata's EM Bypass, suffers tissue tear||KOLKATA: Actor Anindya Chatterjee, an avid cyclist, met with an accident on Thursday while he was paddling down EM Bypass in the early morning hours. He was rushed to a private hospital in the Alipore area with a major tissue tear on his lower back. The actor has been released from hospital and is likely to recover in a couple of weeks, doctors said. Chatterjee, who loves long hours of cycling, covering long distances with fellow cycle enthusiasts, was reportedly hit by a car between 5.15am and 5.20am opposite Fortis Hospital near Tagore Park. With cycling is banned on all major thoroughfares, lack of cycle tracks is a problem for enthusiasts like Chatterjee. According to police, Chatterjee should not have been on EM Bypass, the spot where he met with the accident. The route for cyclists there is through Naskarhat-Picnic Garden Road-CN Roy Road-Tiljala Road-East Topsia Road and finally Science City. The prescribed route sticks to the lanes and bylanes of Tiljala and Topsia, claimed sources. Actor Chatterjee, who is one of the signatories of an open letter to the chief minister, appealing to her for lifting the ban on bicycles on 36 city roads, said: “I am waiting to get back to cycling. Bicycles, like any other mode of transport, may meet with an accident. But compared to other modes, the fatalities are much less,” he said. He went on to add that unless motorists learn to respect cyclists and pedestrians on the road, such accidents will keep happening. Chatterjee, who lost consciousness and was rescued by locals, is now on a heavy dose of antibiotics for his lower back injuries. He plans to resume his shooting schedule from August 22 in Odisha. “I am alright and back home. Met with an accident today morning in front of Arsalan Bypass. Got hit by a car from behind. Landed up with a major tissue tear on my lower body. My bike is okay but I am damaged. For now bed rest, however, will resume shooting in a week’s time....” Chatterjee wrote on his Facebook page. The city has witnessed as many as three fatal accidents involving cyclists this month, the latest being that of a nine-year-old girl close to Taratala. “Since I drive both a four-wheeler and a bicycle, I know how difficult it is to build an infrastructure for cyclists. But cyclists must keep cycling on the road to reclaim their space,” Chatterjee said. Vinay Jaju, a cyclist and a NMT campaigner, said, “Since most cities have a car-centric development pattern, bicycles somehow do not fit their scheme of things. But now thousands of people have started cycling for earning their bread, leisure trips and buying essentials. Bicycle is now a favourite mode across social strata. No political party can afford to ignore bicycles on the road.” Varun Singh, another cyclist, added: “If there is an accident, the cyclist receives the rebuke and retribution, even if s/he is on the right side. However, a lot of cyclists violate road rules and invite avoidable risks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/actor-on-bicycle-hit-by-car-on-em-bypass-suffers-tissue-tear/articleshow/85498100.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

However, barring a few such as Bhagwandas Bagh and Shiva Bagh Baoli Gudimalkapur stepwell which was recently cleaned, two stepwells inside the Mah Laqa Bai Chanda’s maqbara which were restored nearly 10 years ago, Pushkarni at Sita Ramachandra Swamy Temple in Ramanajpur, and the open well at Moula Ali are in a bad state. Taking to Twitter on Friday, municipal administration and urban development principal secretary Arvind Kumar said, “We wish to revive, to the extent possible, all defunct / dilapidated #stepwells in & around #Hyderabad (sic).” The MAUD department is currently undertaking restoration project of a heritage stepwell at Bansilalpet. The stepwell, which was built during the Nizam era, was the source of drinking water for residents of Bansilalpet and nearby areas for several years but became a dumping ground due to neglect. While updating the restoration status of the well, Secunderabad zonal commissioner B Srinivas Reddy said debris would be removed continuously for the next three days for the restoration project. The government has been working with the Hyderabad Design Forum (HDF) to identify such stepwells. The forum has recently submitted a list of 100 wells in the state to MAUD department. The authorities have decided to shortlist the wells which will get a facelift and take up works in a phased manner. One stepwell in Bapu Ghat, one in Gachibowli and two in Kokapet are the ones that are soon going to undergo restoration work. The officials in coordination with a few experts have incorporated methods to recharge the groundwater as part of their stepwell restoration project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-digs-in-to-revive-heritage-stepwells/articleshow/85500439.cms||---

The two policemen, who were in an inebriated condition, kept calling Muthuselvan continuously. The next morning, the shopkeeper came to know that the policemen had taken a chicken from the shop. He took it to the notice of the SP, who transferred the two policemen to the Armed Reserve (AR) unit on punishment duty. Agitated over this, the duo in an inebriated condition attacked Muthuselvan on Thursday. The two also inflicted a cut injury on his thigh.

The district president of SP, DP Yadav, and Mahan Dal leader JP Maurya have been named in the FIR. Both the parties had organised a joint protest ‘Janakrosh Yatra’ against the state government in the district on Thursday after obtaining prior permission from the district administration. Local SP leaders have questioned the move, claiming “BJP leaders have been holding rallies and attending crowded events”. DP Yadav said, “An FIR against the party workers has been registered on instructions of the state government. It is highly objectionable that local authorities see Covid protocol violations only in the opposition party's programmes. BJP leaders have been organizing rallies and meetings. We have all the pictures and videos to show Covid norms were not followed, will the police register an FIR against BJP leaders?” Mahan Dal district president JP Maurya said, “We had taken prior permission to organize the ‘Janakrosh Yatra’. The FIR has been registered due to the political malice of the BJP government. It is highly unfortunate that Covid-19 rules and regulations are being politicized. Such actions will only motivate the BJP workers.” Soron police station house officer Anil Kumar said, “Over 100 people had participated in a march organized by Samajwadi party and Mahan Dal. Social distancing was not maintained and party workers were not wearing masks. Based on video evidence, an FIR has been registered for violation of CrPC’s section 144 and the Epidemic Diseases Act. Further investigation is being done.” Earlier this week, senior SP leader Hemraj Verma, national president of Mahan Dal Keshav Dev Maurya and 185 workers of both parties were booked under sections of IPC and the Epidemic Diseases Act in Pilibhit. Similarly, Agra police had registered an FIR against 200 BSP workers for organizing a meeting on Sunday at a private complex in violation of Covid-19 protocol and CrPC’s section 144.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/over-100-sp-workers-booked-for-protest-they-held-after-admins-nod/articleshow/85495649.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: ‘Muslim Students’ Federation brass found merit in allegations’||KOZHIKODE: The national leadership of the Muslim Students’ Federation (MSF) approached the issue of harassment allegations raised by Haritha, its women’s wing, against MSF state leadership based only on its merit and a report was submitted to the Muslim League leadership nearly a month ago, sources with the national leadership said. Haritha state committee leaders had recently come out with allegations that MSF state leadership made sexually coloured remarks, kicking up a controversy. MSF national president TP Ashrafali said though he has come across a copy of a complaint reportedly filed to the Muslim League leadership against the MSF national leadership, it didn’t seem genuine to him. “I got a copy of this so-called complaint and it didn’t have a name or a letterhead. It seemed fake to me. MSF doesn’t have any factions, like an official faction and an unofficial one, as they allege. Whoever is behind it, doesn’t know much about the organisational setup of MSF,” said Ashrafali. Sources said that the national leadership of the MSF did find merit in the allegations raised by the Haritha leaders and recommended action against the accused. “I have only approached the issue based on its merit. I got a copy of their complaint and as national president, I heard them. MSF state president P K Navas also explained his side. An accurate report on the issue was then submitted to the Muslim League leadership,” said Ashrafali. As many as 10 Haritha leaders had submitted a petition to the state women’s commission, which was forwarded to the Kozhikode district police chief. In their complaint, the leaders said Navas, during the MSF state committee meeting in Kozhikode on June 22, had asked their representatives to explain their opinion about an organisational matter with a remark, “even a prostitute” have opinions and the Haritha wing leaders can share theirs. The Muslim League had on Tuesday froze the state committee of Haritha for making public its allegations. There are reports that even the lower rank and file of Haritha was also upset about the way the party handled the issue. Against this backdrop, the League leadership would likely take action against MSF leaders facing the allegations. Chemmanagad inspector Anita Kumari on Friday said that the investigation into the case has been progressing steadily. “We have begun the investigation. The probe is in its nascent stage and more details cannot be divulged at this point,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/msf-brass-found-merit-in-allegations/articleshow/85498138.cms||---

---||Delhi||How long-term plan looks to clear haze around Delhi’s efforts to fight air pollution||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s long-term action plan against air pollution is likely to be ready by next week and will comprise short-term and long-term anti-pollution measures. The plan has been formulated after including the recommendations of experts at a two-day roundtable organised by the state government in April, the measures under the central government’s Comprehensive Action Plan of 2018 and the past suggestions of National Green Tribunal. A DPCC official confirmed the action plan was almost complete and said the role of various civic agencies will be clearly defined. “To develop the plan, suggestions from experts and stakeholders were gathered from the two-day roundtable conference held in April. The Comprehensive Action Plan and the NGT judgment in the Vardhaman Kaushik vs Union of India have also been looked at,” said the official. According to Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the major short-term measures in Delhi’s greening action plan are managing the dust and turning crop stubble into manure using a bio-decomposer solution developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa. “The plan has three components dealing with stubble burning, dust pollution and greening to mitigate pollution and dust,” said a government official who is working on the action plan. These steps will be implemented this winter. The action this winter, government officials said, will also focus on collecting data from the anti-smog tower at Connaught Place. Real-time pollution source apportionment will be determined with a study being carried out by IIT Kanpur, IIT Delhi and The Energy Research Institute. The official added that data from the real-time source apportionment study will be used to act against the biggest sources of pollution at any particular time. “While long-term measures will continue and aim to reduce pollution over several years, immediate action can be taken based on this real-time data,” said the official. Complaints about pollution can be submitted on the Green Delhi mobile app, which will also be employed to coordinate action among the various agencies and to ensure the complaint pendency rate remains low. In March, environment minister Gopal Rai had announced that the state government was working on a long-term action plan to curb air pollution and mentioned the April 12-13 roundtable in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-long-term-plan-looks-to-clear-haze-around-citys-efforts-to-fight-air-pollution/articleshow/85496768.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Mumbai||Wife, her kin killed ‘missing’ man over threat to frame them in fake cases: Cops||MUMBAI: The police on Friday arrested a 21-year-old woman from Kurla, her sister, two brothers and three friends for allegedly killing her ‘missing’ husband and burying the body near the international airport. The seven accused, who had been detained on Thursday, told the police that they had killed Deepak Sangle, a local goon, because he had threatened to frame them in a false case. The accused—Deepak’s wife Saraswati, her sister Manisha Achare (27), brothers Aditya and Anand, and friends Vishal Darade (25), Kishore Sahu (27) and Krithik Vishwakarma (22), have been booked under the relevant IPC sections for murder, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence. Zonal DCP Pranay Ashok said the police and forensic experts will exhume Sangle’s body on Saturday. In June, Sangle’s sister Sangita had filed a missing person’s complaint with Vinobha Bhave Nagar police in Kurla. The crime branch, which initiated a parallel inquiry into the case, recently got a tip-off that Sangle did not get along too well with his wife and in-laws. They scanned his cellphone call details to trace his last location and questioned those close to him, including Saraswati and Manisha. Their replies were inconsistent, so the police further interrogated the wife, who then confessed to the crime and spilled the beans on others. Saraswati told the police that her husband often beat her up and harassed her family members. “When he threatened to frame one of the accused in a false Pocso case, it was the last straw. The accused then hatched a plan to bump him off,” said a police officer. Saraswati claimed Sangle had earlier framed Darade and Sahu in false assault and molestation cases, hence they too helped them commit the crime. “On June 14, Saraswati mixed sleeping pills in her husband’s dinner. When he got drowsy, they killed him with a sharp object and buried the body 50-60m away from their house at Kranti Nagar in Kurla (W), near the international airport wall,” the officer said. The murder case was cracked by the crime branch team, led by inspector Ghanshyam Nair, assistant inspectors Amol Mali, Jaideep Jadhav, Yerkar and their staff. On Friday, all the seven accused were produced before the Kurla metropolitan magistrate’s court which remanded them in police custody till August 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cops-wife-her-kin-killed-missing-man-over-threat-to-frame-them-in-fake-cases/articleshow/85500487.cms||Ahmed Ali

The protestors have been booked under IPC sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and provisions of the Epidemic Disease Act. A large police force has been deployed around the Jama Masjid and minority-dominated localities in the city. Shivram Yadav, superintendent of police, said, “The procession was taken out in violation of CrPC section 144 (prohibits public gatherings) and Covid-19 protocol.The entire matter is being investigated based on the video recordings. Names of people who circulated content on social media calling for the protest and supported the procession will be added in the FIR.” On Wednesday, an FIR was registered against city mufti Mazidul Kudhush Khubaeb Rumi and his son, Hummdul Khudhush, for allegedly opposing the rendition of the national anthem and flag-hoisting inside the Jama Masjid premises on Independence Day. Local Muslim leaders claimed that the shahr mufti had never opposed hoisting of the national flag but merely suggested that it should not be done at a sacred space where namaz is offered. Vice-president of the All India Jamaitul Quresh Jamiluddin Qureshi, who has been named in the FIR, said, “The shahr mufti has been framed in a wrong and false case. We staged a peaceful protest and demanded that the FIR against the mufti should be withdrawn.

---||Pune||Free cellphone recharge a bait for data theft||Pune: Social media messages about a “three-month free mobile recharge by the Union government” could put cellphone users at data theft risk. One such message was picked up by the Times Verified service, which is aimed at fighting misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic. After scrutiny, the message was found to be fake. The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), via various media reports, had advised the users as early as April this year to be careful about messages promising a three-month recharge for free via the Union government. “Beware of such fraudulent messages. There is no such scheme from the government or telecom service providers. Don't share or forward such messages and also alert your family and friends,” the COAI had tweeted. The Press Information Bureau also tweeted that the claim was fake and the Union government did not make any such announcement. Experts said such messages were aimed at luring gullible users into sharing their personal information after clicking on the links. As per the data maintained with the Indian government, more than 3.17 lakh cybercrimes and 5,771 FIRs were registered online through a centralised portal in the 18 months ending February 28, 2021, with a majority of these cases being reported from Maharashtra and Karnataka. The experts said the on-ground situation might be more grave as not all victims lodge a complaint after being defrauded or subjected to data theft, with children having easy access to cellphones and other gadgets more than ever now. “Special attention needs to be paid to the children during the pandemic,” experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/free-cellphone-recharge-a-bait-for-data-theft/articleshow/85500501.cms||---

After examining the new proposals on interventions like additional bicycle lanes and walkways, the traffic police have asked PWD to submit detailed plans of the changes specific to high traffic corridors. PWD recently inaugurated a 700-metre pilot stretch near Chirag Dilli, an exercise that will be replicated across 540km of PWD roads with street space wider than 100 ft. A PWD official disclosed that work on some more segments had also been initiated. “The work on streetscaping a 4-km portion between Moolchand and Nehru Nagar has been started and footpaths, cycle tracks and greenery will be developed there,” the official said. “At some of the sites, traffic police have their reservations and have sought details of the site-plans and drawings to study them.” Traffic police officers have objected to the width of new lanes being developed, apprehending traffic jams because of them. “We don't have any issue with PWD wanting to develop and beautify the roads. Our concern is with the road width and its possible reduction,” said an officer. “The volume of traffic on the roads is increasing by the day and if the size of the roads is reduced, it will only add to more problems and impede smooth movement. We have asked PWD to let us have a look at their plans to check if any structural change is being mad…. Some traffic police officers stated that in the preliminary discussions, they had informed PWD that while it shouldn’t alter the width of the road when carrying out its revamp. PWD plans to carry beauty11 key corridors. In the first phase, work on this is taken up on the 3-km stretch on Vikas Marg between Laxmi Nagar and Karkardooma, 2.1km Mother Dairy-Narwana Road, 4km of Ring Road from Moolchand to Nehru Nagar, 6km of Rithala Road from Wazirpur to Rithala, 8.5km of Ring Road from Moti Bagh to Mayapuri and the 4.8km section from Moti Nagar to Pusa Road. “Each beautification segment requires specific interventions and features, with some common elements such as bicycle tracks, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, street furniture, designer benches and statues. A three-level greening is also being attempted with shrubs and trees,” official said, adding that the agency had also put the completion of the repairs near the Lajpat Nagar flyover on a priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-chirag-dilli-like-model-stretches-may-have-to-wait/articleshow/85496819.cms||Paras Singh
---||Hyderabad||After risking life & limb in Afghanistan, workers from Telangana rue shattered dreams||HYDERABAD: For many who had trooped into Afghanistan from Telangana to work in NATO security camps, the US withdrawal plan sealed their fate even before the Taliban took control. It was a swift end to their dream to provide a better life for families back home. Ganesh Biragouni Goud, a specialist locksmith, returned home from Afghanistan on July 16 after serving in NATO camps for 10 years. Before that he had worked in Iraq for US forces’ for five years. “My dream of providing good education to both my children and taking care of my family has been shattered,” said Ganesh from Mamidiapalli village in Armoor mandal of Nizamabad. In 2011, his leg was fractured in a Taliban attack. “A bomb had blown up before I could reach the bunker after the siren was sounded,” he recalled, adding that he had come back to India after the attack but went back the next year. “All of us who were employed in the security forces camps in Afghanistan are now in a situation where we cannot take care of our families,” he said. Each worker used to earn between $500 and $1,000 per month, he said. There are others like Ganesh who have returned in the last couple of months and their situation is the same. Most now plan to join hands and hold a meeting to bring their plight to government’s notice. “I was trained in Dubai for five days before being taken to Afghanistan,” Sagar of Velpur mandal in Nizamabad district said. Sagar, who worked as a carpenter in the camps, estimated that around 600 people from Telangana alone worked with the security forces in Afghanistan and have returned now. They were all recruited through various contract agencies. A few who were evacuated from the US embassy in Kabul to Qatar after the Taliban takeover have not yet returned. “We will wait for two or three months for the situation to settle down and then take our issues to the government seeking help,” Goud said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-risking-life-limb-in-afghanistan-workers-from-t-rue-shattered-dreams/articleshow/85500566.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Kolkata||Heritage plaque for Sr PC Sorcar’s house||Kolkata: Around 9.15pm on April 9, 1956, the telephones in London’s Lime Grove studios began ringing. They didn’t stop for two hours as alarmed viewers rang in to find out if the Indian magician who had ‘murdered’ a girl on television had been arrested. The slicing of the girl was magician PC Sorcar’s final act in BBC’s top-rated Panorama programme. After “sawing” the girl into two, he had put the two halves together and then attempted to revive her but something had appeared amiss. He was shaking his head ominously when the show came to an abrupt end. In thousands of homes across England, viewers had gaped in horror for a few seconds. And then they began to call the BBC. “Needless to say, the girl was fine. My father had deliberately concluded the show there to mystify the audience. His sense of timing and his engagement with the audience was amazing. He was the greatest magician and illusionist and the first Indian magician to make a name internationally,” recounted his son PC Sorcar Junior, who took over the mantle from his father after his death in 1971. Sorcar, then barely 57, had died of a massive heart attack in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan, on January 6, 1971, where he was performing. Sorcar is best remembered for his Indrajal show that premiered in Paris in 1955. On Friday, Intach along with Rotary, installed a heritage plaque at the residence of PC Sorcar. Similar honour plaques had been installed in the homes of music composer and singer Pankaj Mullick, sarod maestro Ali Akbar Khan and astrophysicist Meghnad Saha. Later this year, plaques will be installed in the houses of polymath Raja Rajendralal Mitra and mathematician and physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. The Art Deco house on a stretch of road that was rechristened Jadu Samrat PC Sorcar Sarani was his final address. Born Protul Chandra Sorcar in Tangail, East Bengal (now Bangladesh), he had migrated to Kolkata, where he became a magician at a young age and bought a house in Jamir Lane, followed by two houses in Rashbehari Avenue near Ballygunge station. But it was finally at the 276/1 address that he settled down and made the home his magic lab, elevating science into a never-seen-before art form.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-plaque-for-sr-pc-sorcars-house/articleshow/85498140.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Last year, the administration ordered schools not to increase fees for the 2020-21 session. This was later challenged in Punjab and Haryana high court but this year, no such order has been issued for private schools. One of the parents, Kamal Kishore, said, “Last year, schools were asking for admission fee, which includes computer fee and laboratory fee but after orders from the administration, they took a step back. This year, we are facing the same problem as school authorities are saying there is no such order this year and we have to deposit the revised fees.” A parent, whose child is a student of a private school in Sector 40, Chandigarh, said, “The school has hiked fee by 10% to 15% during the lockdown. We tried to contact the principal, but she is not ready to talk and ignored our concerns. We have faced financial loss during the pandemic and the school authorities have shown no mercy.” Parents, many of whom sustained losses and even lost jobs during the pandemic questioned the rationale of paying for facilities not being used by the students. Earlier, parents of school children staged protests against fee hike and additional charges imposed by school authorities. They demanded waiver of all other charges except for tuition fee. The administration has not taken any action till date. The facilities for which parents are being charged include computers, medical facilities, lab charges and multimedia fees. A parent whose child is a student of a private school in Sector 27 said, “Students are being charged for facilities which they haven’t used for the last one year. We have incurred financial losses during the lockdown and school authorities are adding fuel to the fire. Even if there is 5% hike why is it? Our kids are being taught online so for what are we being charged for things they are not even using?” Principal of the said school however, denied the claims made by parents. “The school is charging fees according to the judgment of the court. We don’t charge fees on use of computers or labs,” she said. Nitin Goyal, president, parents’ association, Chandigarh said demand for hiked fee was not the only problem for parents. “Many schools are not giving transfer certificates to students now as they have not paid the entire amount asked by schools. We have tried reaching out to school authorities and administration but no action has been taken as of now. Since the issue is with the Supreme Court, we hope something comes on the table for parents,” he said. Director, school education, Rupinderjit Singh Brar said, “The issue is ongoing and we are seeing progress. Orders for the same will be issued in a month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fee-hike-demand-hounds-parents-dealing-with-covid-losses/articleshow/85498142.cms||---

Residents and shopkeepers had complained to textiles and fisheries minister Aslam Shaikh, who took up the issue with Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray. Thackeray told BMC to review it. “All work has to be in sync with what is required for development. Obviously, there are multiple views about the utility of skywalks, but as locals have voiced reservations, it needs to be reviewed,” Aaditya told TOI. The skywalk was to connect Malad railway station to Pushpa Park Metro station. TimesViewThe decision to stay and review Malad (E) skywalk is welcome. Several skywalks in Mumbai have been declared dilapidated and dismantled. Many that are still standing are rarely used by pedestrians. BMC’s plans to ease movement of pedestrians is good, but it must spend such huge sums on constructing skywalks after proper planning so that they don’t turn into white elephants. BMC must ensure proper maintenance and illumination of skywalks too. In fact, it must review all skywalk projects.This is the second such project against which residents have protested. Residents had opposed a BMC plan to construct a Rs 91-crore skywalk in Borivli (E). The proposal, cleared early this year, was to connect Borivli station (E) with Omkareshwar Temple on M G Road. Residents said the skywalk will be a waste of money and further congest the area. Shaikh said it will block shops and reduce footpath space. “It was being built without proper planning or thought. It would have turned into a white elephant, like many other skywalks in Mumbai, which people rarely use. We urged the minister to stay it. He directed BMC to review it. BMC officials who allow such ill-planned projects must be probed,” Shaikh said. “This area is congested and the skywalk would have added to the mess. It will be a massive waste of public money. Many residents opposed it. The road is 60-ft wide on paper, but in reality it is only 20-50ft. The skywalk would have created a major traffic jam and congestion. Skywalks are in bad condition and none are used by pedestrians. We opposed it,” said businessman Vipul P Shah. BMC also cleared a proposal to construct a Rs 20-crore skywalk in Kurla (W) and proposed one from Taximen’s Colony to Shrikrishna Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-govt-stays-bmc-plan-for-rs-15cr-skywalk-at-malad/articleshow/85500598.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Justice Subramonium Prasad noted that the woman was accused of a serious offence and there was a strong likelihood of her fleeing from justice.“Chargesheet qua the petitioner (accused woman) is yet to be filed. The petitioner’s voice sample has to be taken and the investigation has also to be conducted as to whether there are any other cases in which the petitioner is involved and as stated earlier the investigation is at a nascent stage. The petitioner is accused of an offence under Section 328 of Indian Penal Code, which is a serious offence,” the judge observed in the order refusing relief.Section 328 IPC makes administration of intoxicating drug with intent to cause hurt or commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment up to ten years.According to the FIR registered by a man, he went to the house of a person known to him, who introduced the accused woman to the complainant as his girlfriend. It is claimed that after consuming a soft drink, the complainant started feeling dizzy and became unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the complainant was shocked to see the accused woman with him in an objectionable position, it is alleged.According to the complaint, the complainant then narrated the incident to his friend. However, the duo started demanding a mobile phone, a TV and Rs 2 lakh in cash from him, it added. It was alleged that the complainant was threatened that if demands were not met, the woman would file a case of rape against him.Eventually, an FIR for the alleged rape was also filed against the complainant at the behest of the woman and her boyfriend. The high court noted that “a reading of the FIR shows that this is a case of honey trap” and balance has to be struck between free and fair investigation on one hand and prevention of harassment and unjustified detention on the other.The court said that there was “some justification” in the prosecution’s stand that the woman’s conduct showed the likelihood of her fleeing from justice and that she would not cooperate with the police’s investigation.It further said that the probability of the woman and her boyfriend threatening the complainant also could not be ruled out at this stage. The police opposed the grant of pre-arrest bail on the ground that the present case was that of honey trap and the moment the complainant filed the FIR, the woman went into hiding and surfaced only when the co-accused, her boyfriend, was granted bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/honey-trapping-case-hc-refuses-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/85495714.cms||---

The board could only sell about 1,300 such shirts since the brand was launched during the 2018 Onam season. As per the data submitted in the assembly last week by industries minister P Rajeeve, khadi has so far received only Rs 11.31 lakh from the sales of this particular brand. That means, only around 1,300 shirts were sold by khadi under this brand, given that this particular brand of shirts are priced in the range of Rs 700 to Rs 1,000. However, to a question on what was the government’s sales expectation for this particular brand, the minister said the board had not set any profit target while launching this brand. He further said the board will give priority to selling this particular brand if there is more demand for the product, as its intention was only to popularise khadi among the general public. Meanwhile, Kerala khadi and village industries board secretary K A Retheesh said the number of shirts sold under the brand was not miniscule, as ‘Sakhavu’ brand is only one of the several brands of shirts brought out by khadi. “In the last two years, sales were seriously hit due to the floods and pandemic. We are slowly picking up the sales this year,” he said. He said khadi also intends to undertake widespread marketing and value addition to the existing services to catch up with the changing times. “The board has decided to launch new shops in all taluk headquarters with private participation that will include facilities for stitching, laundry services, etc. Along with this, all products will also be promoted more actively,” he said. Despite the excuses, the number of shirts sold under ‘Sakhavu’ brand seems to be less, given that the government was giving special focus on marketing khadi products and its products, including shirts which are available for sale online. Khadi board vice-chairperson Shobhana George had claimed while launching the brand in August 2018 that the brand name was introduced as a marketing strategy for khadi to attract the younger generation towards its products. The name ‘Sakhavu’ that has Communist connection was seemingly launched with a motive to capitalize on the prevailing political environment in the state. Khadi has apparel products under multiple brand names at present. It includes Khadi Cool, Leader, Milleni, Summer Cool, Sakhavu, Sundari Pattu, Payyanur Pattu, Sreekrishnapuram Pattu and Ananthapuri Silks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/khadis-sakhavu-fails-to-impress/articleshow/85498193.cms||KP Saikiran

Pitroda, who had joined in from Chicago, US, said: "It seems that some people did not want me to join this function." The programme, organised by the Rajasthan government on the occasion of Rajiv's 77th birth anniversary, was marked with technical glitches. Earlier, while showing a short film on the state government's IT achievements, the show was paused for about five minutes due to technical reasons. As soon as Pitroda started his speech, he lost audio. Since it took time to establish contact, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot filled the vacuum with his speech. Pitroda later joined the function by using his mobile. Alleging a conspiracy, he said his computer was hacked and locked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/computer-hacked-to-keep-me-away-from-rajasthan-govt-event-alleges-sam-pitroda/articleshow/85504794.cms||---
---||Pune||Oxford university starts human trials for intranasal AstraZeneca vax||PUNE: The University of Oxford has started the phase 1 clinical trials on 54 healthy adults to investigate intranasal inoculation with the vaccine it developed with AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222) after positive findings of the studies done on hamsters and rhesus macaques, said a group of researchers, including Sarah Gilbert, in a paper published in Science Translation Medicine earlier this week. AstraZeneca has partnered with Pune-based Serum Institute of India for the supply of the vaccine to the Indian government, which is being manufactured under the Covishield brand name. India has relied heavily on Covishield for its vaccination drive. Intranasal vaccines are administered through syringes, nasal sprays or aerosol delivery straight into the nasal cavity. The most commonly used intranasal vaccine is the influenza vaccine. This mode of vaccination is easier to administer than the current intra-muscular injection. In the two animal studies, the intranasal vaccine has been found to reduce the viral load and lessen the impact on the lungs. Unlike the previous vaccines, this vaccine was tested on hamsters on an early mutation (D614G) of the nCoV spike protein and was found to reduce the viral load in nasal swabs. Dr Nanasaheb Thorat, a Marie-Curie fellow at Oxford, said the intranasal method would be a game-changer with possibly lesser side-effects. He said that since the vaccine, which is already in use, has been tried through a different route of administration, it would need fewer approvals. “Intranasal vaccines are easier to administer and handle. Even children can easily be given the vaccine, like in case of the influenza vaccine. The latest research shows that the intra-nasal vaccine reduced virus load and helped prevent the spread of infection to the lungs. Since the vaccine has not been changed, it should not face regulatory checks again,” Thorat told TOI. Oxford University started the human trials after the researchers, including Gilbert who designed the vaccine, found that viral loads in swabs obtained from intra-nasally vaccinated hamsters were lower, and no viral RNA or infectious virus was found in the lung tissue after a direct challenge or after direct contact with infected hamsters. The research paper was published earlier this month. The research further states that the intranasal vaccination of rhesus macaques also resulted in reduced virus concentrations in nasal swabs and a reduction in viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and lower respiratory tract tissue. The researchers tested the intranasal vaccination route against the nCoV strain containing the D614G mutation. The paper states that both studies demonstrated that the vaccine protects against SARS-CoV-2 containing the D614G mutation. It is likely that this translates to other vaccine platforms as well. The researchers said the data presented in the paper supports the investigation of intranasal delivery of Covid-19 vaccines. The data presented demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2-specific mucosal immunity is possible after intranasal vaccination and results in a reduction in virus detection in nasal swabs in hamsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/oxford-univ-starts-human-trials-for-intranasal-astrazeneca-vax/articleshow/85500602.cms||---

According to him, it will also lead to achieving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s target of a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024, as well spread economic growth to emerging clusters in the state. Speaking after launching the Karnataka Digital Economy Mission’s Mysuru office at Hebbal Industrial Area in the city on Friday, he said that the state’s IT sector is presently contributing 25% GSDP to the nation. “Of this, Bengaluru alone contributes 91%. The government has launched the Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDEM) with the intention to create about 10 lakh jobs by 2025, by expanding the IT sector beyond Bengaluru,” he stated. The government has set a target to reach the goal of USD 150 billion in IT exports through KDEM in the next five years. He said the government has taken measures to strengthen the virtual infrastructure, like increasing broadband and internet connectivity, to facilitate the growth of the digital economy, across the state. Additional chief secretary (IT and BT) V Ramana Reddy said that the KDEM has been set up on a public-private partnership (ppp) model. This model was adopted in Singapore to promote hassle-free growth of industries and the economy, without interference from government, he said.

While opposition leader Siddaramaiah is focused on winning this ward, JD(S) has suffered a setback with the Congress candidate meeting disgruntled JD(S) MLA G T Devegowda and seeking his blessings. JD(S) has announced S Leelavathi, who is the sister-in-law of disqualified mayor Rukmini Madegowda, as its candidate. Rajani Annaiah, who contested from Congress from the ward in 2018, had lost to Rukmini [JD(S)] with a thin margin of 393 votes. Rajani had filed a petition in the Mysuru District Court seeking disqualification of Rukmini citing incorrect declaration of assets while filing the nomination, and also won the case. Even though Rukmini approached the high court, it upheld the verdict of the lower court. By then, Rukmini had become the mayor. Following the verdict, she stepped down from her post. JD(S) sources said Devegowda had supported JD(S) leader Madegowda in winning the ZP election and also his wife Rukmini in winning the corporation election. But as he remained neutral in the mayor’s election, Madegowda (being loyal to Devegowda) moved closer to him and JD(S) MLA S R Mahesh. He managed to bag the coveted mayor post to his wife Rukmini. This had upset Devegowda, they stated. Both Rajani and Leelavathi have started campaigning in the ward, and are likely to file their nomination papers on August 23, the last day for doing so. BJP, which had lost the deposit last time, is yet to finalise its candidate. Sources said there are six aspirants for the party ticket. BJP senior corporator Shivakumar told TOI that district minister S T Somashekar will select and name the candidate on Saturday. While Congress has teamed up with JD(S), BJP is seeking to lure the latter to rule the MCC for the first time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cong-jds-to-fight-it-out-in-bypoll-for-ward-36/articleshow/85496663.cms||Lakshmikantha BK

This was stated by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Friday while addressing businessmen, industrialists and legal authorities after completing the registration process of the trust deed pertaining to the emergence of India’s first international arbitration centre He added that this was the first step for the emergence of an alternate dispute resolution facility and expected it to be a reality in the next few months. Justice Lavu Nageswara Rao of the Supreme Court and Justice RV Raveendran, former Supreme Court judge, were made lifetime trustees of the arbitration centre. Justice R Subhash Reddy, also of the Supreme Court and state ministers KT Rama Rao and Indra Karan Reddy, were also present at the event organised at the official residence of Justice Hima Kohli, Chief Justice of Telangana high court. Chief Justice Ramana said the emergence of the international facility at Hyderabad was his dream. He thanked chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for the speed with which he agreed to housing the facility the moment it was discussed with him in June. Explaining the huge opportunity, Chief Justice Ramana said Hyderabad’s exports of goods and services worth $22 billion in 2019-20 and the state’s $120 billion gross domestic product besides 12% annual growth would make Hyderabad an apt place for international arbitration and mediation. He also said that just because it was an international centre did not mean that domestic arbitration disputes could not be handled. He called upon all sections of people and professionals to make use of this facility. “No more waiting for the dispute resolution, once the centre is functional it will ensure quality and quick resolution that is affordable too,” said Chief Justice Ramana. Justice Nageswara Rao underlined the need for ensuring a conducive environment for enforcement of contracts along with ease of doing business. “Paris, London and Singapore were earlier centres for international arbitration and now Hyderabad would stand next to them,” he said. “For India, this would be a state-of-the-art facility with quick and quality resolution options by the best judicious minds.” Justice Ramana reminded the audience that economic reforms in India were heralded by another Telangana son, PV Narasimha Rao, during his prime ministerial days in 1995. Seen from this angle, Hyderabad would be an apt place for international arbitration. KTR in his speech thanked the apex court judges for bringing the international facility to Hyderabad that offered quick resolution to commercial disputes. “We will extend all support to the centre,” he assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wheels-set-in-motion-for-intl-arbitration-centre/articleshow/85503345.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

This follows a directive from the UGC. VC Vidyashankar S confirmed to TOI that the circular has been withdrawn following a directive from the UGC. “The Governor-Chancellor too has issued an order in this regard. I will write a letter to UGC in this regard,” the VC stated. Vidyashankar said the exact number of students who are yet to receive a convocation certificate is not known. The varsity in April has issued a circular stating that all undergraduate, post graduate, diploma (non-technical) students enrolled through collaborative institutes on or before 2012-132 are eligible to receive convocation certificates. They were directed to apply through collaborative institutes and if such institutes are non-functional they had been given the option of applying directly at the university. Sources claimed so far only a handful number of students enrolled through collaborative institutes outside Karnataka have come forward seeking the certificate. KS Shivaramu, former member of Board of Management, KSOU, claimed following his appeal to UGC and Governor-Chancellor against the decision of KSOU to issue convocation certificates to students from outside Karnataka enrolled through collaborative institutes, UGC has directed to stop the process.

The Manjeri judicial first-class magistrate court-1 has granted permission to the superintendent of Customs to record the arrest of the accused who were in judicial custody in connection with the case registered by Karippur police. The accused who would be arrested by the Customs are Mubasheer (A1), Suhail (A2), Salee (A3), Muhammed Mushthafa (A4), Hassan (A5), Faizal (A6), Shanid (A7), Fayaz (A8), Fijas (A16), Muhammedali (A17), Sufiyan (A18), Riyas (A19), Muhammed Basheer (A20), Shmasudheen (A21), Muhammed Fasil (A22), Muhammed Hafiz (A23) and Abdul Naser (A24). Ramanattukara heist bid case pertains to an attempt to capture smuggled gold on June 21. A vehicle chase, reportedly for capturing the smuggled gold, resulted in an accident at Ramanattukara in which five persons were killed. However, the Customs had in fact foiled the smuggling bid at the Karippur airport and seized the 2.33kg of smuggled gold hours before the accident at Ramanattukara. Earlier, Customs had submitted before the additional chief judicial magistrate (Economic Offences) while opposing the bail plea of key accused Arjun Ayanki in the Karippur gold smuggling case that they expect to unravel more evidence by questioning the 17 accused persons in the Ramanattukara case. Customs submitted that even as they intercepted the carrier, Shafeeque, with gold, another gang of smugglers, who had purportedly financed the smuggling operation, had gathered outside the airport with the intention to intercept Shafeeque and Arjun in the event Shafeeque hands over the gold to Arjun. According to Customs, this gang followed Arjun’s vehicle when he moved out of the airport. “A cinematic chase ensued and one of the chasing vehicles collided with a lorry and five people lost their life… It can be seen from the above FIR and remand report that these gangs were targeting Arjun as he was trying to snatch away the gold being financed and smuggled by another set of people and this was not the first such instance of snatching,” Customs had submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ramanattukara-case-customs-set-to-arrest-17-accused-persons/articleshow/85498291.cms||---

In a letter to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, Shelar pointed out that the 3.73km track will cost Rs 44.65 crore per km, which is 500% more than the cost of constructing national highways. “I am writing to oppose it and demand immediate withdrawal of BMC’s sanction to the proposed project. The project has been hurriedly planned, approved without consideration of ground realities and without citizens’ dialogue, consultation or feedback. Its cost is alarming. It equals to BMC spending Rs 44.65 crore per km for this fancy project... which is 500% more than the cost of constructing national highways, which includes land acquisition costs,” Shelar wrote. Bandra (HIG) Phase III CHS Union and Bandra Reclamation Area Volunteers Organisation (BRAVO) also opposed the project. “We are deeply concerned and oppose the project. Such wasteful expenditure when Maharashtra is facing a second coronavirus wave and over 75,000 lives have been lost, should be deferred by five years, and the money should be used to build world class healthcare infrastructure. The stretch of land from Mahim Fort till Bandra Bandstand is isolated and is misused by criminals, anti-social elements and drug addicts. The track, with no restrictions or barricading, will tend to cut the promenade walkway into a narrower place and the open side will be a direct invitation for illegal activity, including drugs, crime and other undesirables, which local residents oppose,” Vidya Vaidya, chairperson of BRAVO, said in a letter to Chahal. BMC officials said the track will be six metres wide, and will have a walkway for pedestrians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bandra-residents-puncture-rs-168cr-cycling-track-plans/articleshow/85500649.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mysuru||e-KYC enrolment for ration holders crippled by poor server connectivity||Mysuru: The e-KYC enrolment of all ration cardholders initiated by the food and civil supplies department from August 1 to 10, is crippled by poor server connectivity and erratic power supply across the state. The state achieved 67% progress against the targeted 4.2 crore beneficiaries as on August 11. Sowing season and other issues have also affected the drive. The department launched this drive in March last year to weed out bogus beneficiaries, to avoid pilferage in the system besides to streamline the ration distribution across the state after the Centre launched One Nation, One Ration scheme and, stopped it due to the pandemic. Over 4.2 crore BPL, Antyodaya and APL beneficiaries were availing the ration under Anna Bhagya free rice distribution scheme from the targeted public distribution system scheme through 20,178 fair price shops spread over across the state. After the department decided to relaunch the e-KYC enrolment, it shouldered the responsibility to all FPS license holders to collect the biometric thumb impression through their laptops and other systems. Currently, the state and Central governments are distributing 10kg rice free of cost to ration card holders. Mysuru district too has 7.3 lakh ration card holders of which 6, 55,751 are BPL card holders, 50,444 are Antyodaya card holders and 26,343 are the APL card holders. The district has 1,011 fair price shops, including 232 in Mysuru city alone. Mysuru city alone has 1, 47,488 card holders. Food and civil supplies department commissioner Shamla Iqbal told TOI that the department has achieved 67% of the total target as of August 11. “The department will continue the drive for the next month too from September 1 to 10 to cover the remaining beneficiaries,” the officer added. “Despite the Covid third wave threat, fair price shop owners across the state are doing their best to achieve 100% e-KYC enrolment target. As they are facing issues like poor server connections, erratic power supply and other technical glitches, the department must extend the drive for a few more months. As the owners are also finding it difficult to collect biometric thumb impression of children and elderly, the government must open Aadhaar centres in all Gram Panchayat limits,” State Fair Price Shop Owners Association president Krishnappa told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/e-kyc-enrolment-for-ration-holders-crippled-by-poor-server-connectivity/articleshow/85496309.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC junks plea to revise marks 6 years after passing||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has dismissed an appeal filed by an MG Science College’s former student demanding that Gujarat University make a correction in his MSc results. The student had contended that the university had not used the correct internal marks to calculate his final results. The division bench on August 19 upheld a single judge’s order and said that the contention about the veracity of the result was raised six years after the student, Anurag Chaudhary, had taken the course. The court was of the opinion that the student was trying to turn the clock back to qualify for examinations by crossing the 55% barrier, the minimum requirement in the field of academics. The division bench said that if at a belated stage the student’s request were to be accepted, it would result in variation of marks of the first semester and the second semester by 40. The same would happen for the next two semesters. The court said that raising the issue six years after he cleared his course did not make any sense.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-junks-plea-to-revise-marks-6-years-after-passing/articleshow/85500689.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Artists get platform to seek legal help||Kolkata: Can copyrighted music be used for webinars without any legal complications? Can copyright claims be made for dance choreographies? Can small arts organizations function without an international complaints committee to address sexual harassment cases? These were some of the questions plaguing artists that are being answered by an independent online platform called Unmute — A Performer’s Guide to Speaking Up - Laws, Rights, Resources. With senior arts leader and Fullbright scholar Arshiya Sethi, performer-arts manager Paramita Saha and dancer-lawyer Somabha Bandopadhyay as founding members, this platform was launched recently to serve as a free legal resource centre for the art fraternity. It all started in 2020 when Sethi started organizing panel discussions on the intersectional space of arts and law. Saha got involved in February 2021 and organised a programme called Unmute. That was focused on sexual harassment issues in the art community. “We started a series called ‘Shilpakala ebong Aain’ in July on arts and the law. It covered abuse of power, copyright issues, rights of performers, rights of LGBTQIA+ artists, artists with disability and child artists,” Saha said. The need for setting up a free resource center - unmute.help - emerged during these discussions. Somabha BandopadhyayRepresentatives in the platform have people from arts and legal backgrounds, including Shameek Sen and Kavita Singh who teach at West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences. Organizational ethical practice advisor Asiya Shervani, sociologist Urmi Basu, Samuho (a collective of women and non-binary performers) are also on board. Singh told TOI that female artists are “vulnerable” when it comes to seeking justice in cases involving sexual assault. “Many performances involve intimate moments and it is often very difficult to establish the partners’ wrong intentions. Often heads of organisations do not want such complaints to be taken up for the fear of earning a bad name. Our panel will provide a victim support and redressal mechanism as well as organize for counselling,” she said. According to Bandopadhyay, the artist fraternity, including music labels and online platforms, need to know about the fair use of copyrighted material for various purposes. During the pandemic, a lot of programmes are being hosted digitally. Copyrighted music is being used for educational purposes or in webinars. “But people are confused about whether or not this will be seen as copyright violation under Section 52 of Indian Copyright Act. Our platform will have information to make people aware that this is not a violation since there is no profit motive involved in it especially when due credits are given. We will also make group members aware of their legal rights under the copyright act,” Bandopadhyay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/artists-get-platform-to-seek-legal-help/articleshow/85498296.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Locals rushed to pull the man — identified as Panyam Venkata Subbaiah from neighbouring Kasipuram village — out of the fire, but failed to save him. The incident was recorded on a CCTV camera. According to Owk police sub-inspector Jagadeeswara Reddy, Subbaiah came to Sunkesula to see the Muharram procession. As part of the Muharram observance, a huge bonfire was lit for fire-walk. Initially, Subbaiah began walking around the fire pit. Locals, who noticed Subbaiah was in an inebriated state, reprimanded him and forced him to sit on a bench nearby. After some time, while people were engrossed in the Peerla Panduga (Muharram observance), Subbaiah again went near the fire pit, and suddenly jumped into it. Though villagers pulled him out after great difficulty, Subbaiah, who sustained severe burns, was already dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-man-jumps-into-fire-pit-during-muharram-dies/articleshow/85503350.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

It will provide one-on-one counselling and quality clinical interventions to students, faculty and staff on the campus. Inaugurated by Neerja Birla, founder and chairperson, MPower is an attempt to bring about a change in mindset about mental well-being. “At MPower cell, we will help people open up about their mental health concerns and seek professional help. We will also work to dispel the stigma around mental illness and empower individuals and their families to foster nurturing environments,” she said. The academic disruption caused by the pandemic has severely affected the students community at large. “With no definitive solutions in sight, it certainly impacted their mental health. The isolation and limited socialisation too played a role in the downfall of mental health in our youngsters… To remedy the situation, we need to take a collaborative approach and we are pleased to launch the MPower cell on our campus,” said Prof G Sundar, director, BITS, Pilani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bits-launches-mental-health-cell-on-campus/articleshow/85500734.cms||---

The students tried to speak to the officials about their uncertain future and request them for help, but BKC cops arrived at the spot and took them to the police station. They were allowed to go home soon after. “We did not come here to protest. We wanted to convey a message to developed countries like the US, the UK and Canada to provide Afghanistan nationals shelter and visas so that they can build their future there,” Dilawar Nasari, an Afghan national studying MBA in Pune, said. “I am worried about my family. They are on the run. I have not been able to communicate with them since the Taliban takeover.” Another concern is the need for funds. “My family would send me money every month, but now I don’t know how I will be able to fund my education and pay my expenses like rent,” Nasari lamented. Thousands of Afghan stud-ents across India have been making desperate efforts to co-ntact their families back home. Many have also appealed to the Indian government to help their compatriots, who had gone back to Afghanistan due to the Covid-19-induced closure of ed-ucational institutes, to return to India and to extend their visas. “The Indian government is always helpful, but we are worried about our future and our families back home,” said Khalid Laraway, an Afghan student. “My family had called me two days back and told me not to return to Afghanistan.” Mohammed Ali, a BBA student from Kabul, said, “Many Afghan students whose visas or passports are about to expire have requested the Indian government to extend the visa period. If we go home, we may be killed by the Taliban.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-32-afghan-students-assemble-outside-us-consulate-seek-help/articleshow/85503352.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Police unlikely to register case against Saseendran||Thiruvananthapuram: The police may not register a case against forests and wildlife minister A K Saseendran over the complaint that the minister tried to settle a sexual harassment case “amicably”. It is reliably learnt that the police received a legal opinion that the connotation in the minister’s conversation that the matter should be “settled amicably” is not illegal. There was no mention of the victim's name or anything against the victim in the minister’s words. Neither there was any pressure from Saseendran to withdraw the complaint or any threatening tone, the legal opinion is learnt to have said. The complainant, a native of Kundara in Kollam, had petitioned the police on June 28 this year against two persons who had tried to defame her in a group titled “NCP Kollam”. The complainant also alleged that one of the two persons -Padmakaran- had tried to physically assault her. Since both the complainant and the accused are NCP activists, the minister, who is an NCP leader in the state, had spoken to the complainant over the phone and asked her to settle the dispute amicably. Saseendran’s intervention in the matter had become a controversy, and the Opposition had raised the matter in the assembly on July 22. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had, however, strongly defended Saseendran and said that the minister had tried to intervene in the matter under the belief that the dispute is an internal affair of NCP, and after learning that it is a complaint about the assault on womanhood, the minister had backed off. The minister has not done anything wrong, and there was no attempt on his part to weaken the case, Vijayan had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-unlikely-to-register-case-against-saseendran/articleshow/85498328.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC notice over apprehension of encounter||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has issued notice to the state government over a petition seeking protection for an inmate against alleged threats by the police that he would be killed in an encounter. Besides seeking reply from the state government, the high court has also sought a report from the Surat police commissioner on whether the grievance of the inmate and his family has been redressed with regard to the family’s apprehension that he would be done to death. The case involved one Altaf Patel from Surat, who has been booked under Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime Act (GujCTOC) on the basis of his past alleged offences. His wife Shabana Patel has filed a petition in the high court through advocate Nauman Qureshi and submitted that after his arrest by Navsari police in 2018, a police officer had put in revolver in her husband’s mouth and threatened him to kill in an encounter. She expressed apprehension that her husband could be killed in an encounter. In her apprehension about the safety of her husband, the petitioner cited a decade old litigation in the high court, in which the court had taken a suo motu cognizance of Patel’s letter and filed a PIL on his claims of custodial torture he was subjected to and ordered an investigation. In 2011, Patel was detained by Vadodara SOG and allegedly tortured him by giving electric shocks on his private parts. He was detained on accusation of aiding a drug paddler to escape custody. After ordering a probe on Patel’s custodial torture, the high court refused to accept the police report as correct one. Later in 2013, the HC converted the PIL in a criminal litigation, which is pending till date. On Patel’s wife’s apprehension and demand that the police should be asked to follow the Supreme Court’s guidelines to ensure prisoner’s safety and security, the HC has sought government’s reply by September 14. The HC has also asked the Surat police commissioner to look into the petitioner’s representation and submit a report on action taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-apprehension-of-encounter/articleshow/85500717.cms||---

---||Thane||Maharashtra: Kin of forest officer who died in mishap granted Rs 85 lakh payout||THANE: The family members of a forest officer from Murbad in Thane district who died in a road accident in 2018 have been awarded a compensation of around Rs 85 lakh in a recent order of Thane accident claims tribunal (MACT). In an order, MACT member RN Rokade ordered the two opponents to pay up compensation to the family of the deceased jointly and severally along with 7% interest from the date of claim. The two opponents in the case were Rajendra Rathore, owner of the tanker, and New India Assurance Company. The claimants were represented by advocate SM Pawar. The insurance company contested the claim on various grounds represented by advocate KV Poojari. The owner of the tanker did not not appear and the matter was decided exparte against him — meaning, in his absence.  In the claim, the widow of the deceased, Avinash Bombe, his aged parents and children informed the tribunal that Bombe, then aged 38, worked as a range forest officer. On May 14, 2018, around 11pm, he was near the entrance of a housing complex on his bike parked on the service road when the oncoming tanker driven in a “rash and negligence manner collided head-on” with the bike. Bombe fell down, suffered serious injures and died on the spot. His family told the tribunal that he drew a salary of Rs 43,396. They submitted that they were totally dependent on him and the claim was filed for award of compensation. In his order the member of the tribunal observed, “.. the accident took place solely because of rash and negligent driving on the part of the driver of the tanker. The insurance company failed to adduce any material on record to prove breach of contract of insurance, if any. The liability of both the opponents to pay the compensation cannot be gainsaid. Therefore, I am inclined to hold that both opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation.” The total compensation amount which is Rs 84,94,600 includes, Rs 40,000 towards consortium to the widow, Rs.15,000 each towards loss of estate and funeral expenses, the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-kin-of-forest-officer-who-died-in-mishap-granted-rs-85l-payout/articleshow/85500719.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

---||Dehradun||Rly orders speed limit as train mows down 2 elephants; loco pilot booked||Rudrapur: A day after two elephants – an adult female and its calf – were hit by the Agra Fort Express in the Terai Central forest division, railway authorities have issued orders to slow down speed of trains on the route. The loco pilot of the train that hit the pachyderms has also been booked under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act. The train was running at an estimated 80kmph. It was headed from Lalkuan to Ramnagar in Uttarakhand on Wednesday morning when it hit the elephants in the Peepal Padav forest range of Terai East forest division, half a kilometre from Sidcul Halt railway station. In an official order on Thursday, the divisional railway manager of the North-Eastern Railway centre in Bareilly said that trains on the Rudrapur-Kashipur railway line should run at a speed of 50 kmph during the day and 30 kmph at night. The rail line connecting Rudrapur, Kashipur and Ramnagar has elephant corridors in Tanda and Peepal Padav forest range. In the last two decades, Uttarakhand has recorded 22 elephant deaths on tracks, according to the forest department. In 2018, the Uttarakhand high court had issued a slew of directions to protect elephants from being mowed down by trains. The railway authorities and the forest department were asked to identify elephant corridors and build trenches and underpasses to prevent deaths on tracks. The court had also said that the speed limit of trains while passing through such corridors should be fixed at 25 kmph. The bench had also suggested use of wireless animal tracking systems to monitor jumbo movements.

---||Hyderabad||No flow of funds from Telangana & Andhra Pradesh, Krishna River Management Board struggles||HYDERABAD: The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) — set up to resolve water issues between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — has been fighting its own battle with both the states. With Telangana and AP not releasing funds even after repeated requests, for the past three years the KRMB has been facing funds crunch even for day-to-day operations. The board was forced to borrow Rs Rs 1 crore from the Centre in the form of a grant to keep functioning. It is now proposing to refund the amount if both states release their share of funds. Not just this, the board is also facing shortage of personnel, including engineers. Interestingly, the Centre’s recent gazette notification said both the states have to deposit Rs Rs 200 crore each for the functioning of the board. The KRMB has included the issue in the agenda items and is planning to raise it during the 14th board meeting scheduled for August 27. KRMB officials said that in the board meeting held on June 6, 2018, it was agreed that both Telangana and AP would share the budget estimation approved by the KRMB in equal proportions (50:50) from the financial year 2018-2019. “Even after repeated correspondence with both the states, the KRMB did not received requisite funds from the states. While the Telangana has released Rs Rs 3.5 crore against its share Rs Rs 8.37 crore during 2020-2021, the AP government did not deposit the amount for the past two years,” KRMB member secretary DM Raipure said in the agenda points sent to the state governments. He said for the 2021-2022, the board approved Rs Rs 18 crore budget. At the same time, it was decided to create reserve fund of Rs Rs 10 crore. But the amount has not been received. The board has just Rs Rs 2.46 crore in the bank amount to meet its expenditure. The KRMB also pointed that posts of four personal secretaries and one senior accounts officer are lying vacant for a long time, which is causing problems in functioning. “Since the KRMB is an autonomous body under the Central Act, people with experience should be appointed as consultants and outsourcing basis. Since the state government remunerations are not lucrative enough to attract suitable candidates, retired employees are not coming forward to work with KRMB. The chairman of KRMB should be authorised to hire experienced people at higher rates of remuneration,” the member secretary said. “The states, which have not been releasing budget amount for regular functioning and reserve fund (to overcome budgetary issues), appear to be reluctant to release Rs Rs 200 crore.,” an official of KRMB said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-flow-of-funds-from-t-ap-krmb-struggles/articleshow/85503363.cms||Koride Mahesh

They claimed that they have been named in the FIR even as they did nothing and were not even near Chawla at the time of the attack. They have also submitted evidence in support of their claims.”The developments, meanwhile, have not affected the UCPMA elections to be held on September 3. The election committee, which has been formed to oversee the polls, on Thursday took charge of the association.

---||Mumbai||Cops register 19 FIRs against Narayan Rane’s Mumbai yatra over Covid violations||MUMBAI: Shiv Sainik Appa Patil’s act of spraying ‘gaumutra’ (cow urine) to purify the late Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray’s Smruti Sthal at Shivaji Park and perform ‘abhishek’ with milk after union minister Narayan Rane had paid respects at the spot on Thursday drew sharp reactions from Rane and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis. Also, between Thursday and Friday, the Mumbai police registered 19 FIRs in connection with Rane’s Jan Aashirwad Yatra against the organisers and BJP workers for violation of Covid guidelines. Speaking to mediapersons in Nagpur, Fadnavis said the Sainik’s act of cleansing the spot was “of a very narrow-minded mentality. This is Talibani thinking. The Sainiks who have done this (purification) have not understood the Shiv Sena.” He added that Sainiks could tolerate the Sena as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi, sharing power with parties that had sought to send the late Sena chief to jail for his allegedly inflammatory editorials. “You can sit with such people, but when an old Sainik goes to pay his respects, you feel the place has become unholy. This is wrong,” he said. Friday was the second day of Rane’s yatra. “I decide before whom I shall bow. I visited other memorials too as part of my dialogue with the people. The memorial (Thackeray) is surrounded by mud. If Sena workers are keen on sanitising it, they should first ensure it is kept in better condition. It should be on a par with an international-standard memorial, but its condition is the same as that of the rest of Mumbai under the 32-year-old rule of the Sena. It is time to get rid of the Sena,” he said. Rane attacked CM Uddhav Thackeray for attending a virtual meeting called by Sonia Gandhi. Terming Thackeray as “helpless,” Rane said the late Balasaheb would never have compromised on Hindutva. Of the 19 FIRs registered by the police in connection with the yatra, the maximum are at Mahim and Agripada police stations (three cases each), followed by Sion and Govandi police stations (two each). Azad Maidan, Gamdevi, Kalachowky, Shivaji Park, Dadar, Chembur, Vile Parle, Kherwadi and airport police stations have registered a single case each. The provisions applied include Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, Section 51 of National Disaster Management Act and Section 135 of the Maharashtra Police Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-register-19-firs-against-ranes-mumbai-yatra-over-covid-violations/articleshow/85500823.cms||---

The company, however, did not specify any reason for calling off the deal. On August 12, Aurobindo Pharma had informed the bourses that it has entered into binding agreements with Cronus Pharma for subscribing to 95,059,963 equity shares of Rs 10/- each at a premium of Rs 34.18 per equity share and that the deal was expected to be concluded within eight weeks. The acquisition of the international veterinary pharmaceutical formulations player was aimed at providing Aurobindo Pharma a foothold in the US$48 billion global animal health market and was being seen by the Hyderabad-based generics major as complementing its product offerings in the regulated markets. Cronus, which was set up in 2015 and is engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of generic veterinary pharmaceutical products and CRO services, has a pipeline of 67 products, of which 22 have been filed and 6 have been approved by the Centre for Veterinary Medicine, USFDA. Cronus Pharma had set up a dedicated non-sterile and sterile manufacturing facility focused on veterinary pharmaceutical products for regulated markets. The facility, spread over 10 acres in an SEZ with dedicated manufacturing blocks for various dosage forms, was awaiting regulatory inspections and was to commence commercial production upon regulatory approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/aurobindo-calls-off-rs-420-crore-deal-to-acquire-51-stake-in-cronus-pharma/articleshow/85498465.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: New coal-fired locomotive to kindle Nilgiri rail nostalgia||UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) is all set to get an indigenous coal-fired locomotive soon. The locomotive is at Golden Rock Railway Workshop in Trichy, from where it would be rolled out on August 25. With this, NMR will have two coal-fired meter gauge engines, including the centuryold Swiss X-class loco, which is still in running condition but has not been used for more than a decade. The railway board had earlier sanctioned Rs 9 crore to the workshop for creating the new coal-fired loco. Shyamadhar Ram, chief workshop manager, said, “This is an X-class steam loco with rack and pinion system, made exclusively for NMR track. This is the first such meter gauge coal-fired loco being manufactured here.” More than 50 technicians were involved in making the steam loco and many of its parts were locally sourced. Most of its key components were developed through reverse engineering as drawings of the old coal-fired locos weren’t available, the official said. Weighing about 50 tonnes, the locomotive was run for 100m in the workshop with rack bar arrangements as a trial. “Now, polyurethane painting work for the loco is underway. The engine will maintain the heritage look with the symbolic ‘NMR blue’ colour. It will be taken to Mettupalayam on August 25,” Ram said. A Guatam Srinivas, Salem divisional railway manager, said the new loco would be operated between Ooty and Coonoor. “Trial runs will be conducted after the loco arrives at Mettupalayam. Only after that, it will be operated on the NMR section.” K Natarajan, managing trustee, Heritage Steam Chariot Trust, said the indigenous coal-fired loco was a great achievement and NMR lovers were happy about the same. Golden Rock Railway Workshop had manufactured four indigenous oil-fired locomotives for NMR a decade ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/new-coal-fired-loco-to-kindle-nilgiri-rail-nostalgia/articleshow/85500826.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: For DGP pick, UPSC wants list of those 30 years in IPS||MUMBAI: The appointment of a regular Director General of Police may be delayed since the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) has asked for the list of all police officers who have completed 30 years in the Indian Police Service. Initially, it was presumed that officers in the rank of DG would be considered for appointment as DGP. However, now all the IPS officers who have completed 30 years in service will be considered for the top post.  The state DGP’s post has been lying vacant since January 7, after Subodh Kumar Jaiswal took up Central deputation, initially as director general, Central Industrial Security Force and subsequently as director of the Central Bureau of Investigation or CBI. Currently, Sanjay Pande, the seniormost IPS officer from the 1986 batch, is holding additional charge. After Jaiswal took up Central deputation, the charge was initially given to Hemant Nagrale, but following his appointment as Mumbai CP, the charge was given to ACB director deneral Rajneeth Seth. From April 10, Pandey has been holding additional charge as DGP. As per the procedure laid down by the Supreme Court, the state home department did submit a list of all eligible IPS officers, but twice it was sent back as more information was sought on certain IPS officers. Recently, the UPSC asked the state government to submit the entire list of officers who have completed 30 years in the IPS. “A week ago, we have submitted the list of 20 officers from the 1986 to 1991 batch. They have completed 30 years in the IPS,” a senior official told TOI. The official said that the entire list of officers will be placed before a high-level committee headed by the UPSC chairman. The committee includes state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. It shortlists three names, and the final decision is taken by the state government. “We expect to complete the exercise by the end of August, so that a regular DGP will be appointed in the first week of September,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-for-dgp-pick-upsc-wants-list-of-those-30-yrs-in-ips/articleshow/85500849.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Talks fail, no Bangladesh flights now||KOLKATA: The Biman Bangladesh flights that were to resume on Sunday have been called off as an agreement on the resumption of flights could not be reached between the aviation authorities. The announcement led to a gloom across the city’s hospitality sector and private hospitals that were getting ready to welcome back patients from Bangladesh, who accounted for around 8%-10% of footfalls till the pandemic. “We had scheduled the resumption of flights from Sunday with the other two weekly services on Tuesday and Thursday. But we have not received permission from Indian authorities. Once an agreement is signed, we will announce the new dates,” a Biman Bangladesh official told TOI. This will mean that SpiceJet and IndiGo flights that were also scheduled to resume will now be cancelled. While SpiceJet was supposed to start services on August 26, IndiGo was to start flights the next day. The flights between the two countries were suspended in April during the height of the second wave. The news of the flight cancellation has dampened the spirit in the New Market-Sudder Street-Marquis Street-Free School Street-Park Street belt as well as hospitals in the city where Bangladeshis are a key clientele. Bangladeshis account for over 50% sales at New Market, 70% business in hotels, guest houses and foreign currency exchanges on Sudder Street, Marquis Street, Free School Street, Royd Street and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and 80% of the transport business in the area. “We are disappointed since 20 online appointments had been issued to Bangladeshi patients who were to take the first few flights. Enquiries had been pouring in and we expected the number to proliferate with flights getting regular. But this is a setback for both Bangladeshi patients and us. They may now look for treatment in south-east Asian countries,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Till the pandemic, 15% of Peerless’ patients would be from Bangladesh. They contributed 8%-10% of the hospital’s annual revenue. AMRI Hospitals that had received 3,000 Bangladeshi patients a month across its three units before the pandemic already processed 300-400 visa invitation forms for Bangladesh patients who were scheduled to visit next week. Most of them have emergency surgeries or treatment lined up, according to AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. “They mostly visit for complicated neuro and gastric surgeries that can’t wait. So, we will end up losing these patients,” said Barua. More than 35 Bangladesh patients were listed for surgeries and consultations at CMRI Hospital over the next few weeks, according to COO Simmardeep Gill. Ruby Hospital, too, was left disappointed by the flight cancellation. “We were looking forward to welcoming them back since they generate a fair share of our revenue. We had issued 11 visa invitation forms to Bangladeshi citizens over the last one week. Most of them are cancer and haemotology patients who were planning to visit our hospital for long-term treatment. They can’t defer their treatment and will settle for other countries, which is unfortunate,” said Ruby Hospital general manager – operations Subhashish Datta. The return of patients is also crucial for tourism and business in Kolkata, said Travel Agents’ Federation of India chairman (East) Anil Punjabi. “They invariably visit with families and do a lot of shopping that help the places like New Market and the shopping centres around it in central Kolkata. Their return would have helped the local economy,” Punjabi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/talks-fail-no-bangladesh-flights-now/articleshow/85498492.cms||Subhro Niyogi

At least five suspected H1N1 cases have been reported here in the past few days. Experts say there were no swine flu cases last year. The health department officials said, “The woman, a resident of an area opposite Lakshmi Cinema, was admitted to a private hospital after she showed symptoms of swine flu. She died during treatment. Her daughter, son-in-law and grandson, who lived with her, don’t have the symptoms.”Dr Ramanpreet Kaur of Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) said, “Samples of contacts are not collected if they do not show symptoms and they are put on prophylactic treatment for 10 days, which includes administration of Tamiflu or antiviral drugs.”On whether the infection source of the woman is known, Dr Ramanpreet said, “A health team is conducting a survey in the area. Till now, it has not found any suspected case with flu-like symptoms, like high-grade fever. There are less than 300 houses in the area which are being covered. The deceased had no travel history.”Assistant civil surgeon Dr Vivek Kataria said they are creating awareness about the symptoms of swine flu and asking residents to visit the nearest health centre if they experience any. “We request people to follow Covid rules, as these help in preventing swine flu as well,” he added. Dr Rajesh Mahajan, a senior doctor at a private hospital, said, “There is a suspected swine flu case in the hospital. The patient belongs to Jammu and his throat swab test report is awaited. The previous year, there were no swine flu cases. Residents should not ignore the symptoms during the flu season.”Another specialist at a private hospital, too, confirmed that they are getting swine flu suspected cases.“We have four suspected swine flu cases. Patients are coming with viral pneumonia and they are Covid negative. This is another sort of viral infection, likely swine flu or influenza. We have sent for testing the samples of the four suspected patients,” said Dr Gurpreet Singh, senior consultant and head of department of pulmonary and critical care at a city hospital. He added that there are three types of swine flu, which is a communicable disease: Type A, which is self-limiting disease and patients recovers in four to five days with symptomatic treatment; Type B in which patient does have breathing problem and may need anti-viral drugs and symptomatic treatment; and Type C in which mortality rate is high and patient has severe breathlessness, hypoxia (low oxygen in the body) and may need ICU admission and ventilator support as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/amid-covid-3rd-wave-fear-swine-flu-poses-challenge/articleshow/85496105.cms||Shariq Majeed

The girl’s lungs were transplanted into a 70-year-old patient admitted to a hospital in Hyderabad for lung failure. Her liver and both kidneys gave a new lease of life to three other patients in Pune. This is the 21st case of multi-organ donation in Pune so far this year. “This is the second organ donation from a minor brain-dead donor this year. Last month, the parents of a 14-year-old boy, who suffered grievous head injuries in a road accident, had donated his organs. Families are rising over their grief and donating organs for the needy,” said Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator, Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), Pune branch. The girl, a resident of Pimpri, was studying in Std XII (Commerce). “She was very social, jovial and wanted to make it big in life. She had secured 80% marks in Std X,” a family friend said. The girl was diagnosed with intracranial bleeding with an aneurysm caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. “She could not be revived and was declared brain dead on August 18. The family gave their consent, when counselled for organ donation. Later, the ZTCC allocated the organs as per norms,” Barge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/girls-organs-benefit-patients-in-pune-and-hyderabad/articleshow/85498477.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Raksha Bandhan could see festive travel resume Sunday||MUMBAI: The weekend will see a range of colourful festivals with the Malayalee feast of Onam falling on Saturday, and Raksha Bandhan and Narali Purnima Sunday. The lockdown relaxation with shops reopening has meant people can at least make proper purchases for home celebration given that community gatherings are prohibited. Matunga resident KA Viswanathan said, “Malayalees all over the country and abroad celebrate Onam, which marks the annual homecoming of the mythical benevolent King Mahabali, by wearing new clothes and arranging feasts at home. After a gap of two years, the well known Mani’s Lunch Home at Chembur and Matunga will organise an Onam feast called Thiruvona sadhya. But this year there will not be sit-down lunch in plantain leaves, only takeaway parcels.” Mani’s new owner Rajamani will serve 22 items including two types of payasam (kheer) called Palada Pradhaman (made from milk) and Paruppu Pradhaman (jaggery and dal). Several home cooks have also been despatching the festive menu to their clients as a fallout of the homebound celebration. Raksha Bandhan visits may resume this year as local trains have reopened to the fully vaccinated. “My brother lives in Dadar and I plan to take the train from Borivli. I have taken both doses but my young children have taken just one, so I am not sure if they should join me amid the festive crowd or stay home,” said Sejal Mane, who lives in Borivli (east). Sunday also marks the Upakarma when many Brahmins change the sacred thread and perform rituals for departed souls on Shravana Purnima day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raksha-bandhan-could-see-festive-travel-resume-sunday/articleshow/85503395.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

With this, the police have recovered 13 of the 28 vehicles “taken on rent” by the suspects and never returned. The recovered vehicles were mostly four-wheelers, including light commercial vehicles., The three men — including a criminal from Daund — were taken into custody on Sunday night. They are charged with cheating 22 people of 28 vehicles worth Rs2.55 crore between March 15 and July 27. “The three men — Rafiuddin “Malik” Gilani (35), Omkar Wasane (25) and car dealer Mujeeb Shaikh (32) had hatched the plan,” senior inspector Ganesh Mane from the crime branch (Unit VI) said. “During questioning, the suspects revealed where the vehicles were sold. A police team visited Ahmedpur in north Latur and Nizamabad in Telangana and recovered 13 vehicles,” he added. “We are in the process of verifying the car rental agreements, conducting technical investigations and questioning the suspects to identity more places where the other vehicles were sold,” he added. The fraud came to light after Gilani and Wasane failed to pay rent to the vehicles’ owners and refused to return the vehicles. One of the owners, Avinash Kadam (28) from Phursungi, had registered an FIR with the Loni Kalbhor police on August 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-seize-11-more-vehicles-in-fraud-case/articleshow/85498549.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cinema owners see glimmer of hope in high turnout for new Bengali releases||KOLKATA: Braving the drizzle, more than a hundred youngsters stood outside the gates of the Nandan complex on Friday afternoon. They had all come to watch the first show of an oven-fresh Bengali movie. By the time Atanu Ghosh’s ‘Binisutoy’, starring Jaya Ahsan and Ritwik Chakraborty, ended at 4.40pm, the man at the Nandan ticket counter was smiling. According to Ghosh, 293 viewers watched his film that has only one show at Nandan. ‘Mukhosh’ had 443 viewers at Nandan on Friday evening. Such figures are a welcome break from the perception that Bengali movies can’t draw enough crowd and hence don’t encourage exhibitors to reopen without new Bollywood releases. Among Nandan’s viewers was Angana Chatterjee. She believes that supporting Bengali cinema can’t only be about social media discussions. “One has to pay a price to support it. I love the cast and the director and decided to watch ‘Binisutoy’ in a theatre and not wait for it to release on OTT. Nandan’s excellent projection made the viewing experience memorable. There were many in the auditorium,” she said. ‘Mukhosh’, starring Anirban Bhattacharya, Anirban Chakrabarti, Chandreyee Ghosh, Kaushik Sen and Payel De was released in 29 theatres across Kolkata. This Birsa Dasgupta film had 92 viewers on Thursday and 73 viewers on Friday at Navina. “I’m glad that I reopened the hall. The turnout for ‘Mukhosh’ is encouraging,” said Navina’s owner Navin Choukhani. According to him, good Bengali films will always sell better than Hindi films. “Anirban Bhattacharya has a tremendous fan-following among the college-goers. During the lockdown, we were running shows even with single digit audience. This time, we are almost touching three digits in almost every show,” he added. Sucheta Dey, who went for the evening show at Navina, enjoys watching Bengali movies in cinemas and not downloaded content. “I like Anirban’s acting and have watched his earlier movies in theatres too,” she said. For the first time in two years, the owner of Bijoli and Chhabighar, Suranjan Paul, is seeing Bengali and Hindi films draw equal response. “The response to Bengali films at Nandan, Navina and my cinemas is encouraging. The numbers will improve if people attached to Tollywood develop the habit of watching Bengali films on single screens,” Paul said. Exhibitor-distributor Satadeep Saha, who released Akshay Kumar’s ‘Bell Bottom’ in 130 theatres of Bengal, said that after two years, this release has prompted fan club members to watch cinema together. “They even garlanded the poster at Menoka,” Saha said. Prachi’s owner Vidisha Basu is happy to have reopened her theatre on Thursday. “The sales figures of Friday are better than Thursday’s,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cinema-owners-see-glimmer-of-hope-in-high-turnout-for-new-bengali-releases/articleshow/85498526.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

All imports from Afghanistan have been stopped due to which the dry fruits business in India has taken a hit, also affecting Rajasthan. According to the wholesalers in the city, there has been a 25% to 35% hike in price of various types of dry fruits in the market. Talking to TOI, Amit Kamdara, dry fruit wholesaler in the city said, “The prices are rising day by day and this is not going to stop anytime soon. Imports have suddenly stopped resulting in price hike. The shipping companies or trucks from Wagah Border are not arriving.” From the wide range of available dry fruits, India imports dried raisin, walnut, almond, fig, pine nut, pistachios, dried apricots that are sold 30% high in wholesale and the consumer has to purchase it at 50% hike. With the festive season approaching, people who preferred gifting dry fruits as a hygienic option amidst pandemic instead of sweets, may have to think of an alternate option. Gaurav Modi, another dry fruit wholesaler in Jaipur said, “Either we have to increase our domestic production or import from other countries. Figs, pistachios and raisins arrive from Afghanistan and with the festive season around the corner, it will take a toll on people’s pocket this year.” Demand for raisins and figs especially increased in the pandemic, with people consuming dry fruits as immunity boosters. Many people have wet figs in daytime for better digestion. Moreover, in many Ayurvedic medicines, dry fruits are used.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/afghanistan-crisis-makes-dry-fruits-dearer-as-imports-hit/articleshow/85500877.cms||---

He said the Congress made sacrifices for independence and to safeguard the integrity of the country, referring to the assassination of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Gehlot was speaking at a programme held to commemorate the 77th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. A function was also organised at the party office where PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, former president Sachin Pilot released a short film on Rajiv Gandhi. Gehlot said unlike Pakistan, India did not fall under military rule. In a democracy, criticism is welcomed, but these people cannot tolerate it and consider it sedition, he said targeting the Centre. “Our leaders made sacrifices and went to jail and it was because of their sacrifices and struggle that the country got independence,” he said. “The new generation will have to understand this, and they will understand when they study history, be it of preindependence or post-independence era. He said it is easy to distort history but creating history is difficult. Those who learn from history are able to make history,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congs-contribution-is-nurturing-democracy-gehlot/articleshow/85500913.cms||---

Accusing the TRS government of doing little for development of Warangal, he said that the town has not reached its potential as a tourism hub only because of state’s non-cooperation with the Centre. He said that while the Centre wanted to develop Mamnoor airport, state had failed to provide land for renovation and runway extension. “If the airport is developed, the town would not only see more tourists from India but also from abroad,” he said. Kishan claimed that even the UNESCO world heritage tag for Ramappa temple was all because of the efforts of Union government. He said that while initially many member countries were against selecting Ramappa temple, they changed their stand after intervention of the central government. Earlier, Kishan offered prayers at the historic Bhadrakali temple and the Thousand Pillar Temple. He said that that ‘natyamandapam’ at the historic Thousand Pillar Temple would be reconstructed soon. He blamed the delay on lack of cooperation between the state government and ASI. He said that Warangal was selected in the Smart City list by the Centre with the intention of developing all historical monuments and turning it into a tourist hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-govt-not-cooperating-with-centre-kishan/articleshow/85500945.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

The eco-friendly gym equipment which has been brought to the beach, also called Mahim Retibunder, is still to be assembled, officials said, adding that the work should be completed by next week after which an inauguration will be held. Assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G North ward, Kiran Dighavkar, said that the gym equipment have been selected in a manner that it is requires little maintenance. “Everything’s almost ready. Once the gym equipment is placed, we can throw the beach open to the public. It’s been delayed due to continuous showers over the past few days,” he said. One highlight of the project is a watch tower that gives visitors an aerial view of Bandra-Worli sea link. Locals said facilities should be such that people are encouraged to visit the beach regularly which would also help keep encroachers at bay . A resident who visited the place said that the BMC has currently taken over a small area for the revamp, but added that it’s a good start. Mahim resident Irfan Macchiwala said, “Mahim Retibuner is a large area which was earlier encroached upon. Though a small portion near Mahim Fort has been cleared and revamped, it’s a good start as BMC is already working on a project to connect Bandra and Mahim forts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-opening-of-watch-tower-that-overlooks-sea-link-at-mahim-beach-delayed-by-rain/articleshow/85500938.cms||Richa Pinto

The arrest was made on Thursday in Kothabukar hillock under Chouparan police station limits after the cops received a tip about his whereabouts. The rebel was identified as Pradyuman Sharma (49). He was the outfit’s eastern regional bureau member and a member of the Magadh zone of the Maoists’ Bihar Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC). A graduate in philosophy who hailed from Rustampur village in Jehanabad district of Bihar, Sharma joined the outlawed outfit in 1996 and went by aliases such as Saket, Lulah and Kundan. Hazaribag SP Manoj Ranjan Chouthey, while terming Sharma’s arrest as a prized catch, said, “He was a part of the think tank of the outlawed outfit and was the brain behind extorting huge amounts of money from under construction railway projects and civil projects under the public works department in the area.” As soon as the cops got to know that Sharma has arrived in the forests of Chouparan on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, a team was put together at the command of ASP (operation) Nigam Prasad and Ajit Kumar, who is the deputy commandant of the 22nd battalion of CRPF. The two officers made their way into the forests with their teams on Thursday night and found two men talking at the hillock. As soon the cops steeped closer towards the duo, latter saw them and one of the men escaped while the other was nabbed, who was later identified as Sharma. “Sharma’s identity was confirmed by his disfigured hand, which he had sustained in an IED blast,” Chouthey said. Sharma, during his interrogation, said that he was mostly active in the Magadh zone of Bihar and Jharkhand since he joined the Maoists. Being a BJSAC member, Sharma was also responsible for strengthening the Maoist organization in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoist-carrying-rs-rs-25l-bounty-held-in-forested-area-of-hbag/articleshow/85499409.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We all should raise this demand. The relatives of the deceased should be compensated,” Soren appealed to an online gathering of national opposition leaders, among whom were Congress national president Sonia Gandhi, former PM Manmohan Singh, CM’s of Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, Mamata Banerjee, Uddhav Thackeray and MK Stalin. The meeting was also attended by CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

He also said, “The Union government is gagging democracy and misleading the country’s people. The MPs are not being heard in Parliament, which is a glaring example of gagging of the democracy. The opposition unity should become stronger and meetings such as these should be held often. There are various issues on which the Centre can be cornered and BJP has taken several decisions which are not in the interest of the people of the country and globally,” he said.

Mohan Paints, the Lucknow-based company, had filed a case in this regard and the police have completed their investigation. The four accused are yet to be arrested. The mastermind of the four accused is reportedly one employee identified as Vimlesh Pathak, who has been working for several years as in charge of the company’s depot in Adityapur. According to reports, Pathak recruited three other employees — Jitendra Jha, Sarvesh Kumar and Ved Pandey — for the depot. As part of their plan to dupe the paint company, Pathak floated a dubious firm, JP Enterprises, in partnership with Jha in 2017. The firm then started procuring goods from the paint company. Sources said the company grew suspicious after JP Enterprises’s outstanding payment for the purchases amounted to Rs 56 lakh and upon inquiries, it was found that the firm was jointly owned by Pathak and Jha. An official of Mohan Paints said, “The GST registration of JP Enterprises has confirmed that it is owned by Pathak and Jha. We had approached the court of the chief judicial magistrate in Seraikela Kharsawan in 2020, seeking to file an FIR against the four employees.” The court then directed Adityapur police to file a case against the four under sections 406, 420, 323, 408, 341, 506, 379, 467, 120(B) and 34 of the IPC. Adityapur police station officer-in-charge Rajendra Prasad said, “Our investigation is over and a chargesheet will be filed shortly.” He added that none of the accused has been arrested so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/four-staff-dupe-paint-company-of-rs-rs-56-lakh/articleshow/85499463.cms||B Sridhar

Education secretary Rajesh Sharma said the department is thinking of holding two term-end examinations for all the classes on the lines of the CBSE. The first one will be multiple choice questions in November. He said, “In case we fail to hold the year-end examination in February-March due to Covid, the marks would be assigned on the basis of the term-I (November) examination. Like in CBSE, the syllabus of term-I examination and the year-end examinations would be separate.” Sharma said the administration is hoping that Covid will not be at its peak during both the examination and at least one of them would be held. He added that the letter in this regard will be issued shortly. Moreover, the syllabus will be curtailed by 25 per cent this year as almost one-third of the academic session has been disrupted due to Covid. It may be stated here that schools have remained closed till class 8 while offline classes for class IX to XII started early this month. Sources said the State Council for Educational Research and Training would be working on the amended syllabus, adding tht committees have already been formed in this regard. The subjects, which were taught to students in earlier classes, would be removed. In addition, topics, which are not very important, could also be curtailed. For instance, for English, grammar would be retained but a few stories may be dropped.

BIT Sindri Teachers’ Association (BITSTA) secretary Professor Amar Prakash Sinha said: “Some people managing the affairs of the institute are conspiring to deprive the poor tribal students of receiving engineering education at an affordable cost just to fulfill their own interests. They want to change the very character of this lone government engineering college in the state.” “After getting the autonomous status, the institute administration would be free to change the fee structure of the institute which is known for imparting engineering education at a low cost all over the nation,” he added. Sinha claimed that the institute’s director circulated a notice on August 10 which stated that a team of senior faculty members of IIT Kanpur would visit the institute on August 13 and all heads were invited to attend the meeting with the vision plan of their respective departments. “The notice did not mention that the departmental secretary and director (technical education) would also attend the meeting. We came to know from newspapers the next day that the meeting was convened to decide modalities of granting autonomy to the institute,” he added. Sinha claimed that Bihar has opened 34 new government engineering colleges after the formation of Jharkhand. “On the contrary, BIT Sindri is the only government engineering college of Jharkhand but certain officials are trying to privatize it in the name of autonomy by keeping the teachers, staff and students in the dark,” he alleged. The association has also sought the intervention of the chief minister in this matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bit-sindri-teachers-oppose-autonomous-tag-say-move-will-deprive-poor-students/articleshow/85497689.cms||Anil Ashutosh

We urge people from all walks of life, who have been affected by this government’s misgovernance, to join us,” he added. Prakash also announced that the BJP will knock the doors of the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax department and seek a probe into the recent government decision to hand over the stocking and distribution of India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) to a consortium of businessmen from the state-run Jharkhand State Beverage Corporation Limited (JSBCL). “We are aware that a lot of shady deals have taken place before and after the decision was made,” Prakash claimed. Unfazed by JMM’s criticisms, Prakash sided with Marandi’s press advisor Sunil Tiwari. “The case against Tiwari is fake. There is also a case against incumbent chief minister Hemant Soren. The investigation of both the cases should be handed over to the CBI or to a sitting judge of the high court,” Prakash said. Earlier in the day, Prakash and Marandi met Governor Ramesh Bais and sought his intervention in the matter. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Marandi responded to JMM’s allegations. “I have been overseas a few times. If the state government smells something fishy, then they can initiate an investigation,” he told journalists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-to-form-human-chains-to-protest-against-govt-atrocities/articleshow/85499127.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Talking to TOI on Friday, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “As the movement of passengers from these states to Jharkhand is taking place daily, we are exploring the possibility of making negative RT-PCR test mandatory for such passengers. A decision in this regard will be taken soon.” Singh has also written to senior officials of Dhanbad and Ranchi railway divisions and to the DCs of eight districts through which trains that originate in the three states pass. “Once we get the details, passengers arriving in those trains will be tested,” Singh said. According to Singh’s letter, the DCs have been directed to make sure that the samples of such passengers are collected and their details are submitted to the state IDSP unit daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/travellers-may-need-to-show-rt-pcr-ve-cert-to-enter-state/articleshow/85499221.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Goa||After acting on dhirios, Colva PI transferred||Margao: Less than a week after Colva police booked two separate cases against four persons for organising dhirios at various places in its jurisdiction, in-charge of Colva police station PI Anand Shirodkar was shunted out of his current posting on Friday. Prabhudessai is among 17 police inspectors who have been transferred as per an order issued from the Goa police headquarters. Though the state police administration has termed the transfers as a routine administrative move, the transfer of the PI, hardly six months after he was posted at Colva, is being seen among the police constabulary as a fallout of the police action against the dhirios that had been overtly supported by a politician. At an informal farewell function organised at the Colva police station Friday evening, South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh, lauded the outgoing PI Shirodkar for his superlative efforts in leading his team in controlling the crime situation in his jurisdiction during his short stint at the Colva police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-acting-on-dhirios-colva-pi-transferred/articleshow/85500990.cms||---

The agency has also sought details of cases from West Bengal director general of police Virendra. Each team of seven members will be headed by joint director-level officers and include officers of deputy inspector-general and superintendent ranks. According to sources, additional director Ajay Bhatnagar is likely to monitor the investigation's progress. Sources said so far around 25 officers had been earmarked from Delhi, Lucknow, Chennai and from other states, and they would be divided into four teams. On Friday, the CBI wrote to the DGP seeking details of the cases. "The court has clearly demarcated the cases that CBI and SIT will investigate. We have asked the state government to provide us with details of the cases. FIR will be lodged following that," a CBI official said. The HC's five-member division bench had on Thursday handed over to the CBI the investigation of murder, rape and atrocities against women allegedly committed during post-poll violence. In his observations, Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal said that in a number of cases, FIR was registered after the NHRC-led committee flagged off the incidents. There are FIRs registered against political workers and supporters of a party not in power. According to CBI sources, the teams started work immediately after the probe was handed over. After they receive documents from the state government, the teams will head for Bengal where they will conduct an extensive investigation into the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/west-bengal-violence-cbi-sets-up-4-teams-seeks-information-from-dgp/articleshow/85504840.cms||Rohit Khanna

Kandolkar and GFP president Vijai Sardesai spent Thursday in Aldona meeting local stakeholders and grassroots workers before making the announcement. Meanwhile, Kandolkar’s wife Kavita, who is the Colvale zilla panchayat member, will contest from the Tivim constituency on a GFP ticket. “We have started work to build the party in Aldona constituency under the leadership of Kandolkar. His workers are confident of winning this constituency,” GFP president Vijai Sardesai said. Kandolkar won the Tivim constituency in 2012 as a BJP ML,A but lost out in 2017 to sitting MLA Nilkant Halarnkar. Halarnkar switched over from Congress to BJP in 2019 after which Kandolkar and his wife quit BJP. “The party workers have unanimously decided that Tivim constituency will elect a woman for the first time. Kavita, who won the zilla panchayat election from there is the right candidate,” Sardesai said. GFP has already announced Deepak Kalangutkar as its candidate for Mandrem constituency and is all set to announce Jagdish Bhobe as the candidate for the St Andre constituency. “For now, we have 12 candidates in mind. I am travelling to all constituencies to begin our campaign and build the party,” Sardesai said. GFP, which is pushing for an alliance with Congress for the upcoming state assembly polls, is simultaneously making inroads into the constituencies that were represented by Congress. Mandrem, St Andre and Tivim were represented by Congress till the sitting MLAs switched over to BJP. Kandolkar, during a visit to Mayem, announced that Santosh Kumar Sawant will be GFP’s Mayem candidate for the elections.

Stating that development projects were crucial to ensure progress of Dharbandora which has remained relatively backward, Sawant urged the people to cooperate with the government in setting up new projects in the state’s newly carved taluka. “The government is keen on bringing in various projects at Dharbandora on lands owned by the government which will lead to development of the area. People should welcome these projects. The government is considering bringing in an educational project here. An IIT campus, a forensic institute, or national school of law – anyone of these projects is likely to be set up in Dharbandora,” Sawant said while speaking at a public function at Dharbandora as part of his Sanvordem constituency tour. Addressing a gathering later at Sanvordem, Sawant held leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat squarely responsible for the current mining crisis. “Had the 88 mining leases not been renewed in time during Digambar Kamat’s tenure as chief minister, this situation arising out of the cancellation of those mining leases wouldn’t have arisen. And now they are blaming me for the mining problem,” Sawant said. He also blamed Kamat, alongwith then IT minister Dayanand Narvekar, for poor telecom infrastructure in the state leading to the current poor internet connectivity. Further, he said that he suspected a scam in the “flawed” telecom policy of 2009 signed during their tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-promises-iit-forensic-or-law-school-for-dharbandora/articleshow/85501219.cms||---

He had accused the portal of dishonesty and deficiency in service, claiming it had failed to find a prospective match for him after collecting Rs 59,180 as non-refundable enrolment fee. The complainant, who is a resident of Malleswaram, had registered with Elite Matrimony Services on June 17, 2019 in an attempt to find a prospective match. He had paid Rs 59,180 through a cheque and was waiting for the profiles of prospective brides. The aspiring bridegroom claimed the portal, which had advertised to have over one lakh matches for its subscribers, failed to send him profiles despite him being a member for nearly four months. He said when he approached Elite Matrimony's office with a complaint on the matter, he was treated rudely by a woman staffer. The man approached the Bengaluru Rural and Urban 1st additional district consumer disputes redressal forum in Shantinagar with a complaint against Elite Matrimony Services on October 24, 2019 and sought a refund of his deposit and compensation of Rs 3 lakh for dishonest and deficient service. The complainant presented his case on his own while the portal's attorney claimed the complaint was frivolous, vexatious and with ulterior motives. Counsel for Elite Matrimony Services stated that the man had opted for the package and was provided profiles of 14 prospective brides, of which he picked two. He further said the agency was not responsible if the match didn't materialise as it was their job only to facilitate the matter. Dismissing the complaint on July 23, 2021, the judges observed an online matchmaking portal can't assure positive response at all times and does not guarantee a marriage within the service provided. Moreover, the complainant has not denied the claim that two out of 14 profiles of prospective brides sent by the opposite party were accepted by him, they pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/matrimonial-site-cant-guarantee-marriage-says-bengaluru-consumer-court/articleshow/85504879.cms||Petlee Peter

Goa police have informed the Russian embassy about both the deaths, and the bodies have been preserved at Goa Medical College, Bambolim. Police said, while one woman died by suicide, the other's body was found lying on the bed. PI Suraj Gawas on Thursday said that they received information from the Siolim public health centre that one Alexandra Ri Djavi, 24, was brought dead in an ambulance. Upon enquiry, it was revealed that the deceased lived in a rented room with her boyfriend at Gublawaddo-Oxel, Siolim. Gawas said that the deceased was "mentally-disturbed" and under medication. "In the absence of her boyfriend, she died by suicide by hanging herself to a ceiling fan hook in the kitchen with a red sari," he said. In another incident on Thursday, Gawas said they received a phone call from EMRI 108 informing them that a woman was found dead in her rented room at Oxel. "At the spot, we found Ekaterina Titova, 34, lying on the bed inside her bedroom. The deceased lived in the rented room with another foreigner, also a Russian," he said. Gawas said that upon verification, no external injuries were found on the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-russian-women-found-dead-goa-cops-say-no-foul-play/articleshow/85504900.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Ahead of polls, BJP MLAs in touch with grassroots workers’||Margao: BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade on Friday said that people of the state were largely supportive of the BJP government in the state, notwithstanding the Opposition’s attempts to malign the government ahead of the elections. Further, he exuded confidence of the party coming back to office on its own strength. Addressing reporters at Curchorem while on a day-long tour of the constituency, Tanavade said, “Maligning BJP may be their (Opposition) agenda. Despite the prevalent wide-spread support for BJP, which I have noticed during my ongoing constituency tours, (the Opposition) is trying hard to tell people how the government is bad. (On the other hand) BJP workers are working hard towards strengthening the party. The environment is conducive for BJP.” Hitting out at Opposition parties for their criticism against the government, Tanavade said that BJP enjoyed the “wholehearted support” of the people. Stating that all BJP workers as well as its MLAs were out on the ground meeting people and trying to gain their trust, ahead of the elections, Tanavade wondered what has stopped the Opposition from doing likewise. “Once elections are announced, they will cry foul and say they were fooled,” he said. In reply to a query, Tanavade said that BJP enjoys the support of both the rural and urban electorate as, he said, was seen in the zilla panchayat and municipal elections. “For the zilla panchayat elections, we won 19 of the 25 seats in North Goa - where we had never won more than 15 seats in the past – and in South Goa we won 14 of the 18 seats we contested – where we had never earlier crossed the single digit mark. This was despite the Melauli (anti-IIT protest) issue in North Goa. In Chandor, which was the hub of anti-double-tracking and anti-coal protest, we won the seat from there too. BJP also swept the municipality poll. This shows that both the rural and urban voters stand by us,” Tanavade said. Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral was also present at the press briefing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ahead-of-polls-bjp-mlas-in-touch-with-grassroots-workers/articleshow/85501327.cms||---

Around 200 villagers from the areas Madhalawada, Surla, Bolkornem, Butter and part of Dharge will benefit from the commissioning of the plant. Presently, the areas get around 500CuM (0.5 MLD) water from Panshe Jack well and Satpal sand filter after the chlorine dosing process. Public works department assistant engineer at Collem Devidas Borkar said the Sacorda plant has been designed estimating the water needs of locals 30 years later. Apart from the WTP at Sacorda, a 300CuM capacity master balancing reservoir (MBR) will be constructed for storage of treated water. The plant will have a 6.5 km long ductile iron (DI) pipeline network with a 3km-long PVC distribution line. The raw water will be sourced from Ragada river, he said. “The entire project costs around Rs 3.8 crore and the work has been allotted to Naar Infra Pvt Ltd Hyderabad. The work will start soon after the monsoon season,” Borkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sacorda-area-to-get-treated-water-soon/articleshow/85501410.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Given limited airline capacity during pandemic times, a number of people who bought United tickets were booked on code share flights of European airlines to fly one-stop to the US from there. Since Afghanistan air space was closed to non-defence aircraft on Monday, Air India, Vistara and European carriers are taking a longer route between India and Europe, overflying Iran. However, as per Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, flights by US airlines - including their code share ones - can't overfly Iran, say people in the know. As a result, passengers booked on United and supposed to travel on code share EU carriers overflying Iranian airspace are being told that their confirmed seats no longer had that status or that the flights had been cancelled. A United spokesperson told TOI: "Due to the dynamic nature of the situation we have begun routing affected flights around Afghanistan airspace. We will continue to work closely with the FAA and IATA to evaluate the situation. The routings for our India flights are the only ones impacted." United is trying to book the affected passengers on its nonstops to the US that are taking a route as per FAA rules. Industry sources say an attempt is being made to automatically re-route affected passengers on other flights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/closure-of-afghan-airspace-adds-to-woes-of-us-bound-flyers/articleshow/85504912.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Goa||Rajiv gave Goa statehood, but BJP has made it crony estate, says opposition leader Digambar Kamat||PANAJI: While former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi believed in decentralisation of power and passed on administrative rights to local bodies, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has consolidated decision making powers in the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, Congress said here on Friday. Marking the birth anniversary of Gandhi, opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that BJP has converted Goa into a crony estate for the Centre. “Gandhi believed in decentralisation of power and passed on the administrative rights to local bodies like panchayats and municipalities. His vision was to empower the common man and woman. BJP government has killed every democratic institution to give powers only to the Modi-Shah duo who have centralised everything by demolishing the federal system,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said. Paying tribute to the former prime minister, who was assassinated in May 1991, Kamat said that over the last nine years, the “irresponsible BJP government has converted Goa into a crony estate” and shattered the dreams of Goans. Kamat has urged Goans to vote for Congress and help the party form the government in 2022. “It is sad that BJP, which formed the government in 2012, failed to keep up with a single promise which they had made to the people of Goa. Today, the BJP government destroyed the identity of Goa by bringing in environmentally destructive projects. They sold our mother Mhadei for political gains,” Kamat said. State Congress vice-president M K Shaikh urged party workers to follow the discipline of the party and resolve all issues, differences within the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rajiv-gave-goa-statehood-but-bjp-has-made-it-crony-estate/articleshow/85501678.cms||---

The news about city student Vrishin Vigneshwar landing a Rs 1.17 crore per annum job with a US startup, after a successful internship, has stirred up things. With startups and IT product companies willing to shell out big bucks for students with good coding skills, several campuses recorded a significant rise in marquee offers (above Rs 20 lakh), super dream (Rs 10 lakh-Rs 20 lakh per annum) and dream offers (Rs 6 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per annum) over the previous year. Placement officers at several institutions are thrilled at the high offers so early in the season. Vigneshwar, a fourthyear computer science student from Chennai’s SSN College of Engineering, said he was pleasantly surprised to get a summer internship (done remotely) from Motorq. Of 60-80 students, they shortlisted 6-8 after two rounds. “I was given unknown tasks and we were to learn, figure out the unknown and learn something new. It was a repeated cycle for two months. They assessed our ability to understand the problem, solve them without relying on others and meet deadlines,” he said. Siddharth Singha Roy, a final year computer science student from VIT, received seven offers and accepted a Rs 45 lakh per annum job from Microsoft. “… I believe the interviewers wanted to know how the student approached a problem. I think it set me apart,” he said. Two students from VIT received Rs 75 lakh per annum from DYTE, a startup. V Samuel Rajkumar, director (placement and training) at VIT, said there was a 50% jump in offers compared to the same period previous year. “A total of 166 companies completed campus interviews and offered 1,500 job offers and internships. More than 100 companies offered super dream offers.” Bajaj Finserv, Intel and Nokia offered more than 100 internships, while Societe Generale hired 75 VIT students, highest in the country. S T Jothi Basu, placement head at SSN College of Engineering, said fintech companies, IT product companies and healthcare technologies are showing more interest. “We expect average salaries to increase from Rs 7.5lakh to Rs 9 lakh,” he said. SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST) career centre director N Venkata Sastry attributed the trend to the digital push by IT and IT product companies. “More than 100 companies have visited so far (remote hiring) and more than 1,000 students bagged dream and super dream offers. We internalised competitive coding skills, a driving force to get high-paying jobs, as a credit course,” he said. Srikanth S, head (corporate relations and placement) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in Coimbatore, said the pandemic had impacted campus placements positively. V Badrinath, dean, corporate relations, Sastra University in Thanjavur said the average pay package would show a 10% increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/techies-in-chennai-laugh-their-way-to-the-bank-as-placement-season-begins-with-a-bang/articleshow/85504927.cms||A Ragu Raman

---||Chennai||Covid cases down in Chennai, mask prices up||CHENNAI: Pharmacies in the city have once again started to sell Covid-essential items like face masks and sanitisers at a higher price compared to government-fixed rates. The state health department in June fixed a cap on retail prices of 15 essential medical items used in Covid-19 care. Accordingly, N95 masks and surgical masks can't be sold over Rs 22 and Rs 5 per piece respectively. In the first few weeks, medical stores in the capital city strictly adhered to the new pricing system. But some stores claimed that they ran out of stock and sold only premium brands. Nearly two months down the line as the number of Covid-19 cases has come down, the situation has turned worse. Many retailers don't pay heed to the government order now, according to a status check by TOI at half-a-dozen pharmacies in Adyar, Kotturpuram, Velachery, Adambakkam and Madipakkam on Friday. These standalone drug stores offer masks in two qualities. Customers, who buy masks at government-fixed rates, are provided with items of ordinary quality. Others, who demand better quality, are made to pay double or three times more. On an average, N95 and surgical masks were sold at Rs 40-60 and Rs 7-10 respectively. One medical store in Velachery actually sold N95 masks at Rs 100 per piece. When asked about this, the druggist claimed that the elastic straps in Rs 22 masks could break easily, or threads could loosen soon. Maximum Retail Prices (MRPs) were not printed on wrappers of some masks, but few others had a higher MRP printed on them. Face shields and some brands of hand sanitisers were sold at a 25 % to 60% higher cost. When contacted, a senior official from the Tamil Nadu Drug Control Department said that they conducted frequent raids at pharmacies in the city recently, but they did not come across such complaints. He, however, assured to take action against stores, which TOI visited on Friday. Commenting on it, KK Selvam from Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association said that they have advised all their member-stores to adhere to the government order. Stores sell items at the price fixed by the manufacturers. Some additional technical specifications could result in a higher retail cost, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-cases-down-in-chennai-mask-prices-up/articleshow/85504969.cms||Ram Sundaram

The speakers pointed out that as per the Indian e-commerce industry report, e-commerce in India is anticipated to jump from $39 billion in 2017 to $120 billion in 2020, exhibiting an annual growth of 51% — the highest in the world. During the Conclave Special Guest, TCPL Packaging MD Saket Kanoria mentioned that sustainability and investment push is a very welcome development. “Investment-driven approach and large MNCs in the west put a lot of pressure to actually demonstrate that they are moving towards sustainable and recyclable solutions and one thing that we don’t really think of discussing too much in the packaging industry with respect to the regulatory bodies is that should we focus on only sustainable or on recyclability. Because, recyclability is the more critical thing to maintain sustainability because carbon footprint of a plastic packaging as opposed to glass or paper and other forms of materials is not fully understood,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/plastic-sector-to-grow-at-26-7-to-204-8-bn-by-2025/articleshow/85499674.cms||---

For the second year in a row, the number of applicants from the state has dropped after reaching 1.4 lakh applicants before the pandemic in 2019. From 1,21,617 applicants for NEET 2020, the number has come down to 1,12,889 for NEET 2021, according to National Testing Agency's registration data. Among the applicants, 71745 (63.5%) are female candidates and 41,144 (36.5) are male candidates. Experts cite the delay in conducting the common medical entrance test and increase in the cut-off for medical admissions as reasons for dip in the applications. Meanwhile, the number of students opting to write the exam in Tamil increased by 16% as the number went up from 17,101 in 2020 to 19,867 in 2021. NEET 2021 is scheduled to be held on September 12, 2021. "During the last two years, the cut-off for medical admissions increased by 100 marks. The current students are reluctant to take up the exam without coaching as the cut-off for government colleges has gone up to 570 and 580 marks. This year students did not attend even regular classes as the classes were held online. So, students who are mentally not prepared might have decided to apply after preparing for a year," said career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi. He further said the quota for government school students could be the reason behind the increase in the number of students opting to write in Tamil. Students counsellors said the delay in conducting the NEET could be the reason for dip in applicants from Tamil Nadu. "Due to the pandemic, the NEET exam has been conducted in September for the last two years. The more the medical admissions are delayed, students who are not confident and undecided are joining engineering colleges. If the NEET exam is conducted in May, the registrations will be more from Tamil Nadu," said Manickavel Arumugam, a students counsellor. From government and government-aided schools, 11,236 students have applied to the exam. Last year, around 10,000 students applied for the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/neet-applicants-from-tamil-nadu-fall-by-7/articleshow/85504976.cms||A Ragu Raman

The authority has the mandate to conduct investigations into violations of consumer rights, institute complaints and prosecution and order recall of unsafe goods and services. It also has the power to order discontinuance of unfair trade practices and misleading advertisements. The details obtained from CCPA show that the authority has so far issued 52 notices against misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices by companies. "Some of the companies, in their advertisements, had claimed that their products such as paints, water purifiers, fabrics and plywood had 99% efficacy against the Coronavirus and germs without any scientific proof. After we issued notices, six companies withdrew their advertisements and four others have gone for corrective advertisement," said an official. The officer said currently the authority is headed by additional secretary Nidhi Khare in the consumer affairs ministry and officials from other agencies including the Bureau of Indian Standards are part of the CCPA. "The objective is to enforce the provision of the Consumer Protection Act and to fill the gap that earlier existed. The authority is keen to ensure that the companies follow rules and protect consumers' interests. That's why we are issuing directions for compliance," said another official in the consumer affairs ministry. CCPA is empowered to impose a penalty of up to 10 lakh for false or misleading advertisement on manufacturer or an endorser and the penalty can go up to 50 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ccpa-issued-52-notices-against-misleading-ads-so-far/articleshow/85504934.cms||Dipak K Dash

The court’s remarks were in response to recent cases wherein a sitting judge of the court received a bogus interview call letter and several instances of youth being cheated by job racketeers. “Of late, several unemployed youth are being cheated by job racketeers and antisocial elements, especially taking advantage of the pandemic, where thousands have lost their jobs. The method of minting money by utilizing the unemployment problem is mushrooming in the recent past and though the amount sought can be meagre, it will be multiplied when thousands transfer the amount,” said a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice S Vaidyanathan. The judges also made made it clear that progress in the investigation and trial status have to be intimated to the high court registrar regularly and warned the police authorities concerned that contempt would be initiated against them if they err. When the issue first surfaced in October 2017, the court had posed a series of questions to the investigating agencies to ascertain whether a wide network is involved in scamming gullible aspirants. CB-CID investigation into the matter showed that an aspirant, who was duped by a fake advertisement, decided to punish them and hence sent the address and mobile phone number of a sitting judge along with his phone number to various manpower agencies. Police traced the woman who posted the fake advertisement and arrested her. She is now released on bail. When the case came up for hearing before the bench, it noted that though FIR was registered in 2017, progress has been slow and directed that charge sheet be filed quickly and trial be commenced and completed expeditiously. The court also reminded of a recent incident which happened in high court premises itself wherein an accused had impersonated a high court staff and collected money from people in the garb of securing jobs in Madras high court. The court held that even in this incident investigation was slow and only after the intervention of a Judge, the investigation was speeded up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/counter-job-racket-menace-with-entrepreneurial-ventures-says-madras-high-court/articleshow/85504995.cms||---

Of the 15 stations dotting this route, the lighting is inadequate at platforms and two-wheeler parking lots at seven stations. Even access roads to these stations are poorly lit. People are further inconvenienced when trains are delayed. At the stations at Athipattu Pudunagar, Athipattu, Kathivakkam, VOC Nagar, Kavarapettai and Nadiambakkam, commuters say lights exist on the portion containing platforms closer to the station building, but those alighting from the last few coaches or the first couple of coaches of the train at the far end of the platforms remain in the dark. On Wednesday, people who got off the last coaches of a MMC-Gummidipoondi train at Kathivakkam had to walk in the dark. The illumination from the lone lamp in a far corner was inadequate. Similar is the scene at most of the other stations. S Thiagarajan, who commutes to the city from Minjur, said there was no uniform lighting on the platform at the station. “Those who get down or board the first few coaches have no light. The parking lot is unsupervised as the contract is over. People have to take their bikes in the dark. Women find it difficult as men from nearby areas sit around at the parking lot at night,” he said. Dhanushkodi of the Chennai-Gummidipoondi Commuters Association said thefts of petrol and bikes are common as parking lots are not supervised. At Nandiambakkam, a commuter was attacked by miscreants when he confronted them about a theft recently, he added. Train delays and poor lighting also affect people waiting to board trains at small stations. M Gunasekharan of Athipattu said commuters boarding trains en route also suffer. “The frequency of trains is 30 minutes. This gets extended further due to train delays. People have to wait at deserted stations.” The Railway Protection Force (RPF) has deployed personnel to travel by suburban trains at night, preventing crimes against like snatchings. But all stations do not have personnel on platforms. A few stations have RPF personnel. “They are often spotted near the station building or the station master’s room,” said Thiagarajan. Dhanushkodi said parking lots and toilets, which are crucial amenities, need to be set right. “The stations have toilets. But they are locked. Commuters cannot ask for keys every time,” said Gunasekharan. On Thursday, senior railway officers of the Chennai division went on a routine inspection along the route till Gudur. “A few commuters have handed over petitions. The problems faced by commuters will be resolved,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/suburban-train-route-on-the-chennai-gummidipoondi-section-definition-of-risky-ride/articleshow/85505000.cms||V Ayyappan
