Seetharam, 35, and Sethuram, 43, who were from Rajasthan and lived in Padmanabhanagar, were returning home from work when they were hit by the speeding Hyundai Creta. They were not wearing helmets. The SUV came to a halt only after it pushed the bike and the two men on to the pavement. Quoting eyewitnesses, police said the SUV was being recklessly driven by Suhas Venkatesh, 26, a disc jockey staying in Padmanabhanagar. He was arrested by Banashankari traffic police. A senior police officer said the accident took place around 10.30pm when night curfew was in force. Suhas was allegedly under the influence of alcohol and accompanied by a friend. He sustained head injuries. As locals gathered and began shooting videos of the incident, Suhas began to question them on what rights they had to record his video. Police whisked him away as tension began building up. A police officer said Suhas was subjected to a medical test and found to be driving under the influence of alcohol. “We registered a case and he has been arrested. As he is undergoing treatment, we are yet to collect details from him,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/drunk-dj-at-wheel-of-suv-mows-down-2-bike-borne-carpenters/articleshow/85161008.cms||---

Allowing the appeal filed by Messrs ARRK Tooling Sermo India Pvt Limited, a Pune-based company, Justice HP Sandesh pointed out that Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority has made the position clear on this aspect in two circulars issued on November 16, 2009 and December 3, 2009. The judge noted that the IRDA circulars have been recorded by the Supreme Court in Balakrishnan’s case, to the effect that when the vehicle is insured by the company, the insurer is liable to pay compensation in case of “comprehensive package/policy”. Ashok R Kyalkond was travelling in the company’s car and due to the driver’s rash and negligent driving, it met with an accident on June 18, 2001 near Lonikond village along Pune-Nagar road (Maharashtra) within the limits of Loni Kalabhor police station. Ashok was killed in the accident. His wife, minor son and parents filed a petition. On July 21, 2010, the tribunal partly upheld their claim and the liability of payment of compensation was fastened upon the owner of the car. However, the insurance company was exonerated on the ground that the deceased being an employee of the car owner, is not covered under the policy. The company owning the car challenged this verdict, contending the tribunal ought to have held that liability under the instant policy towards third-party liability is that of the insurance company alone. The insurance firm claimed the deceased was proceeding in the offending car during the course of his employment under the owner and his risk was not covered under the insurance policy issued in respect of the vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/package-covers-car-occupant-insurer-must-pay-relief-hc/articleshow/85161068.cms||Vasantha Kumar

At the unveiling of a new mobile application developed by National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) intending to reach help to the poor with free legal aid for efficacious access to justice, Justice Ramana said, "If, as an institution, the judiciary wants to garner the faith of the citizens, we have to make everyone feel assured that we exist for them. For the longest time, the vulnerable population has lived outside the system of justice". Giving importance to the legal aid reaching the most marginalised in remotest parts, the CJI said, "If we want to remain as a society governed by the rule of law, it is imperative for us to bridge the gap of accessibility to justice between the highly privileged and the most vulnerable. For all times to come, we must remember that the realities of socio-economic diversity which prevail in our nation, cannot ever be a reason for denial of rights". Speaking on the occasion, NALSA executive chairman Justice UU Lalit said the body is planning to actively use the vast network of Indian Postal Service to spread the awareness about availability of free legal aid to the poorest of the poor. He also said to make the campaign of 'justice for all' a success, NALSA is in talks with law colleges and universities to make it mandatory for the third and fourth year law students to enrol as para-legal volunteers to help those who need assistance in getting legal aid free of cost from the national and state legal aid services. CJI Ramana said even after nearly 75 years of independence, custodial torture and other police atrocities still occur in our country. "The threat to human rights and bodily integrity are the highest in police stations. Custodial torture and other police atrocities are problems that still prevail in our society." "In spite of constitutional declarations and guarantees (for the rights), lack of effective legal representation at the police stations is a huge detriment to arrested/detained persons. The decisions taken in these early hours will later determine the ability of the accused to defend himself... Going by the recent reports even the privileged are not spared third - degree treatment," he said and suggested NALSA to actively carry out nationwide sensitisation of police officers. The CJI appealed to all advocates, especially the wellto-do senior advocates, to dedicate “some percentage of their working hours” to help those in need of legal aid. Terming the NALSA’s “Access to Justice” project as an unending mission, the CJI said its main obstacles are lengthy, painstaking and expensive formal justice processes. “As an institution, the toughest challenge before us is to break these barriers first... The problem of poor connectivity in rural and remote areas adversely affecting the justice delivery was highlighted by all (the HC chief justices with whom he interacted after taking over as CJI). Taking this major concern into consideration, I have already written to the government emphasising the need to bridge the digital divide on a priority basis,” he said. He said though the legal aid movement, started 25 years ago, has gained new momentum, it still has to reach out to a large section of the population. “Ours is one of the largest legal aid systems in the world. (But) ... it is an undeniable truth that, there are significant barriers in accessing the relevant legal information.” Watch CJI Ramana suggests NALSA to actively carry out nationwide sensitisation of police officers||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/threat-to-human-rights-bodily-integrity-highest-in-thanas-cji-ramana/articleshow/85161232.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The government said in a statement Modi will be the first Indian PM to preside over a UNSC open debate. The meeting is expected to be attended by several heads of state and government of member states of the UNSC. The debate will focus on ways to effectively counter maritime crime and insecurity and strengthen coordination in the maritime domain. "The UN Security Council has discussed and passed resolutions on different aspects of maritime security and maritime crime. However, this will be the first time that maritime security will be discussed in a holistic manner as an exclusive agenda item in such a high level open debate," said the government in a statement. "Given that no country alone can address the diverse aspects of maritime security, it is important to consider this subject in a holistic manner in the United Nations Security Council. A comprehensive approach to Maritime Security should protect and support legitimate maritime activities, while countering traditional and non-traditional threats in the maritime domain," it added. Modi put forward the vision of SAGAR - an acronym for 'Security and Growth for all in the Region' in 2015. This vision focuses on cooperative measures for sustainable use of the oceans, and provides a framework for a safe, secure, and stable maritime domain in the region, according to MEA. In 2019, at the East Asia Summit, this initiative was further elaborated through the Indo-Pacific Oceans' Initiative (IPOI) with a focus on seven pillars of maritime security including Maritime Ecology, Maritime Resources, Capacity Building and Resource Sharing, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management, Science, Technology and Academic Cooperation and Trade Connectivity and Maritime Transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-to-chair-unsc-debate-on-maritime-security-today/articleshow/85161814.cms||---

The two-day visit by Al-Qahtani was important as it came, as official sources said, in the middle of a major effort to secure an interim arrangement in Kabul that is agreeable to all stakeholders. Al-Qahtani backed India’s position that an inclusive process, which ensured protection for women, children and minorities was important for a lasting political settlement in Afghanistan. However, while the peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban have continued intermittently in Doha, prospects for a negotiated power-sharing deal look increasingly bleak. Taliban insurgents have continued to indulge in wanton violence despite their claim that they ``strenuously’’ favour a political settlement. Doha will this week also host Russia’s extended troika meet on Afghanistan involving US, China and Pakistan. While Al-Qahtani didn’t clearly, or directly, mention Pakistan in his interaction with Indian authorities, he brought up regional and global conflicts with potential to affect the situation in Afghanistan. These included US-Iran relations and India’s own ties with Pakistan. While maintaining that it won’t recognise any group that takes Afghanistan by force, Qatar has continued to facilitate the peace talks as it sees the Taliban, as Al-Qahtani was himself quoted as saying recently, a key component of any political solution. Al-Qahtani had acknowledged India’s contribution to Afghanistan economically and said India wanted a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. India has committed humanitarian and development assistance worth over $ 3 billion to Afghanistan. It has undertaken more than 500 infrastructure and development projects since 2001. For India, the main priority remains cessation of all violence and terrorist attacks. This includes the support extended to the Taliban by Pakistan based terror groups. In its meetings with Qatari officials, as indeed other regional and international partners, the government has continued to emphasise on the importance of settlement of the conflict through political dialogue and "respect for the interests of all ethnic groups, women and children." During his visit to India, Al-Qahtani met foreign minister S Jaishankar, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and joint secretary J P Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/working-for-inclusive-peace-in-afghanistan-but-concerns-remain-about-external-players-qatar-tells-india/articleshow/85162504.cms||Sachin Parashar
---||India||Parliament logjam: Oppn digs in as Monsoon session enters last week||NEW DELHI: As the Parliament session enters its last week with the prospect of continued disruptions, the opposition on Sunday sent out a warning that it is not willing to relent on its demand for a discussion on the Pegasus scandal to allow the proceedings. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, posting a video clip of different parties seeking a discussion in the House, tweeted, "PM Narendra Modi seems to have lost his nerve. Why is he not keen on answering questions in the Parliament? The opposition parties are ready for discussions but the BJP government is stalling the proceedings so that the truth doesn't get to the people." Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien retweeted the post with the comment "Mr Modi come listen to us in Parliament." The aggression may continue barring the uncertainty over whether to join proceedings when the government introduces the 127th Constitution Amendment Bill to restore the rights of states to identify and maintain the "state lists" of OBCs which was scrapped by the SC judgement of May 5. The bill is listed in Lok Sabha for Monday. A meeting of floor leaders will take a call in the morning. What has happened in the monsoon session is the coming together of key opposition parties, who were earlier fragmented, and taking a joint stand on issues to corner the government. The TMC's renewed aggression after victory in West Bengal elections over challenger BJP has been the catalyst in the unity. The Pegasus scandal proved handy for the opposition as it tied in with their allegations that the Modi regime is "compromising the institutions and democracy". In fact, TMC and Shiv Sena argued that washout of Parliament was not a new development as BJP had done so over 2G scam during the UPA regime. If the washout succeeds, the opposition parties believe it will strengthen their hand in future and the BJP would have to give due consideration to their demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parliament-logjam-oppn-digs-in-as-monsoon-session-enters-last-week/articleshow/85163398.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||India||4% dip in India's weekly Covid cases as NE numbers decline||Weekly Covid-19 cases in India fell by 4% after having registered a 7.5% spike last week, mainly due to a steep decline in cases in several northeastern states. India recorded over 2.74 lakh cases during the week ended Sunday (August 2-8), registering a 4.2% decline from the previous week, when the case count was 2.86 lakh. That week (July 26-August 1), fresh cases in the country had risen for the first time in 12 weeks on the back of a 27% surge in Kerala and smaller increases in Karnataka and a few states in the northeast. In the current week, Kerala cases showed signs of plateauing, with a marginal 1% increase over the previous week. In absolute numbers, the state reported more than 1.41 lakh cases, its highest weekly count since the last week of May. Kerala accounted for more than 51% of all new cases reported during the week. Tamil Nadu, where cases have been rising marginally for the past 10 days, logged a weekly spike of 5% while Andhra Pradesh recorded an increase of 1%. With this, all southern states, with the exception of Telangana, have recorded a spike in infections either this week or the last. Meanwhile, deaths during the week fell to 3,540, the lowest weekly toll in the country since the beginning of April. This was a dip of 7% from the previous week's toll of 3,805. The drop in the weekly cases was mainly because of a sharp decline in fresh infections in the northeast, with Sikkim reporting a fall of 43%, Tripura 32%, Arunachal Pradesh 26%, Manipur 25% and Mizoram 22%. Cases had been rising in several of these states till last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/4-dip-in-indias-weekly-covid-cases-as-ne-numbers-decline/articleshow/85165077.cms||---
---||India||For top military posts, MoD weighs merit over seniority||NEW DELHI: In what will be a radical change in the promotion policy for top military generals if implemented, the defence ministry is “examining” a proposal that the commanders-in-chief (Cs-in-C) in the Army, Navy and IAF should primarily be selected on merit rather than seniority. With the impending creation of integrated theatre commands, the proposed aim is to concomitantly evolve “a more progressive, common and merit-based” policy for the promotion of officers to three-star ranks (Lt-Generals in Army, Vice Admirals in Navy and Air Marshals in IAF) in general and Cs-in-C (senior three-stars who head different commands in armed forces) in particular, say sources. “A tri-Service committee of the vice chiefs of the Army, Navy and IAF is likely to be formed to study the proposal and recommend suitable merit-based criteria for selection of Cs-in-C,” said a source. Serious reservations against the proposal, however, have already been expressed by some quarters within the armed forces. “Only a handful of officers reach three-star ranks after being assessed on merit at every step in their careers. Why tinker with a policy that has worked well for decades? This so-called ‘deep selection’ will needlessly lead to politicisation of top ranks,” said a senior officer. But the proponents of the change in policy contend merit, and not just seniority, should be the deciding factor in selecting the top ranks as the country heads for tri-Service theatre commands and organisations to build an integrated land-air-sea war fighting machinery. As per the existing policy, promotion to the C-in-C level is based on an officer’s date of birth and his date of commissioning almost four decades ago. In the Army, for instance, an officer must have a “residual service” of 36 months left (till he turns 60) from the date of his approval as a Lt-General in order to command one of the 14 corps in the force. Then, after commanding the corps, he must have residual service of 18 months to be promoted as the C-in-C of one of the six operational and one training command. The residual service clause for Cs-in-Cs in Navy and IAF is 12 months. “In effect, with the date of birth, qualifying residual service and commissioning seniority being the all-important criteria in the existing policy, promotion of Lt-Generals to the C-in-C rank is automatic if there are vacancies,” said an officer. Incidentally, though earlier governments had almost always followed the seniority principle to appoint a new military chief except in a few instances, the NDA government had appointed General Bipin Rawat as the Army chief in December 2016 by superseding two Lt-Generals senior to him. Gen Rawat was then appointed as the country’s first-ever chief of defence staff in December 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-top-military-posts-mod-weighs-merit-over-seniority/articleshow/85165257.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||India||NIA raids 56 J&K places to bust terror funding module||SRINAGAR: In a concerted crackdown on a J&K terror funding module that would funnel donations to charity into subversive activities, joint teams of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), police and CRPF on Sunday raided 56 locations across 14 districts and seized sheaves of documents and several digital devices thought to contain evidence of the money trail. An NIA spokesperson said the raids on premises of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), a Srinagar-headquartered outfit that was put on the proscribed list in 2019, were carried out on the basis of a terror funding case registered on February 5 this year under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The raided properties are in Srinagar, Budgam, Ganderbal, Baramulla, Kupwara, Bandipora, Anantnag, Shopian, Pulwama and Kulgam in the Valley and Ramban, Doda, Kishtwar and Rajouri in Jammu division. "Members of the organisation had been collecting funds within the country and abroad in the form of zakat, mowda and bait-ul-mal (different types of donations to charity and welfare activities). These funds were then used for violent secessionist activities," the NIA official said. The prod to conduct raids in 14 out of the 20 districts of J&K on a single day came from the Union home ministry. Donations raised by JeI were being used to fund terror outfits such as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba, among others, through an entrenched network of overground cadres, sources said. JeI also stands accused of radicalising Kashmiri youth and recruiting "rukuns", or freshers, to participate in disruptive secessionist activities, the NIA said. Besides residences of JeI office-bearers and members, the premises raided on Sunday include offices of various trusts allegedly controlled by the organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nia-raids-56-jk-places-to-bust-terror-funding-module/articleshow/85165344.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Wary of ‘Sunny Leone’ on merit list, colleges take extra guard||KOLKATA: A film star is keeping principals and vice chancellors in Kolkata glued to the computer screens though the reason for it is not her body of work but to prevent a prank which caused much embarrassment not only to the colleges but also to the entire education department after it went viral last year. In 2020, a fake application in the name of Sunny Leone made it to the top of the merit list of English Literature of Asutosh College inspiring a series of memes online and Sunny herself tweeting how “excited” she was to be back in college which many reciprocated with their desire to be her classmates. This year, however, colleges are not leaving any stone unturned to avoid such a situation where fake applications or pranks make it to the merit list. Last year, colleges and universities were too busy figuring out the entire online process of admission and the fake application of Sunny slipped through the filter process and made it to the merit list. But colleges and universities are already alert this time and have incorporated mechanisms to weed out such applications either at the application stage or just before the merit list is drawn up. The probability of such pranks is higher because there is no application fee and most colleges cannot physically verify documents before admission. At Asutosh College where the incident happened, the authorities have directed applicants to report online before final merit list is drawn up at every stage. “The students will be told to upload the copies of their mark sheets, photograph, signature and other documents which we will tally against the one they have submitted while applying. If anybody is trying to play a prank or submit fake details, he/she will be caught at this stage only,” said an official of the college. First online application is scheduled on August18, 19 and 20. “We want to avoid any incident like last year and we are taking proper measures for that.” Presidency University, too, has directed applicants to report online before every provisional merit list is published. “Students will be required to upload the copies of mark sheets, signature and other documents which will be matched with the ones submitted at the application stage. This will help us eliminate any fake applications,” said an official. First online reporting is scheduled on August 30 and September 1. Many autonomous colleges like Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira and St Xavier’s will have online interaction or viva voce before admission. The admission portals of all colleges are maintained by “professional” companies who design the software and incorporate mechanisms for various calculations and to identify fake applications. Before the admission process began this year, college authorities held meetings with the companies and instructed them to ensure that fake applications like last year do not make it to the merit list. “Colleges too have made their teams to watch out for any fake applications or pranks at the application stage. The incident last year involving the fake application of Sunny Leone was a very embarrassing one for all of us,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wary-of-sunny-leone-on-merit-list-colleges-take-extra-guard/articleshow/85161836.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The hit for the government just doesn't stop here. If one adds the outstanding Rs 23,000 crore owed to the banks, the impact could be one of the biggest in corporate history as a large part of the loans (65-70%) is extended by state-run lenders. The banks have further extended guarantees worth thousands of crores to the company, which also run the risk of defaults. "The telecom department and the national exchequer would lose the most in case of a collapse of Vodafone Idea. The picture looks grim considering the poor recoveries and unrealised outstanding after the collapse of Anil Ambani's Reliance Communications and Aircel, where too several thousands of crores of rupees remain locked. Taxpayers stand to lose the most," an analyst with a leading brokerage told TOI. Cumulatively, the company currently has a debt of Rs 1.8 lakh crore, and has been bleeding financially with losses pegged at Rs 7,000 crore during the March quarter. The debt tops Rs 1.8 lakh crore, according to ICICI Securities. "We see payment of liabilities coming soon, while fund availability remains a challenge," it said. According to numbers sourced from various analysts and Vodafone Idea's financial results, at Rs 107, the company remains precariously placed with the lowest average revenue per user (Arpu) among its peers. Reliance Jio reported Arpu of Rs 138 and Bharti Airtel at Rs 145, though the latter has said time and again that at least Rs 200 Arpu is needed to nurse the capital-intensive sector back to health. Vodafone Idea's poor outlook was evident after the SoS calls given by its promoters, who have refused to make any further investments into the company, and are asking the government to support its survival. Goldman Sachs said that it expects capex for Vodafone Idea to remain under pressure, "resulting in continued market share loss". It said that between December this year and April of 2022, the company has about Rs 22,500 crore of dues (debt, AGR and spectrum) payable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-may-have-to-take-the-biggest-hit-if-vodafone-idea-fails/articleshow/85165702.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||India||Covishield-Covaxin mix offers better shield, says ICMR study||PUNE/NEW DELHI: A combination of Covishield and Covaxin could not only be safe but elicits better immune protection and the adverse effects were no different as a same vaccine regimen, ICMR's analysis of a "serendipitous" Covid-19 vaccine-mix in Uttar Pradesh shows. The study examined 18 individuals in UP who inadvertently received Covishield as the first jab and Covaxin as the second. Researchers compared the safety and immunogenicity profile of this group with two groups of individuals who received either Covishield or Covaxin. "The findings suggest that immunisation with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine was not only safe but also elicited better immunogenicity," the pre-print of the Indian Council of Medical Research study published in MedRxiv says. The blood samples of the 18 individuals who were mistakenly given Covishield and then Covaxin jabs in April-May were analysed at different stages for 60 to 70 days after vaccination. "The mix-and-match of Covishield and Covaxin as first and second dose provoked a superior immune response than two doses of either Covishield or Covaxin," said senior ICMR scientist Rajni Kant, the study's chief investigator. This is the first report of mixed immunisation that has demonstrated safety and significantly improved immune response. The findings are important as experts have asked if Covishield and Covaxin doses can be mixed to get around supply shortages. Currently, deliberate mixing of the two vaccines is not advised. But to conclusively prove these findings, the ICMR researchers said a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be needed as the current sample size was small. Findings show immunogenicity profile in people who received both the vaccines was superior against Alpha, Beta and Delta variants, IgG antibody and neutralising antibody response was significantly higher compared as in the case of homologous groups. "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which reports the effects of heterologous prime-boost vaccination with an adenovirus vectored vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine," the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covishield-covaxin-mix-offers-better-shield-says-icmr-study/articleshow/85166025.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The huge poster, put up by the supporters of JD(U) state general secretary and former MLA Abhay Kushwaha, has the pictures of CM Nitish Kumar, RCP Singh, party state chief Umesh Singh Kushwaha, state rural development minister Shrawan Kumar and many other state-level leaders, baring those of Lalan Singh and Upendra Kushwaha. As the posters were put up at all important road cross-sections in the state capital on Sunday morning, it caused resentment among Lalan’s supporters. Supporters of Abhay Kushwaha said they put up such posters in retaliation to the posters of August 6, in which pictures of RCP and Umesh Kushwaha were missing. They said supporters of Lalan had put up a huge number of posters in the city on August 6 to mark his maiden visit to Patna after becoming the party’s national president. In some posters, the pictures of RCP, the lone Union minister from the JD(U), and Umesh Kushwaha were left out. Abhay’s supporters also sent to TOI the pictures of some August 6 posters in which photos of RCP and Umesh were missing. Contacted over phone, Abhay Kushwaha said the posters sans Lalan’s photo were put up mainly to draw the attention of the party leaders towards the posters of August 6 sans pictures of RCP and Umesh. “They (supporters of Lalan) should learn that if they can leave the pictures of RCP Singh and Umesh Kushwaha in their posters, other people can follow the suit.” Umesh Kushwaha said the party leader who put up the poster sans Lalan’s picture, admitted his fault and the controversial poster had been removed from the front side of the JD(U) office. Umesh said Nitish, RCP Singh and Lalan are the JD(U)’s top three leaders and all party functionaries would have to maintain the protocol while carrying out their pictures in posters or any propaganda materials. He said necessary action would be taken if any party functionary violates the protocol. Asked whether the JD(U) leadership took action against those party functionaries who left the pictures of RCP from August 6 posters, Umesh said, “We were not aware of it. These matters were brought to our notice on Sunday after controversy erupted over the posters not having the national president’s picture.” The JD(U) state president also said the party’s senior leaders would sit together over the issue and sort out the matter soon. “I will ensure that such things do not happen in the future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalan-finds-no-place-in-jdu-posters-put-up-to-welcome-rcp/articleshow/85158577.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Business||Godrej & Boyce’s digital push to boost consumer-focus drive||Mumbai: The privately held Rs 11,500-crore Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company (G&B), which has partnered in India’s space missions, has undertaken a digital transformation initiative across its diverse group companies with an objective of bringing a consumer-centric focus and aiding cross-selling as well. G&B, which is headed by Jamshyd Godrej, is setting up a centralised digital corporate team, which will work along with individual companies, explore synergies and enable a common platform for consumer insights and data that can be harnessed across the group. Coronavirus-triggered trends, such as the emergence of the omni-channel consumer, has hastened the plan. G&B executive director Nyrika Holkar, who leads digital strategy for the group, told TOI that from the perspective of the 124-year old group, which has experienced several transformations over the decades, the current change brought about by digital acceleration and changes in consumer behaviour have unearthed several opportunities. Holkar said G&B wants to continue exploring synergies from a design thinking perspective so that it can provide a superior customer experience across its multiple consumer businesses like appliances, furniture & interiors and security. which directly serve 100 million consumers. These businesses are leveraging digital to enhance reach by complementing their physical retail presence with a strong online presence through owned e-commerce as well as aggregator sites. Holkar believes that digital commerce will be a critical driver for future growth and not just another channel. “We want to be an insights-driven organisation and for that we need to deeply understand the customer journey and how we can leverage insights across our diverse businesses. We want these data-led insights to guide our business decisions,” said Holkar, a qualified solicitor, who is the fourth-generation member of the Godrej family.At the manufacturing end, Godrej Interio has deployed systems that study seasonality and trends to forecast demand and help production planning. Efficiency has increased significantly across multiple stages of the product journey, and in some cases, reaching up to 50% higher efficiency from what it was before the upgrades to systems and processes. “Even though sales on the Godrej Interio e-commerce portals increased by 40% during the pandemic, we want to set an even bolder revenue target for direct-to-customer. We believe this target can be achieved by curating personalised experiences and offering differentiated services. The furniture business has an ambitious target of growing its digital commerce 5x over the next 3 years,” said Holkar. Both B2C and B2B businesses, which contribute equally to the group’s turnover, adopted their own paths on how they want to transform digitally. G&B Group chief digital officer Poorav Sheth said: “It is essential to draw synergies to manage customer experiences and their expectations, which is the essence of having a common platform. Take for example, at our storage solutions business, if a customer says they want to build a warehouse, can we not share that lead with our forklift division, because ultimately, these are all in the same industry. A common platform can help you to cross-sell rather than work in silos. Godrej Material Handling business has recently introduced a fleet management system that provides customers with live data and preliminary analysis of operations to efficiently manage their assets, ensure their security and also monitor equipment health. So, you have a common platform that solves multiple challenges for the customer leading to more efficiency.” In its locks business, given that 30% of the sales come from the carpenter and contractor community, to manage these grassroots-level interactions, more than 20,000 carpenters and contractors across the country are now part of an app that offers them loyalty benefits and accidental covers. The digital transformation interventions are expected to bring about a behavioral change in people. While the Group would look at bringing in niche, skilled talent for its central digital team, from consulting/technology backgrounds, there is also a goal to create digital champions through upskilling initiatives who will act as change agents for the digital transformation within the Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/godrej-boyces-digital-push-to-boost-consumer-focus-drive/articleshow/85162170.cms||Namrata Singh

Vijay Kirloskar, chairman, Kirloskar Electric, has written to Sebi chairman after one of the Pune faction of the family sent letters to stock exchanges that implied four companies within the $3-billion (about Rs 23,000-crore) group were allowed to use the ‘Kirloskar’ brand. The letter said it was against a court order of 2015 that allowed all the companies within the 130-year business group to use the brand. This development comes days after the Supreme Court advised Kirloskar family members to settle all disputes amicably in the last week of July. The letter by Bengaluru-based Vijay Kirloskar to Sebi was in response to stock exchange disclosures by Kirloskar Oil Engines, Kirloskar Industries, Kirloskar Pneumatic and Kirloskar Ferrous Industries, which separately but in identically worded letters said these four companies were rebranding the ‘Kirloskar’ logo to continue to grow their businesses. In the letter to Sebi, Vijay Kirloskar alleged that these four companies were misleading investors by false representation, a violation of Sebi rules. The latter has also been sent to the two stock exchanges, NSE and BSE. These four companies are run by Pune-based Atul and Rahul, nephews of Vijay Kirloskar. He alleged that Atul and Rahul were attempting to create uncertainty in the minds of investing public and undermine the intrinsic value of Kirloskar Electric’s shareholders by giving false statement.Vijay Kirloskar requested Sebi to act against four companies run by his nephews for misleading investors by giving false statements and for trying to “usurp” the 130-year-old legacy of the brand name ‘Kirloskar’. He was seeking regulatory action under Sebi (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and Sebi (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. If the regulator acts on the letter, it would be second regulatory action against Atul and Rahul since Sebi’s October 2020 order against the two and their associates that ordered total payment of Rs 31 crore plus interest for violations of various regulatory prohibitions. Since 2010, the various factions within the Kirloskar family have been fighting a business battle either for the control of various companies within the group or trying to enter each other’s businesses. This, despite a 2009 family settlement agreement between all the factions within the group and then a failed attempt by Vijay Kelkar, the former finance secretary, in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kirloskar-electric-chief-moves-sebi-against-two-nephews/articleshow/85162124.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Merger helps Bk of Baroda step up retail loans: CEO||Mumbai: The merger of Vijaya Bank has given Bank of Baroda a lead in retail lending, particularly loans against jewellery, which rose 35% to be one of the fastest-growing segments last year. Bank of Baroda has also recorded nearly Rs 1,000 crore of savings following the three-way merger and is in line to achieve savings of Rs 10,000 crore over five years. Bank of Baroda MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha told TOI the lender completed the integration of 2,898 branches of erstwhile Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with itself in December last year. Since then the bank has got the benefits of economies of scale and branch rationalisation. “There were 1,300 branches that were closed where there was an overlap, expenses on account of rent and taxes have come down in absolute terms,” said Chadha. He added that the merger has also reduced the need for fresh hiring. Another cost-saving has been in interest expenses. “The ratio of low-cost current and savings account (CASA) deposits of the merging banks was lesser than that of standalone Bank of Baroda. As a result of the merger, BoB’s CASA dropped from 40% to 36%. We have not only retrieved what we have lost but moved ahead with a CASA ratio of 43%,” said Chadha. While Vijaya Bank’s business has given Bank of Baroda a leg up in retail, Dena Bank has consolidated its position in Western India particularly Gujarat. The public sector bank is also saving capital by shutting down international branches in South Africa, Hong Kong and Trinidad & Tobago. Chadha said that the bank also stands to gain from the new current account norms, which require borrowers to maintain current accounts with banks that provide them with a cash credit/overdraft account. He said that the bank has a strong collections business, which has been growing 70% year-on-year and is competing with private and foreign banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/merger-helps-bk-of-baroda-step-up-retail-loans-ceo/articleshow/85162051.cms||Mayur Shetty

It was heavier in the southern part of the city and lost intensity by late morning. The rain was triggered by a cyclonic circulation over Gangetic Bengal, said the Met office. There will be light to moderate rain in the city and its surroundings, but heavy rain has been ruled out in the next 48 hours. “The circulation and the monsoon trough, which now passes through Gangetic Bengal, led to the rain on Sunday. It will continue to cause light to moderate showers in Kolkata and the surroundings. But there is no other rain-triggering system,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. Last week, the city received moderate showers under the impact of a cyclonic circulation over north Bay of Bengal. It triggered heavy rain in some parts of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-gets-sunday-shower-light-rain-on-met-radar/articleshow/85161016.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation Covishield vaccine centres to reopen today||KOLKATA: The civic body’s Covishield clinics and mega centres, which were shut for three days, will reopen from Monday. The decision was taken on Sunday after the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) received 30,000 Covishield doses during the day. However, whether these Covishield doses will last beyond Monday will hinge on whether fresh supplies arrive on Monday and Tuesday. The state health department has reportedly informed the KMC that the next lot of Covishield will be made available on Wednesday, August 11. KMC officials said given the daily Covishield requirement of 30,000 to 35,000 to feed its 102 vaccination clinics and 50 mega centres in Kolkata, it is largely expected that the stocks will run dry on Monday itself. “In that case, unless replenished earlier, the centres may have to be closed again on Tuesday and Wednesday. A decision will be taken based on the supplies on Monday,” said an official. “As supply of Covishield doses improved in the last week of July, we were allocating 200 doses to each of our Covishield vaccination centres daily. The mega centres were getting around 300 doses per day. But given the dearth of vaccines at present, we need to cut down on the allocation drastically if we want to keep our clinics and mega centres open,” said a civic official. The official, however, conceded that if supply didn’t improve, the second-dose backlog would reach an uncontrollable level. “At present, our backlog stands at 1.2 lakh doses. We need to clear this as fast as we can. But this backlog will grow at a faster rate if we fail to feed our clinics and mega centres regularly. Any further backlog will make the situation challenging for us. We hope the next consignment of Covishield doses will be good enough to clear this backlog,” the official said. According to health department officials, Kolkata has been allotted 40,000 doses of vaccines, which means the Covid vaccination centres being run in state-run medical college and hospitals will also get 10,000 Covishield doses. Vaccination numbers in Kolkata on Sunday plummeted as not even 4,000 doses were administered, and even those were largely given by private facilities in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-covishield-vaccine-centres-to-reopen-today/articleshow/85160963.cms||Saikat Ray

Mayor Prasanna Ernest raised this demand at a meeting convened here to discuss measures to be taken for sanitizing and protecting the lake. Speaking at the meeting, finance minister K N Balagopal said there was an allocation of Rs 50 crore in the budget for the conservation of water bodies in the state. A portion of this amount could be made available for protecting Ashtamudi, he added. "Compared to other backwaters in the state, Ashtamudi is less affected by contamination. Still, changes under prevailing conditions have to be examined. Fish resources should be sustained, and free flow of water to be ensured," the minister said, adding that there should be a popular movement for conserving the lake. As part of preparing the action plan, a technical workshop will be held on August 10. MP N K Premachandran said his MP's fund would be made available for rejuvenating the lake. He also added that constituting a nodal agency for protection and conservation of the lake was necessary. NORKA Roots chairman K Varadarajan said given the tourism potential, several projects could be implemented with ensuring the lake's conservation.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fund-to-be-made-available-for-ashtamudi-conservation/articleshow/85161036.cms||---

The woman’s entire biliary system was fully stuffed with stones which were removed without a single incision.  “The patient was in extreme distress. Upon investigations, she was suspected to have multiple stones and hence without wasting any more time, we planned for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure,” said Dr Dhaval Dave, gastroenterologist at Parul Sevashram Hospital. Doctors were startled to see her biliary system. “We started removing the stones from intrahepatic duct, hepatic duct, common bile duct and we around 80 stones of various sizes up to 2 cm size till the ampulla,” he said “But we could complete the procedure in two hours without any intra-operative bleeding. With a special balloon, the tract was dilated. The stones were pushed into the intestinal cavity from where they would be gradually excreted with faeces,” he said.  Usually, such cases are seen more in northern and central parts of the country. “Prolonged fasting, diet with excessive fat content are some of the reasons for formation of such stones. These stones if not removed timely also pose a risk for cancer. Hence it is crucial to remove them,” said hospital’s medical director Dr Geetika Madan Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/80-hard-stones-removed-from-mp-womans-gall-bladder-without-cuts/articleshow/85160058.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Delaying health needs leading to increase in heart attack, stroke||Nagpur: Though Covid wards are empty, doctors are still busy and hospitals are full. This is because patients who were neglecting their medical needs during the pandemic period are now revisiting hospitals. Many people who kept on postponing their healthcare needs are suffering from strokes, said doctors. “Our hospital is 150% occupied for last two months. The fact is that Covid admissions are near zero since June first week. We are getting patients from people who postponed their healthcare needs during the pandemic. This is dangerous,” said Dr Nitin Shinde from Alexis hospital. “I have been treating an unusually high number of heart attack patients for last 2 weeks. People as young as in their mid-thirties are suffering from heart attacks. What I have noticed is that they report very late. Maybe, they still feel unsafe visiting the hospitals despite we don’t have any Covid patients since last month or so,” said Dr Prashant Jagtap of Viveka Hospital. He advised people not to shy away from visiting the doctor in case having acidity symptoms for long despite taking medicines. Stroke is also one of the serious implications of staying home and avoiding healthcare needs. “Due to changes in lifestyle and demographics, the lifetime risk of stroke for people over 25 years during pandemic phase has increased from 1 in 6 to 1 in 4. That means one out of four persons over the age of 25 is going to have a stroke in their lifetime,” said Dr Amit Bhatti, Interventional Neurologist, and Stroke Specialist. According to him, the commonest causes of death in stroke patients are lack of awareness about symptoms of stroke, its treatment, and after that comes limited facilities in hospitals. “Many patients don’t know that there is a treatment available for stroke. For ischemic strokes, it is important to get treatment within the golden window of 4.5 to 6 hours. But most of this time is wasted by family and friends in either understanding the stroke symptoms or taking the victim to the right hospital,” he said. The best and the safest option in case of stroke is to take the patient to a stroke emergency-ready hospital where CT, MRI, and other facilities are available with neurologists round the clock. The majority of strokes could be prevented by addressing risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, diet, smoking, and exercise. Thanks to the recent advances in interventional neurology, the clot can be removed successfully. This not only saves the patient’s life but also avoids the disability that may have been followed by stroke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/delaying-health-needs-leading-to-increase-in-heart-attack-stroke/articleshow/85160984.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The deadline has been given in the wake of the railway board fixing the date for completion of the doubling process by March 31, 2024. According to the government documents accessed by TOI in this regard, as much as 63 hectares of land (155.67 acres) are pending for acquisition in various stretches, covering a total length of 54.3 km, where doubling is to be completed and bridges to be reconstructed. The railway board has sanctioned necessary funds for the land acquisition, and the state government has given the administrative approval for the acquisition. The major land acquisition pending is the Thiruvananthapuram-Kanyakumari route (87 km), in which 31km from Thiruvananthapuram to Parassala is falling in the state. As much as 40 hectares (98.84 acres) falling in Thiruvananthapuram and Neyyattinkara taluks are pending for acquisition in this segment alone, for which the railways has provided Rs 50 crore towards the acquisition expenses in the first phase. As much as 16 hectares (39.53 acres) in Kanayannur and Cherthala taluks of Ernakulam and Alappuzha, respectively, are to be acquired for doubling the line between Kumbalam and Thuravur (15.6km). Also, six hectares (14.82 acres) have to be acquired from Kanayannur taluk for the completion of doubling in Ernakulam-Kumbalam stretch (7.7km). In addition, the railways also need to reconstruct major bridges in some of the stretches falling in Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod districts, for which as much as 81 ares (two acres) have to be acquired in Vadakara, Taliparamba, Kannur, Hosdurg and Kasaragod taluks. The railways has asked the state to complete the acquisition process by the end of the ongoing financial year as it would then require 24 months to complete civil engineering works, electrical, signalling and the telecommunication works. The railway board has set a deadline of March 31, 2024, as the day to complete its highly utilized network (HUN) tracks in which the state falls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rlys-asks-state-to-expedite-land-acquisition-for-doubling-work/articleshow/85159428.cms||KP Saikiran

Police said the accused were identified as a 22-year-old student of BSc (computer science) and his 13-year-old younger brother, who was a classmate of the girl. “The boys used an application to change the landline number to a foreign-origin mobile number to make search difficult for the police,” said ADCP, North, Prachi Singh. “During investigation, we found that the accused made 13 calls on the girl’s number to harass her. We also recovered the phone number used by them and it was verified by the cyber cell on the basis of the surveillance that the phone was present at the house of the accused,” added Singh. “Laxity on the part of college administration also surfaced during the probe. Police said some students were made WhatsApp group admin and they added some outsiders to the group. Therefore, it became difficult to trace who shared the link to an outsider,” added Singh. ACP, cyber cell, Vivek Ranjan Rai told the TOI that the minor boy had tried to harass the girl because she had stopped talking to him and was not friendly anymore. “He felt alienated as she was her only friend and had suddenly stopped talking to him,” the ACP said. The girl’s mother had lodged a case on July 17 after which the police started investigations. Cops were initially baffled as the mobile number used to send messages was of foreign origin. ACP, Aliganj, Akhilesh Singh said while the minor was sent to juvenile home, his elder brother was arrested. The harassers had posted obscene messages targeting the girl and raised questions on her integrity causing mental trauma to her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/minor-brother-held-for-harassingclass-8-girl-on-school-wa-group/articleshow/85164327.cms||---

Bus marketers are expecting the current dismal run to continue through to Q4 of this year with big companies like Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors waiting for things to improve before they kickstart investments. “Since the existing capacity is not being used up, fresh investments will be on hold for two years at least. The only OEMs to invest will be those building their EV line up,” said Rohan Gupta, VP, ICRA.Take Ashok Leyland for example. The company’s bus factory in Andhra Pradesh was commissioned in March but domestic bus volumes are down so sharply there’s been no urgency to add additional capacity. But the company has, on the other hand, already put in the ‘predominant part’ of the $130 million investment in its UK-headquartered EV entity Switch and will launch electric light vans and make electric buses for India. As for Tata Motors, CFO P Balaji admits that “demand is extremely tepid” and the company “will need to wait for a while” before things look up. “We are still not looking for expansion of capacity in buses at all and we are phasing out the investments on new products because we need to wait for the right time,” he added.The good news is bus companies are looking at the bus upgrade push in the budget to help demand once the third wave threat eases out. “The electric eco-system will take time to pick up speed and in inter-state and semi-urban/rural areas it will still be a combination of diesel and LNG/CNG usage. The budget push for fleet upgradation will help bus demand,” said Vipin Sondhi, MD & CEO, Ashok Leyland. Bus companies say most of the capacity investments are already in place so there is no real need for fresh factories. “We already have capacity already on the ground as a group and there is no need for additions till the market picks up,” said Kamal Bali, president & MD, Volvo Group.Experts say that the market will improve as vaccination drive picks up speed. “We are looking forward to the bus market recovering as restrictions ease and we have launched our BSafe package in anticipation,” said Satyakam Arya, MD, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles. “The state transport fleet is ageing and school bus demand will return when schools reopen,” Balaji added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bus-manufacturers-put-capex-on-hold-focus-on-electric-models/articleshow/85160607.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

---||Patna||Caste-based census demand: More to it than meets the eye||PATNA: The demand for caste-based census has brought the two rival political parties – ruling JD(U) and opposition RJD – to the same page, again, in the state. Contrary to the categorical stand of his ally BJP in state as well as at the Centre, JD(U) leader and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar accepted the demand of RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to seek appointment with PM Narendra Modi to discuss the issue and also wrote a letter to him in this regard recently. The diametrically opposite stand by JD(U) and RJD vis-a-vis the BJP, which calls the demand for caste census “divisive politics”, has started a debate on any possible political churning and realignment in Bihar. It may strain the relationship between the two NDA allies, who now differ on several other controversial issues also, like bringing a law to control birth rate in the country and NRC. The reiteration of demand for a caste census is also being seen as a move by the regional parties, which are mostly led by the intermediary caste leaders, as part of their plan to revive the Mandal Commission euphoria in order to weaken the “kamandal” (BJP) and as part of their electoral preparations for the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states next year as well as to create a platform for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. RJD national general secretary Alok Kumar Mehta did not deny the political quotient in favour and against any such demand but said authentic caste data would help in making policy decisions more effectively. “Only the status quoists (BJP) are opposing caste census. When Laluji effected social justice, they said it led to chaos and termed it as ‘jungle raj’. Suppose any caste is included on the list of Dalits, how will you determine their welfare measures when you don’t know their numbers,” Alok told TOI on Sunday. JD(U) chief spokesperson Neeraj Kumar also strongly felt the need of caste census to develop human index as well. “The state assembly passed a unanimous resolution twice in favour of caste census and no political parties had opposed it. Caste is a social and political reality. What is the problem if it will help in framing better welfare programmes for the backward people? The country’s population has increased manifold since the last caste census in 1931,” Neeraj said. However, social and economic expert and former principal of Patna College, Prof (retd) N K Choudhary, feels it is a purely political issue. “Instead of trying to develop a modern society, the political parties demanding caste census are trying to polarize society, understanding well that they have ‘laddoo’ in both their hands. They will brand those opposing caste census as anti-backward, anti-poor forces. Their professed objective and hidden agenda are to reap the benefits of Mandal politics once again. They have benefitted from it during the last over 30 years. Do you need a caste census to develop government schools and hospitals?” he said. National general secretary of BJP OBC Morcha, Dr Nikhil Anand, said BJP is not completely opposed to the idea of caste census, but it is not possible in the present situation. He also questioned the Congress-led UPA government’s motive behind conducting a caste census in 2011. “The political parties demanding it should first seek explanation from Congress for not obeying the consensus of Parliament to conduct caste census in 2011. Why did the then UPA government conduct it separately from the regular census and in violation of the Census Act, costing around Rs5,000 crore involving private agencies in doing a sample survey, which has uncountable mistakes?” Anand asked. The Manmohan Singh government had ordered the socioeconomic and caste census in 2011 following a fierce demand by the Yadav troika of Lalu, Mulayam Singh Yadav of Samajwadi Party from Uttar Pradesh and Sharad Yadav in Parliament in 2010. But the government published only the socioeconomic data and not the caste figures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/caste-based-census-demand-more-to-it-than-meets-the-eye/articleshow/85158643.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

The health department is also on alert as seven cases of dengue have been reported in Patna in the last few days. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh said three dengue cases were reported from Agamkuan and one each from Naubatpur, Phulwarisharif, Khagaul and Kankarbagh. “Extensive fumigation through hand-held and vehicle-mounted fogging machines is being conducted by the civic body and the district health team in these areas,” she said. Dr Singh added chikungunya and malaria cases have so far not been reported in the district, but the health workers have been put on alert. “Potentially vulnerable areas in the district have been identified as breeding grounds for mosquitoes based on the infection reported in previous years,” Dr Singh said. These vulnerable areas are Kankarbagh, Rajendra Nagar, Transport Nagar, Sampatchak, Phulwarisharif, Danapur, Pirbahore, Patliputra, Gai Ghat, Gardanibagh, Khajekalan, Shastri Nagar, Mahendru and Pathar ki Masjid. Patients suffering from dengue display symptoms like high fever, body rashes, low platelet count and appetite loss. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection which spread to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma said the civic body follows the roster for the anti-larval medicine spray and fogging throughout the year. “Each area is covered once a week. The civic body has two hand-held fogging machines in each ward. Also, there are 40 vehicle-mounted machines which move from one ward to another on a roster basis. The anti-larvae medicine spray is also being done to kill the virus in water bodies,” he said. Sharma said bleaching powder is also being sprayed at vulnerable points where there is stagnant water. There are 75 wards in PMC’s six circles – Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankarbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City. Executive officer of Kankerbagh circle said special measures have been taken at places close to drains and farmland on Bypass as mosquitoes breed in stagnant water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmc-launches-drive-to-keep-vector-borne-diseases-at-bay/articleshow/85157913.cms||Faryal Rumi

Though the incident took place a few days ago, it came to light on Sunday when the priest of the temple lodged a complaint with the police. The police said that the idols of Saraswathi Devi and Lord Ganesh, kept outside the temple, were vandalised. The police said that the devotees throng the temple once a year during Sankranti festival. The temple is located atop a hill. On normal days, only the priest visits the temple. It is not the handiwork of burglars as nothing valuable was missing from the temple. Deputy superintendent of police M Mahendra said that the police received a complaint from the priest and committee members of the temple. “We visited the temple and found that some idols, which were outside the temple, were vandalised. We have issued notices to the management of the temple to install CCTV cameras in January this year. But they failed to install the CCTV cameras. We have registered a case and investigation is on,” said Mahendra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/idols-vandalised-at-temple-in-srikakulam/articleshow/85160186.cms||Nalla.Babu

Inaugurating the platinum jubilee celebrations of the department through a digital platform here, the VC said the university would provide all technical and financial help in the establishment of this field museum, first of its kind in the state, in the larger interest of the budding earth scientists. He lauded the all-round progress made by this department right since its inception 75 years ago and expressed the hope that it would continue to contribute significantly towards the national organisations related to mines and geology by producing a galaxy of brilliant geo-scientists. He assured of sincere implementation of the road map to be prepared by the department during its year-long celebrations. Some alumni of the department suggested establishment of a corpus fund with the help of financial contributions from the alumni so that development activities of the department may be completed with the help of this fund in future. Two alumni, a retired teacher and a former legislator, announced a donation of Rs 1 lakh each for setting up this fund and appealed to all other alumni to donate at least one day’s salary or pension to this fund. PU geology department head Atul Aditya Pandey welcomed the guests and showed the various academic and infrastructural development of the department through a video. He said a road map of development of the department would be chalked out with the help of all alumni in the platinum jubilee year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-geology-dept-to-get-a-field-museum-soon-vc/articleshow/85158074.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Those in politics shouldn’t wear jeans, says RJD chief, draws flak||PATNA: RJD state president Jagadanand Singh’s statement that “politics is not fit for those who wear jeans” has stirred up a controversy in state’s political circles. Leaders cutting across party lines have suggested the old guard of the RJD to change his mindset. While addressing party workers during a dharna to press for caste-based census on Saturday, Singh had advised them not to wear jeans as it would send a wrong message. Singh, credited with maintaining discipline in the party, also asked the workers to sit at the dharna site. “Ours is the party of the poor, suppressed and the downtrodden. We have to fight a long battle as our rights are being compromised. Those who are wearing jeans may not be our party workers, but from the RSS or the BJP. They have sneaked into our agitation with ulterior motives,” Singh told the gathering. The RJD state chief got agitated after some workers wearing jeans were seen moving here and there and paying little attention to his repeated requests to sit at the dharna site. Apparently peeved at their behaviour, Singh said, “Jeans pahanne wale neta nahi ho sakte (Those wearing jeans can’t be leaders).” Within hours of Jagdanand’s statement, a number of Chhatra RJD workers were seen sporting jeans at its meeting held at the state office on Sunday. Chhatra RJD state chief Akash Kumar said, “I don’t think it is proper and justified. Today’s politics has nothing to do with dress or uniform.” Neeraj Kumar, an office-bearer of Chhatra RJD said, “We respect Jagada babu for his seniority and contribution to the party since its inception, but he should refrain from making controversial remarks.” Reacting to Singh’s remark, HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan said, “It’s ridiculous. He should first try to set his house in order. RJD leaders like Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Manoj Jha can be seen sporting T-shirts and jeans. He should initiate action against them first.” VIP national spokesperson Dev Jyoti said, “With all respect and honour for the RJD stalwart, I would like to say that times have changed and so is the case with politics. Wearing jeans is no more a taboo.” JD(U) spokesperson Abhishek Jha described Singh’s statement as an insult to the youth. “This shows the mindset of the party that he is heading,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/netas-fume-as-rjds-bihar-chief-says-those-in-politics-shouldnt-wear-jeans/articleshow/85158494.cms||Ramashankar

Patna district magistrate (DM) Dr Chandrashekhar Singh on Sunday reached the flood-affected areas of Bind Toli and diara and listened to their problems caused by the floods. The Nakta diara has 14 wards with over 9,000 voters. Singh assured all necessary help to them. The DM enquired about the healthcare facilities, employment opportunities, cattle care and also the agricultural loss due to the flood situation. He asked the officials to prepare a list of affected households for payment under disaster compensation at the rate of Rs6,000 per family. As the flood has caused huge loss to the vegetable farming in the diara, the DM asked the district agriculture officer to evaluate the losses. He said the state government has already established middle and high schools, anganwadi wellness centre and launched other welfare schemes for the people of diara area. He instructed the SDOs and circle officers to regularly visit the flood-affected areas so as to provide all necessary help to people facing problems of sort.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-boat-in-each-ward-of-nakta-diara-patna-dm/articleshow/85158014.cms||VK Tripathi

The Chhatra RJD, led by Tej, called one-day meeting of its office bearers to discuss the issues related to students. Ahead of the meeting, posters and banners were put up in different parts of the city, including Beerchand Patel Marg, where the party’s headquarters is located. The meeting was later addressed by Tej. The posters and banners, however, carried the pictures of former CMs Lalu and Rabri Devi. A large picture of Tej was also visible. However, Tejashwi was missing from these posters and banners, leaving his supporters high and dry. “The posters contained the picture of Chhatra RJD state chief Akash Kumar, but not Tejashwi,” said Rajan Kumar Yadav, a diehard supporter of Tejashwi. He added senior leaders of the party should look into the matter and act accordingly. Tejashwi’s supporters viewed the move as an act of retaliation of exclusion of Tej’s pictures in posters and banners erected at the party office on the occasion of RJD’s foundation day in July this year. “Tejashwi to hamare dil mein hain. Wo to hamare Arjun hain. Posters mein photo nahi rahne se kya hota hai? (Tejashwi occupies his place in my heart. He is like my Arjuna. Posters without his pictures hardly matters),” Tej said. The JD(U), an NDA ally, however, took a potshot at Lalu’s sons. JD(U) spokesperson Ajay Alok said, “Both Tej and Tejashwi are like mythological characters Bali and Sugreev. Both are brothers, but they are poles apart.” The Congress leaders refused to comment on the matter. “It's an internal matter of the RJD. Let them handle it,” Congress spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-missing-from-chhatra-rjd-posters/articleshow/85157976.cms||Ramashankar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: BBMP chief orders drain works to end Ulsoor flooding||BENGALURU: Ulsoor residents, especially those living on and off Annaswamy Mudaliar Road, are hoping last month’s bitter experience when basements of their houses and apartments were flooded may end soon. On Saturday, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta and his officials inspected the area. The BBMP chief instructed officials to address the issue of waterlogging, complete work on the side drains and clean up small drains immediately. He also told officials to start white topping work on the road. As a first step, the storm water drain stretching from Dickenson Road to Ulsoor Road will be cleaned. Also, work on side drains will be speeded up. White topping of Annaswamy Mudaliar Road is pending for a stretch of 150-metre and officials have been asked to wrap it up soon. The storm water drain near Gurdwara Road too will be cleaned up to enable smooth flow of water. Kodamdaram Layout, off Annaswamy Mudaliar Road, was flooded after heavy rainIn July-end, heavy rain that lasted for 10 minutes resulted in massive waterlogging on Annaswamy Mudaliar Road and stretches branching off it. Water had gushed into the basements of several houses and apartments of Kodandram Layout, off the road. “I travel regularly on Old Madras Road. When it rains, Gurdwara Road, Begum Mahal Circle and Ulsoor Lake Road get flooded, making it very difficult to drive. As potholes and speed-breakers are not visible, accidents are common,’’ said Kusuma Shetty, an entrepreneur from Indiranagar. Several locals, though, are unhappy that they were in the dark about Gupta’s visit and could not discuss their problems with him. V Purushotam, convener of Halasuru Rising, an RWA, said: “We had raised the issue with the jurisdictional joint commissioner many times but it was of no use,” he added. According to locals, waterlogging of roads is common in the area but the problem of basements getting flooded started only after white topping work on Annaswamy Mudaliar Road began. “Flooding has now become common whenever it rains in our area. Waterlogging makes it impossible to step out. Rainwater even enters many houses,” Purushottam said. Youth falls into river, missingA youth from Chowkahalli village near Bidadi is suspected to have been washed away after he accidentally fell into Vrishbhavathi river on Saturday night. Kaushik Reddy, 26, was walking near a bridge over the river at 10pm when he slipped into the gushing waters. Bidadi police suspect he was washed away and said a rescue team is yet to trace his body. Search operation will resume on Monday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-chief-orders-drain-works-to-end-ulsoor-flooding/articleshow/85160708.cms||---
---||Agra||Bengal historians’ body opposes 'malicious distortion’ of university syllabus||Agra: After the Indian History Congress (IHC) and academics from JNU and AMU, the Paschimbanga Itihas Samsad, a body of 3,000 historians from West Bengal, has registered its protest against the changes in how history will be taught, calling it an “uninformed and malicious political intervention”. The Learning Outcomes based Curriculum Framework, adopted on June 24, says it would remove “references to un-historical facts and distortions about national heroes” from university syllabus. The West Bengal historians’ body said the planned measures “are rather mischievous and misplaced in their thrust and design.” “(It) promotes reading lists that are mostly out of date by almost half a century or more and implicitly denies the relevance of scholarly innovations,” its resolution, adopted on July 24, said. “Important themes such as Mughal history and Dalit politics have been thoroughly marginalised and scholarly rigour has been done away with in the ideologically charged presentation of the history of Harappan Civilization, defying without substantiation, existing historiographical and methodological documents.” Professors from JNU and AMU had last week opposed the changes as “agenda-driven”, TOI had reported. Vice-president of the Bengal historians’ body, Susnata Das, told TOI it was a step to “saffronise” education. “Internationally recognised historians like Romila Thapar, Brajadulal Chattopadhyay and Irfan Habib, who have been studied and taught by generations of professional historians, have either been deliberately excluded or made non-essential by (the proposed curriculum),” he said. The resolution also spoke of planned changes in school syllabus and said they were unnecessary. “The Paschimbanga Itihas Samsad is of the opinion that though pedagogic reforms are needed from time to time, they have to be necessitated by scholarly developments and departures within the discipline and not by state diktat,” it said. “Moreover, school textbook reforms, by virtue of their sensitive nature, should be steered … by one or more recognized committees comprising historians … (It) cannot be delegated to politicians or bureaucrats or self-proclaimed practitioners of the discipline.” The IHC, India’s largest body of historians, had earlier objected to the planned overhaul of history textbooks for school students. “The IHC is much disturbed at the misinformation and biased view that is being projected in the name of bringing reforms in the existing NCERT textbooks,” it had said in a letter to the Rajya Sabha secretariat, which had notified the changes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bengal-historians-body-opposes-malicious-distortion-of-university-syllabus/articleshow/85159420.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

According to Prof Sinha , the college has about 65% girl students on the rolls. However, the college has now decided to hold full-fledged offline classses from Monday. “Unless the entire campus is free, it is not possible to hold classes. However, students including girls are eager to attend regular classes, he said adding, “The SSB personnel had occupied the entire portion of the building adjacent to the girls’ common room.” According to the principal, these forces are using all amenities of the college for the past four months incurring an electricity bill of about Rs 70,000 so far. “The college has written to the district administration and local administration of Naubatpur to get the college campus vacated at the earliest, but nothing has been done so far,” the principal said adding, “Guardians and students are putting pressure on the college authorities to start offline classes soon as university examinations are to be held next month.” However, SSB commandant Ajit Singh said that armed personnel have already started leaving the college campus. The SSB forces are now in possession of one or two rooms of the college, which will be soon vacated, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/naubatpur-college-to-start-offline-classes-from-today/articleshow/85157864.cms||Kumod Verma

The intensity of the tremors was recorded on the Richter scale as 3.0, 2.7 and 2.3. Seismology experts said mild tremors have been felt in the region over the last seven days. Meanwhile, irrigation officials fixed the damaged gate at the Pulichintala project and started filling up the dam again. About 40,000 million cubic feet (TMC) of water had to be emptied from the reservoir to fix gate no. 16 that had snapped while being lifted to release water in the wee hours of Thursday. The Pulichintala project was at full reservoir level at the time of the incident. Engineering experts had to reduce the water level below the crest gates to fix a stop-lock gate. As the project continued to receive inflows from upstream, it took about 72 hours to start gate fixing works. On Saturday morning, the stop-lock gate fixing works commenced as the water level reduced to 5 TMC. Engineers fixed the stop-lock gate in place of the damaged gate. With works completed on Sunday morning and water leakage arrested, the reservoir was filled again after closing all gates. The Pulichintala project is receiving inflows of about 40,000 cusecs and current storage stands at 7 TMC against the full reservoir level of 45 TMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gate-no-16-fixed-at-pulichintala-project-dam-filled-with-water/articleshow/85160103.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: IGI Airport to debut full-body scanners soon||NEW DELHI: Full-body scanners, which were to be installed at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport by April 2020, could be made operational in the next couple of months if footfall continues to increase. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which tested a German body scanner in February 2020, said out of two technologies — backscatter X-ray and millimetre wave technology — the latter had been selected owing to lesser radiation being emitted from it. However, the pandemic had delayed the installation, which was a “top priority” currently. A senior CISF official told TOI that the technology was considered after all possible faults from the testing phase as well as radiation concerns were addressed. Several adjustments were made and the final technology was approved by Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) last year. “It remains a top priority for CISF to cover all airports with this technology. Delhi and Mumbai will see installation first, followed by other airports. The technology has been approved and possible flaws have been fixed,” said the official. The scanners would be installed in coordination with the airport operator, Delhi International Airport Limited. Another official, who was involved in the testing process, said an increase in footfall was required to begin installation as the move would not be economical for now. Last year, 69 “precise” body scanners were approved for installation at IGI Airport. Officials said the figure was unchanged, but fewer machines could be installed initially. “It will be expensive to install all of them at the moment as footfall is low. But we may begin the process soon,” added the CISF official. A senior airport official said they had been coordinating with different agencies and meetings for body scanners were held even last year to finalise the installation process. “Covid-19 and closure of air operations slowed the process,” added the official. In June 2019, BCAS had asked 84 major airports in the country to install body scanners in the next two years. However, IGI and five other airports had been asked to carry out the process by April 2020. In a notification, the specifications for each full-body scanner and the protocol to be followed with passengers were also issued. In the tests carried out in January and February 2020, the new machine was found to be fairly effective in capturing minute details, but it faced problems in identifying items around the ankle. CISF said that problem was fixed later. In 2017, CISF had carried out trials with a full-body scanner from the US. However, that machine had problems, particularly with women wearing sarees. Officials said the scanner was also unable to reliably detect items below the knee. Over 10,000 passengers were tested during this trial. The current door-frame detectors would remain in place for wheelchair-bound passengers and those who cannot physically pass through the full-body scanners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/igi-to-debut-full-body-scanners-soon/articleshow/85163550.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Around 97% inmates lodged at Naini Central Jail, including hardcore criminals and terrorists, have put their chequered pasts and trysts with law behind, and have already taken Covid vaccine so far. The statistics shared by Naini Central Jail in Prayagraj on Sunday reveal that 4,086 inmates, including 3,935 males and 151 females, have taken their jabs till Sunday. There are 4,213 inmates, including 4,052 male and 161 female, in the central jail. Senior jail superintendent P N Pandey told TOI, “Till now, 4,086 inmates, including 4,086 males and 151 females, have been given first dose. We have set a target to immunize all 4,213 inmates, including 4,052 males and 161 females. Only eight male inmates are left for first dose, while 950 males and 65 female inmates have also taken second dose and are fully vaccinated.” Higher authorities review vaccination of inmates on frequent intervals since new inmates keep arriving while others lodged ones leave premises after getting bail, added Pandey. For now, as many as 2,963 inmates, including 2,882 males and 81 females, are left for second dose that will be given on the scheduled dates. Apart from vaccination, jail authorities have also taken all corrective measures to check the spread of coronavirus in premises and conduct tests on routine basis. Total 121 inmates had tested positive for coronavirus infection in the second wave, but now there was no positive cases. As many as 531 inmates were found Covid positive in both first and second waves. The infected inmates were treated at the Covid care centre inside the jail and all got cured and no deaths took place. “We are still taking all precautions. The undertrials brought here are first kept in a temporary jail on the premises. Their rapid antigen tests are conducted, and they are taken inside main prison only if they test negative. Any inmate testing positive is kept at Covid care centre in the jail. When a positive inmate tests negative, he/she is put in quarantine barrack for 14 days,” said the jail superintendent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/no-naysayers-no-hesitancy-97inmates-of-naini-jail-vaccinated/articleshow/85163824.cms||---

The details in the application should match those on the lists sent by the schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/student-bus-passes-from-today/articleshow/85160228.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid effect on Kolkata roads: Two-wheeler sales may be highest in 5 years||KOLKATA: Two-wheeler sales in Kolkata this year are likely to be the highest in the last five years. By July-end, it had already crossed the 10,000 mark. And, if the current rate of registration continues, it will surpass 20,000 by the end of this year, said transport department officers. The average annual sale of two-wheelers is 15,000+. However, in the last three years, the sale has crossed 17,000 in the city. Car sales in the city are also poised to overtake last year’s figure. The Public Vehicles Department, which is the regional transport authority (RTA) for the city, had 10,634 two-wheelers registered by July-end. In 2020, 17,459 were registered. Since the real sale of personalised vehicles picks up from August-end and continues till January, they are hopeful that two-wheeler registrations will cross 20,000. The highest registration of two-wheelers had been 19,409 in 2019. The car registration figure in Kolkata is poised to surpass that of 2020. By July-end, 7,219 cars were registered compared to 8,843 in 2020. “This spurt in registration of new two-wheelers and cars, however, defies logic. The economy is in doldrums and petrol price is hovering around Rs 103-Rs 104 a litre,” said a transport department official. “This is largely the effect of pandemic-related restrictions. The pandemic fears are pushing people towards using personal vehicles more,” said transport expert Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). The decline in registration of passenger vehicles is also significant. Only 153 light passenger vehicles (16-seater) were registered compared to the average 3,000 in pre-pandemic times. Similarly, just 17 medium passenger vehicles (mini-buses) were registered against 80 in pre-pandemic years, and only one omni-bus was registered. In the luxury cab sector, which includes app cabs, the decline is sharp as well. Only 87 of them were registered compared to an average of 3,000 in a pre-pandemic year. “This spate of personal vehicle purchases can aggravate congestion and toxic air pollution further. Steps need to be taken to scale up deployment of well-integrated and safe modern bus systems, and reformed Metro and tram services with improved last-mile connectivity. This needs to be supported by targeted and time-bound implementation of electrification of vehicle fleets. In fact, two-wheelers can be mandated for targeted electrification for a quicker makeover to zero emission,” Roychowdhury said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-effect-on-kolkata-roads-2-wheeler-sales-may-be-highest-in-five-years/articleshow/85160758.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The researchers studied 18 out of 20 individuals who were mistakenly given Covishield as the first jab and Covaxin as the second in Uttar Pradesh in April-May. The individuals’ blood samples were analysed at different stages for 60 to 70 days after vaccination. “The mix-and-match of Covishield and Covaxin as first and second dose provoked a superior immune response than two doses of either Covishield or Covaxin,” said senior ICMR scientist Rajni Kant, the study’s chief investigator. Coronavirus live updatesThis is the first report of mixed immunisation using an adenovirus vector-based Covishield and an inactivated whole viri-on-based Covaxin in hum-ans that has demonstrated safety and significantly improved immune response . The findings are important as experts have asked if Covishield and Covaxin doses can be mixed to get around supply shortages. Currently, deliberate mixing of the two vaccines is not advised. Read AlsoDriven by rural India boost, daily vaccination gathers pace in AugNEW DELHI: Daily vaccinations have picked up in August with an average of 51.45 lakh doses per day in the week July 31-Aug 6, up over 27% from 40.31 lakh doses a day a fortnight ago (July 17-23) with a high uptake in rural areas. Vaccination has averaged at around 48.25 lakh doses in the previousThe findings could also have a significant bearing on the Covid-19 vaccination programme — a heterologous (mix-and-match) approach to immunisation could pave the way for strat-egies that provide better pr-otection against variants. But to conclusively prove these findings, the ICMR researchers said a multicentre randomized controlled trial would be needed. Read AlsoMaharashtra allows travel in local train from Aug 15 to those fully vaccinatedA week before Independence Day, August 15, the chief minister, while addressing the state through social media, made an announcement of allowing travel by local trains. BJP in Mumbai held a strong protest last Friday, demanding allowing local trains for the general public, who are fully vaccinated.A vaccine’s immunogenicity is the ability of a foreign substance, such as vaccine-induced antigen (virus particles), to provoke an immune response. Kant said, “The immunogenicity profile against Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants in the group that received Covishield and Covaxin was superior. The IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody response of the participants were also significantly higher compared to that in homologous groups, in which participants had received two doses of either Covishield or Covaxin.” Another investigator in the study, senior scientist Pragya Yadav of the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, said, “The findings suggest that immunisation with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine (Covishield) followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine (Covaxin) is not only safe, but also elicits better immunogenicity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/study-covishield-and-covaxin-jabs-mix-match-safe-in-maharashtra/articleshow/85165067.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The victim was identified as Munna Sah (25), a daily wager. The man who fell ill was identified as Nawal Kishore Choudhary (50), who runs a general store in the village. Police said Choudhary is undergoing treatment at Patna Medical College and Hospital. Vaishali SP Maneesh said Sah’s biological samples were preserved during post-mortem for forensic analysis. He, however, said only forensic report would confirm whether the two had consumed hooch or not. “Police are investigating the reason for Choudhary’s illness. A team will visit PMCH to inquire,” he said, adding Sah was not well for three days and that he was also taken to a doctor for treatment. SHO of Mahua police station Krishnanand Jha said Sah’s family told police that he had fallen ill after consuming hooch. “Post-mortem was conducted at sadar hospital. Viscera has been preserved for further analysis and investigation,” he said. Jha said raids were conducted in Mukundpur and five empty liquor bottles were recovered from the house of one Kamlesh Choudhary on Sunday. “He fled by the time police raided his house,” the SHO said. Sources said four people, including Sah, had consumed liquor together on August 3 night and all of them had fallen ill. “Two of these people died in Bidupur on August 6. Their families said they died of diarrhoea and other complications. No action could be taken as bodies were already cremated and families outrightly denied liquor consumption,” the sources added. At least 53 people have died due to suspected hooch consumption since January this year in dry Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hooch-suspected-as-man-dies-in-vaishali/articleshow/85156886.cms||Debashish Karmakar

There are 9,361 higher secondary and secondary schools in Bihar, out of which 2,948 middle schools have been upgraded to secondary schools to admit students from the academic session 2020-21. In these upgraded schools, a survey would be conducted for providing necessary facilities to ensure education up to class XII. Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary (education), said the survey would help the department identify such institutes which lack the required infrastructure so that to plan accordingly to upgrade and build additional classrooms to accommodate more students and other facilities like libraries, laboratories, playground and toilets. “Several schools have been upgraded from middle to secondary level and from secondary to higher secondary level. All these institutes have to be surveyed. Depending on the availability of land and condition of the existing buildings, plan for the refurbishment will be made. We have achieved the target of providing high school in all panchayats in the state. Now, it is extremely important that every high school in panchayats have required facilities, so that students will not have to go to other village or drop from school,” Sanjay told this newspaper on Sunday. He added: “The survey will be done by the end of this month. Based on the report, the department will draw a plan for strengthening and refurbishing the infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade all the schools within a year, but the detail will help us do it accordingly. Priority will be given to such institutes which lack infrastructure.” The Bihar Education Project Council has also asked the district education officers (DEOs) to conduct survey and collect information from government schools on various parameters, including enrolment of students (as on September 30, 2020), infrastructure -- number of buildings, status, condition, number of classrooms, scope of expansion and year of construction, and availability of land among other things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-edu-dept-to-conduct-survey-to-upgrade-schools/articleshow/85158119.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Ganga still above danger level in Patna||PATNA: The rising trend of the water level in the Ganga that was witnessed at Allahabad and Varanasi on Saturday caused its effect in Bihar on Sunday, as the river water crossed the danger level at Buxar and maintained steady rising trend all along its downstream up to Kahalgaon and beyond. However, the flood scenario in the state is unlikely to worsen as the water discharge through most rivers in north and south Bihar, including Punpun and Sone, was a tame affair. The Ganga was flowing 12cm below the danger level at Buxar on Saturday, but the water level crossed the red mark by 11cm by 2 pm on Sunday. Similarly, in Patna, the Ganga was flowing 27cm above the danger level at Digha, 85cm at Gandhi Ghat and 76cm at Hathidah. Further, along the downstream, the water level was hovering around the danger level, but showing rising trend in Munger and Bhagalpur. It was flowing 51cm above the danger level at Kahalgaon. The Central Water Commission (CWC) bulletin said the water levels will increase at all the places along the downstream of the Ganga from Buxar on Monday. Significantly, the water level in the Ganga started falling from Sunday at Allahabad and Varanasi, implying that the rising trend will sustain in the Bihar stretch of the river for the next couple of days only, as the water discharge through Kosi at Birpur was around 1.27 lakh cusecs. Through the Valmikinagar barrage across Gandak, the water discharge has fallen drastically to 97,500 cusecs. Only Mahanada was showing the rising trend due to rainfall in its catchment areas of Nepal and its Bihar basin. Besides, the water level in all other rivers – Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla and Punpun – was below the danger level at most places. The water level in the north and south Bihar rivers might rise slightly for two days after Monday, as the basins of the rivers are expected to receive light to moderate rainfall in Nepal and Bihar. Meanwhile, the water resources department flood bulletin said the Dagmara marginal bund, which was breached early this month, has been fully plugged. “The strengthening of the bund is in progress,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-still-above-danger-level-in-patna/articleshow/85158438.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Amaravati||Aided schools and colleges to no longer receive Andhra Pradesh govt funds||AMARAVATI: Moving ahead with its intent to take over aided educational institutions, the state government has decided to stop release of grants to all aided schools and colleges. The government issued an ordinance to regulate financial assistance to aided educational institutions. The government incorporated a subsection in section 46 of the Andhra Pradesh Education Act, 1982, to withhold, reduce or withdraw any grant payable to an educational institution with regard to the funds at the disposal of the government. The government would also take action against the institutions that have failed to comply with the rules, regulations and codes in force, after giving an opportunity to the manager of the institution concerned to make a representation. “You pay salaries and run the institutions. Else, allow us to run the institutions and pay the salaries. How could you run the show while making us pay?” is said to be the government’s poser to the aided managements. The government had directed managements of aided educational institutions either to run their institutions on their own or hand them over to the government. The government made it clear it would not be possible to continue funding while giving the management rights to private individuals. “Many aided educational institutions are not keen to develop and manage them in a proper way despite getting funds from the government towards salaries of the teachers and non-teaching staff. The enrolment in aided schools and colleges is drastically coming down due to the failure of the managements,” said a senior official. He said that it was not wise to allow dual control over the educational institutions in the interests of the students. Sources said that many of the aided educational institutions have been resisting the move to take over the management control citing value of property schools and colleges own. The managements are alleging that the government was trying to usurp the properties in the name of management control. Sources said assets, particularly vacant lands, where the aided schools and colleges located are worth several thousands of crores. MLCs from teachers’ constituencies have opposed the move to take over aided schools and colleges that were established by freedom fighters and philanthropists. Sources said that about 2,300 schools and nearly 700 colleges are functioning the under aided institutional category. These institutions together have a strength of over two lakh students. “This might result in closure of many institutions that have been serving students from economically backward classes. It will also create panic among hundreds of teaching and non-teaching staff about continuance of their services,” said S Ramakrishna, president, Municipal Teachers Federation (MTF).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/aided-schools-and-colleges-to-no-longer-receive-govt-funds/articleshow/85160068.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Bihar: Woman killed for cleaning mattress in neighbourhood||PATNA: A woman was allegedly beaten to death for cleaning a mattress infested with bedbugs in front of her neighbour’s house at village Kenasarai under Mufassil police station area in Nawada on Saturday night. The woman, identified as Girija Devi, 35, was rushed to a hospital but succumbed to her injuries after undergoing treatment there for several hours. The prime accused in the case, Chandrika Choudhary (40), was arrested on Sunday. Though police claimed the incident took place for extracting bedbugs from her mattress in front of Chandrika’s house, media reports quoted Girija’s husband Arjun Choudhary said she was beaten for protesting liquor consumption by the accused. Nawada Sadar SDPO Upendra Prasad said the preliminary inquiry revealed that the bedbug issue led to her thrashing and subsequent death. The SPDO said he has come to know that Girija’s husband has recorded his statement to police on Sunday evening on the basis of which an FIR would be registered. However, the SDPO said he was not aware about the allegations made by Arjun against Chandrika and other accused. Mufassil police station SHO Lal Bihari Paswan said Chandrika’s two sons and his wife are evading arrest in connection with the killing. He said the incident took place at around 4.30pm and the woman died at around 8pm. “On getting information, police reached the spot but the woman had already been rushed to the hospital. Probably, she might have received serious internal injuries,” he said. He said the body has been sent for conducting a postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-killed-for-cleaning-mattress-in-neighbourhood/articleshow/85156913.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The health wing of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and ward secretariats have initiated weekly door-to-door surveys as part of preparedness in the event of a third wave of Covid-19. The district registered 1.1 lakh Covid-19 cases till Saturday with a positivity rate below 2%. The district is registering around 200 new Covid-19 cases on average per day and a majority of them are from Vijayawada city and Vijayawada rural. Officials who are carrying out Covid-19 tests have decided to conduct a weekly fever survey in Vijayawada for early detection of cases. Volunteers and health workers are directed to interact with families allocated to them every week and enquire about their health. Fever cases are to be reported immediately and Covid-19 tests performed on time. District collector J Nivas said, “Early detection of cases and quarantine are main elements to prevent the rapid spread of Covid-19. We successfully implemented a similar system at Srikakulam. Covid-19 usually spreads fast in urban areas with crowds. Vijayawada turned out to be a major hub for Covid-19 in the second wave. We don’t want the same to happen in future. Fever survey should be strictly done.” The administration is also focusing on increasing bed strength at private hospitals. Joint collector L Siva Shankar is inspecting hospitals and enquiring about oxygen supplies and the possibility of adding ICU beds. The health wing is imposing fines on hospitals found flouting Covid-19 guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fever-survey-taken-up-in-vij-to-guard-against-third-wave/articleshow/85160037.cms||Venu Lanka

He said Amaravati will be developed along with other regions in the state and asked farmers not to get carried away by the false campaign promoted by TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu. Speaking to the media here on Sunday, Kannababu said the state would shortly get three capital cities and there is no going back on the issue. He wondered why TDP leaders were opposing the development of north-coastal region and Rayalaseema. “TDP should come out in open that it is in favour of development of north-coastal region and Rayalaseema if it wanted Amaravati as single capital city,” he said. The minister added that Naidu had deceived Amaravati farmers for five years when he was in power. He continues to mislead them now, said Kannababu. He said that Naidu and his son Lokesh were unable to learn any lessons from the verdict of the people in the recent local bodies’ elections and Tirupati by-election. The minister suggested Naidu reach out to people of all regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/min-slams-tdp-for-misleading-amaravati-farmers/articleshow/85160136.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Footfall at private hospital fever clinics double in a week||KOLKATA: The crowd at fever clinics — launched by several private hospitals to screen, test and treat Covid suspects prior to admission — has swelled over the last week, indicating a rise in number of affected patients. Footfall at these clinics has doubled at some hospitals, forcing some to increase the number of doctors and nurses. Peerless Hospital has been receiving 50-60 patients at its fever clinic daily for the last week. It had dropped to less than 15 after the second wave ebbed. “We have five doctors who attend these clinics, depending on the patient flow. Patients with pronounced symptoms are tested for Covid through an RT-PCR test and prescribed medicines. Since all reports are not available in less than 24 hours, those seeking admission are taken to an isolated non-Covid ward. Those testing positive are then shifted to the Covid section and the rest to general beds,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipto Mitra. Belle Vue Clinic, too, has seen a sudden spurt in patients reporting at their fever clinic with temperature. While the number would be two-three a day till July, this month it has been 12 a day on an average. “We have two doctors and eight nurses posted at our emergency department. A rapid antigen test is done immediately and if the result is positive, the patient is advised admission. An RT-PCR test is still done for further confirmation. We expect a further rise in numbers and may have to depute more doctors,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. AMRI Hospitals have seen a marginal rise in attendance across its three centres. “We do a CBNAAT test and other tests if a patient reports with symptoms. In some cases, we even do a CT scan. Those testing positive or with pronounced symptoms are advised admission but such cases remain low,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Many, especially those with mild symptoms, are refusing admission even after testing positive, said Mitra. “Most of these are young or middle-aged with low-grade fever and mild cough and cold, that can be treated at home. Many are vaccinated and prefer guidance and prescription from our doctors than admission,” added Mitra. Belle Vue, too, has arranged for screening of home patients through video calls. “Infections are still largely mild and most can be treated at home. Till the number of severe cases rise, clinics should be relatively empty,” said Belle Vue internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. At CMRI Hospital, though, the fever clinic remains shut. But it will have to be eventually opened by mid-September, felt pulmonologist Raja Dhar. “Cases are trickling in. Due to vaccination, infection remains mild and manageable at home. So, we are getting frequent calls for long-distance web consultations. As this trend continues, there would be more patients with symptoms visiting hospital, may be, a month from now and the clinic will have to be revived,” said Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/footfall-at-pvt-hosp-fever-clinics-double-in-a-week/articleshow/85160807.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||After e-buses, West Bengal Transport Corporation set to roll out CNG vehicles with flexible-fuel option||KOLKATA: After running electric buses successfully, West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) is set to introduce five buses retrofitted with compressed natural gas (CNG) engines, apart from their existing diesel engines. These buses can switch to diesel, if CNG is not available. Apart from reducing the carbon footprint, the use of CNG will also lead to savings on costlier diesel. WBTC ran buses on trial with CNG, a cleaner fuel, after Bengal Gas Company Limited (BGCL) set up a CNG dispensing station at its Kasba depot. “The CNG kit was retrofitted with old BS-II buses and the trial run was successful. The buses will retain diesel engines, with BGCL supplying CNG in caskets. Once the CNG pipeline is ready and the supply is steady, we may do away with diesel engines in phases,” said a WBTC official. “We are focusing on electric buses and now CNG so that Kolkata can become greener and cleaner,” said transport minister Firhad Hakim. He reiterated that the state transport department has taken various steps for e-buses earlier. “Now steps are being taken for CNG buses. There will be a significant reduction in vehicular pollution with the introduction of CNG fleet in Kolkata and saving fuel cost to the extent of 25-30%,” said Hakim. According to WBTC sources, two fuel tanks will be used — 40% CNG and 60% diesel. WBTC installed dual fuel kit —each worth Rs1.5 lakh —in five buses at Belgharia depot through a private agency. This is cheaper when compared to the expensive CNG engine that costs Rs 5 lakh per bus. South Bengal Transport Corporation (SBSTC) also adopted the same technique for some of its buses. However, the trial of flex-fuel — the use of diesel when the bus is in first and second gear and automatically switches to CNG in higher gear — had some troubles like knocking and other problems with the engine. “Frequent gear changing on the city roads with different fuels like diesel and CNG may cause engine knocking due to random change of fuel and resultant fall of fuel pressure in combustion engine. The hybrid system necessitates software logistics to strike the crucial balance,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an engine combustion expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-e-buses-wbtc-set-to-roll-out-cng-vehicles-with-flexi-fuel-option/articleshow/85161175.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has ordered the area DCP and joint commissioner to take action. Many of the people raising the slogans have been identified and teams were conducting raids to nab them, said an official. The prime suspects are Uttam Malik, Vineet alias Kranti, Dipak Singh and Bhupender Tomar, who goes by the aliases of Pinky Chaudhary and Pinky Bhaiya, said an officer. The objectionable slogans were raised at an event against “colonial laws” which was held near Jantar Mantar. The police said they had not granted any permission for the protest which was called by lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay, a former BJP spokesperson. Upadhyay is also likely to face action, an officer added. The man wearing an orange kurta in the video has been identified as Malik. Dipak Singh belongs to northeast Delhi while Pinky Bhaiya is from Ghaziabad. He was earlier involved in an attempt to assault CM Arvind Kejriwal and also took responsibility for the violence at JNU last year. He belongs to a group called Hindu Raksha Dal. Upadhyay has claimed that he did not raise the offensive slogans and that the incident did not happen till the time he was there. In a video message, Upadhyay said: “If the videos are correct, then the police must investigate. Neither do I know the people seen in the video, nor did I call any of them. In fact, till the time I was there, no sloganeering happened. I think the videos were made to defame our protest. If at all the videos are fake, then it must be propaganda and the police must investigate." "I have filed a complaint. I also appeal to the government to take strict action against people who spread disharmony. Their properties should be seized and they should be given longer jail terms," he added. Deepak Yadav, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), said: “A case under section 188 for violation of Covid guidelines, 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth) as well as other sections of IPC has been registered. Some of the people seen in the video have been identified." Jaspal Singh, Joint CP New Delhi Range added that raids were being carried out to nab them. Meanwhile, Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan has written to Delhi Police demanding Upadhyay's arrest. He said that stringent sections like NSA or UAPA would have been slapped had the perpetrators been from other communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jantar-mantar-slogans-cops-filefir-conduct-raids-to-nab-culprits/articleshow/85195330.cms||---

The woman from Amroha's Didauli has alleged that she was raped for two months and has filed a complaint against six persons, including the main accused, at Didauli police station. The woman approached the police on Saturday and narrated her ordeal. According to police, a case has been registered against the accused under relevant sections of IPC and a probe is on. The woman claimed the Sambhal-based man was her college classmate. They fell in love and their engagement was fixed five months ago. The man's family demanded a car and Rs 5 lakh in dowry which broke off the engagement. The complaint states, "Two months ago, the man and his family took me away while I was on my way to a bank. I was taken to a temple in Sambhal district and forcibly married. The man's family phoned my parents and told them that things were okay. My family did not file any complaint. However, the man and his family soon started to torture me and assaulted me several times. On August 5, the man threw me near my village in a semi-conscious state." When contacted, Didauli SHO Mohit Chaudhary said, "We have registered a case against six persons - the man, his brothers, his parents - for abducting and raping the woman.

Dasu Suresh, the Chairman of national weavers united joint action committee, an umbrella of 24 weavers’ welfare associations, on Sunday, also appealed to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India, NV Ramana to see that the struggles of the weaver community are not increased due to the fake handlooms being sold in the market. All the violations of the Handloom Reservation Act, 1985—which is a major cause of handloom workers’ suicides—were brought to the notice of the CJI. “Handloom workers’ suicides are increasing rapidly as power loom garments are being sold in the name of handloom products by the shopping malls with the help of famous movie stars,” said Suresh. Responding to the appeal, the chief justice gave assurance to the weavers that he would look into the matter and soon provide possible assistance to the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/appeal-to-cji-to-look-into-fake-handloom/articleshow/85165060.cms||---
---||Kochi||Police questioning Bihar natives||Kochi: On Sunday evening, SIT probing the murder of dental house surgeon Manasa at Kothamangalam, brought the Bihar natives who were arrested in the case to Kochi. The accused were taken to district police (Ernakulam rural) headquarters in Aluva for interrogation. Police are hoping to glean more information about the shooter’s (Rakhil) activities in Bihar by questioning them. The men from Bihar were arrested for allegedly supplying the weapon used for killing Manasa. Rakhil had killed himself after killing her. SIT also recovered a video in which one of the accused can be seen holding a pistol which looks similar to the country-made pistol used for the crime. The accused can be seen taking out the magazine and reloading the pistol. He was seen firing the weapon as if to demonstrate its effectiveness. Police are investigating if they supplied similar pistols to other people in state. The arrested persons were identified as Sonu Kumar (20), a resident of Parsando village in Munger and Maneesh Kumar (23) of Buxar. Police had found that it was Sonu who provided the country-made pistol with which the murder was committed. Maneesh acted as the intermediary between Rakhil and Sonu. As per preliminary probe, the pistol was reportedly purchased for Rs 35,000. Police sources said Rakhil was given training in using the firearm by the arrested persons. The arrests were made following a two-day-long joint operation with Bihar police. Police had approached the accused as potential buyers. The accused had resisted arrest, were overpowered and taken into custody on Saturday. Police also sought the help of a friend of Rakhil to conduct an investigation in Bihar, sources added. Earlier, a ballistic examination of the firearm confirmed it to be a 7.62mm country-made pistol. On July 29, Manasa (24) was shot dead by Rakhil at Kothamangalam where she was staying at a rented home. Police later received a statement from Rakhil’s friend in Kannur that he had accompanied him to Bihar and had stayed there for over 10 days. It is this detail that made the police ascertain that the gun must have been procured from Bihar. The woman and the assailant met each other on Instagram. In an informal meeting with the Kannur assistant commissioner nearly a month before the attack, Rakhil had assured that he will not try to contact Manasa again. It seems he went to Bihar after this meeting, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-questioning-bihar-natives/articleshow/85161124.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Saturday morning saw wide-spread panic buying of fuel after some petrol pumps in Howrah and northern suburbs of the city went dry. Tanker movement was normal. and most fuel stations in Howrah, Hooghly and Kolkata functioned normally, an IOC source said. Queues, a common sight at retail outlets across the city on Saturday, were absent on Sunday, a West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association spokesperson said. Fuel supply from the Mourigram depot suffered a setback after private oil tankers snapped the supplyline by refusing to carry fuel to retailers. They demanded withholding of the new tender which led to reduction of fare and termination of services of 70 tankers. When IOC agreed to withhold the tender, the tankers association withdrew the strike.

Two of her friends, who also got swept away in the river, remain missing. KM Singh Bhandari, SHO, Muni-ki-Reti police station, told TOI, “The girl’s body was found in the middle of Ganga in the Gauri Mafi region of Raiwala. Our teams are searching for the other two youths — Apoorva Kelkar and Melroy Dante — both from Mumbai — who were also swept away.” The three youths were part of a five-member group — all students of Thakur Polytechnic in Kandivali East — that came to Rishikesh on vacation on August 1. The friends who were staying in a riverside hotel in Tapovan, went to explore a stretch of Ganga near the property on August 4. While three of them decided to take a swim, the other two — Nisha Goswami and Karan Mishra — stayed at the banks. “It happened so fast. Apoorva had waded deep into the water and slipped. The other two swam towards her and within minutes, all of them were caught in strong currents and disappeared. We couldn’t do anything as there was no one else at the spot,” Karan had told the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/body-of-mumbai-girl-who-drowned-in-ganga-at-rishikesh-found/articleshow/85159485.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Meerut||Delayed payments pinch sugarcane farmers in UP||Meerut: Farmers in the western part of the state that houses a major chunk of UP’s sugar mills have begun to feel the heat as majority of the mills have defaulted on payments due to them. In Muzaffarnagar alone, mills owe Rs 428 crore to cane farmers. Mills in Bijnor owe Rs 532 crore while Shamli which has just three sugar mills and is incidentally home district of UP sugarcane development minister Suresh Rana has Rs 600 crore dues to be paid to farmers. In Saharanpur, mills owe Rs 482 crore to the farmers. The pending dues have also kicked up a political storm as the opposition is not leaving any stone unturned to capitalise on the farmers' resentment in the run-up to UP polls. Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), for instance, has raked up the issue of pending cane dues by protesting at the cane offices of various districts seeking immediate release of the farmers’ payment. Sunil Rohta, RLD’s state spokesperson, said, “The farmer is being battered from all sides. Pending dues, farm laws and rising power tariff – his woes are piling up. There has been no revision of State Advised Price (SAP) for cane for the last three years. And even now, when the crushing season is due to start in October, farmers are still waiting for their last years’ dues.” Farmers said they were financially crippled. Rajan Jawla, a Shamli-based farmer, said, “We give our cane to a local sugar mill, but we have not got our payment of around Rs 8 lakh. This has completely jeopardised our financial status. We are unable to pay our monthly instalments of loans and even school fees of our children.” Jaipal Singh, a farmer in Bijnor, said, “We have no other source of income. I gave my cane to a mill in Bilai in March and I am still waiting for my payment.” When contacted, UP cane commissioner Sanjay R Bhoosareddy said, “At present, the pending dues are close to Rs 5,500 crore. In terms of percentage, we have already paid 79% of the dues pan UP which is a history in itself. Never before have we achieved this figure and that too despite depressed sales performance by the mills owing to Covid pandemic when exports had almost stopped and institutional buying of sugar stocks witnessed considerable drop. We were able to sail through because of ethanol production and even now we are ensuring dispersal of dues on a daily basis.” On the high rate of pendency of dues even in his own home district Shamli, UP's cane minister Suresh Rana told TOI, "I am the cane minister of the entire state and not just Shamli where I belong. The same laws apply to all districts that are applicable in Shamli. I am fully committed to the welfare of farmers and we are inching towards fully paying the farmers what is due to them sooner than later. All defaulting mills have been issued directions to pay before the starting of the next crushing season. I think our farmers are in a much better position than what they were in previous regimes when backlogs on mills were huge and would run into years, crippling farmers in the process." On Wednesday, the Supreme Court sought a reply from the Centre and the state governments regarding the pending dues of sugarcane farmers. A bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramanna issued a notice asking for a response from the sugarcane growing states and Centre and scheduled the matter for a hearing in the next three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/delayed-payments-pinch-sugarcane-farmers-in-up/articleshow/85159480.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Amid questions over flood relief, Sena steps up community work in Konkan||Navi Mumbai: Ahead of the BMC election, the Shiv Sena’s stakes and presence are high in the flood-hit areas of the Konkan, where community work is under way to help victims and their families. The party is facing the dual challenge of keeping Mumbai and Konkan district voters together on its side. Many Mumbai residents have their roots in the Konkan belt. These voters are vital to the Shiv Sena in the upcoming polls.The Shiv Sena has 8 MLAs among the 14 from Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. The Shiv Sena’s traditional voter base lies in the heart of Konkan. Two of the three MLAs from Sindhudurg, three of the four from Ratnagiri and three of the seven from Raigad district belong to the Shiv Sena. Mahad constituency, covering Poladpur taluka in Raigad, a traditional Shiv Sena bastion, has been hit both by floods and landslides. The latest disaster management data till August 5 mentions that over 3,500 people are sheltered in 82 camps. Over 13,000 were evacuated to safer locations.There were 160 dead, two missing and 52 injured in the Konkan during the heavy rainfall. “Most of the affected people are living in very poor condition with the help of relatives. The government assistance is hardly reaching the people,” said Varsha Nake, a Chiplun resident. “Due to poor post-flood management and improper relief work, many have left Mahad for other locations temporarily. This will have a direct political bearing in the ensuing BMC election,” said Chandrakant Kokane, a Mahad resident. “On average, one member from each family in the three districts stays and works in Mumbai. Hence, the influence is felt in their native places as well. Around a third of Mumbai voting is influenced by the Konkan factor,” said Shiv Sena politician Shahu Gujar from Sindhudurg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-amid-questions-over-flood-relief-sena-steps-up-community-work-in-konkan/articleshow/85165325.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Delhi||Email threat over attack hoax, but IGI hikes security||New Delhi: Security has been intensified at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport after a threat email was received by IGI police station, warning of a possible bomb attack by terrorist outfit Al Qaeda. The email, received by Delhi Police on Saturday evening, warned of a bomb that could be used at the airport in the next one to three days. However, the threat was later found to be “non-specific” and the Bomb Threat Assessment Committee, after an intensive search, was terminated from the airport. Sources claim the cops received an email, which stated that “planned bomb blast by Al Qaeda Sargana at IGI airport. Karanbir Suri alias Mohamad Jalal and Karanbir Suri’s wife Shaily Sharda alias Haseena are coming to India on Sunday from Singapore and plan to put the bomb at IGI in 1-3 days (sic).” Immediately, cops alerted the airport officials and the Airport Operations Control Centre, with checks carried out at the premises. Around 7.18pm, the BTAC declared the bomb-threat as “non-specific”. It, however, asked for heightened security to remain on the premises. Officials said an anti-sabotage check was carried out soon after, alongside access control at all terminal points, checking of vehicles on airport premises and increased patrolling and checking at nakas on the access road leading up to the airport. CISF officials said that checks by their quick-reaction teams would continue on the premises owing to the bomb threat, as well as Independence Day. Dog squad was also being put to use, with a bomb detection and disposal squad ready on alert. The Security Operations Control Centre of the airport, on inspection, found that a similar threat message had been received by the airport in March, mentioning similar names and the same threat. Even in March, the threat was declared ‘non-specific’ by BTAC, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/email-threat-over-attack-hoax-but-igi-hikes-security/articleshow/85165072.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand rehab inmates ‘forced into sex’, lured with drugs & assaulted||DEHRADUN: For months, women at a privately run drug rehab in Dehradun were allegedly raped by the centre’s manager while the director, a woman, induced them with drugs. If they objected, they were beaten up with sticks, and made to sit on sharp-edged stools and bricks for hours as “punishment”, the inmates’ families said. On Thursday, around 5.30am, four women inmates locked the director in her room, ran for their lives and reported the case to the police. The rehab’s director has been arrested while the manager is on the run. “I had been at the rehab since May 26 … At the beginning, they treated us well, got us detoxed. When my mom came to visit after a month, I told her the centre is good and I’ll recover,” one of the four women who fled — aged 19, 21, 22 and 26 — told TOI. “One day, I noticed some girls would huddle in groups for two to three hours in the washroom. I would wonder what they were up to.” When she asked, they told her they were getting high. “How did they get drugs at a rehab, I asked them. One of them said I could join … If I had sex with the (manager), he would get me as much smack as I wanted.” She declined. The rehab was set up in February and had 22 inmates — 17 men on the ground floor and five women on the first. For Rs 5,000 a month, those struggling with addiction were supposed to go through de-addiction therapy. The director, Vibha Singh, 48, and manager, Vidyadutt Raturi, 48, had earlier worked at other de-addiction centres, also in Dehradun, and police are now investigating if they were fronts for a similar set-ups. The women were forced into having sex with the promise of drugs, and there were repercussions if they refused. “If anyone objected, the director would give them the ‘stick’, ‘stool’ or ‘brick’ treatment — beat them up with sticks, or make them sit on sharp-edged stools or broken bricks for hours,” said the uncle of another inmate among the four who fled. “These ‘punishments’ were also meted out for other things — washing plates too slowly, speaking too loudly, or complaining about anything.” On Friday, the women filed a complaint with the police. “An FIR was registered and the director arrested for concealing design to commit an offence,” station house officer of Clement Town police station, DS Rautela, said. “The manager is on the run.” Rape charges will be added after medical examination reports come in. One of the reasons such cases are difficult, government officials said, is that private de-addiction centres don’t have any oversight. “We have no guidelines on how they should function. We don’t know how they should operate, the number of rooms or staffers they should have,” said Dehradun district social welfare officer Hemlata Pandey. The rehab the women fled, for instance, had no psychologist or counsellor for the inmates. “But when there are no established rules, we can’t penalise them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rehab-inmates-forced-into-sex-induced-with-drugs-assaulted-if-they-refused/articleshow/85159496.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Kochi||Archbishop joins protests against films hurting belief||Thrissur: Thrissur archbishop Mar Andrews Thazhath, who is also the chairman of the social affairs commission of the Syro-Malabar Church, has come out in the open against the films ‘Easho’ and ‘Keshu Ee Veedinte Nadhan’ saying that the titles hurt the religious sentiments of the Christians. It is for the first time that the Church directly comes out in the open against the films, though some of the associated organizations like Catholic Congress had protested against the films earlier. “The tendency to depict the symbols of virtuousness and religion in bad light has been on the rise in recent days. Market dominance and ascend to power are the motives of those indulging in such depictions, and they also have a communal agenda. The civil society must come out in the open to condemn such acts,” the archbishop said. Mar Thazhath said these films depict Easho (Jesus Christ) in bad light and this was hurting the belief systems and religious sentiments of the thousands of Christians who revere Easho as their God. “It is painful to the Christians, and those who uphold high societal and moral values should question those indulging in such mean actions,” he said in a video statement. Pointing out that Jesus Christ had taught to ‘Love your enemies’, the archbishop said those indulging in such heinous acts could be thinking that His followers will not react even if they are hurt. “But they must remember that Jesus Christ himself had also questioned when he was beaten up for no justified reason,” he said. Director Nadhirshah had earlier clarified that he has no plans to change the title of either ‘Eesho’ or ‘Kesu Ee Veedinte Nadhan’ after controversy erupted over the titles of his films.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/archbishop-joins-protests-against-films-hurting-belief/articleshow/85161190.cms||---

The BMC had to cancel the drive on Wednesday and shut vaccination in nearly 90% of centres on Saturday due to shortage of doses. Civic authorities said the dema-nd is set to rise with complete vaccination becoming a criterion to board local trains. Through August, nearly 9 lakh people will become eligible for the second dose. In addition, an aver-age of 10 lakh people come for first dose. According to CoWin, 19.6 lakh people have taken both doses, which means nearly 21% of the city’s population is fully vaccinated. While nearly 42% (39 lakh people) have taken at least one dose. However, a big chunk of people who have taken vaccines are Mumbai Metropolitan Region residents, so even BMC doesn’t know what percentage of Mumbai’s population is actually inoculated. On Sunday, private centres administered nearly 17,000 doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-drive-at-mumbai-citys-public-centres-to-resume-today/articleshow/85165075.cms||---

At a DDMA meeting held on Friday, officials of the department gave a presentation on the city government’s preparedness for a possible third wave of Covid-19 and the status of vaccination. Officials said around 1.5 crore beneficiaries are eligible for Covid-19 vaccination in the national capital and three crore doses are required to fully inoculate them. More than one crore doses have been administered till August 5. More than 76 lakh people, which is more than 50% of the eligible beneficiaries, have got at least one dose. Nearly two crore doses are still needed. The Centre has allocated 16.79 lakh doses to Delhi for August. At the present rate of vaccine supply, it will take till July/August 2022 to complete two-dose vaccination of all 18+ beneficiaries, the health department officials told DDMA. They said around 45 lakh doses are required every month to complete the vaccination by December 2021. In view of the “short supply of vaccine and a large number of beneficiaries due for the second dose”, the Delhi health department recently issued orders asking district authorities to restrict 20% doses of Covishield and 40% of Covaxin for first shot. According to the Centre’s CoWIN portal, 53.25 lakh doses have been administered to beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group. Over 33 lakh jabs have been given to people in the 45-60 years category.  Meanwhile, a total of 1,19,785 Covid vaccines were administered in the national capital on Saturday, Delhi government said in its vaccination bulletin on Sunday.

VC Ashok Mittal has filed a writ petition in Allahabad high court. Terming the action against him as one-sided, he alleged that he was not given a chance to make a clarification over “unsubstantiated” allegations levelled against him. After “serious complaints” of alleged financial and administrative irregularities, governor of Uttar Pradesh Anandiben Patel on July 5 had “detached” Agra university VC from "all his duties" and ordered a probe. A three-member judicial inquiry headed by a retired justice was set up by the governor to investigate corruption charges against Mittal. The probe, which was targeted to be completed within one month, is still pending. According to the official declaration made by the office of the governor, “Serious complaints of corruption, administrative and financial irregularities were received at the office of the governor against VC Ashok Mittal. The VC had come unprepared and was not able to provide satisfactory answers during the review meeting on June 2.” Some of the specific reasons cited by the office of the governor for acting against the VC include recruitments made in violation of norms, non-compliance on audit objections, lack of adequate advocacy and required action in matters pending with the high court, delay in providing degree certificates to the students, unnecessarily providing overtime remuneration to the employees and lackadaisical approach towards responsibilities of a VC. Mittal said, “I was not given a chance to tender a formal clarification over the false allegations levelled against me. All the complaints against me were made with mala fide intention by a local lawyer. Earlier, the varsity's top decision-making body, the executive council, had removed him from the legal panel after he was found to be involved in malpractices. Seeking justice, I have filed a petition in the high court". A senior professor of economics at Aligarh Muslim University, Ashok Mittal was appointed as VC of Agra university in February 2020 for three years. The 65-year-old former student of Agra university has a teaching experience of over 45 years and has done research work for over three decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-vc-moves-hc-against-his-detachment-from-duties-over-corruption-charges/articleshow/85159489.cms||Deepak Lavania

After a woman was raped in an ambulance in Jaipur a couple of months ago, I was completely shocked and realised that immediate measures need to be taken so something like this does not happen again. At present, there are around 3,500 private ambulances out of which majority have been fitted with GPS trackers.” The ambulance providers, however, will have to bear the cost of getting the GPS installed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gps-trackers-in-over-2k-ambulances/articleshow/85163634.cms||---

Goel said similar Covid Care Hospitals will be opened in the police lines of every district in the state. The DGP lauded the efforts of police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun and ADCP South Anil Kumar. To recall, both CP and ADCP had started the hospital immediately after the second wave of Covid and provided treatment to patients. DGP recalled that he had been the DIG Range (Kanpur) for nearly two years. “I know that the people here actively participate in any work for social cause. Everything cannot be left to the government. People’s efforts are very necessary, and the result is before you, the hospital is now ready to dispense its services,” he said. Similar hospitals would be built in other districts also. At some places, such hospitals have already become functional. If the third wave comes, then there will be no shortage of beds and treatment,” he said. Mayor Pramila Pandey, Police Commissioner Asim Kumar Arun, divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar, ADG Bhanu Bhaskar, IG Mohit Agarwal and other senior district and police officers were present during the inauguration. ADCP South Anil Kumar, who holds an MBBS degree, had played a key role in building the Police Hospital. A finance company, which helped in building the hospital, honored former DGP of Himachal Pradesh Sanjay Kumar and Nagendra Mishra. ADCP Anil Kumar told reporters, “There are 16 beds in the hospital. Oxygen facility is available here.” “Three beds have been reserved for children. In the second wave, 46 patients were admitted to the hospital. Seven were referred, while 39 patients were successfully treated. 1,020 patients were cured through telemedicine. Around 900 Covid tests were also done here,” he said. The Commissioner of Police said that in future there is a plan to run the hospital as a polyclinic. “If needed, 12 more beds will be increased,” he added further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/dgp-opens-covid-carehospital-in-police-lines/articleshow/85163984.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Citizens suffer as 28km outer ring road remains incomplete||Nagpur: Even as a lot of hype is being made about road projects in and around the city, residents along the four-lane standalone outer ring road (ORR) and bypass for the Nagpur city are suffering due to incomplete road work done by the National Highways Authority India (NHAI). The Package II of outer ring road project covers 28km starting from Fetri on Kalmeshwar-Katol road connecting to Kamptee-Jabalpur road of NH-44 through Bokhara, Bharatwada, Panjara on Koradi-Chhindwara section of NH-47. Of the 28km, only 7km has been completed in stretches. Of the Rs639 crore project, over Rs312 crore has been spent. The project, which started in January 2017, is in the doldrums despite 100% land acquisition. It was to be completed in 30 months. NHAI granted an extension to the contractor MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd till March 2021, but still the concessionaire has failed to complete the project. NL Yeotkar, project director, NHAI, admitted that the project has been left midway and only 40% of work has been completed. “The concessionaire has run into financial problems and we have issued ‘intent to terminate’ notice to MEP,” said Yeotkar. Yeotkar said the project is being built under hybrid annuity mode (HAM) wherein 40% of the cost is shared by the NHAI and of the balance 60%, 45% is funded by the banks and 15% by the concessionaire. The contractor has utilized the entire bank money. Residents of Ramnath and Mahalaxmi townships, Bajrang Nagar, and other independent colonies along Koradi road are facing grave inconvenience. A TOI visit to townships and localities on Sunday found that in some patches, a cement road has been constructed but people cannot use it. Work on culverts and bridges has been abandoned in the entire route. Architect Sharique Sheikh said that even a brief spell of rain makes the ring road slushy, and “it is difficult to ride two-wheelers”. “Life has become a hell for over 1,500 population who use the one-km muddy and potholed road to reach Koradi main road,” he said. “There are no street lights and the cement road in front of our township is a dead-end where anti-social elements consume liquor and throw empty bottles along the road. Women cannot step out after 6pm, even in case of emergency,” said Rajendra Gupta. The outer ring road was the focal point, said Vijay Kolhe, why people bought residential flats and houses in 2017. “The ring road was a big hope as it would have connected us to the city and help avail all facilities, including healthcare,” he said. Pravin Sable said that they are aware that the dispute with the contractor will not resolve soon. He demanded that the NHAI at least develop a service road and street lights in the 1km stretch from their locality, which is the end of the ring road. “This can solve our woes to some extent,” he said. Aftab Sheikh said that the contractor laid four huge foundations on both sides of the Koradi road for a flyover and abandoned the work. Now, these spots have turned into open wells and have become accidental spots during the night. Omkant Srivastava said that riders have lost balance due to potholed road and got injured. “Due to bad roads, even school van drivers had refused to pick up kids from the colony and asked parents to drop them till the main road,” he said. Yeotkar said the grievances are genuine but their hands are tied. “As the project is under HAM, the MEP will have to settle disputes with the lenders. Secondly, we will have to appoint a new contractor, but this will happen only next year as December is the final deadline for MEP to complete the project,” said Yeotkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citizens-suffer-as-28km-outer-ring-road-remains-incomplete/articleshow/85161250.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Kochi||Kerala: Restrict kids on ‘Clubhouse’, Child rights panel to IT, cops||KOCHI: The Kerala state commission for protection of children’s rights (KeSCPCR) has asked the IT secretary to take appropriate action to ensure that children below the age of 18 years are not allowed to open accounts or use Clubhouse, a social media app. If any such incident involving children is reported, the account should be deleted or cancelled. The IT secretary has been directed to issue guidelines to investigating agencies for frequent cyber patrolling and to check illegal activities and fake accounts by minors. The single bench of the commission was hearing a complaint filed by an Alappuzha resident who said that he heard children participating in a Clubhouse conversation which had sexual content and they were being encouraged and instigated to join the sexual discussion. In its response, the state police Cyberdome cell expressed its apprehension that children could be getting into Clubhouse using fake accounts. While Cyberdome has not come across any complaint so far, they did not rule out the possibility of such incidents. “The mechanism to ascertain whether it’s really a child engaged in such an activity is very limited, other than drawing inferences from the conversations shared by the user over such groups, like age, institution they study in, etc. It is hard for the investigating agencies to ascertain the authenticity of the contents such as screen-recorded videos shared over other social media platforms or those which are recorded by individuals as part of collecting evidence, since they can also be manipulated,” said the cyberdome report. It informed the commission that the room’s recording is automatically deleted by Clubhouse when the session ends. Clubhouse may record audio in the virtual rooms for supporting incident investigations. When a discussion is reported of Clubhouse rules violation, the audio of the associated room will be reviewed by the staff. But, Clubhouse does not explicitly explain the review process. So with difficulty in proving the authenticity of the content, it is very much possible that prosecution of any such crime committed over the platform may fail in court. “Cyberdome’s view is that Clubhouse is a matter of concern and its use by children may open up opportunities for online predators to engage with children easily and it may later turn into a situation of physical abuse too. As per the privacy policy of the app, it is not intended for use by children under 18 years of age. The app does not restrict anyone from using it with regard to age limit,” said K Nazeer, commission member, in his ruling. He said that the state must frame regulations to check child abuse and asked the education department to raise awareness among children and civil society groups on the possible threats and legal violations. It sought an action taken report from the IT, police and education departments on this issue within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/restrict-kids-on-clubhouse-child-rights-panel-to-it-cops/articleshow/85161272.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

There are approximately 650 structures, including shops and houses, causing hindrance to the construction of the corridor. The JDA will draw a lottery on Tuesday to allot plots to affected owners at a new location. After affected owners of Jhotwara elevated road project had given consent to shift, the JDA started work on identified land in Niwaru. “Work to construct the road is on. Electricity, water and sewerage lines will be laid. Following this, structures falling on the route will be removed,” said an official. For the 2,450-metre long road project, work in the 1,250-metre stretch cannot be initiated due to land availability. An official said, “Till June, approximately Rs 60 crore has been spent on the project. The work of the entire project can be completed by December 2022.” The width of the three-lane elevated road will be 11.50 metre. “Now, the work can only be started after the structures are removed,” the official said. In the 2016-2017 budget, the BJP government had announced construction of the road to give relief to commuters travelling to Jhotwara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/survey-to-remove-structures-from-jhotwara-corridor-begins/articleshow/85163660.cms||---
---||Lucknow||SP, BSP trying to reignite Mandal politics, but how far will it work?||LUCKNOW: Even as opposition parties observed ‘Mandal Diwas’ on Saturday to commemorate 21 years of implementation of the Mandal Commission report by the then National Front government led by Prime Minister VP Singh in 1990, political focus got trained on the ‘Mandal Vs Kamandal’ narrative which had led to the emergence of powerful regional satraps like Samajwadi Party and BSP in the political theatre of UP. The SP joined the opposition ranks, including Lalu Prasad-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), to observe the ‘Mandal Diwas’ on Saturday, in what was seen as an overt plank to consolidate the OBC community which accounts for over 50% of the total voting population in the state. This came two days after BSP chief Mayawati played a backward card by demanding a separate census for the OBC community for which, she said, she would support the BJP both inside and outside Parliament. The twin developments gain much political significance even as the SP and BSP roll up their sleeves to take on the mighty BJP’s organisational machinery in the high-pitched UP assembly elections due next year. Experts interpret the opposition’s ploy to play out the Mandal politics to position itself squarely against the BJP which had stood staunchly against the Mandal commission report recommending 27% reservation for OBCs in the government jobs. The BJP had then withdrawn the support from the VP Singh government while stepping up the Ram Temple movement to bring the OBCs under the umbrella identity of being a Hindu. Analysts said that similar efforts have already been made in the past without any significant result. They pointed out that the “OBC unity” seen at the time of Mandal agitation is not there as most influential OBCs oppose SP because of its overt tilt towards its core Yadav community. “BSP has also been reduced to a party of Jatavs, losing the support of OBCs and economically backward castes (EBCs) it enjoyed under party founder Kanshi Ram,” analysts said. Experts said that these parties need the support of upper castes, especially in UP. Besides, objectives of Mandal Commission has been accomplished and therefore, does not have the potency it had when it was a mission to strive for. BJP sources said that the party may have pulled out of VP Singh government over the Mandal Commission issue in 1990, but in 1985 at its Bhopal national executive, it had passed a resolution demanding its implementation. Significantly, despite its stand against the Mandal Commission report, the BJP has been harping on consolidation of OBCs, especially the non-Yadav castes, including Kurmis and Lodhs. While the BJP forged an alliance with the Kurmi-dominated Apna Dal in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it expanded its OBC outreach by amalgamating most backward castes (MBCs), including Rajbhars and Nishad. BJP leaders maintained that the party is treading cautiously in setting out a caste-driven political narrative which is otherwise being mastered by regional players like SP and BSP — in fact their emergence was solely based on amalgamation of OBC, Muslims and dalits. Experts pointed out that the BJP would also be averse to the idea of raising an OBC badge which could potentially boomerang and alienate the upper caste which has traditionally been voting in favour of the BJP. Experts said that the opposition trumping up the OBC plank could set a political stage with the BJP harking on its trade mark ‘grand Hindutva identity’ plank even as the SP sets out aggressive measures to consolidate the Muslim vote bank counter the saffron political outfit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-bsp-trying-to-reignite-mandal-politics-but-how-far-will-it-work-now/articleshow/85164166.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt eyeing record paddy yield for second successive year||LUCKNOW: The UP government expects to set a new record in paddy production for a second year in a row this year, the state government said in a statement on Sunday. This comes in the backdrop of the area under cultivation of paddy increasing from 58.92 to 60 lakh hectares, favourable weather conditions, better rains and the measures taken by the state government. The state government expects the paddy yield to increase by one million tonnes in the current Kharif season. Last year, the production of paddy had crossed 257.04 lakh tonnes. Notably, the agriculture department had set a target of cultivating paddy on 60 lakh hectares of land out of 96.03 lakh hectares in this Kharif season. Of this, sowing had been done on 57.72 lakh hectares till August 4. Sowing of paddy on the remaining land is likely to be completed by August 15. A state government spokesperson said that UP is likely to set a new record in the production of coarse cereals like millet and maize as well due to the conducive weather. Out of 18 divisions in the state, the production of paddy is likely to be the highest in Bareilly division where maximum sowing has been done. In Bareilly division, paddy has been sown on 194.40 thousand hectares of land followed by 175.50 thousand hectares in Moradabad division, 156.01 thousand hectares in Meerut division, 141.40 thousand hectares in Aligarh division, 73.72 thousand hectares in Saharanpur division and 25 thousand hectares in Vindhyachal division. The spokesperson said that even during the second wave of pandemic, CM Yogi Adityanath ensured that agricultural programmes continued uninterrupted. “There was no shortage of manure and seeds in the state. The Government also ensured that there was also no shortage of fertilizers like urea, DAP, NPK, zinc and potash while the movement of machines for harvesting wheat continued as usual. Agricultural equipment and improved seeds were also made available to the farmers, which led to significant increase in the production of rabi crops. And now the Government is leaving no stone unturned to have a record production of kharif crops including millet, maize, mung, groundnut, soybean, sesame and toor this year,” he said. The state government, officials said, is also working on increasing the storage capacity for food grains in view of the estimated increase in production. In 2017, the total storage capacity in the state was close to 29 lakh tonnes, which has been increased by the state government to more than 51 lakh tonnes in just three years. The Government has set a target to increase storage capacity to 7 million tonnes by the year 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-eyeing-record-paddy-yield-for-second-successive-year/articleshow/85164203.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Lucknow||‘Vaccine a must for pregnant women’||Over 60 lakh women get pregnant in Uttar Pradesh each year and they are the latest addition to the list of eligible persons for Covid-19 vaccination. With this, the vaccination target for UP would go up to 14 crore people by the end of the year. As the state prepares to mobilise expectant mothers to come forward and take their shot, Shailvee Sharda spoke to Dr Kanupriya Singhal, health specialist with UNICEF, to answer some key questions. Q: Why is it necessary for pregnant women to take Covid-19 vaccine? Does pregnancy increase the risk of infection in any way?A: No, pregnancy does not increase the risk of Covid-19 infection. That is a myth, but their health may deteriorate rapidly during Covid and that might affect the baby. Therefore, they need to be extra cautious and take all available measures to safeguard themselves. Q: How can Covid-19 affect pregnant women?A: Data indicates that majority of the pregnant women—almost 90%—are likely to develop asymptomatic disease. This means that they may recover without any need for hospitalization, but rapid deterioration in health may occur in a few. Symptomatic pregnant women appear to be at an increased risk of severe disease and death. In case of severe disease, like all other patients, pregnant women shall also need hospitalization. Pregnant women with underlying medical conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, age over 35 years are at a higher risk of severe illness due to Covid-19. Q: Does Covid-19 infection in a mother affect the baby?A: In rare cases (less than 5%), Covid-19 infections in pregnancy may increase the possibility of pre-mature delivery, the baby's weight might be less than 2.5kg and in rare situations, the baby might die before birth. Q: Is it possible that a Covid-19 positive mother will pass on the infection to the newborn baby?A: Most (over 95%) newborns of Covid-19 positive mothers have been in good condition at birth. But some babies may get Covid infection during pregnancy and some during childbirth. Newborns mostly get infected after birth if the mother or those around them do not follow Covid protocols. Q: Is it true that some pregnant women are at a higher risk of contracting pandemic infection?A: Yes. Pregnant woman older than 35 years of age, those with high body mass index (obese) and those with pre-existing illness such as diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma and heart disease are at a higher risk. Q: Are vaccines recommended for pregnant women who have been infected in the current pregnancy?A: In such a condition, she can be vaccinated soon after delivery. Q: What are the possible side effects of Covid-19 vaccines for a pregnant woman or her baby?A: Covid-19 vaccines are safe and vaccination protects pregnant women against illness/disease like other individuals. Like any medicine, a vaccine may have side effects which are normally mild. After getting the vaccine, she can get mild fever, pain at the injection site or feel unwell for one to three days. The long-term adverse effects and safety of the vaccine for fetus and child are not established yet. Very rarely (one in up to 5 lakh persons), pregnant women may experience severe symptoms within 20 days after getting the Covid-19 vaccination which may require immediate attention. Q: What are some of the warning signs to watch out for after vaccination? A: The Union ministry of health and family welfare has maintained that any of the following symptoms occurring within 20 days after receiving any Covid-19 vaccine should be flagged. This includes: shortness of breath (difficulty in breathing), chest pain, pain in limbs/pain on pressing the limbs or swelling in the limbs (arm or calf), small pinpoint haemorrhages (petechial) or bruising of the skin beyond the vaccination site, persistent abdominal pain with or without vomiting, seizures in the absence of previous history of seizures with or without vomiting, severe and persistent headaches, weakness/paralysis of limbs, persistent vomiting without any obvious reason and blurred vision/pain in eyes. Q: Are there any conditions in which pregnant women should not get vaccinated? A: Pregnant women should avoid vaccination if: they developed an allergic reaction to the previous dose of the vaccine, have any allergic reaction to vaccines or injectable therapies, pharmaceutical products, food items, etc. Vaccination should be deferred in case the woman is suffering from active infection. Another condition in which vaccination needs be deferred is infection treated with anti-Covid monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. Q: What other precautions need to be taken after a pregnant woman gets the vaccine?A: To protect themselves and those around from spreading infection, pregnant women and family members must continue to practice Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vaccine-a-must-for-pregnant-women/articleshow/85164443.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP pits Yadavs against other backward castes, says SP chief Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Joining the growing demand for the caste census, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said the ruling BJP was not interested in going for it and promised to get one done in UP within six months if the SP government came to power in the 2022 assembly polls. “Look at the extent of discrimination. They (BJP) don’t want to get our census done. There was a time when the country pushed for a caste census. Then they pitched us against each other saying that Yadav’s are depriving the other backwards of opportunities. Such debates get louder as polls approach. Now all of us, including SP, demand a caste census. Earlier, the Congress spent thousands of crores of rupees and got the caste census done but the statistics were never released,” Akhilesh said, addressing a conference of Mahan Dal where he was the chief guest. The former UP CM went on to announce that he would get a caste census done within six months of the SP government being formed in the 2022 polls. “Today with the available technology, it will not even take six months. It can be done within three months or even less,” he said at the conference, which was held at Samajwadi party headquarters in Lucknow. Reaching out to cadres of Mahan Dal – which claims to enjoy the support of OBC voters like Shakyas, Mauryas and Kushwahas, particularly in western UP – Akhilesh said the parties which never got the caste census done had earlier tried to divide the backward classes by pitting Yadavs against the rest. “…Humare aur aap mein ladai lagwa di… (Created differences between you and me) he said. “They propagated this claim that Yadavs were not bothered about the welfare of other backward classes,” he said as Mahan Dal workers raised slogans like “Mahan dal ne thana hai, Samajwadi party ki sarkar banana hai (Mahan dal has decided to ensure that SP forms the government). Akhilesh also announced that after coming to power, the SP government will go by the Supreme Court guidelines to release ex gratia relief to those who died of Covid in the state. “A probe will be conducted into the total deaths that took place in the state due to Covid. The government will record the statement of the family members to ascertain the cause of death of those who died at home as they never got a bed in hospitals,” Akhilesh said. Responding to a media query on BJP’s response to his objection over chief minister Yogi’s Abbajaan’ jibe, Akhilesh said he does not want to fall into the trap of getting into a war of words on the issue. The BJP on Sunday morning had questioned why Akhilesh had objections over the word ‘Abbajan’. The BJP’s statement came after Akhilesh on Saturday said the chief minister should mind his language and not refer to the SP patriarch at Abbajan else he too will respond in the same language.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-pits-yadavs-against-other-backward-castes-says-akhilesh/articleshow/85164117.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

So it sseems going by what the Panvel municipality has done. A dried rain tree which drew admiring glances from passers-by was recently chopped down by Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC). The reason people cast a second look was that it was artistically painted and bore a slew of eco-friendly messages on its trunk. But civic officials failed to “The tree was no hindrance to traffic or passers-by,” said social activist Bharat Jadhav. “But our municipal officials simply cut it down.” The tree that stood outside the boundary wall of New Panvel Fire Brigade had been spruced up for the Swachha Bharat campaign. It had messages like ‘We all need nature to breathe’ creatively painted on its trunk. The hacking has angered locals and activists. Swapnil Raut, a local, said “If the tree had to be cut, why did PCMC spend tax payers’ money on beautifying it?” Deputy municipal commissionerVitthal Dake said that a few organisations had asked Cidco to remove dead trees in the area. “Last year Cidco obtained permission from PCMC’s tree authority to remove the tree. Accordingly, t was chopped.” Right To Information activist Anarjit Chauhan said “PCMC and Cidco must inquire into the hacking... Civic contractors and the timber lobby led to its cutting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-axe-effect-for-an-artistic-rain-tree-in-heart-of-panvel/articleshow/85165345.cms||Umesh K Parida

An FIR was lodged in this connection on Sunday. The boy was rushed to Apollo Hospital in Lucknow where he was operated upon and put on ventilator for four days. The boy has suffered paralysis on the left side of his body and is completely bed-ridden. “Doctors are not able to make a clear prediction about his recovery. The bullet hit him on his head which not only left him paralysed but has also affected his mental stability,” said Abhay Dwivedi, father of the victim. He said he lodged an FIR against the accused boy after meeting senior police officials on Sunday. Dwivedi has also written to the Uttar Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UPSCPCR) in this connection. In the FIR, Dwivedi said his son was playing on the terrace on July 21 when the 10-year-old son of his neighbour came on the terrace of his house. “An altercation took place between the two kids after which the 10-year-old boy picked up his father’s airgun and shot at my son,” he said. “I rushed to the terrace and saw my son lying in a pool of blood. I immediately took him to the district hospital from where doctors referred him to Apollo Hospital in Lucknow,” he added. The boy was operated upon but the left side of his body was left paralysed due to the impact. Superintendent of police, Hardoi, Ajay Kumar said an FIR had been lodged against the minor for causing grievous hurt to a person by doing any act negligently, and negligent act endangering the life of person. “My son is a bright student and had participated in robotics competition in Noida recently.

---||Lucknow||Poll sweetener: Uttar Pradesh govt clears 75 per cent sugarcane dues with bumper Rs 26,000 crore payout||LUCKNOW: In a decisive outreach to farmers, the Yogi Adityanath government has made a record payout of Rs 26,000crore in cane dues for 2020-21 crushing season, which experts say is a critical move to placate the restive sugar bowl of the west UP, which has been wracked by protests over new farm laws. Cane development department records accessed by TOI show the payment accounts for 75% dues between October 1, 2020, and August 5, 2021. The state government would have to cough up Rs 7000crore to complete the payment process for the current reason. Record disbursement of cane dues comes despite lower sugar consumption due to the pandemic. Additional chief secretary (cane development), Sanjay Bhoosreddy told TOI that a host of measures undertaken by the department contributed to the “record” payment, including tagging cane products other than sugar — molasses, bagasse and press mud. Besides, ethanol produced from B-heavy molasses or sugarcane juice and that used for sanitizer production were also tagged for payment of cane price. In fact, cane price payment got accelerated due to an increase in ethanol production and sale. After coming to power in 2017, the BJP government created an escrow account, which was operated jointly by the mill representative and district cane officer/senior cane development inspector. As per rules, 85% money received in the account was kept for farmer payment. This resulted in arresting diversion of money for purposes other than cane payment. “Payment of over Rs 1.40 lakh crore made to around 45 lakh farmers in last four years is the highest in absolute number till date,” Bhoosreddy said, adding the state was determined to promote the economic interest and all-round development of cane farmers in the state. The state has as many as 120 sugar mills, of which 93 are privately owned, 24 in the cooperative sector and three belong to UP Sugar Corporation. Records show 39 mills have made 100% payment for the 2020-21 season, while 26 sugar mills have made 80% cane price payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/poll-sweetener-up-makes-record-rs26k-crore-payout-of-cane-dues/articleshow/85164146.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||The great siege||The period between June and November 1857 is among the most volatile in India’s freedom struggle. The resistance offered by rebel forces to the British Indian Army, and the subsequent bloodbath was the “First War of Independence”. In July 1857, word had reached Lucknow that the “firangi hukumat” (British regime) had almost come to an end and the Nawab could be reinstalled in power as soon as the few Europeans in the Residency were dispensed with. The British force under the command of the Resident Henry Lawrence, was a combination of artillery, infantry and cavalry. The revolt had already begun in Faizabad, Gonda, Bahraich, Sultanpur, Sitapur. English fugitives hounded by the rebels poured into Lucknow for protection. Other whites also gradually withdrew from all parts of the city and sought shelter in the Residency. Lawrence organised stockpiling of camel loads of food and ammunition. Except on the river side, the complex was encircled by the palace on one side and the Indian quarters on the other. So, the construction of stockades around Residency started. Meanwhile, Lawrence did not forget his greedy interest. He removed the treasury with Rs 2.3 million and also exhumed the jewellery of Wajid Ali Shah, net worth of which then was Rs 8 million. The rebel Indian army commanders watched the British movement but could not make out the enemy design until there was an ear-shattering explosion at Machchi Bhawan. The structure had been reduced to a shamble by the British because this building housed a big cache of ammunition. Its transport was impossible, so the British chose the other alternative, to destroy it. The rebels then regrouped and heavy artillery bombardment started at Residency, leading to success. On July 2, a gunner hit Lawrence on the thigh, to which he succumbed two days later. The news boosted rebel morale. There were 2,976 inmates in Residency: men, women, children, fighters and civilians, both whites and the Indian. On the other hand, the rebel forces numbered over 10,000. The entire show was run by Jailal Singh who was also the liaison man between Begum Hazrat Mahal and the other rebel leaders. On July 5, Birjis Qader, minor son of Wajid Ali and Begum Hazrat Mahal, was declared as the king of Awadh. The rebels started getting reinforcements from some taluqdars. However, lack of planning and coordination among the rebel leaders and their ignorance about the military plan was their weakness. Over-enthusiasm and mutual jealousies were also among impediments. The Indian attempts, first to burn Bailey Guard gate and then to break it open, yielded no substantial gain. The revolutionaries had sent messages to every taluqdar of Awadh to assist the rebels with arms, men and leadership. However, arms and food were becoming scarce. By middle August, Havelock in Kanpur had received an SOS from the Residency. The rebels knew that the enemy forces from Kanpur would attack them so the cavalry was withdrawn and sent to guard Alambagh. Havelock's first attempt on July 25 to push his way towards Lucknow with 1,500 men was not successful and he retreated. He tried twice again, on August 4 and 11 but on both occasions, the Indians gave very good account of themselves. Assault on Lucknow began again on September 19, this time Havelock was strengthened by the reinforcement from Outram, the notorious ex-Resident of Lucknow. After a little skirmish, the Indians withdrew tactically to lure the enemy cavalry into a hostile terrain in the countryside. The ploy did not succeed and the pursuing army under Outram reached Basheerganj through Unnao to meet Havelock. From there the combined army of the enemy set out for Lucknow on September 22. After a little encounter with the mutineers under Lal Madho Singh, the invaders poured into Alambagh with all vindictiveness and barbarity. The British troops killed whoever came in their way. With a distinct numerical superiority over the enemy, the Indian army could have been more motivated. Instead, they threw their hands in despair and surrendered the Alambagh post. Led by Colin Campbell, a huge force was marching towards Lucknow. The British soldiers were told not to show any mercy. What followed next formed the most sanguinary episode. With revolvers and bayonets, the enemy fell upon the Indians. With drawn swords, our troops met their adversary; a hand-to-hand fight ensued in which the enemy with superior arms inflicted mortal injury on our troops. Two thousand of our brave warriors fell to the enemy bullets and bayonets with smiling faces and no regrets, because they embraced glorious death rather than that from the ignominy of gallows. The army of the rebels was a motley array of sepoys, re-employed soldiers of the former Nawab's army and the retainers of taluqdars. The mutineers from the British army were the most qualified; they were skilled to handle European arms. An ideological definiteness made them combat the enemy with courage and dedication. Even in situations of extreme danger, such as at Sikanderbagh when Campbell slaughtered many of them, they never retreated. After advancing towards Residency, Campbell ordered women, children and the wounded to be transferred from there under the cover of darkness to Dilkusha, where Havelock shortly died of dysentery. Altogether 7,950 sepoys, 5,600 Awadh regiments, 7,720 cavalries, and 32,080 of taluqdars’ men fought at different points of time, at different places, till the evacuation of the Residency on November 23 by Campbell. The British lost 536 people including 45 officers although Indian lives were lost in thousands. The evacuation by the British enthralled the rebels but they did not see amid the enthusiasm of false hope that it was a pyrrhic victory, that Lucknow was the beginning of their end. Campbell returned to retake Lucknow, with the attack starting on March 6, 1858. By March 21, all fighting had ceased. The enemy vacated Lucknow not for their valour but to come back to destroy the brave rebels again and with them extinguished the flicker of India's first hope of independence. What happened inside residency Death, illness and constant attacks had sagged morale of the British residents. Scarcity of food and clothing too started to exert pressure on them. Meals were reduced from three to two. They had never had bread till Residency was evacuated. Chapati, rice and dal constituted their staple food; vegetables and meat were rationed. There was auction of the dead officers’ properties, in which cigar, wine, garments, besides some luxury commodities fetched heavy prices to meet the needs of the surviving members. Prices of brandy, sherry and cigars touched the sky. Sugar had become a luxury.

---||Jaipur||Green panel lens on Illegal sand mining in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has sought a report on a plea accusing private khatedari lease holders of excavating bajri from riverbeds and illegally issuing royalty rawannas. The reply has to be filed within four weeks. The order dated August 4 reads, “We deem it just and proper to call a report on the matter in issue in present application from a joint committee consisting of director mines and geology department (GoR, Udaipur), state level environment impact assessment authority, Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board.” It was mentioned in the application that the khatedari lease holders were issuing rawannas for a distance of 600 to 700 km for a truck having a capacity of almost 20-30 tons whereas mineral allegedly being filled was hardly 2-3 tons simply to legitimise illegality. “The area of leases falls within 5km of the riverbeds, non-compliance of the sustainable sand mining guidelines 2020 issued by MoEF and CC, mining being undertaken in monsoon season, which creates a pit in khatedari land and stops the recharge/replenishment of the riverbed by the water being flown in the adjoining fields and permission of mining without replenishment study,” it said. Despite the apex court blanket ban on mining, the mafia continues to plunder the riverbed. Bajri Truck Operators’ Welfare Society president Naveen Sharma told TOI, “Its on open secret there is no bajri abundance on khatedari land. The mafais are digging it from riverbeds and illegal rawannas are issued. Despite the CEC being constituted, the mafia is not afraid due to the lackadaisical approach of the administration.” The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has made a mandatory provision even for small lease holders to carry out a replenishment study. But none of the holders in Rajasthan has conducted the study. Pradeep Singh, who has also filed a PIL in Rajasthan High Court says, “There are approximately 200 sand mining leases on agriculture plots in Rajasthan. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) appointed by the Supreme Court to look into the issue of illegal mining had recommended not to excavate sand within a 5-km radius of the river. However, on ground the nothing has changed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/green-panel-lens-on-illegal-sand-mining/articleshow/85163663.cms||---

---||Jaipur||40 Bihar child labourers return home from Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The 40 children from Bihar, who were rescued in Rajasthan last month, have been sent back home after their parents were contacted. While officials had previously found that the parents were given around Rs 4,000 for each child, the former claimed that they sent the children with the assurance that the minors would be sent to school. The children were supposed to work in bangle factories in Jaipur and had boarded the train from Patna. Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal told TOI, “The children were kept in quarantine while we got in touch with the parents. However, the parents told the child welfare committee that they sent the children under the assumption that the boys would be sent to school and taken care of. Even the children claimed that they boarded the train willingly, though it was found that they were to work in bangle making industry.” Officials could not verify if it was a single individual or a group of persons who actually bought the children from the parents in exchange for money. The boys, aged between 8-15 years, were travelling in a passenger train and were accommodated at the government-run shelter in Jaipur till they returned home. In the past two years, approximately 3,000 children have been rescued from labour in Rajasthan out of which majority have been boys and over 1,000 persons have been arrested since 2019. Close to 1,000 rescued children hailed from states outside Rajasthan and were brought here under various pretext to work in hotels, factories and other forms of employment and experts claimed that majority of children were brought from Bihar. Last month also more than half a dozen children were rescued in separate incidents in Udaipur and experts working in this field claimed with the lockdown restrictions eased, more cases of child trafficking are likely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/40-bihar-child-labourers-return-home/articleshow/85163687.cms||---
---||Allahabad||‘Gangsters Act FIR valid evenif accused booked in one case’||Prayagraj: The Allahabad High Court has held that lodging of a first information report under Gangsters Act even on the involvement of a person in single criminal case is valid and permissible under law. A bunch of 12 writ petitions along with others were connected on the common question whether a first information report under provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 (Gangsters Act) can be lodged and is maintainable on the basis of involvement of the petitioner(s)/ accused in a single previous case. While dismissing the writ petitions filed by Ritesh Kumar alias Rikki and others, the division bench comprising Justice Pritinker Diwaker and Justice Samit Gopal said, “In a petition under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) of the Constitution of India, the high court cannot adjudicate the correctness of the allegations in the impugned first information reports or the cases on the basis of which the impugned first information reports have been lodged.” The common ground as raised in all the writ petitions was that the petitioners have been made accused in the impugned first information reports which have been lodged under the provisions of the Gangsters Act on the basis of their involvement in a solitary case, and even the gang chart prepared and approved by the authority shows that there is a single case against them on the basis of which the impugned first information report has been registered which is illegal and against the essence of the Gangsters Act. The said first information report could not have been lodged on basis of a solitary case and as such, the writ petitions should be allowed and the respective impugned first information reports be quashed. After hearing the counsels of the petitioners and state, the court discussed several judgments and decided this important question of law. The court gave this decision on August 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/gangsters-act-fir-valid-evenif-accused-booked-in-one-case/articleshow/85163905.cms||---

Rawat, who is an inspector in the Uttarakhand Police, said that they both met for the first time only a couple of months prior to the Rio Olympics. “We were together at the pre-Olympics camp in Poland. The qualification mark for the Rio Olympics was 82m but Neeraj missed out by a metre. Still, I knew that there is something special in him as just some days after that, he created a record by throwing the javelin at a distance of over 86m in the Under-20 Junior Athletics World Cup at Poland.” The 31-year-old race-walker told TOI that they both used to go out to eat parathas once in a while despite strict instruction against it from their coaches. “In Patiala, we used to go together once a week to eat our favourite food and cheat on our diet plan,” said Rawat who remembers the gold medalist as someone who is very humble and down-to-earth. Rawat said that he now wishes Chopra wins a gold at the World Athletics Championship next year as it will ensure a rare feat for the youngster - a gold in all four major sporting events, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, Olympics and World Athletics Championship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/neeraj-i-used-to-sneak-out-to-eat-parathas-amidst-our-strict-diet-plan-ukhand-olympian/articleshow/85159607.cms||Mohammad Anab

As Rajasthan gets its vegetable supply mainly from other states, retail prices are almost 40 per cent higher. Wholesale traders at Mohana Mandi said rising vegetable prices will continue till September 15. “Heavy rains have damaged crops in farms at Tonk, Chomu, Bassi, Bagru, Sawai Madhopur and other areas of Rajasthan. Presently we are dependent on Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Thus, wholesale veggie prices are high,” said Abdul Majid, a wholesale trader at Mohana Mandi. Tomatoes, which are sold at Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg, now costs Rs 35 to Rs 45. Lemon, which was priced between Rs 25 and Rs 35 per kg in July, was now been sold at Rs 35 to Rs 45. “The prices have just doubled and this trend will continue till September 15 when we will start getting the vegetables from local farms,” said Shiv Shankar Sharma, president of an office bearer of vegetable traders at Mohana Mandi. Sharma added that some of the locally harvested vegetables will start coming from September first week. “By mid-September, the prices would be cheaper as the supply would be in abundance. Locally, we would start getting cucumber, lemon, tomatoes, coriander and other vegetables,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rains-take-veggie-prices-up-rates-to-dip-after-mid-sept/articleshow/85163755.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lutyens’ hotspots to come under 'Cycle4Change-II'||NEW DELHI: New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has submitted its proposal for Phase-II of the cycling corridor project, ‘Cycle4Change’, to Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (planning & engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) for scrutiny and approval. The corridor will cover a stretch of 10 kilometres. “It will be connecting government housing colonies to offices in and around North Block, South Block, Nirman Bhawan, Central Secretariat and New Moti Bagh areas where a cycling track will be made for last mile connectivity. The plan was approved by the lieutenant governor recently,” said an NDMC official. A senior DDA official said, “Yes, we have received the proposal and it will be processed as per the UTTIPEC’s procedure.” Since there will be many roundabouts and intersections falling on this proposed route, the civic body will make provision for zebra crossing and other arrangements in consultation with Delhi Traffic Police to make the corridor safer for cyclists. “To avoid any confusion, we have already shared the plan with the traffic police. The lanes in the corridor will be 6 feet wide and at places, the track will be laid beside the footpath to allow smooth movement of cycles,” said the NDMC official. The civic body has also proposed to beautify the stretch, mark it with cycle symbols and make the roundabouts and roads intersections safer with the installation of safety devices, including temporary/permanent retro reflective markings. During the Phase-I of the project, which was launched in October 2020, the civic body had developed a five kilometres stretch starting from Bikaner House at India Gate to Jor Bagh Metro Station via Lodhi Garden. “The corridor is still operational during weekends. On the designated route for Phase-II, two cycling stations will come up at Sunheri Bagh Masjid and Kautilya Marg. If required, we will develop more stations,” said the NDMC official. Since the project will be compatible with the ongoing Central Vista Project, NDMC expects that more and more people visiting government offices/other places in its jurisdiction areas will use bicycles for better connectivity. “Besides reducing the traffic on the roads, the proposal will also help people keep themselves fit,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lutyens-hotspots-to-come-under-cycle4change-ii/articleshow/85163789.cms||Vibha Sharma

Tenders for five works have been floated while the rest were in progress. The major works under CRF included concretisation of ever busy road from Jaistambh Square to Manas Square, which is 3.63km in length. For this project, Rs234.21 crores were approved, which also included beautification of both squares, a flyover and railway underbridge. “Mahametro has been entrusted with the work and its deadline is December 31 this year,” the minister told TOI. A spectators’ gallery of 4,000 capacity at Futala lake, one of Gadkari’s dream projects, is also being built from Rs112.89 crore CRF funds. A parking plaza for vehicles would be constructed here. The minister told TOI there would be a food mall spread over three floors with a viewing gallery at the venue. This work too has been delegated to Mahametro with the same deadline of December 31. Another major project is widening of busy roads located in market areas like Gandhi Putla, Kelibagh, Tulsibagh passing through Reshimbagh Square, which stretches 3.30km. An amount of Rs58.69 crore has been allocated for the project, whose work is underway and its deadline is February 27, 2022. Even the highly congested Old Bhandara Road stretching 4.30km would be broadened from Rs70 crore received under CRF. Though the tender has been finalised, its work couldn’t be started as Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is yet to provide additional land for its expansion. The road would be widened from Mayo Hospital to Hotel Sunil at Satranjipura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-brings-rs1824cr-central-road-funds-for-city-projects/articleshow/85161348.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Hyderabad||Community fridge goes missing in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: In a bizarre incident, a community refrigerator, which was set up by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) along with Apple Homes NGO, to serve the hungry poor, went missing from road 12 in Banjara Hills. Shocked locals and small vendors in the area, who arrived at the location on Sunday morning, discovered that the refrigerator was gone, leaving just a broken shelter behind. When TOI tried to find out about the missing refrigerator, locals said that the refrigerator might have been stolen by miscreants as there was no staff designated to safeguard it after it stopped working due to erratic power supply and lack of maintenance a few months ago. “It looks like someone stole it at night. It was not working and had been left abandoned for over six months. It looks like the job of some miscreants. The situation arose because the authorities who installed it about two years ago were not looking after its upkeep,” said G Anjaiah, a tea-stall owner in the area. Set up at a cost of Rs 1.5 lakh each, poor maintenance and erratic power supply has put paid to the novel plan to save food and feed the needy. “It is really shocking that the entire refrigerator went missing from a prime area without anyone’s notice. I also enquired with the security guards and local vendors, but no one knows where it disappeared. Even the concerned GHMC authorities I spoke were not able to tell where the refrigerator went,” said Harish Daga, a social activist. However, when contacted, GHMC deputy commissioner of Khairtabad zone, Seva Eslavath said, “We have shifted it to a comfortable place to carry out some road works.” However, he did not reveal any further details about its current location. In a similar case in Tolichowki, it was found that the shed for the refrigerator has been removed and the glass door was broken by some unknown persons. TOI also found that the refrigerators in most other placesare all damaged and not in use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/community-fridge-goes-missing/articleshow/85165100.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Delhi||Before I-Day, cops intensify checks for sabotages||New Delhi: Ahead of Independence Day, Delhi Police has tightened security across the capital by intensifying patrolling, conducting anti-sabotage checks and deploying extra pickets at the border areas to thwart any untoward incident, officials said on Sunday. As part of the anti-terror measures, enhanced police presence, intensive checking at vulnerable points, checking of hotels and guest houses, SIM card and second hand car dealers, sensitisation of cyber cafe owners and verification of tenant and servant drives are being intensively carried out by all the police stations, they said. At his first crime review meeting held on Saturday ahead of Independence Day, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana directed officials to draft the cooperation of street vendors, small shopkeepers and auto drivers in a “big way” for them to act as “eyes and ears” against terrorist or criminal designs. “These common people on ground can be vigilant to act as our “force multipliers” and form a part of our community policing to keep the city safe and secure with greater public cooperation and participation,” he had said. According to sources, police said legal action have been initiated against those house owners who did not get the verification of their tenant or domestic help done. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “Security at malls and vital installations have been increased. There is constant foot and motorcycle patrolling being done by senior officers. Network of CCTV cameras are being strengthened. Those CCTVs, which are found non-operational, are being repaired and new cameras are also being installed in vital areas. Anti-sabotage checks are being carried out in malls and markets.” PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/before-i-day-cops-intensify-checks-for-sabotages/articleshow/85163845.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bundi woman delivers child in candle light at village PHC||KOTA: Two nursing staff at Barakheda village health centre in Bundi saved the life of a pregnant woman and her baby by guiding her through delivery using light from candles and torches on Thursday. The delivery was conducted at the primary health centre (PHC) of the village which had no power due to heavy rains. Both the mother and the baby girl were healthy after the incident and sent home the same night. The two nursing staff on duty had received the alert about the pregnant woman on Thursday evening. The two - a woman health visitor and an auxiliary midwife - carried out the delivery under the leaking ceiling of the PHC’s labour room as it was not possible to refer her to a better hospital due to rains and inundated roads. The pregnant woman, 22-year-old Vinita Bairwa, had arrived at the PHC with her husband Sonu Kumar and mother-in-law in labour pain around 5pm on Thursday when it was raining heavily and flooded the village, said Rajiya Sultana, one of the nursing staff to TOI on Sunday. This was Vinita’s second pregnancy and she had critical problems during the first child birth. The staff, though initially reluctant, decided to go ahead with the delivery as her labour pain intensified. The electricity supply was disconnected due to rains and the mobile phones of the staff did not have charge. So they lit some candles and asked the woman’s husband to get some torches from outside. They called two local ASHA workers also for help, said Meena Malav, who assisted in the delivery. "It was really a great joy and gave us deep satisfaction to see the baby and the mother in sound health after the delivery. We were very worried and afraid but it was successfully handled," said Rajiya. "The nursing staff have done a good job and we will recommend their names for state level awards and certificates," said Bundi CMHO Dr Mahendra Tripathy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bundi-woman-delivers-child-in-candle-light-at-village-phc/articleshow/85163814.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Aug 15: Fully vaxxed citizens get freedom to board locals||Mumbai: In a major relief to office-goers and others who need to commute within the city and its vicinity, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday that the general public would be allowed to board local trains from August 15, Independence Day, provided they had completed 14 days since their full vaccination against Covid-19. There would be an app-based pass for suburban train travel and an offline method to obtain the pass for those without a smartphone, said Thackeray in an address to the state on social media. He appealed to private offices to implement a system of staggered working hours to avoid crowding at the workplace as well as in trains. About 19 lakh people in the city have been fully vaccinated so far. On easing of curbs at places of worship and providing further relaxations to hotels, restaurants and malls in the state, the chief minister said a decision would be taken in the days following a review meeting with the State Covid Task Force on Monday. “A decision on hotels, restaurants, malls and places of worship will be taken in the next eight to ten days,” Thackeray said. “However, people should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour as Covid has not been eliminated yet. We can stop the third wave of Covid by adhering to social distancing norms, wearing masks and washing hands regularly.” Last Monday, the state allowed malls, gymnasiums, yoga centres, salons, beauty parlours and spas to reopen with 50% capacity. In that announcement, it permitted shops and establishments to remain open till 8pm on weekdays and till 3pm on Saturdays in 22 districts. In the city, the BMC allowed shops and establishments except malls to remain open till 10pm on all days but permitted hotels and restaurants to operate only till 4pm through the week. In his latest address, Thackeray cautioned that lockdown-like restrictions could be imposed again if Covid-19 cases increased and if a third wave of the pandemic hit the state. On the app-based passes for local train travel, the chief minister said fully vaccinated people would be able to upload their details and use a QR code to download the pass. He said people who do not have smartphones could obtain their passes from BMC ward offices or railway stations on furnishing relevant information. Thackeray’s announcement came a couple of days after the BJP held protests in the city on Friday tom press for opening of local train travel for ordinary people who had been fully vaccinated. After the Covid-19 restrictions began in March last year, the state had last allowed the general public to board local trains from February 1 this year, but with staggered timings. The general public was allowed to board trains in non-peak hours, that is, before 7am, between noon and 4pm, and from 9pm till the last local of the day. When Covid-19 cases again rose dramatically, it brought the train travel restriction back in April. During the pre-pandemic period, there were about 80 lakh commuters daily on the suburban train services run by the Western Railway and Central Railway. Thackeray also expressed concern about some districts that still have a high positivity rate, such as Pune, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Beed. In Raigad and other districts where there were floods and landslides last month, Thackeray said more care needs to be taken there to ensure Covid-19 cases do not spike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/aug-15-fully-vaxxed-citizens-get-freedom-to-board-locals/articleshow/85165110.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Love heritage? You’ll get cop cage||AHMEDABAD: Manish Brahmbhatt, 49, and Nishit Singapurwala, 38, would not have imagined that their cry to protect the city’s legacy will lead to their incarceration in the crime branch lock-up. The crime committed by the two: making an innocuous public appeal to save the World Heritage icons at Khadia. The two have been demanding action against illegal construction as well as the demolitions of heritage homes. “August 8 commemorates the start of the Quit India Movement and Khadia played a central role during the freedom struggle,” Brahmbhatt said. “So we thought it was an opportune time to protest against illegal demolitions of properties bearing the World Heritage value. The structures were being razed to build new commercial buildings.” Brahmbhatt added: “At stake was the lives of thousands of families in the Walled City. But a harrowing time was in store for us. It felt as if police were trying to spread fear.” Brahmbhatt and Singapurwala had appealed to people in a WhatsApp message to install black flags at their homes to protest against the rapid commercialization of their pol areas. The pols come under the World Heritage Site (WHS) zone. On Saturday at 5:30pm, circle police inspector P D Solanki called the two men to the police station to identify the messages, Brahmbhatt said. “As soon as we said that we had circulated the messages, we were asked to sit in a room,” said Singapurwala. “We were arrested at 9:30pm and later driven to the crime branch’s lock-up at Gaekwad Haveli.” Both men were arrested as preventive action under the Code of Criminal Procedure’s Section 151. By 11:30pm, Singapurwala complained of health problems in the lock-up. By early morning, police called a 108 ambulance to take Singapurwala to Asarwa Civil Hospital. The two were released on bail late on Sunday afternoon. “I had not even informed my family of my arrest till Saturday night,” said Singapurwala. Inspector Solanki said: “A black flag symbolizes protest and if visible in public, the protesters need to inform police of their action.” Over the past two years, the two had been raising awareness on saving heritage in Khadia, Bangla ni Pol, and Dhal ni pol. They also led a group, ‘Shresht Khadia Abhiyan’, which spread awareness on the transfer of development rights. They have been consistently appealing to the AMC to stop the demolitions of heritage properties in their area. “We can’t even put up a black flag at our homes to protest against illegal demolitions,” Brahmbhatt said. “The inaction of the civic body is affecting us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/love-heritage-youll-get-cop-cage/articleshow/85161392.cms||Paul John
---||Dehradun||Vandana Katariya among 23 women achievers given Tilu Rauteli awards||Dehradun: Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Sunday conferred 23 women, including hockey player Vandana Katariya, with the Tilu Rauteli award. The annual award is given to women for their exemplary performances in their field of work in Uttarakhand. During the event, CM Dhami announced that the prize money for the award will be increased from Rs 31,000 to Rs 51,000 next year. Notably, the prize money was raised from Rs 21,000 to Rs 31,000 last year. On the occasion, 22 anganwadi workers were also felicitated with an amount of Rs 21,000 for their outstanding service. However, the event stoked some controversy as several activists and leaders of political parties, other than the BJP, have expressed disappointment over those selected for the Tilu Rauteli award this year. Sarojini Kaintura, the former chairperson of the Uttarakhand women’s rights commission, said, “The award should ideally be given to one woman from each of the 13 districts. The spirit of the award has been bypassed to push political priorities.” Echoing similar sentiments, Sanjay Bhatt, Uttarakhand AAP leader, said “Nine out of the 22 awardees have a connection with the incumbent BJP. This goes against the spirit of the award.” When asked about the controversy, Harishchandra Semwal, secretary of the women and child development department, told TOI, “The nominations come from the districts. Thereafter, scrutiny is conducted at the state level. The awardees are selected only on the basis of merit.” The selection procedure is absolutely fair.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vandana-katariya-among-23-women-achievers-given-tilu-rauteli-awards/articleshow/85159688.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Rajkot||‘Atmanirbhar’ Kutch village shows the way||RAJKOT: A small hamlet, located around 18 kms from Anjar town in Kutch district, is showing how overall development can be achieved by prudent use of tax revenue. Bhimasar village boasts of many amenities that one usually sees at posh localities of urban areas. The 2001 earthquake had left the village completely ruined. When it was rehabilitated in 2004, the residents vowed to make it a model village. Back to the present, the village has wide roads, flanked by green trees on both sides. Also, it has six community centres, a network of CCTV cameras, sewage line and sewage treatment plant. In a way, the village is ‘atma nirbhar’ as the entire infrastructure was created without the dependence on government grants. The earthquake that uprooted the village, later paved the way for its panchayat’s income. Many edible oil refineries came up around the village after the earthquake under the central government’s tax relief scheme. The village panchayat earns around Rs 2 crore per year as tax from these refineries and other industries. With industries coming up around it, the village faced pollution issues. Last week, around 2,500 saplings of native trees were planted in coordination with the forest department to mitigate the pollution problem. These trees are planted in a way that it will create a canopy when they grow. An automatic drip irrigation system has also been installed which starts watering at 7am in the morning and stops at 9am. The village has a population of 8,000 which includes around 3,000 migrant labourers who work in the surrounding industrial area. Dinesh Dungariya, the sarpanch of the village, said, “We have six community halls in the village. Since 2004, we have planted around 10,000 trees. The village has a 400-year-old lake, which we deepened, and it is used for watering these trees.” The village is getting Narmada water which is used for drinking and other household purposes. After facing a grass deficit, the village authorities created grassland a year ago. Also, no encroachments are allowed on the ‘gauchar’ land. The village has 5,000 livestock including 1,100 cows. “We don’t want our population to move around with their livestock in search of grass and water during the summer like people of other Kutch villages. We have created our own grassland,” Haresh Humbal, a village leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/atmanirbhar-village-shows-the-way/articleshow/85159721.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Focus on social media pages as Puja clubs plan to go digital||KOLKATA: Even as they prepare for the worst and gear up to embrace the digital format of Durga Puja, many organisers in the city are seeking professional support to update, calibrate and popularize their social media pages and websites amid growing fear of a Covid-19 third wave looming over the festival, barely two months away, this year. The pandemic has changed the way festivals are traditionally organised. In 2020, the week-long celebration was very low-key especially after the high court banned entry of visitors inside the pandals, virtually declaring them “no-entry zones” to prevent any gathering. TimesViewIt may be too early to predict how the Durga Puja season will unfold. But being prepared for a somewhat-restricted festival, similar to last year’s, would make sense for organisers.Without waiting for the government or court directive, this year, too, the majority of organisers have scaled down the Pujas and started shifting towards a digital drive along with a slew of Covid-related changes. “Going digital is the need of the hour. There is no way we can welcome guests to Puja pandals and invite further spread of the infection. Hence, we have decided to hire an agency and organise multi camera setups, conduct interviews and prepare interesting programmes to make our Facebook Live page and live streaming on our website more engaging,” said Sajal Ghosh, a senior functionary of Santosh Mitra Square . Ballygunge Samaj Sebi Sangha and Mudiali Club in south Kolkata said they were making substantial changes to their pandal designs by cutting down on the glitz as well as the pandal size and budget, making it more open-air that’s deemed fit for public viewing from a distance. But they too are thinking digital. “We are in talks with multiple agencies seeking quotations, opinions and options from them to make our digital productions more engaging. We want to ensure our patrons don’t miss out on the fun and revelry even if they can’t come to the pandal,” said Arijit Maitra, the general secretary of Samaj Sebi Sangha. Advertisement and social media promotion agencies said they were receiving multiple queries from Puja organisers. “We have submitted plans to a couple of big ticket Durga Puja organisers. This is also an opportunity for local and smaller Puja organisers to compete with bigger ones using the digital platform and eye a global audience,” said Suvajit Dutt of Anonymous. The forum for Durgotsav — an association of more than 350 Pujas in the city, including the prominent ones, have already proposed a set of guidelines for this year’s Durga Puja in the second week of October. All organisers, artisans, priests and drummers need to be vaccinated. The guidelines also ask organisers to reduce spending on lighting, idols and other paraphernalia and keep it as open as possible. Naktala Udayan Sangha has decided to scale down their puja to a minimal one. “We are not organising theme puja and will only perform the rituals on club premises without any spectator,” said Bappaditya Dasgupta, a key functionary of the club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/focus-on-social-media-pages-as-puja-clubs-plan-to-go-digital/articleshow/85161428.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Mumbai||Probe Mumbai's desalination plant project: BJP to Centre||MUMBAI: The BJP has raised a red flag over the BMC’s ambitious Rs 1,600-crore desalination plant project in Mumbai. The party has asked the Union environment ministry to conduct a study and come out with a report on the environmental impact of the plant on Mumbai’s coastline.  In a recent letter to Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar pointed out that the United Nations has reported on the negative impact of desalination plants. TimesViewMumbai has historically been blessed with abundant rain. Hence, the decision to set up a desalination plant to treat sea water is not only outrageously expensive but also not environmentally friendly. These plants also require huge amounts of energy. The BMC should instead encourage water conservation and promote rainwater harvesting projects. “The UN has extensively reported on the negative impact of desalination plants on nearby marine and aquatic life and the ecosystem. Unfortunately, Mumbai’s coastline and nearby aquatic ecosystem is already endangered and severely polluted as repeatedly highlighted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in its various judgments and reports,” Shelar said in his letter. “I urge the Union environment ministry to commission a report and present its findings in the next two months to analyse the likely environmental impact of the setting up of a desalination plant in Mumbai on its coastline and also evaluate and suggest environment-friendly alternatives to this project,” Shelar, an MLA from Bandra (West), said in his letter. The letter, with a request for a report in two months, comes ahead of the civic polls scheduled for February next year, with the BJP pitted against the Shiv Sena, which has been ruling the BMC for close to 30 years.  In June, an MoU was signed between the BMC and an Israeli water technology company to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the desalination plant project. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who was present at the event, had said that the 200 MLD project would be a “revolutionary step” and that it was his dream of several years. If the plan goes through, it would be the state's first desalination plant, to be set up at Manori for “augmenting Mumbai's water supply”, though at a steep bill of Rs 1,600 crore. The aim is to make the plant operational by 2025.  As per the MoU, signed with MS IDE Water Technologies, a global leader in the field, the DPR of the project is to be be ready by May 2022. The firm’s appointment was cleared by the BMC's standing committee in May 2021. BMC officials said that once work on the preparation of the DPR is taken up, different studies for the project, like measurements of tides, waves and currents, a bathymetry survey, a sea water quality analysis, and ecology & biodiversity studies will be pursued vigorously. Also to be pursued are the preparation of a CRZ map and CRZ clearances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-to-centre-probe-mumbai-desal-plan/articleshow/85165447.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Even as the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) drags its foot on the restoration activities, the building is suffering irreversible damage. In the last few months, large sections of the of RCC planter running all along building’s wall broke or was pulled down for safety issues. Unesco in 2016 has inscribed 17 of the Le Corbusier’s buildings as world heritage.  “The concrete is peeling off at several places. New rooms have been constructed within the museum complex,” says an AMC official. Corbusier had initially designed the RCC planter gutters for creepers to grow and climb up thewalls. “The creepers had existed till mid-1960s after which the AMC stopped maintaining them,” adds the official. The museum stands on pillars. One enters the building through an open court. From here a ramp, opens to the sky, leading to the various exhibition levels. Corbusier expected visitors to come to the museum in the evening or night-time. “He wanted them to wind up at the terrace which had provision for 45 flowered basins, filled with water to a depth of 40cm. There was supposed to be garden on the terrace,” adds the AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corbusiers-sanskar-kendra-crying-out-for-restoration/articleshow/85161427.cms||---

---||Dehradun||U’khand govt approaches SC, seeks stay on CBI probe into Haldwani sub-jail custodial death||Nainital: The Uttarakhand government has filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court (SC) challenging the ruling of the single-judge bench of the Uttarakhand high court (HC) which ordered a CBI probe into the custodial death of an inmate at Haldwani’s sub-jail and the transfer of SSP Nainital and Haldwani circle officer (CO) for failing to register the FIR on time and causing a delay in the investigation. In its petition, a copy of which is available with TOI, the state government has argued that even though ten injuries were recorded on the deceased’s body, the nature of injuries does not show culpable homicide or murder as provided under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The petition has also said that SSP Nainital and other police officials discharged their duties as per the law and if the HC judgement is allowed to sustain, it “will tarnish the image and the career of the honest and innocent officers”. As reported by TOI earlier, a man named Pravesh Kumar had died at Haldwani’s sub-jail in March this year allegedly after being thrashed by the prison guards. Days later, his wife tried to register a complaint but the police refused. Finally, an FIR was filed on the orders of the magistrate. The victim’s family, however, approached the HC seeking a CBI probe into the matter. The HC also noted that 10 injuries were recorded on Kumar’s body during his post-mortem and that CO Haldwani, in his preliminary probe report, did not record the doctor’s statement. The court, in its judgement, remarked whether the “ties of brotherhood” led police to finding no evidence of beating by prison guards. The CBI has already started its investigation into the case. Last week, a CBI team visited the Haldwani sub-jail and recorded the statements of the inmates and the prison guards. The apex court is likely to hear the case on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-approaches-sc-seeks-stay-on-cbi-probe-into-haldwani-sub-jail-custodial-death/articleshow/85159776.cms||Prashant Jha

The HC rejected the quashing petition because the rape survivor told the court that the relationship was not consensual and that she had given her consent for quashing of the FIR under the influence of the family members. The case was from Devbhoomi Dwarka district. On April 15, Jamkhambhaliya police registered an FIR for rape at the instance of a married woman. Within a month of filing of the complaint, the accused managed to convince the victim to withdraw her complaint by involving the family members. With the consent petition filed by the accused in the high court, the victim filed an affidavit granting her consent for junking the FIR. However, when the hearing took place on the quashing petition, Justice Gita Gopi summoned the victim and heard her through video conferencing. Later, the court noted, “However, on verification it was found that the complainant has not given her voluntary consent for withdrawing the prosecution and the facts of the complaint itself suggest that there was no consent.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-refuses-to-quash-rape-fir-after-parties-reach-settlement/articleshow/85161462.cms||---

The case involved Sanjaykumar Shahu, 45, from Dwarka town. On December 29, 2020, somebody withdrew total Rs 30,000 from his account through PhonePe application in six transactions, each of Rs 5,000. However, Shahu did not get OTP even once. He came to know about the withdrawal when he tried to pay fees for his daughter’s studies on January 4, 2021. He contacted the bank and he was advised to lodge a complaint. Shahu filed a police complaint also in this regard and approached the Jamnagar District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission alleging deficiency in banking services and demanding his lost amount back along with Rs 9,000 in compensation. The SBI told the commission that the bank did not have to do anything with PhonePe and that the customer’s account was not linked with the application with the bank’s consent. The customer filed the complaint in order to extract money from the bank, though somebody else had committed a fraud on him. The transactions took place due to the complainant’s negligence, the bank submitted. The panel said that it cannot be believed that the bank was unknown to PhonePe link. In case of electronic banking transaction, it is mandatory for a bank to send SMS tone alert to the customer. After holding that it was deficiency in banking services on part of the bank, the commission ordered it to return Rs 30,000 to the account holder. It also ordered the bank to pay Rs 5,500 in compensation towards mental harassment and legal expenditure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/withdrawal-sans-otp-bank-told-to-repay/articleshow/85161495.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Look out for signs of diabetic foot: Doctors||NAGPUR: Retired government servant Sunil Patil would have never realized about the severity of his foot ulcer had his seven-year-old granddaughter not pointed out that his leg was having a wound and smelt really bad. Patil, living with diabetes from last decade or so, realized that he hardly has any sensation left in his legs. “I rushed to my family physician after realizing the wound was really serious. I don’t remember when and how I got this wound,” said Patil. According to doctors, neuropathy or nerve damage is common in people with diabetes, and can cause loss of feeling and numbness among other problems. “This puts people with diabetes at risk of serious foot disease as they may be unaware of having a wound on it,” said Dr Himanshu Patil, endocrinologist and diabetologist. Explaining the condition, Dr Patil said that diabetics with neuropathy don’t feel pain, pressure or temperature. “They can step into a tub of scalding hot water without feeling it. In fact, the numbness in their feet makes them feel cold. Such patients can develop burns, wounds etc. We call it diabetic foot,” he said. Compared to non-diabetics, diabetes patients having open sores and wounds on the feet are 15 times more likely to develop a foot ulcer sometime during their lifetime. If left untreated, they can become highly infected and possibly lead to amputation or even death. Foot infections are common reason for patients with diabetes getting hospitalized and an estimated 85% of all amputations in people with diabetes are the result of a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer. Intravascular surgeons manage or amputate the part of foot in such patients. Dr Vaibhav Lende, who has managed many such cases, said that neuropathy is a serious diabetes complication that may affect as many as 50% patients. “It may start sometimes between 5 and 10 years of having diabetes. With normal nerves, a person can usually sense if shoes are rubbing on the feet or if one part of the foot is becoming strained while walking. Diabetic patients with neuropathy lose such sensations and get wounded,” he said adding that the people living with diabetes must consider their feet as second face and see it in mirror daily. “Inspect your feet daily. Check your feet once a day for blisters, cuts, cracks, sores, redness, tenderness or swelling. If you have trouble reaching your feet, use a hand mirror to see the bottoms of your feet,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/look-out-for-signs-of-diabetic-foot-docs/articleshow/85163957.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Three widows and a divorcee are among the seven beneficiaries of the special poverty alleviation scheme. They would formally get ownership documents at the hands of guardian minister Nitin Raut, after the formalities of the allotment were expedited by district-level committee under collector Vimala R. The process for selecting the beneficiaries and co-ordination with the taluka-level scrutiny and selection committee was carried out under the supervision of department of social justice and special assistance. Total 26.5 acre non-irrigated but arable land was procured at Mohgaon Dhole in Hingna taluka by the government, which would be divided equally among the seven beneficiaries, said assistant commissioner of social justice and special assistance Babasaheb Deshmukh. “The four women now plan to stay together and jointly earn livelihood through agriculture for which we would extend help through government machinery. Our aim is to ensure these beneficiaries form a joint venture-type business which would be monitored and guided by village and taluka level officials,” said Deshmukh. Patil, having two children, barely had a monthly income of Rs2,500. Her struggle for a square meal a day is now set to come to an end. Similarly, 54-year-old visually impaired and divorcee Gumpabai Mankar’s life too is now set for a positive change as she would no longer have to depend on other farmers to employ them as daily wagers. Mankar earned less than Rs2,000 a month. Another two widows and three male farm labourers would also be receiving the benefit. In the past, 56 beneficiaries from Nagpur district have been covered under the poverty alleviation scheme. In addition, social justice and special assistance department is also trying to take the benefits of different schemes, run by various departments, to economically weaker sections so as to ensure a steady income for the downtrodden. The department also plans to help the beneficiaries get 11 goats or two cows, financial assistance to buy tractor, build their homes near the land, procure seeds, fertilizers and also dig up a well for irrigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/i-day-to-bring-freedom-from-poverty-for-7-dalits/articleshow/85163985.cms||Soumitra Bose

A sultry weather with less rains, like being seen these days, creates right conditions for the pest growth. This can increase spraying, and farmers also avoid wearing safety kits in a humid weather. Vinod Chavan, a 42-year-old farmer from Yavatmal district, allegedly died due to accidental inhalation of pesticide fumes last week. His relatives say he fell unconscious on returning from the farm. Chavan was taken to Government Medical College (GMC), Yavatmal, where he was declared brought dead. Currently, there are four other patients in the GMC, their condition is stable, said a senior doctor. “Cases come each year,” he said. TOI talked to his son, Pramod, who said that his father was not wearing a mask while spraying pesticide but had covered his face with a handkerchief. “He started off in the morning and perhaps forgot to take the mask along,” he said. The post-mortem report is awaited. In 2017, a large number of deaths were reported in Vidarbha due to pesticide poisoning. Yavatmal was the epicentre with the highest 20 to 23 fatalities. A number of safety campaigns had started after that. Experts and farmers directly link pink bollworm with inhalation incidents. This is because if the bollworm infestation increases, spraying also goes up leading to the risk. Pesticide India Network (PAN) and Maharashtra Association Pesticide Poisoned Persons (MAPP) have launched a website to create awareness about safe use of pesticides and also post individual stories of victims. Narsimha Reddy of PAN said the present season is perfectly conducive for the bollworm to grow. Yavatmal district collector Amol Yegade said that the pesticide companies are providing kits to select farmers. “Kits may not reach to all, however the district administration is carrying out an awareness drive. Farmers are being asked to wear masks and gloves, not to consume tobacco and not work on empty stomach at the time of spraying,” said Yegade. Swiss pesticide company Syngenta has been allotted the stewardship programme in pockets of Yavatmal. According to details shared by a Syngenta official, the third edition of safety drive is being carried out in this season. The official said that 10,000 farmers will be trained on safety. Over 250 trained spray-men will be deployed to prevent any accident. More than 43,000 PPE kits have been distributed along with awareness drive conducted in 1,100 villages. Methods like street plays, posters to even audio video clips are being used to create awareness. Manish Jadhav, a farmer in Yavatmal and a member of Shetkari Sangathana, said that despite the efforts the kits do not reach farmers. Only a select few get the benefit. “The matter has been taken up with the district administration,” he said. To this the Syngenta official said it is ensured that each of the item reaches the ultimate beneficiary. The district administration also keeps a track. Chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), Kishore Tiwari, said that bollworm has been reported in the early variety. “At present, the intensity is same as it was last year. However, if the weather remains same, there is a likelihood of pest attack increasing,” he said. Shetkari Sanghathana veteran Vijay Jawndhia said that it needs one bout of good rains to ward of the threat or else the infestation is likely to increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pink-bollworm-infestation-increases-spraying-leads-to-pesticide-inhalation/articleshow/85161491.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Ease 50% cap on reservation: Uddhav, Sena MP tell Centre in Mumbai||Mumbai: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said the Centre, while delegating powers to the states to offer social reservations, should relax the existing 50% cap on quota, since mere delegation of powers does not really fulfil the intention of giving reservation. His statement was backed by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut who echoed the view that unless the 50% cap on reservations is relaxed, the constitutional amendment on allowing states to prepare their own OBC list will not help, and the Maratha quota cannot be restored. “When I met PM Narendra Modi in Delhi (in June), I told him that since the SC has quashed the Marath quota and ruled that states had no right to provide reservation, the central government should take the initiative (to ease the 50% reservation ceiling). Now, that the Centre has given the right (to prepare OBC lists) to states, it should relax the 50% cap. I hope the PM would do so,” said Thackeray. Talking to reporters here, Raut said he discussed the issue and developments regarding it in Parliament with the CM. He said state public works department minister Ashok Chavan will hold a virtual meeting to inform leaders of all political parties about the status of the issue of Maratha quota, which was quashed by the Supreme Court earlier this year. The demand for a debate will be raised when the constitutional amendment issue comes up in Parliament, the Rajya Sabha member said. “Unless the 50% cap is relaxed, the Maratha quota cannot be restored,” he said. The Union cabinet is learnt to have cleared a constitutional amendment bill that seeks to give power to states and UTs to make their own OBC lists. The bill will now be introduced in Parliament for passage, sources said in Delhi on Wednesday. The SC had dismissed the Centre’s plea seeking review of the May 5 majority verdict which held that the 102nd constitutional amendment took away the states’ powers to declare socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) for grant of quota in jobs and admissions. The Maharashtra government had granted reservation to the Marathas in jobs and education under the SEBC category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ease-50-cap-on-reservation-uddhav-sena-mp-tell-centre-in-mumbai/articleshow/85165479.cms||---

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) could not conduct vaccination in the 153 Covishield centres on three consecutive days — Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The civic body was able to carry out inoculation only in two Covishield centres, which are dedicated centres for Central Jail and Motibagh Poly Clinic. However, vaccination continued in 12 centres of Covaxin on Sunday. On Sunday, 2,910 people took the jab in the NMC centres. Vaccination also continued in 28 private centres where 1,470 people were inoculated. Thus, total 4,380 people took the jab in the city on Sunday as against average of 30,000 per day. The state government has supplied 22,000 doses of Covishield for the district on Sunday. The NMC got 13,000 and remaining 9,000 doses were given to zilla parishad for vaccination in rural areas. An official from the NMC told TOI, “Stock of 13,000 doses of Covishield is not enough for even one day. There will be no vaccination in Covishield centres on Tuesday if no fresh stock arrives on Monday.” Sources from the office of state’s public health department said chances of supplying fresh stock of Covishield on Monday are very bleak. The demand for vaccine has increased since the government resumed inoculation of 18-44 age group on June 23. Vaccination could not take place on 27 of the last 47 days in Covishield centres of NMC due to irregular supply of doses. The NMC will continue vaccination of bedridden people as soon as it receives all necessary documents from the potential beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-centres-get-covishield-for-monday-no-stock-for-tuesday/articleshow/85161529.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The accused later dragged the body for more than 100 feet and dumped it behind the shrubs at a desolate place. Police said Raghore, a native of Wardha, had come to work at Digambar Durge’s garage some time back. Nandeshwar, who worked as a labourer, was also sheltered by Durge at his garage after the victim had lost his job due to an ailment. It’s learnt that Nandeshwar too worked in the vicinity earlier. After Durge extended assistance to Nandeshwar, the two started staying together at the garage. After his arrest, Raghore told the police that Nandeshwar used to harass him with undue advances and raunchy remarks which left him miffed. The duo also had an altercation a day before. Police said Nandeshwar was stuck on the head with a hammer by Raghore who dragged the body and left it behind the shrubs in the early hours. Cops have also come across the dragging marks on the road in front of the garage. The accused had also cleaned the blood stains at the garage. Raghore tried to mislead his employer by saying that Nandeshwar left the garage while he was asleep. The murder came to the fore later in the day when passersby spotted the body and alerted the cops. Sources from Gittikhadan police station said Raghore was rounded up as he was the only one with Nandeshwar. Initially, Raghore was denying his involvement in the case but later, spilled the beans during sustained questioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-hammers-co-worker-to-death-for-making-sexual-advances/articleshow/85164036.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||How to measure tree age? Axing proposals stuck: BMC||MUMBAI: With the state government recently amending the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, proposals to axe trees for infrastructure and redevelopment projects seem to be heading in limbo. The BMC’s garden department has written to the state environment department asking it to issue clear guidelines on implementing the ame-ndments. Identifying and marking heritage trees and measuring the age of trees are the biggest challenges for the BMC and if it isn’t able to do it, several projects will get stuck owing to lack of clearances. The Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, which was amended in the two-day monsoon session of the state legislature in July, stated that the Maharashtra State Tree Authority be formed to take decisions regarding protection and conservation of trees. The amended Act also stated that all proposals for felling more than 200 trees aged five years and above for any project as well as heritage trees shall be referred to the Maharashtra State Tree Authority and not BMC’s Tree Authority. In case, the state authority recommends felling, the local tree authority may request for reconsideration of the decision. Local tree authorities should ensure that the project is not sub-divided into smaller parts to keep the number of trees below the defined threshold. “How are we to send proposals to hack 200-plus trees that are more than five years old?” the BMC asked in its letter to the state. “To figure the age of trees, guidelines were to be issued. But till they are issued, how should we process the proposals for hacking of less than 200 trees? How will compensatory tree plantation be carried out? Till these issues are clarified, should BMC process appl-ications for hacking trees bas-ed on the existing guidelines?” With no response from the state government yet, the Sewri-Worli connector, that will connect Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, and a proposed redevelopment project at Worli will be among the first projects to be hit by the new amendments. Over 550 trees are proposed to be felled and transplanted for these two projects. Arborist Vaibhav Raje said he has sent a proposal to the BMC to identify heritage trees by measuring their age scient-ifically and is awaiting its nod. “The approximate age of trees can be measured using scientific tools. We can also implement a unique grading system for heritage trees. A comprehensive tree database can be created with their location, recommendation for taking care and heritage grade. The BMC must also develop a system where people can nominate heritage trees in their areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-how-to-measure-tree-age-axing-proposals-stuck-in-mumbai/articleshow/85164162.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||India||Previous 100 picks ‘ignored’, SC judge-led panels stop interviews for tribunal posts||NEW DELHI: The statutory selection committees led by Supreme Court judges have collectively decided to stop conducting interviews to recommend names for appointment of members to important tribunals till the bureaucracy clears 100 names that are already recommended even as vacancies have rendered the tribunals dysfunctional. TOI has learnt the collective decision by SC judges to stop further selection process had led to a bench of CJI V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant on Friday expressing unhappiness over the slack approach in filling vacancies in key tribunals. The SC is unhappy with the governnment's slack approach in filling vaccines in important tribunals relating to armed forces, central government employees and in important sectors like telecom, environment, income tax, central excise and sales tax, debt recovery, corporate insolvency and company law. The statutory committees for selection of chairperson and members of NCLT and TDSA are headed by CJI Ramana with Justice Surya Kant as member. Justice D Y Chandrachud heads the selection committee for National Consumer Disputes Resolution Commission (NCDRC) while Justice A M Khanwilkar-led committee selects chairperson and members for Armed Forces Tribunal and Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. Selection of members for the National Green Tribunal is done by a committee chaired by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul. The SC pointed to the delay in setting up a Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Appellate Tribunal as per the CGST Act, which came into force in April 2017. "Any person aggrieved by the decision of the GST authority or the revision authority is entitled to approach the appellate tribunal within 90 days. You were mandated by the CGST Act to create an appellate tribunal. Even after four years, you have not been able to set up an appellate tribunal," the SC had said on Friday. "So many orders passed by the GST authority or revisional authority are not dispatched for the reason that the aggrieved persons would then be bound by the 90-day limitation period for filing appeals before the appellate authority, which does not exist. So, the finance ministry passed an administrative order on December 3, 2019 waiving off limitation period because of non-constitution of the appellate tribunal. What is this? I do not understand," the CJI had lamented. For various vacancies in the National Company Law Tribunal and NCLAT, the SC judge headed committees had recommended names of 21 persons as far back as May 27, 2020. But it has not been acted upon for more than a year and two months. NCLT, which deals with litigations pertaining to companies as also the insolvency proceedings, does not have a president and posts of 23 judicial and technical members are vacant. For the NCDRC, Justice Chandrachud led committee had recommended 14 names in June last year. After nearly 14 months, the government has appointed only four of the 14 names recommended. Similarly, a committee headed by Justice Khanwilkar had recommended 35 names for appointment as members in ITAT in October 2019, but the government has not acted upon it for nearly two years. For the Armed Forces Tribunal, the SC judge led committee had recommended 20 names in November last year, but not much progress has been made. Debt recovery tribunals have no chairpersons in 15 places. The Appellate Tribunal for Forfeited Properties has no member and is virtually non-functional for the last two years. The Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) does not have a chairperson. An important tribunal catering to the telecom sector has been plagued with vacancies for the last 15 years. Another important tribunal, ITAT has 25 judicial and 27 technical members' posts vacant. In the Railways Claims Tribunal, posts of 20 judicial and five technical members are vacant. In CESTAT, posts of 16 technical members are not filled. The CAT president has retired and there are vacancies of 18 judicial and 14 technical members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/previous-100-picks-ignored-sc-judge-led-panels-stop-interviews-for-tribunal-posts/articleshow/85166265.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Nagpur||It’s a different ‘dry day’ inrural to fight dengue menace||Nagpur: Divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare Verma has made an appeal to observe ‘Korda Divas’ or dry day in the six districts under her charge, including Nagpur, to tackle dengue. ‘Korda Divas’ is being made the mantra to tackle dengue in districts where the local bodies, especially in the rural, would decide a day when no water would be supplied to ensure that vessels, containers, pots and other storage items are emptied, cleaned and dried to kill the mosquito larva and break their life-cycle chain. In Nagpur district, around 263 patients were found dengue positive in July. There were three deaths as well. In the same period last year, there were only 16 cases of dengue with one death. Till July, Kuhi taluka had the maximum 54 cases followed by Nagpur and Umrer (49 cases each). District malaria officer (DMO) Dr Rahul Gaikwad said killing mosquito larva is not only crucial for fighting dengue or malaria but is also key to prevent the Zika virus which has already created havoc in Kerala. “Only emptying water containers or storage places is not sufficient as the mosquito larva manages to stick to the surface. We also need to dry containers once a week to kill the larva which grows in clean water. It’s also important to find out where the rain water gets accumulated. Such places need to be cleaned,” he said. District health officer Dr Deepak Shelokar said the situation was reviewed in Umrer, Bhivapur and Kuhi talukas where civic bodies and peoples’ representatives have appealed to locals to ensure that there’s no water supply on a day decided by all stakeholders so that vessels and storage places can be cleaned and dried. “Apart from treating the water vessels, fogging and early referrals of patients with fever are also equally important to fight dengue,” he said. Assitant civil surgeon Dr Nitin Gulhane too said the significance of the ‘Korda Divas’ is to go dry one day and break the life-cycle of mosquitoes. Block development officer, Umrer, Jaisingh Jadhav said some villages have agreed to go dry on Mondays but a another meeting is expected to take place later this week so that the rest of the villages take similar decisions for a day suitable to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/its-a-different-dry-day-inrural-to-fight-dengue-menace/articleshow/85164072.cms||Soumitra Bose

The artistes, who would be staging the protest to mark August Kranti Din, told TOI that already half of the season has gone waste. “Theatre activity has completely stopped this year. Not only plays but also musical events are on hold. Artistes and technicians have lost their income source. It’s a life and death situation for us,” said Charudatta Jichkar, theatre activist. The ‘Break the Chain’ rules allow theatrical activities at 50% occupancy with Covid appropriate behaviour, but, not a single theatrical event was permitted in city for last two months. “While amateur artistes are missing their cultural activity, there are hundreds of musicians, technicians and daily wage workers whose life depends on these events. If political gatherings and events are permitted, why orchestra is banned?” said musician Amit Kumar. The artistes have planned to assemble at 11am at Samvidhan Square from where rally will be held to the district collector’s office. A delegation will hand over a memorandum of demands to the collector. Event organizers, wedding planners and organizes of musical events in marriage functions are suffering from huge financial losses as they have been practically jobless since last many months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/artistes-to-stage-protest-to-demand-theatre-reopening/articleshow/85161561.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Closure: In dead files, Gujarat cops find the missing||AHMEDABAD: When a team of Anand police approached a family in Sarsa – about 19km from Anand town – with the photograph of a woman, the family was in for a shock. The 61-year-old woman, mother of the family head, had been missing since January 2010. The family had lost any hopes of getting her news after over a decade, even as she was legally dead after seven years of remaining missing. But the body in the picture was definitely hers, with physical description and clothes matching her perfectly even as the facial features were distorted due to the start of decomposition. The body, found near Dakor in Kheda district, was found three months after her missing report. “It was less than 40 km between the two spots, but it took 11 years for the family and police to get the closure,” says M H Bhati, sub-inspector of the missing persons squad of Anand police. According to the missing children portal of the government of India, Gujarat still has about 10,000 missing persons, as daily about three to four persons go missing due to reasons ranging from abduction to mental illness. On the other spectrum, there is also a number of unidentified dead whose pictures lie buried in police files. In a unique experiment, the Anand police has started running matches of pictures of 1,000 unidentified dead found in seven districts over the past decade, with some 500-odd persons missing from Anand since 2007, and have found 11 matches. Ajit Raijan, SP Anand, said that he had started the pilot project to connect the unclaimed/ unidentified bodies to the missing persons when he was in Surat range a few years ago. “It was there that I realized that with some diligence and attention to details, it’s possible to get the match. Thus, when I came here, we created a database of all unidentified bodies from Anand, Kheda, Ahmedabad rural, Vadodara rural and Bharuch – accounting for about 1,000 persons – for the past decade,” he said. The district, since 2007, has about 500-odd missing persons. It’s shock or denial for families:How do family members feel about the discovery after 5-10 years about the death of their relatives? Rajian said that rather than police procedure, it’s an exercise to give closure to the family. “Till the body is found, a person is almost always alive for the family. Finding the body also helps in settling insurance claims or getting other benefits in some cases,” he said. “But in most cases, we have get one of three responses – the family is in complete shock but glad that they got the news at least, in complete denial and not wishing to cooperate, and accepting it pragmatically.” He added that in all the cases where the bodies’ DNA samples were saved, they matched it with the family’s. “The issues arise when the missing persons are migrants or have changed their addresses,” said Rajian. Quick resolution :In some cases, the gap between report of missing persons and find was a few days – in one of the cases, a 35-year-old man from Kathlal police station area was reported missing on May 14, 2016, and his body found from Anand town on May 18 – whereas in some cases, the gap was of a few years. A 42-year-old man was reported missing from Sojitra in 2015, and his body was found from Jawaharnagar near Vadodara in 2019, after four years. Some of the deaths had taken place in road accidents, whereas in some cases the causes were either natural or not known.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/closure-in-dead-files-cops-find-the-missing/articleshow/85161583.cms||Parth Shastri

Acting on her complaint, the Mora Coastal police have booked accused Doctor Alex and the unidentified woman aide under section 420 and 34 of the IPC, along with section 66(c) and 66(d) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The victim had browsed Google looking to buy an i-phone online between July 18 and 20. She was then approached by one Dr Alex on Instagram who said he was from Scotland.

Commuters and passenger rights activists said that it was “unfair” not to allow office-goers and daily workers on local trains and that many travelled without tickets “in desperation”. Activists said that as the local train service was the lifeline of Mumbaikars, lakhs depended on it for travelling to workplaces like shops, offices and business houses from far-flung places and these were among those fined in the past four months. A CR official said that the rules were strict and only those in government jobs, on medical frontline duties and a few others were permitted by the state government to travel in suburban trains. “We have imposed fines of Rs 260 plus the train fare on every passenger caught without a ticket,” said CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. Subhash Gupta, president of Rail Yatri Parishad, said: “It is ridiculous. The government has opened shops, restaurants and offices after the second lockdown. But it has denied train travel to those who will be going to these shops, restaurants and offices for work. “Hundreds of labourers, workers from unorganised sectors and also office-goers depend on lcoal trains to travel from far-flung suburbs to their workplace. If shops are open, then their workers find it difficult and also expensive to travel by road to their place of work. Not everyone can afford an Ola or Uber daily to travel to the office. It is impractical to stop trains and expect people to travel by road to work.” An office-goer, who requested anonymity, said: “I am in sales and have to travel from Kalyan to Dadar daily. It is strenuous to travel by bus and expensive to travel by cabs. If I do not report to work, I may lose my job. There is no alternative but to travel by train and pay fines if caught.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-7cr-in-wr-cr-fines-in-4-months-shows-desperation-to-use-locals/articleshow/85165153.cms||Somit Sen

In the current year, 30% of the residents will be rehabilitated on government-owned land, said Kolhapur district guardian minister Satej Patil. The minister visited several flood-hit localities in the district on Sunday. He assessed the damage to the homes, public buildings, roads, wells, and crops inundated by the floodwater in Bhudargad and Ajara tehsils. Speaking at Bhudargad, Patil said, “Many towns and villages in the Kolhapur district were ravaged by the recent floods. We are witnessing frequent floods in the district and as part of a permanent solution to the loss of life and property, we are planning to relocate the affected population to safer places. The rehabilitation work will be done in phases. This year, we will rehabilitate 30% of the residents. Next year, another 30% will be rehabilitated, and the remaining, the year after,” said Patil. Patil said the width of the streams and canals will be increased to avoid flooding. “We are in consultation with experts to prevent losses due to floods, landslides, and torrential rainfall. The width of the streams will be increased. There is also a need to mark the flood lines of smaller streams. The carrying capacity of the rivers and streams will be increased by adopting sustainable methods. I have asked the authorities to built homes for the landslide-affected citizens immediately,” said Patil. Rain takes a break On Sunday, most places in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts did not receive any rain. The inflow of water from the catchment areas into the dams and the discharge into the rivers is now almost the same. The inflow into the dams in the Krishna river basin is around 14,000 cusec and the outflow is 14,200 cusec per hour. The water level of the Panchaganga river has receded to 21.5 feet at Kolhapur’s Rajaram barrage. The Krishna level has receded to 12.9 feet at Sangli’s Irwin bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapurs-flood-hit-residents-to-be-rehabilitated-in-3-years-satej-patil/articleshow/85165498.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: NDMC proposes 3 sites to shift Gaffar traders||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has proposed three alternative locations for shifting traders out of Gaffar Market till the old and dilapidated building is redeveloped. The civic body’s standing committee chairman, Jogi Ram Jain, said the proposed locations were an old primary school in Karol Bagh, the old zonal headquarters in City-SP zone near Idgah and a building near Videocon Tower. “We are trying to assure traders that they will be brought back to the redeveloped market after work is completed just like they exist now. But the traders have decided to approach the court,” he added. The structure of the market has become weak. Though the shopkeepers were allotted the space on a 99-year lease, the civic body issued eviction notices after carrying out a structural safety study with the help of IIT-Roorkee. Harish Chitakara, the market association president, said it was unfair to give eviction notices to the traders. “The shops were allotted on a 99-year lease. How can the properties be vacated suddenly?” he asked. A municipal official said the department of earthquake engineering of IIT-Roorkee visited the site on July 5 to assess the vulnerability of the market. Based upon the results of the rebound hammer test and ultrasonic pulse velocity it was found that surface compression strength was not satisfactory and the quality of tested columns was doubtful. The report also stated that active corrosion in the building, especially in the basement, meant that any maintenance without stopping the corrosion would be futile. On July 23, the civic body issued notices to the shopkeepers at the complex on Saraswati Marg and asked them to vacate the premises as the building was in a dilapidated state. The civic body plans to redevelop the place on a public-private partnership. Shopkeepers claimed that north corporation’s project was only aimed at getting the shops vacated and similar attempts were made in 2011 and 2016. The market was developed in 1975 and the shops were given on lease for 99 years in 1976. On the ground floor, there are 75 shops, a majority of them selling mobile phones and electronic items. Most of the shops on the upper four floors are empty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-proposes-3-sites-to-shift-gaffar-traders/articleshow/85164159.cms||---

The suspects were arrested from the Rokdoba Wadi area of the city. They were produced in court on Sunday and were remanded in police custody till August 10. Senior police inspector of Upnagar police station Anil Shinde said that on the instructions of commissioner of police Deepak Pandey, DCP Vijay Kharat and ACP Sameer Shaikh, personnel of the detection branch were looking for criminals wanted in various theft cases. On Saturday, the team got information about six burglars who were hiding in the Rokdoba area. The police raided the place and arrested the suspects and recovered 54 stolen cellphones. Shinde said the gang has been operating at an inter-state level and moves from one place to another.

If found guilty, those involved in illegal sale of biodiesel would get maximum punishment under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955,” Nanded collector Vipin Itankar said. He has also asked the Nanded police and officials of the state excise department to start cracking down on such illegal sales. Earlier, the fuel dealers’ association in Nanded held a meeting with Itankar and highlighted this issue. The state government, in May, had come out with the Biodiesel (manufacturing, storage, supply, selling) Policy 2021. “The policy has been framed in the best interest of all stakeholders involved, including retailers and consumers. Therefore, any violation of rules and regulations laid down as per the policy would attract legal action,” Itankar warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-administration-warns-against-illegal-sale-of-biodiesel/articleshow/85165512.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Series of events planned to mark Madhu Limaye’s birth centenary||Mumbai: Friends and followers of socialist ideologue and ace parliamentarian Madhu Limaye have planned a series of events to commemorate his birth centenary. A committee has been set up for the year-long celebrations, with economist Bhalchandra Mungekar, a former MP, in the chair. Scholar Bhanu Pratap Mehta recently spoke online on ‘Challenges Before Indian Democracy: A Historical Perspective’, a theme that was close to Limaye’s heart. Limaye played a key role in deepening post-independence India’s democratic and secular content. Born in Pune in May 1922, Madhukar Ramchandra Limaye was educated at Fergusson College. He gave up studies to join the freedom struggle, and at 16 he was cooling his heels as a juvenile convict in the Raj prison. Like countless youths of his times, Limaye took to socialism like fish to water, and came under the spell of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan. Maharashtra was at the forefront of the fledgling socialist movement and Limaye was one of its firebrand crusaders. Limaye faced yet another imprisonment, of two years, during the 1942 stir. Later, he fought for Goa’s independence, and was clapped into jail for 16 years. Limaye was deeply influenced by Sane Guruji, the respected socialist and writer. Although groomed by Dr Lohia, Limaye did not exactly back his mentor’s idea of an anti-Congress front in the 1960s. Limaye thought this would mean investing Jan Sangh, the BJP’s earlier avatar, with respectability. “Limaye had an abiding faith in the Constitution. He would do nothing which would weaken the country’s secular foundation. Yet, Dr Lohia cajoled Limaye and George Fernandes (also a Lohia protege), into accepting his agenda,” said political commentator Amarendra Nandu Dhaneshwar. This resulted in a clutch of rag-tag coalitions in the Hindi heartland in 1967, and the Janata Party experiment, which replaced the Congress at the Centre, in 1977. Two years later, the Janata government fell following infighting. Many criticised Limaye for the fiasco. “Limaye was wrongly dubbed a splitter. Actually, the Jan Sangh, which had promised to dismantle its front units after being part of the government, went back on its word,” said Dhaneshwar. In a recent article, Aniruddha, Limaye’s son, defended Limaye against his detractors. Now again the Lohia-Limaye-Fernandes formula of a third front is the flavour of the season, if recent parleys between Mamata Banerjee and Sonia Gandhi on the one hand and Sharad Pawar and Laloo Prasad on the other are any indication. “The idea of welding together regional forces into a coalition to take on a ruling party which is intoxicated with power is irresistible,” said Ramesh Joshi, a socialist and former corporator. Political upheavals apart, Limaye will be remembered for his role as a parliamentarian in the 1960s, when both houses were chock-a-block with opposition giants H V Kamath, Acharya Kripalani, Bhupesh Gupta, Hiren Mukherjee and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Limaye would join the stalwarts to pin down the Indira Gandhi regime on a slew of issues, including the Tulmohan Ram case and Sanjay Gandhi's Maruti public car, much to the discomfiture of Indira Gandhi. Limaye effectively opposed Indira Gandhi’s pet theme that Parliament was supreme to the Constitution. Indira would often consult Limaye on the intricacies of statecraft and parliamentary procedures. She had despatched two colleagues to Limaye to find out the nature of her punishment in case a privilege motion against her was passed by the Lok Sabha in 1979. When the 1970 union budget was presented in the house, Indira and her ministers, all in a celebratory mood, forgot about the Finance Bill. It was Limaye who drew the PM’s attention to the breach of rules, and saved the government from embarrassment. By the 1990s, the Socialist movement was past its prime, and Limaye decided to call it a day. He passed away in January 1995.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-series-of-events-planned-to-mark-madhu-limayes-birth-centenary/articleshow/85165548.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||Surat||297 bird species make Dang their home||Surat: Forests in South Gujarat — from Surat to Dang — is a bird paradise where varied avian species have made the lush green forests of the northernmost part of Western Ghats their abode. This was confirmed by a recent study on avian diversity titled, ‘Birds of Surat-Dang: A consolidated checklist of 75 years (1944–2020)’ published in Journal of Threatened Taxa. The study has special emphasis on noteworthy bird records and hotspots from northern side of Western Ghats of Gujarat. The paper has been co-authored by Nikunj Jambu from Division of Avian Biology and Wildlife Biology, Department of Zoology, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda along with Kaushal Patel from Wildlife Conservation Society (Bengaluru).“Total 297 species belonging to 21 orders and 70 families has been recorded from the Surat-Dang landscape representing 51.03% of the avifauna recorded from the Gujarat and 22.85% of India’s bird species. Both the protected areas — Purna Wildlife Sanctuary (PWS) and Vansda National Park (VNP) — are home to 77.44 % (PWS) and 65.32 % (VNP) of the 297 species recorded from the landscape. The high diversity could be due to intense alterations in habitat fidelity over the past 125 years (1897–2020),” researchers said. Talking to TOI, Kaushal said, “We have reported a total of 297 bird species belonging to 70 families and 21 orders including the first record of Nilgiri Wood-Pigeon in Gujarat as well as PWS. We have re-reported Red Spurfowl, Jungle Bush Quail, White-spoted Fantail and Indian Yellow Tit, which were suspected to be locally extinct from PWS.”Authors say that 19 species fall under various categories as per the IUCN Red List. Seven each were categorized under near threatened and vulnerable categories, two each in critically endangered and endangered categories, while one as data deficient. Record of Western Ghat endemic Nilgiri Wood Pigeon from Surat-Dang is an addition to the bird list of the state.“Despite being a part of an endemic bird area and global biodiversity hotspot, avifaunal diversity has been less documented in PWS and VNP, the designated landscape. A handful of studies on birds have been conducted after Dr Salim Ali’s collection in 1944–48,” the researchers said. The duo surveyed both protected and non-protected areas in 2012–13 and 2015–2018 for documentation and presented a consolidated checklist of birds from the surveys as primary data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/297-bird-species-make-dang-their-home/articleshow/85160088.cms||Vijaysinh Parmar

The forest department and police personnel, however, took control of the situation before any untoward incident could take place. The tusker was first spotted at the Khoratwadi hamlet. The forest department staff arrived soon after being informed by the local residents. The foresters tried to drive the elephant out of the hamlet, but the animal instead took to Gadhinglaj-to-Ajara state highway. The elephant steadily moved along the main road and reached the Madilage bus stand. Scared, the local residents started making noise. Range forest officer Smita Dake said: “To prevent the tusker from turning violent, we asked the local police personnel to get the residents out of the animal’s way. Most of our employees followed the elephant — maintaining some distance — till it crossed the Hiranyakeshi river. The elephant entered the nearby forest after some time and we ensured that it returned safely to its natural habitat.” Raids by wild tuskers damaging crops are not new to the farmers in the Ajara-Chandgad forest belt. However, the animals are rarely seen wandering about in the residential areas. “I don’t know about the past, but since I took charge in May, I have seen a wild tusker inside human habitations for the first time. There are two tuskers in the region. The one that was seen on Sunday has not harmed anyone not has it damaged property. However, some crops were damaged along its path. There is a plan to limit the tuskers in the transit zone. The villagers have been opposing. The local representatives have called a meeting to convince the villagers,” said Dake. There is also a plan to drive the tuskers out of the Ajara-Chandgad forests into the forests in Karnataka with the help of trained elephants. This plan is still being worked out by the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/wild-elephant-enters-villages-in-ajara-foresters-drive-it-back-into-the-jungle/articleshow/85165563.cms||---

Delhi Traffic Police tweeted that the roads from Rajdhani Park Metro Station towards Mundka and from Tikri towards Peeragarhi faced snarls due to waterlogging and requested commuters to avoid them. Similarly, the Pul Prahladpur railway underpass was filled with two feet water, which led to closure of both the carriageways from Lal Kuan to Badarpur. Traffic police requested commuters to avoid this stretch on its Twitter handle. In south Delhi, waterlogging was reported at two places, including the crematorium at Mandi Road, which also resulted in the collapse of a portion of a wall. Dakshinpuri L-Block also got flooded. Continuous rain led to falling of trees in Greater Kailash-I (C-Block), CR Park (B-Block) and Lajpat Nagar-III (E-Block). North Delhi Municipal Corporation received reports of portions of buildings collapsing at nine places, including Kucha Patti, Ram Chawri Bazar, Hauz Quazi, Karala, Rama Vihar (Rohini), Pitampura, Asiyana Chowk, Chuna Mandi (Paharganj), Nihal Vihar and Kohat Enclave. There were reports of trees falling at 11 places and waterlogging at 28 places, including Chawri Bazar, Wazirabad, Mukherjee Nagar, Wazirabad Village, Begumpur, Alipur, Karala, Rohini, Pitampura and Ambedkar Park. At Shankar Road, slow traffic movement was reported due to waterlogging. “After zonal control rooms reported the problems, immediate action was taken by the departments concerned. Our teams got damaged trees removed to allow smooth movement of traffic on arterial and internal roads. Pumps were also installed at places,” said an official. Complaints of trees falling were reported from Sarai Rohilla, Moti Nagar, Naraina Village, Old Rajendra Nagar and Rohini. East Delhi Municipal Corporation reported zero incidents of waterlogging, trees falling and collapse of buildings in both Shahdara south and north zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/waterlogging-fallen-trees-disrupt-traffic-on-weekend/articleshow/85164255.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Despite police chief’s orders, no checks on cops irregular on duty||Ludhiana: Even as Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal claims of keeping a check on cops irregular on duty, the administration has been lax. The claim fell flat on August 6 when ASI Rajinderpal Singh was arrested with drugs and STF officials found that he was absent from duty for three days but marked present on the roznamcha (daily dairy report) by the SHO. Rajinderpal, posted at Daba police station, and his accomplices were held for drug peddling and 350kg poppy husk was recovered from their possession. During investigation, the STF found that the accused cop used to be irregular on duty and would go out to get drug consignments. When he was out with other accused to bring contraband, he was shown present at the police station. Earlier too, several cops were arrested by the police and the STF for drug peddling. In most of the cases, they were found to be absent or irregular. So in November 2019, Agarwal announced a check on the irregular cops and a dope test of those absent for a week. On November 19, 2019, the STF had arrested constable Amandeep Singh, 27, and recovered 51gm heroin from his possession, costing Rs 25 lakh in the international market. Amandeep was posted at police lines and was given the task of taking undertrials from Ludhiana Central Jail to the court complex. After STF arrested him, it was found that Amandeep was absent from duty for a month. The STF officials also claimed that he was into drug peddling for seven years and had used his uniform to procure and sell contraband and that was why he never got arrested. He also used to consume drugs while in uniform. The accused constable was also admitted to a de-addiction centre, but could not quit drugs.After Amandeep’s arrest, the top cop had stated, “If a cop is involved in such activities, he will certainly remain absent from duty. The Ludhiana police administration will get conducted dope tests of the cops absent for at least seven days. Besides, the senior official will also keep a tab on others who remain irregular.”Inspector Harbans Singh, in charge of Ludhiana STF, said, “In ASI Rajinderpal’s case, it was found that he was absent from duty for three days, but marked present. The SHO concerned has to mark attendance twice a day, morning and evening. Strict action has to be taken for writing wrong information in daily dairy report.” The inspector added, “The STF has arrested many cops in the past for drug peddling and in all the cases it was found that they would remain absent for two to three days, but never take an official leave. Moreover, no senior officer had ever questioned them for their absence. At times, they would join the duty in the morning and then leave with an excuse. The system has to be streamlined.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-police-chiefs-orders-no-checks-on-cops-irregular-on-duty/articleshow/85160137.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Goa||More than 260 academicians apply for post of Goa University VC||PANAJI: As the term of the current vice-chancellor of Goa University, Varun Sahni, ends on August 18, the varsity had begun the procedure to identify a new candidate for the post. The university has received over 260 applications for the position, possibly the first case of such an overwhelming demand for the vacancy. Of the 260 candidates, 23 have been shortlisted and interviews of these candidates will be conducted on August 25. The GU vice-chancellor holds the position for a term of five years. As Sahni’s term is set to end on August 18, an acting vice-chancellor is likely to be appointed to fill in for him till the VC arrives. Officials said that usually the senior-most dean is expected to be appointed as the acting vice-chancellor. But as per GU statutes, the current VC can also continue in the post till the time the successor is appointed. In June, the governor, who is chancellor of Goa University, initiated the process of identifying a new candidate for the post of vice-chancellor, by inviting applications from academicians who have over 10 years of experience. The 23 applicants have now been invited for a personal interview with the search committee. The governor had formed a three-member search panel to shortlist candidates for the VC’s post. Following the interviews, the chancellor will select the new appointee to the VC’s post from the three to five shortlisted candidates. If the chancellor does not approve any of the persons recommended by the selection committee, he can call for a fresh recommendation from the same committee, as per GU statutes. The three-member committee includes CSIR director general Dr Shekhar Mande, former NCERT director Jagmohan Singh Rajput and DRDO’s Dr G Satish Reddy. While the chancellor appoints one member to the selection team, one member is nominated by the state government and a third by the executive council of Goa University. “The vice-chancellor to be appointed should be a distinguished academician, with a minimum of ten years of experience as professor in a University system or ten years of experience in an equivalent position in a reputed research and/or academic administrative organization,” the GU statutes state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-than-260-academicians-apply-for-post-of-goa-univ-vc/articleshow/85164248.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Ludhiana||Man held for trying to kidnap woman, 2 kids||Ludhiana: The Dehlon police, on Sunday, arrested a man for attempting to kidnap a woman and her two children due to an old rivalry. The incident happened in July and the woman’s father said the police took 36 days to act. The accused, along with his accomplices, had chased the car in which the woman was travelling with her children from Dhandhra road to Alamgir village. The accused has been identified as Dilpreet Singh of Satjot Nagar in Dugri.Complainant Pardeep Singla of Sant Sundar Singh Nagar, Dhandhra Road, alleged that the accused had been harassing and attacking his family members for the past seven months. They had filed many complaints against the accused, but some of the senior officers of the Ludhiana police favoured them and did not lodge any report, he alleged.Singla added that on January 13, they had organized a Lohri function and hired Dilpreet Singh to arrange DJ and catering. Dilpreet created a ruckus at the function in an inebriated condition, following which they exchanged heated arguments. Thereafter, Dilpreet nursed a grudge against him.He alleged that the accused had smashed the windowpanes of the car of his son-in-law Tushar Bansal on June 1 in Model Town and on June 21 at Dugri Flyover. Again on June 30, the accused vandalised their car parked outside Tushar’s house in Sadar. Despite repeated complaints, the police did not lodge an FIR, he said.He said on July 2, the accused tried to kidnap his daughter and her two children. He again went to the police, but they took 36 days to lodge an FIR.Investigating officer from police station Dehlon ASI Ranjit Singh said the FIR has been lodged following an investigation under sections 364 (kidnapping), 511 (attempting to commit an offence) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/man-held-for-trying-to-kidnap-woman-2-kids/articleshow/85160147.cms||---

None of the results till date have indicated the presence of the Delta-plus strain in the state, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI. Genome sequencing at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, has detected the Delta strain in 64 out of 69 samples recently received by the directorate of health services. Out of the total of 184 samples sent by the state for genome sequencing during the second wave since March 1, 173 had the Delta strain. The Delta strain was the cause of the second wave and responsible for the acute rise and fall in Covid-19 cases. “We have already had a wave (second wave) due to the Delta strain. Another wave because of the Delta strain is unlikely. Delta will possibly not cause another huge epidemic outbreak in Goa.” “This is because a sizable population has developed immunity against it, but small clusters are possible. If a new mutation sets in, then we could see a wave,” Betodkar said. However, he also cautioned against becoming lax. “If we don’t want an outbreak, we must stay away from all functions, birthday parties and gatherings. We have taken precautions for the past one and a half years and we need to continue for a little while longer,” he said. “Other foreign nations who completely stopped enforcing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and stopped using masks have started imposing restrictions again. We don’t want to see another outbreak here so we must continue to follow Covid-19 appropriate protocol. Another 280 samples are still pending with NCCS, which receives around 75 samples every 15 days from Goa. Betodkar said each of Goa’s five labs — at Goa Medical College, North and South Goa district hospitals, sub district hospital, Ponda, and Victor hospital — send 15 random samples each, every 15 days, for genome sequencing. “The labs will be continuously sending samples for genome sequencing to keep a check on new mutations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/delta-strain-in-94-of-samples-since-march-21-delta-not-detected/articleshow/85164288.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Goa RERA frames rules to extend deadlines for housing projects by a year||PANAJI: The department of urban development has notified rules to extend the completion timelines for real estate projects, which are registered with the Goa Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). As per the rules, the builder will be given an additional period of one year to complete the project with any further extension being given on a case to case basis. The builder or real estate firm will have to apply to Goa RERA Authority at least three months before the validity of the registration period expires and only in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances the three-month period may be waived, Goa RERA chairperson S Kumaraswamy said. The rules — Extension of Registration of Real Estate Project by the Goa Real Estate Regulatory Authority Regulation, 2021 — provide guidelines to extend the validity period already approved for completion of the real estate project. Goa RERA will charge Rs 10 per sqm of the land proposed to be developed with a minimum of Rs 50,000 and a maximum of Rs 10 lakh for extending the project completion deadline. Kumaraswamy said that the builder will have to provide a proposed plan of the project showing the most recent stage of development along with an explanation for the delay in completion of the project. “An explanatory note regarding the state of development works in the project and reason for not completing the development works in the project within the period declared at the time of making registration of the project has to be submitted,” he said. Real estate firms will have to obtain all other approvals and extensions before they approach Goa RERA for extension. “Extension may be considered which shall in aggregate not exceed a period of one year. Extension beyond one year will be decided on case by case basis,” Kumaraswamy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-rera-frames-rules-to-extend-deadlines-for-hsg-projects-by-a-yr/articleshow/85164320.cms||---
---||Delhi||Yamuna level link to waterlogging? Officials say so||New Delhi: Levels of water in the Yamuna are also linked with the extent of waterlogging in Delhi. When Yamuna levels rise above 205m, the waterlogging situation worsens in the city. Delhi’s topography prevents gravity-based flow to the irrigation and flood department (I&FC)-managed bigger drains like Barapullah drain and supplementary drain, which carry the excess water to the river, said officials. A senior public works department official said drains in smaller colonies were managed by civic bodies, while drains along wider roads by the PWD “The drains managed by municipal corporations carry the excess runoff from colonies to the PWD drains. The PWD drains carry this excess water to bigger drains like Barapullah and Najafgarh that are connected to the river,” the official stated. “Recently when the level in the Yamuna had been above 204-205m, the gravity-based flow of water was hampered. If the level rises, water level in the I&FC drains increases and water from PWD drains can be discharged only by pumping. Gates of irrigation and flood department-managed drains are closed when the river level goes so high,” the official explained. Besides Najafgarh and supplementary drains, 17 more drains, including Dilli Gate, Mori Gate, Shahdara and Jahangirpuri drains, carry waste water into the river. The levels in the Yamuna had crossed the danger mark during the recent heavy rain due to release of more than 1.2 lakh cusecs water from Hathnikund Barrage in Haryana. The warning level is considered to be 204.5 m, while the danger level is 205.3m. According to data presented in the assembly, ten agencies are managing more than 2,846 drains that are wider than 4ft and whose cumulative length runs into 3,694km. Delhi had witnessed 506mm rain only in July and severe waterlogging scenes were witnessed all across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/yamuna-level-link-to-waterlogging-officials-say-so/articleshow/85164345.cms||---

The flight, run by Air India, had last operated on April 9.An Air India official said, “We have received a mail from the higher authorities about the extension of Ludhiana-Delhi flight’s suspension till August 31. Even as the government has allowed resumption of about 60% of the fights in the country, it is not on the list. The reasons are Covid-related issues. We don’t know whether the flight will be allowed after August 31. It might be resumed immediately post the date or after some time.”“The flight is expected to operate in the afternoon. As per the new directorate general civil aviation (DGCI) guidelines, there should be 5,000-metre visibility (against the earlier 1,500-metre) for flight landing. The meteorological department had stated that at Sahnewal the visibility is better between noon and 3pm. As per the last schedule, the flight is expected to depart from Ludhiana at 5.25pm. It will take off from Delhi around 3.45pm,” said sources in Air India.Air India officials said they were getting queries about the resumption of the flight. They added that as air travel is considered safe, passengers prefer it.Residents are waiting for the flight to restart. “I have to go to Bengaluru as I work there. I prefer air travel as it saves time.

Though she managed to come through the Covid infection, the virus badly damaged her lungs. For the last 76 days she was surviving on a ventilator and her family’s prayers. Throughout the last two-and-half months her family tried their best for organ transplant but to no avail. When they had all but given up, the woman found her saviour, Mansukh Kathrotia — a diamond polisher from Surat. The lungs of Kathrotia, who was declared brain-dead, were transplanted into the woman on Saturday night. “The lungs were transported through a commercial flight from Surat to Chennai and were transplanted into the 51-year-old woman at MGM Hospital in Chennai,” said Nilesh Mandlewala, founder member of ‘Donate Life’. It was Mandlewala who had approached Kathrotia’s family with the request of organ donation. Kathrotia, a resident of Opera Prince in Kamrej, suffered a brain stroke on August 2. His CT-Scans revealed that he had suffered brain hemorrhage and on Friday the doctors declared him brain-dead. After being informed by the doctors, Mandlewala and other members of DonateLife, which works for creating awareness about organ donation, reached the hospital. “We met the kin of the brain-dead patient and explained about the importance of cadaver donation and they readily agreed to it,” Mandlewala told TOI. Later, State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) convener Dr Pranjal Modi was alerted about it. SOTTO allocated Kathrotia’s two kidneys and a liver to Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC) in Ahmedabad and lungs were allocated to Chennai-based MGM hospital. The two corneas were donated to Lok Drishti Eye bank in Surat. Though Kathrotia’s kidneys were harvested it was declared unfit for transplant due to formation of blood clots. “My husband’s death came as a big blow to all of us. We come from an economically poor family and have nothing to donate. But in his death he has gifted life to a few and smiles to their many relatives,” Reeta, Kathrotia’s wife, said. Kathrotia is survived by his wife, son Dhruv (13) and daughter Khushi (3). He is a native of Chalala town of Amreli district. At a time when organ donation slowed down due to Covid-19 across the country, Surat has contributed a lot in the field. “We were successful in donating 111 organs and tissues from brain-dead patients in the past one year. We must thank the kin of the brain-dead patients who agreed for cadaver donation and save lives of others,” Mandlewala added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-mans-lungs-save-mp-woman-hit-by-covid/articleshow/85160166.cms||---
---||Delhi||North forest division there since Mar, but yet to get any functional power||New Delhi: If you have applied for permission to chop or prune a tree in north Delhi, your permission may still be lying pending. Officials claim that the newly-created north forest division is yet to see the appointment of a tree-officer, with no statutory powers given to the Deputy Conservator of Forest either, until an approval from the lieutenant governor is received. The division, which was reconstituted in March 2021, saw its jurisdiction change, with large parts of the west division, as well as areas of central Delhi now falling under it. The previous “north” division was re-christened as the central division. Officials, however, say the process to grant powers after this process may take a few more weeks. A senior forest official in the north forest division said while on-ground work had already begun, the department was still awaiting functional powers. A file for the same has already been sent to the LG. “Once approved, permissions under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, can be provided. These include permissions to chop or prune trees, as well as take action against violators,” said an official. The division said records were being maintained for “pending” applications, with important requests being transferred to the west forest division for approval at the moment. “The process should be completed in a week or two. Inspections to give approvals for requests have also been ongoing simultaneously and will be approved once powers are provided,” an official added. The DCF can also act as a tree officer once statutory powers are provided, while he is also the highest authority — on par with a DCP of the police force in terms of taking action against tree and wildlife-related offences. To create a new division, the forest and wildlife department had moved a file in 2018, stating it was becoming increasingly difficult to function, owing to the large area under the west division. The west division earlier stretched from Narela in north Delhi to Dwarka in southwest Delhi, taking time for field officers to move from one complaint to another. The frontline staff, which primarily consists of forest guards and lower level labourers, in an ordinary day were being forced to travel almost 2-3 hours just to cater to complaints of trees being felled in their respective forest ranges, with the DCF often required to set out himself to carry out inspections and file reports. Narela, which was earlier part of the west division now forms a part of the north division, while the west district, including Punjabi Bagh, Rajouri Garden and Patel Nagar, is also part of the north division now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-forest-division-there-since-mar-but-yet-to-get-any-functional-power/articleshow/85164405.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||India||Posts against judges: CBI arrests five, quizzes YSR netas||NEW DELHI: The CBI has arrested five suspects in the last one month in connection with investigation in a case of posting derogatory messages against judges and the judiciary. The agency has also examined Lok Sabha MP Nandigam Suresh and former MLA Amanchi Krishnamohan, both belonging to YSR Congress, in the case. While three of suspects were arrested in July, two were held on August 7, just a day after Chief Justice N V Ramana rued that judges were not on priority for investigating agencies and that their complaints of being harassed or intimidated were not heeded despite specialised bodies like CBI being roped in. The two suspects arrested now have been identified as Pattapu Aadarsh and Lavanuru Samba Siva Reddy. Agency spokesperson R C Joshi said the duo was being produced before a court at Guntur in Andhra Pradesh. Prior to this, CBI arrested two accused on July. They were identified as Pamula Sudheer, in custody for interrogation till August 10, and Dhani Reddy Konda Reddy who is in judicial custody. CBI had registered a case on November 11 last year against 16 people and taken over investigation of 12 FIRs from CID, Andhra Pradesh, in pursuance of the orders of the high court. The original FIRs were registered on complaints of Registrar General of High Court of Andhra Pradesh. It was alleged that the accused intentionally targeted the judiciary by making derogatory posts on social media platforms against judges and judiciary, following certain court verdicts. CBI had made the first arrest in the case on July 9 when a suspect named Lingareddy Rajasekhar Reddy landed from Kuwait. "CBI traced 13 of the 16 accused named in FIR in the case on various digital platforms. Three out of them were found to be abroad. CBI has so far examined 11 out of above 13 accused persons and arrested five out of them. CBI is pursuing to secure the presence of two other accused said to be abroad," CBI spokesperson R C Joshi said. Searches were also conducted by CBI at the premises of the accused which led to recovery of several incriminating documents. It was also found that one accused was allegedly using a passport with a name different from his real identity. The CBI had many of the objectionable posts removed from public domain. "Investigation is continuing through the channels of MLAT, Interpol," the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/posts-against-judges-cbi-arrests-five-quizzes-ysr-netas/articleshow/85166355.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

While she was admitted for tubal ligation procedure to prevent pregnancy, a health worker inserted a cannula on her elbow. A portion of the cannula broke while it was being removed by a nurse after the procedure and was stuck in her vein.When the woman complained of pain in her elbow, doctors said a surgery was needed to remove the broken piece and referred her to CMCH.The woman was rushed to CMCH on Saturday and the operation was performed within an hour. CMCH dean A Nirmala termed it an unusual case. “While it is not sure if the product was defective, manual error cannot be ruled out in this case as cannula doesn’t easily break, as it happened in this case,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/docs-remove-broken-cannula-from-vein/articleshow/85162031.cms||---
---||Delhi||Most animals that die on NCR roads amphibians, says DU college study||New Delhi: A majority of the animals dying on Delhi-NCR roads are amphibians such as toads, a study by Sri Venkateswara College of Delhi University has found. According to the study, monsoons are the breeding time for many animals. The animals generally move for foraging and to look for breeding sites and mates. “But unfortunately, many animals become roadkill while migrating (mostly in urban setup). Unlike larger animals like leopards, etc, death of such animals often goes unnoticed,” said Robin Suyesh, assistant professor of Sri Venkateswara College’s department of environmental science. He stated that the roadkill survey conducted this monsoon showed the deaths of several smaller animals, including rodents, lizards, insects, and primarily amphibians. “Among amphibians, the slow-moving toads were the biggest victims, comprising more than 60% of the total animals that were found dead on roads during the survey.” The assistant professor explained that amphibians are known for their poor dispersion ability and fragmentation of their habitat makes them prone to local extinctions. For frogs, roads act as a man-made barrier, reduce their dispersion ability, kill them and reduce their population density. “Delhi-NCR already has a very low population density of amphibians. They are struggling to survive due to multiple anthropogenic disturbances. Mostly amphibians can be seen in the urban green spaces and on the outer limits of the city, but expanding city and upcoming developmental projects are destroying their habitat and are making them vulnerable to local extinction. Roadkill is another major reason that brings down their population density,” Suyesh said. The study further stated that amphibians migrate in search of the breeding sites and tend to cross the roads as their habitats in the city are severely fragmented by roads. The movement across the roads, which happens mostly during the night (as they are nocturnal), makes them more vulnerable to roadkill. Suyesh said that “a general driving awareness among people is important to ensure the safety of animals, including amphibians. Local bodies and authorities also need to look into this issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/most-animals-that-die-on-ncr-roads-amphibians-says-du-college-study/articleshow/85164452.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

EOW was formed in 1999 to deal with cases relating to default in repayment of deposits after maturity by non-banking financial companies and unincorporated financial institutions. CCIW units are present in 29 districts and EOW in 15 districts.“CCIW personnel register one or two cases a year. Most of them don’t work on weekends. But EOW personnel are investigating several financial frauds and the wing desperately needs more people,” a source said. “Former director general of police J K Tripathy had sent the merger proposal to effectively use manpower.”CCIW is functioning at Jawans Bhavan in Coimbatore city, where it has 20 personnel including a deputy superintendent of police. EOW-II, based at the city police commissionerate, has 15-20 personnel.“The EOW unit here occupies a small office. If the CCIW unit is merged with EOW, there won’t be enough space for all the personnel. So, we are planning to seek permission to construct an exclusive office for the EOW unit,” said a senior police officer. “Several cases are pending with EOW due to manpower shortage. The state government should take immediate steps to merge the wings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/delay-in-merger-of-cciw-eow-mars-effective-probe-into-financial-frauds/articleshow/85162048.cms||---

The slow start to monthly supply has left many officials worried. They said that routine and special vaccination drives — including mobile vaccine camps and outreach programmes for certain groups — have been severely impacted by vaccine shortages. In PMC limits alone, more than 200 vaccination sites had to stay shut for three days in the first week of August due to vaccine scarcity. In July, government-run vaccination centres were sent more than 10 lakh doses, which were mostly used as first doses. Officials are still hoping for similar supply levels this month. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “We were told that vaccine supply would improve in August. So far, that hasn’t happened. We are aware of the erratic supply and its impact on the vaccination drive, but it’s the Centre that is sending the vaccines.” He said that there has been no clarity on how or when the supply of Covishield is set to improve this month. But he said he's confident that more doses will be arriving soon. “Also, demand for Covaxin is currently low at private hospitals of the district. It could mean more doses of the vaccine for government sites and more of it being used to give people their first or second dose of a Covid shot,” he added. Private hospitals may also be key to increasing double-dose coverage. Turnout has been low for paid jabs and it’s estimated that private units currently have thousands of doses in their reserves. Hospital administrators said they are focusing on second-dose beneficiaries. A source from a leading private hospital in the city said the unit has at least 25,000 doses of Covishield in its reserves. On Sunday, due to the ongoing scarcity and a vaccination holiday at many sites, just over 8,000 people were vaccinated against Covid in the district. On Monday, officials from the PCMC said they will hold vaccination drives from 72 centres. At least 60 centres have been set aside to give Covishield jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/august-vaccine-supply-still-to-pick-up-officials-worried/articleshow/85162005.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The residents, who also complained about dust pollution, said they had shot off letters to various authorities and the city corporation to complete the work at the earliest, but to no avail.J Sivaraj, a commuter, said it was difficult to travel on the stretch that was filled with gravel. As it is the short route for him to enter the main road, he, however, continues to travel on the stretch. “I used to service my bike only once in four months. Because of the poor condition of the road, the bike needs to be serviced once in two months now. The work should be completed at the earliest, as many people are affected.”N R Ravishankar, president, Consumer Awareness and Protection Association, said they had taken up the issue of pathetic condition of roads at Cheran Ma Nagar and surrounding areas with authorities a year ago, following which the government allotted funds for relaying them. “Work started early this year and the roads were relaid at Cheran Ma Nagar and nearby areas. For some reason, work on the main road was abruptly stopped after paving gravel. We have made several representations to the authorities to resume the work, but there is no response yet,” he said.S Pandiaraj, another resident, said the dust from the unfinished road was a major concern and posing them health risks. “Elderly people are developing respiratory problems because of the prolonged exposure to the dust. The issue should be addressed by completing the road work at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vilankurichi-road-kumutham-nagar-stretch-in-tatters-cries-for-attention/articleshow/85162064.cms||V Devanathan

Vice-chancellors and university heads have said that students from new places that had never enrolled before like some southern states, Rajasthan, Punjab and New Delhi have enrolled in their varsities and they attributed the trend to the entire system from start to end going virtual.Principal director of Symbiosis Society, Vidya Yeravadekar, said they have noticed an increase in the number of registrations. “Our enrolments like usual are more from the northern states. Due to the pandemic, we were anxious about students enrolling in universities away from their home. But surprisingly more students have enrolled. Our percentage of outside Maharashtra students is always more.”Symbiosis had conducted a home proctored entrance test so the university received registrations from all states of India including Jammu & Kashmir and also the southern states.The university has received entries from a lot of northeast students this time.Confirming the trend, Rakesh Jain, director of JSPM’s Rajarshi Shahu College of Engineering ,said that the students were leveraging the current mode which was virtual. “It could be the admission process, teaching-learning process, assessment and evaluation, and also students’ career progression at the end of the term, everything has taken the online mode. In short, admissions to placements to higher education, everything has gone online and it has created a win-win situation for students and institutes,”he added .All universities quoted a 5-7% rise in applications from outside. Jain said that, at their institute, the students were enrolling from places that had never enrolled before like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and others.Pro-vice-chancellor of MIT World Peace University, Milind Pande, said the university was experiencing this trend with students applying from all over the country including from Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal. Pande said, “The visibility about various colleges across India has increased during the pandemic as students and their parents find out information about colleges digitally browsing across their websites and videos and then take decisions. Those interested in pursuing their further studies abroad are preferring colleges with international tie-ups. We had received applications last year also, but Pune being a hot-spot then many of these applications didn’t convert into admissions. But with situation easing and college students accepting virtual education as the new normal, at least for now, students from across the country are applying.”Pande added that students were selecting out-of-the-box courses like data analytics, design, liberal arts, public health, bio-physics, nano physics, hotel management, machine learning, robotics, augmented reality apart from basic and popular courses like mechanical engineering and computer engineering.Last year, Ajeenkya D Y Patil University saw less response from students elsewhere. However, this year the university is noticing that students are wanting to consider the university and looking to enrol. Vice-chancellor of the university, Hrridaysh Deshpande, said, “Last year was an exception where many students took a break. A break is something they cannot take again. We are seeing students returning to us and we do hope more and more think similarly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/enrolments-from-new-places-go-up-with-online-education/articleshow/85162089.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The gang had committed four back-to-back crimes in Karol Bagh in the last few months, creating panic among businessmen. The accused have been identified as Mohammed Ali (52), Mohammed Kabli (45), Anwar Ali (45), Shoukat Ali Jafri (55) and Mukhtyar Hussain (35) who were living in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. They used to travel from one city to another and commit the crimes. “The accused were earlier declared proclaimed offenders by courts after committing crimes in Malviya Nagar, Bara Hindu Rao and Vasant Kunj areas,” DCP (central) Jasmeet Singh said. On June 27, a PCR call regarding snatching of 300 gram of gold by criminals posing as CBI sleuths was received at Bank Street in Karol Bagh. It was found that four-five people approached the complainant on the pretext of checking his bag and took away his gold. An FIR was registered and investigation was initiated under ACP Vidushi Kaushik and SHO Manish Joshi. The team scanned CCTV footage from Karol Bagh market to Pusa Road — covering the stretch of almost a kilometre.

But streets were deserted today. Although it is a loss for the business community, it is good for the people in the health perspective,” said G Selvakumar, an autorickshaw driver.Although key commercial areas were closed, others witnessed normal activity. People thronged meat and fish stalls. While social distancing norms went for a toss at such places, people mostly complied with the mask rule. “We do not allow people without masks in shops, as it would affect other customers. However, it is difficult to ensure distancing as customers are not following it,” said a fishmonger at Ganapathy.City buses plied as usual, but with a limited number of passengers. Bus terminals also witnessed less crowd.Some businessmen voluntarily closed their shops, although the areas were not brought under intensive restrictions, to help the district administration fight Covid-19.Vehicle movement was marginally low compared to normal Sundays as people avoided visiting friends and relatives due to pandemic fear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/residents-comply-with-lockdown-rules/articleshow/85162152.cms||---

Only 21% of the population has received the second dose in the district, which, as in the earlier case, lags behind only Chennai and Nilgiris.P Aruna, deputy director of health services, said most of the elderly people aged above 60 years had realized the importance of vaccination. “Hence, they are volunteering to get inoculated. And this is one of the reasons that helped us vaccinate more than 50% of them with the first dose.”When asked about administering the second dose of vaccine on the remaining 80% of the elderly people, she just said people in the high-risk category would be given priority. “Preference will also be given to those who are due to take the second dose.”When it comes to the total population aged above 18 years, the district has vaccinated 11.89 lakh of the 38-40 lakh people. There is no data to show how many of 11.89 lakh have received both the doses.When the inoculation drive began in May, only 1% of the population was vaccinated and there was a resistance among the public to take the jab. Now, 30% of the population has taken the shot. The scenario had changed upside down in recent weeks, when there was an unprecedented demand for vaccine. But there is a shortage of vaccine, which often leads to chaos with people running from pillar to post to get inoculated.S Sivasubramaniam, 65, a resident of Nanjundapuram, said, “There was a real crisis in May and June, when people had to stand overnight in queues without maintaining social distancing to get inoculated. The token distribution was then influenced by political elements.”G Vidya, 68, of Avarampalayam, recalled how she finally got the first dose in May after waiting in queue at a nearby primary health centre for two weeks in vain. She was inoculated at a private hospital, after paying for the vaccine.V Moorthy, 62, a resident of Sowripalayam, said it would be impossible to vaccinate the majority population in the next few months by inoculating just 10,000 or 11,000-odd people a day. “Most people are relying on government facilities, as they cannot afford Rs 1,000 for vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/half-of-elderly-population-gets-first-dose-of-vaccine/articleshow/85162165.cms||Sampath Kumar

The notification of scheduled areas from 1950 with an aim of protecting their culture and development has not yet yielded desired results.Over the years, it has been noticed that their reliance has increased manifold on outer space. “They usually grow local crops which provide food-cum-fodder for them and their livestock, respectively. Since the government is not providing them subsidy on crops which they grow like millets they are shunning the crops for rice, wheat and soybean,” said Jayesh Joshi, secretary of Vaghdahar, an NGO working for the uplift of tribals in the state.The less development in the tribal region has seen a massive rate of migration which has completely changed the family/social system of the subgroups. “The tribals follow a unique social system called ‘Halma’ in which the entire lineage lives in close harmony providing social and financial security to each other. In the past three decades, massive industrial growth in Gujarat and Maharashtra added with poverty has forced tribal youths to migrate leaving fewer men in the families. It has disunited the harmony and killed the spirit of collective practices like fairs, festivals, marriages and deaths,” said Rashmi Jain, head of department sociology, Rajasthan University.The decline in Haat Bazaar is gradually ruining their traditional art and robbing them of sustainable livelihood opportunities. Mahaveer Kharadi, a senior RAS officer who comes from Bhil tribal clan from Banswara says tribals have lost their market forever with the decline of the weekly market system called ‘Haat’. “The roaster-based weekly marker system had been the lifeline of tribals until two and half-decades ago. It was an opportunity for every tribal to sell their product and to buy their needful items. Here barter system added with credit system existed until the economy opened in 1990,” said Kharadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tribals-fast-losing-traditions-cultural-practices/articleshow/85162167.cms||---

However, when doctors counseled them that it was just common cold, they were relieved. Hospitals are witnessing increasing number of cases with upper respiratory tract infections, allergy and asthma, influenza, cough and fever during monsoon. “What is important is that the city is not witnessing Covid transmission much. We also check if a patient has any history of travelling to other states while clinically examining such cases for diagnosing the disease. Some parents look anxious and worried when they bring their children to the hospital with influenza-like illness symptoms. In some suspected cases, we get Covid test done too. Parents should also consult doctors if children gets symptoms similar to Covid,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, head of the department (medicine), JK Lon Hospital. Since experts predict that more children will get affected during the third wave, a lot of parents of children suffering from even common cold and influenza get tensed. Doctors pointed out that anxiety due to fear of Covid is also a major issue. Doctors attributed rise in common cold, influenza and respiratory tract infection cases to rains and change in weather. Though rains have provided relief from the scorching heat, it has brought along seasonal illnesses. Not only in children, but also in adults, upper respiratory tract infection, body ache, fever, cough and cold have become quite common during monsoon. “New Covid admissions have gone down drastically as the state is reporting 20-30 daily infections. However, we have witnessed rise in cases such as throat infection, common influenza and other such symptoms which resembles to the symptoms of covid,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, dedicated Covid RUHS Hospital. During monsoon, the vector-borne disease cases also go up. However, in July, only 11cases of dengue were reported in Jaipur. Health department officials said they were conducting door-to-door survey in different parts of the state to keep a check on seasonal diseases such as dengue, malaria, scrub typhus and influenza.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/common-influenza-throat-infection-fuel-anxiety-among-parents-amid-fear-of-third-wave/articleshow/85162151.cms||---

The TSP areas enjoy special schemes under the central and state government for the development of tribal areas. At present, 5,697 villages are under the SA.Census report says that the population has ST population is increasing in the state from 2.5% in 1991 to 2.9% in 2001 to 3.2% in 2011. The highest rise in population was recorded from 2001 to 2011 in Dungarpur by 5.7%, Udaipur by 3.6% and Pratapgarh by 3.5%.They claimed that villages/areas under Pindwara in Sirohi, Bali in Pali, Khamnor and Nathdwara in Rajsamand, Bhindar, Kurabad and Girva in Udaipur, Chhoti Sadri and Badi Sadri in Chittorgarh have become eligible for SA.Bodies like Aadivasi Parivar, Bhil Pradesh Mukti Morcha, Mahisagar Foundation, Mission 73 along with a political party, BTP is pitching for more areas to be listed under SA areas.Prakriti Kharadi, former chairperson of State Tribal Commission feels that the listed areas should be granted the status at the earliest in order to bring justice to over five to seven lakh more tribals.“These villages are just the tip of an iceberg. The state should carry out the counting every second year to see that if any villages become eligible, it should be added as and when,” said Kharadi.Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) is on the fore pressing these demands says that with the expanding tribal areas the reservation scheme should also change. “The states like Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra provides reservation as per the population of the tribal. In Rajasthan, the population for ST are up to 70% but the reservation is just 45% of the population,” said Vela Ram Ghogra, president of BTP.He also demanded that Gram Sabhas are powered to be given full rights for local matters like mining NOC, forest rights, Liquor rules, Cultural Empowerment, Women’s rights under the scheduled areas.The SA means norms will become in sync with the Tribal areas. From change in reservation schemes to additional powers to the Gram Sabhas. The 5th Schedule of Indian Constitution which guarantees the status of Scheduled Areas which allows president and the governors to implement the law of state or the union. Last in 2018, 341 villages were added under the SA by the president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tribals-want-165-panchayats-under-scheduled-areas/articleshow/85162183.cms||Shoeb Khan

The victim, Rajesh Kumar (38), runs a small grocery shop where he also sells cattle fodder for six nearby villages.On Saturday night, he was fast asleep when six masked men entered his house through the main gate after unlocking the ramshackle latch on the door. Rajesh told cops that one of the accused was holding a firearm, suspected by the police to be a countrymade revolver, colloquially known as desi katta.The accused were rifling through Rajesh’s house taking away jewelry and petty cash. The stunned family members stood in silence when one of the accused menacingly asked the shopkeeper to reveal the place where money was kept.Dazed and petrified, Rajesh pointed to his bed where Rs 6 lakh in cash were hidden. The accused rolled up the mattresses and took away the cash underneath.Before leaving the house, the accused locked the door from the outside and disappeared into the main road leading to Haryana. According to Paniyala police station, Goneda village is located on the edge of the Rajasthan-Haryana interstate border.According to Jaipur (Rural) SP, the police teams were following up on leads in pursuit of the accused. A team led by Kotputli DSP Dinesh Kumar Yadav was examining the CCTV camera to zero in on the accused. “The prima facie evidence points out that the accused knew about Rajesh and his house. The shopkeepers in rural areas tend to keep the cash with them, instead of depositing it into the bank daily. The suspects knew that Rajesh kept large sums of money and broke into his house,” an official told TOI.The victim claimed that the accused also smashed the family’s mobile phones so that they could not summon any help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/armed-men-loot-rs-6-lakh-cash-jewelry-from-shopkeeper-in-kotputli/articleshow/85162224.cms||---

The money was transferred from his account through two transactions. According to the complainant Deepu Dodiya, his SIM card was blocked on July 2 by the telecom company. He said that he had received a call from customer care asking if his phone had been lost or stolen since they had received a request to block the SIM card. Despite Dodiya informing that he hasn’t made any such request, his SIM was blocked on the same evening. Next day when he went to the telecom company’s store, he was informed that the request for blocking his SIM card was made by some other person. After Dodiya’s SIM card was restored, he received two SMS stating that Rs 2.6 lakh were debited from his cash credit and current accounts. On checking with the bank, Dodiya learnt that the money was transferred to the bank account of one Vishal Kumar Singh through RTGS and IMPS. Since the transactions were irreversible, Dodiya approached police and based on his complaint, an offence of cheating and under the Information Technology Act was registered at Cyber Crime police station. Police said that the accused must have got the SIM card used by the complainant blocked. Later, the accused must have got a new SIM card of the same number issued. “Using the new SIM card, the accused must have got access to bank OTP and he transferred money from the complainant’s bank accounts,” said a police official.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 6.5 crore-year-old basalt columns discovered in Adilabad forest||HYDERABAD: Rare basalt columns, estimated to be over 6.5 crore years old, were discovered by a group of history enthusiasts in Bazar Hatnur forests of Adilabad district in Telangana. Geologists said that basalt columns were formed in the Deccan plateau due to volcanic eruptions some 65 million years ago. These rock formations are found in the southern and southeastern parts of Telangana in Rangareddy, Medak, Nizamabad and Adilabad districts. Kotta Telangana Charitra group members reported that ‘basalt columns’ were widely found in the reserve forests in Adilabad. Historian Sriramoju Haragopal said, “Similar formations were found earlier in Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Deccan Traps are one of the most significant volcanic features on the earth. Basaltic rocks consist of polygonal patterns and columnar joints. There are 6.5 crore years old.” Former deputy director-general, Geological Survey of India, Chakilam Venugopal said: “The thick pile of volcanic flows, widely spread in the west coast and Deccan plateau, is commonly known as Deccan Traps. These traps, spread as thin sheets of basic lava erupted from fissures, occur as flat-topped mountains all over the states of Maharashtra, parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Telangana. Towards the west and central part of the Deccan main mass, the flows are thick and rapidly erupted .On the southern margin and eastern fringes, they are less in number and not rapidly erupted, allowed the formation of inter trappean.” These lava flows, at places, developed polygonal cracks at the stage of solidification and these cracks vertically extended, forming interlocking columns are eventually exposed to weathering, resulting in uniquely patterned columnar patterns to the area. These columnar basalts sometimes appear as man-made features due to the imposing columnar patterns. In India, such columnar basalts are known to occur at St Mary’s Island (Udipi, Karnataka), Andheri (Mumbai) and Kolhapur (both in Maharashtra). The columnar basalt of St Mary’s Island has been declared a national geological monument. “The southeastern margin of Deccan Traps extend to Telangana all along Maharashtra border. Columnar basalt are, however, not known in this area. The recorded columnar basalt from Adilabad appears to be a new record,” Venugopal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/6-5cr-yr-old-basalt-columns-discovered-in-adilabad-forest/articleshow/85164303.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The police identified the accused as Shehzada Salim alias Dadda. “We have recovered one stolen idol from him, remaining other idols and ornaments will soon be found,” said ACP (Ramganj) Sunil Prasad Sharma, adding that the accused have multiple cases against him at Brahmpuri and Galta Gate police stations. Sharma said that local police teams were searching for suspects in nearby areas when they found a clue about the accused and detained him for questioning. He was arrested late on Sunday night. The authorities of the Jain temple claimed that some of the stolen idols were nearly 300 years old, and made of ashtadhatu (octal metal). “When we came to the temple for morning puja, we found that locks were broken while several of the idols were missing,” said one of the administrators of the temple, Rajiv Tholiya. He claimed that one of the stolen idols was found during the excavation and placed here in 2011 for devotees. Besides idols, silver ornaments of about 4.5 kg were also stolen the same night. Ramganj police suspect that the accused used screwdrivers to break locks of cabins behind which idols were kept. The temple is located in the Ucha Kuan area of Haldiyon Ka Rasta. The narrow lanes of the area usually keep buzzing late at night. Yet, no local reported any suspicious activity. A devotee, Rajendra Jain, told TOI that the Jain temple is nearly 100 years old. “The temple here is also known locally as Ladi Bai temple,” he said. According to Sharma, a similar theft was reported from another temple located in the same area where a bronze statue was stolen. The police suspect that the arrested accused may have been involved in both thefts. “The accused is a resident of the Galta Gate area. He has been arrested in the past too. Prima facie it appears that he alone broke into the Jain temple. But we are interrogating him to find out if other suspects had accompanied him in the theft,” an official said. Till late night, the city police were making efforts to recover all idols stolen by the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/idols-silver-ornaments-stolen-from-jain-temple-one-held/articleshow/85162258.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Buying ORS? Most brands in market too sweet, don’t have WHO formula||HYDERABAD: With a plethora of flavoured and non-World Health Organisation (WHO) standard ORS being sold in the name of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), most parents end up giving the wrong formula to children when they suffer with diarrhoea or vomiting. Doctors have now raised an alarm over such sweetened drinks being sold as ORS. High sugar content in flavoured versions actually worsen the symptoms and many times children end up being hospitalised. In fact, ORS should never be sweet in taste and these non-WHO standard sweetened ones do more harm than good to patients, according to experts. “Almost everyday we get such cases where parents bring in their children saying their condition had worsened despite giving ORS. When we check what they gave, it is usually the flavoured ORS tetrapacks which have a high content of added sugar. Nowadays most parents buy these after falling for misleading names used by many brands which have sugar and salts in violation of what’s recommended by WHO,” said Dr Sivaranjani Santosh, chief paediatrician, Magna Centres. While too much sugar on one hands adds to diarrhoea, less than required salt does not adequately compensate its loss. This goes for even non-flavoured ones which do not mention on the label that they have the formula recommended by the WHO. “As a result many children end up in the hospital. While those that don’t follow WHO formula can be taken as energy drink, they shouldn’t be used when ORS is recommended for a patient suffering from diarrhoea or vomiting,” added the doctor. Parents’ lack of awareness as well as children’s preference for them and a market flooded with these sweetened versions has added to the problem. “While sugar increases the osmolarity of the drink making it even more dehydrating, it defeats the whole purpose of giving ORS. But children also prefer this as they are now used to flavoured versions which are harmful for them. We see these kind of cases every day. Children can get extreme dehydration and shock due to these drinks,” explained Dr Satish Ghanta, neonatologist and paediatric intensivist, Little Stars Children’s Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/buying-ors-most-brands-in-market-too-sweet-dont-have-who-formula/articleshow/85164582.cms||Amrita Didyala

The GHMC’s pilot project for the online platform is being tested and it plans to roll it out soon. It has given hospitals two months to upload the details. “We have started reviewing and issuing certificates as per the new procedure and the results are satisfactory,” a GHMC official said. The civic body also informed that as per the new procedure, the applicants do not need to visit GHMC offices and submit the application for the certificates. In fact, the corporation would issue the certificates within a week after the hospitals uploads the details. However, to issue a death certificate, there are two approaches. If the person dies at home, the family should take a receipt from the burial ground and submit it to the GHMC citizen service centre (CSC). After which the certificate could be obtained from Meeseva. But in case the death is in the hospital, the management should directly enter the details online. After approval from the registrar of births and deaths, the applicant can take the certificate from Meeseva. A digital certificate can also be downloaded from the MY GHMC app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-plans-e-portal-for-birth-death-certs/articleshow/85164608.cms||---

Other accused are Ramchandra, Ram Singh, Jaikishan, Leela and Sumeru Pandit. Now, the police will have to arrest the accused before September 24, the next date of hearing. Earlier, the high court had issued a stay order against the previous order of issuance of arrest warrant in view of Covid-19. Recently, the Supreme Court had issued an order making such a stay order effective only for six months. Based on this order, these arrest warrants have been issued again. On July 10, 2017, the Sadar Hansi police had registered a case on the complaint of Ajay Kumar against Chander Fauji Pandit, Ramchander, Sadhu, Jaikishan, Lila, Sumeru Pandit, Sarpanch of Bhatla village under Sections 153-A, 504, 505, 506, 34 of the IPC and Sections 3 (1) (r), 3 (1) (z), 3 (1) (za), 3 (2) of the SC/ST Act. After investigation, police filed a chargesheet against Chandra Fauji and discharged the rest. But, later the discharged persons were made accused under Section 319 of the CrPC. Against this order, six accused, including the sarpanch representative, had filed a revision petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court, which was stayed for a date. Advocate Rajat Kalsan said the Supreme Court in the case of Indian Resurfacing of Road Agency vs Central Bureau of Investigation passed an order on July 21, 2021, saying that the cases in which the high court had issued a stay will not be effective after six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bhatla-social-boycott-arrest-warrants-issued-against-6-accused/articleshow/85164614.cms||---

A 45-year-old person, who returned from Mumbai to his hometown Dhariyawad in Pratapgarh on July 29, tested positive along with four other relatives. He and his wife tested positive four days ago and now his daughter, uncle and aunt were found infected. Health secretary Siddharth Mahajan at a review meeting on Covid headed by chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday had specifically pointed out that people in Udaipur belt travelling from Maharasthra and Gujarat and entering Rajasthan from its southern part should be careful. Chief medical health officer (Pratapgarh) Dr Vishnu Dayal Meena said, “The person, who had come from Mumbai, was found infected during routine surveillance. Our teams are camping in the area for the past four days and taking samples. We are also keeping an eye on people coming from other states.” Weekly positivity rate and active cases have started to plateau in the state. The highest positivity rate is in Pali at 0.46%. In the state, 14 districts do not have been a single active case of Covid. The weekly positivity rate in the state remained 0.07% for the past two weeks as it has started to plateau. The weekly positivity rate from May 8-14 was 23.13%, the highest the state has ever seen. At that time, one out of four persons were testing positive for Covid. For nine weeks in a row, positivity rate has fallen and now in the 10th week, it remained unchanged. Out of 30,371 samples collected for Covid testing, 15 were found infected with a daily positivity rate of 0.04%. However, when it comes to opening of schools, the state government is treading cautiously. It is reviewing the Covid situation in other states before taking any decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-mumbai-returned-labourer-tests-positive-three-family-members-found-infected-in-pratapgarh/articleshow/85162275.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||HSSC asks DGP to lodge FIR in paper leak||Chandigarh: A day after cancelling the examination for the recruitment of constables in Haryana Police, the chairman of Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) on Sunday asked the Haryana DGP to register a case into leak of answer key. The move has come as the police have smelt a rat on the part of officials of the agency involved in design, printing and supply of question papers and answer keys. Notably, the job has been outsourced from an agency in Hyderabad and the investigating agencies are working to completely establish the alleged link between agency men and the gang involved in the paper and answer leak. “The gang involved here is suspected to be historysheeters and can go to any extent. Initial investigations have not ruled out the possibility of an insider from the agency as a source. Rest investigations are in progress,” said a senior official monitoring investigations. Since Saturday afternoon, police have arrested 14 persons, including six persons from Kaithal, four from Karnal, two each from Fatehabad and Hisar districts. The arrested include three persons who were part of coaching academies in Kaitla and Fatehabad. According to information, the entire racket had come to light following the complaint of a resident of Fatehabad, who had alleged that an academy owner of Fatehabad had struck a deal with him on the pretext of getting the examination cleared. Initially, two persons were arrested from Fatehabad, following which cops arrested rest of the accused from Kaithal and Hisar. While the answer key was found to have been leaked in Kaithal, they had contacts in Karnal and other districts too. Police had also arrested a few persons who had impersonated at candidates and tried to cheat. One such accused managed to escape while the rest have been rounded up for interrogation in Karnal, sources said. Notably over 8.5 lakh candidates had applied for 5,500 posts of constables in Haryana Police and the examinations were to be conducted in two shifts in districts across the state on Saturday and Sunday. Following the answer key leak on Saturday morning, HSSC announced to cancel the examination on both the days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hssc-asks-dgp-to-lodge-fir-in-paper-leak/articleshow/85164805.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Residents fume as MC turns Jhuriwala forest area in Panchkula into dumping ground||PANCHKULA: The issue of the dumping ground in Panchkula is still a mess. The area for the solid waste management plant to be made at Jhuriwala village to process garbage from the Sector 23 dumping ground is being turned into a dumping ground itself by the Panchkula Municipal Corporation (MC). This has affected residents, forest area, seasonal nullah passing through and the wildlife sanctuary nearby. While residents welcome a garbage management plant, they oppose use of the area as a dumping ground because it is too close to the residential area. Residents of trans Ghaggar sectors alleged that they were promised that the solid waste management plant would be set up at Jhuriwala village and all waste from the Sector 23 dumping ground would be shifted and processed here. Senior vice-president, Sector 25 Residents’ Welfare Association, B R Mehta alleged that 20,000 residents had been fooled by the administration and the state government. Mehta said that the Jhuriwala plant area is situated on 13.24 acres of land and is merely 500 metres away from the dumping ground in Sector 23. He said that only the national highway separates it from the residential area. “Creating a new problem to end an existing problem is not the solution. We have requested the government as well as local authorities multiple times through various modes to not start dumping waste at Jhuriwala as it does not make any sense but to no avail,” Mehta alleged. RWA members alleged that Jhuriwala village used to exist hundreds of years ago and now, there is zero population and it is surrounded by the forest and wildlife sanctuary. Sanjeev Goyal, president of the RWA, Sector 25 said, “As per the Solid Waste Management Policy, 2016 and NGT ruling, making a solid waste management plant near the forest area/wildlife sanctuary is not allowed and it is violation of the act.” Residents of trans-Ghaggar sectors allege that they have been fooled by the administration and state govtSources said wildlife and forest department officials had heated arguments with MC officials recently over dumping of waste around the wildlife sanctuary, which affects wildlife. They claimed that everyone was quiet as the government wanted to continue dumping waste here. Residents alleged that a foul smell had started coming from the area in the monsoon. Residents’ welfare association members said that the Jhuriwala dumping ground is surrounded by hills and rain water coming from the hills flows into the Ghaggar river. The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) had used large pipes to maintain the natural flow of water to the Ghaggar river, they said, adding that the rain water would now carry waste with it, affecting groundwater in the area. Residents added that the groundwater had already been affected by the dumping ground. Bhagwan Dass Mittal, general secretary, RWA Sector-25 said, “The government as well as local administration has made the lives of residents living here a joke. After earning crores by selling plots in these sectors, they gave residents a dumping ground.” Residents also said that many people were planning to sell their properties while a few had already left as they were concerned about their health. Foul smell and poor groundwater was the primary reason for their leaving, they claimed. MC officials refused to comment. An officer said on condition of anonymity that once the solid waste management plant started working, waste would be processed and the problem would be resolved. There is a plan to build a solid waste management plant in Jhuriwala at a cost of Rs 40 crore. However, no firm has expressed interest during the two online bids. Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, in his order issued on June 5, asked the MC not to dump garbage at the Sector 23 dumping ground. He also directed them to shift all garbage at the Jhuriwala plant from the Sector 23 dumping ground. Haryana Assembly speaker, during his public meetings, also announced that the 600 tonne garbage lying at the Sector 23 dumping ground would be processed and the area would be turned into a park. Around 80 tonnes of garbage is collected from Panchkula city every day and parts of it is processed by various NGOs working with the MC Panchkula.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/residents-fume-as-mc-turns-jhuriwala-forest-area-in-pkl-into-dumping-ground/articleshow/85160321.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Chandigarh||Months after 24 students test positive, child rights panel summons Mohali deputy commissioner||MOHALI: The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) summoned Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan for failing to report to the commission about 24 students being found Covid positive. The commission had asked the administration to register an FIR against the school directors and report the same to the commission, which the Mohali administration failed to do. The commission chairperson, in a letter, stated, “The commission had received an action taken report (ATR) from your side mentioning that the Sohana Police Station registered an FIR against the director of the institution and Gurukul Management Committee under Section 188, Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 & Section 51, Disaster Management Act.” The letter further stated that after examination of ATR and representations by several parents, the Commission recommends re-examination or investigation of the matter and registration of FIR under 304-A (causing death by negligence), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), 270 (whoever malignantly does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 188 (2) (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 340 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under Section 75 of Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The commissioner also directed the Mohali administration to send an action taken report on the above mentioned point to the Commission in three days. The letter was written on June 12 and the administration was to register an FIR and reply by June 15. According to the commission, the administration failed to do this despite repeated reminders. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “We are yet to receive any summons from the commission. Once received, an appropriate reply will be filed. And it was Mohali administration which took up the matter of Corona positive students and appropriate action against the school. The school was closed immediately and students were shifted or isolated.” In April 2021, acting on a complaint about students of a residential school suffering from moderate to high grade fever, Mohali administration immediately dispatched a medical team to conduct Covid test of hostel inmates. Report of samples taken from Career Point Gurukul near Tangori village, Banur Road, Mohali revealed that 24 persons tested Covid positive out of the 100 persons tested till late evening that day. Extensive testing was conducted and positive persons were isolated at the Covid Care Centre (CCC), Gharuan while those found negative were sent home to their respective families. ‘Worked during lockdown but not paid’A group of teachers resigned as the school management failed to pay their salaries. The group has approached Punjab chief minister and other ministers seeking relief. The Prime Minister had directed all institutions to pay salaries of employees for the pandemic period. Some of the teachers from the group, Vipul Tiwari, Asheesh Sharma, Ankit Kumar, Achal Kumar, Amrit Kaur and Shalu Sharma said in their letter, “We resigned from Career Point Gurukul about 5 months back, due to non-payment of salary. We were forced to leave the job and were rendered helpless by management due to salary issue. We have gone through a lot of mental torture as we have been treated by them as educated beggars. They forced us to come to school campus even during the lockdown and we have been made to work for 11-12 hours on regular basis even on gazetted holdiays.” They stated that despite repeated verbal and written requests, the pending dues were not cleared. “We have not received our complete salary from February 2020 to February 2021. Apart from salary, there is a security deposited with them which is 10% of our yearly package. Prime Minister has time and time again passed directions to not deduct salaries in these difficult times but these directions have fallen on deaf ears. Besides this school has been collecting fees and other funds from students for whole year in advance still they show their inabilities to pay salaries to their employees,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/months-after-24-students-test-positive-child-rights-panel-summons-mohali-dc/articleshow/85160334.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Hyderabad||GHMC’s nala revamp hits land acquisition hurdle||HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) currently faces challenges in two major operations to implement its Strategic Nala Development Plan (SNDP)—acquiring land from private properties and payment of compensations for land acquired. For instance, in GHMC’s Charminar circle, the civic body has to acquire over 3,000 square yards to widen an open nala between Nehru Safar Park and Kishan Bagh Road. For this it has to acquire land from 37 properties. In the same circle, for another portion of SNDP, officials have earmarked an acquisition of 1,118 square yards of land from 31 properties. Proposals from circle officials have begun flooding the GHMC commissioner’s office, urging the acquisition of land belonging to private properties. Within a span of a month, town planning officials have sent estimates to the tune of Rs 80 crore for acquisition of private lands from properties which will be affected during nala widening operations. “The allocation of necessary funds is a major challenge before GHMC. This, apart from the fact that over Rs 1,000 crore will be required to implement the SNDP. The civic body is also facing a financial crisis and we have no other option but to approach agencies such as the World Bank or Japan Internation Cooperation Agency (JICA) for funds,” a GHMC town planning official told TOI. Within the next two months, proposals from all GHMC circles will be received with short-listed properties, extent of land required and acquisition cost estimates. Tenders will be floated after receiving financial clearance, according to GHMC officials. “It is known that over 70 to 90 per cent of nalas are encroached by illegal properties, but in some areas we have to acquire land from some properties to widen nalas in critical areas. We may face heat from owners of some of these private properties,” said an additional city planner. “If all goes well, by 2023, the entire nala network may get a facelift and won’t overflow during the rainy season,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmcs-nala-revamp-hits-land-acquisition-hurdle/articleshow/85164724.cms||---

Almost all car manufacturers now coming up with automatic versions of their brands. Driving school representatives told TOI that with surging demand they had requested the state transport department to come up with a system in which the driving tests for the final licence can be conducted in automatic cars in addition to the ones with clutch pedals. “After the second wave of the pandemic ended, we are seeing a huge increase in the number of people coming to us to learn driving. If one talks about numbers, we are looking at an increase of more than 50% and all our slots are full. One thing which we have noticed is that a majority of those coming to learn driving want to do it in automatic vehicles and demand the same. However, according to the regulations laid out, we cannot teach them driving in automatic vehicles. The state transport department should look into the matter given the demand and introduce automatic vehicles for final driving tests in all the RTOs,” a representative of the Wanowrie-based Jadhav motor training school told TOI. An official with the department told TOI that the proposal would be studied. “There has been an increase in sales of vehicles with automatic transmissions in recent times. As far as conducting driving tests in them is concerned, it is the ministry of road transport which will take a call on the same,” the official said. However, an official with the Pune RTO office said, “The trend of buying automatic vehicles is mainly in the metropolitan and bigger cities due to traffic issues. However, with the sale of automatic vehicles improving, we are looking at a change in regulation during driving tests.” Driving schools representatives said apart from those who wanted to learn driving, they were seeing an increase in the number of people who just wanted some classes to brush up their driving skills. “There are many who know driving but haven’t driven for long due to lockdowns and want to brush up their skills. Since these people already have a licence, they go for automatic vehicles to brush up their driving skills and we oblige them,” the representative of Sutar driving training school in Hadapsar, pointed out. Shailesh Bhandari, regional director of FADA (Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations) in Pune, told TOI that the sale of automatic transmission vehicles in Pune had substantially increased in Pune since the last two years. “More and more people are going for automatic transmission versions now. Also, all manufacturers have got the automatic versions of their brands in the market,” Bhandari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-to-learn-driving-automatic-vehicles-rises/articleshow/85162433.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Pune rural police get 2 speedboats to curb illegal sand mining||PUNE: The Pune rural police recently acquired two speedboats to keep an eye on illegal sand mining in areas along the Bhima river basin in the district. Abhinav Deshmukh, the superintendent of police (Pune rural), said that illegal sand mining was mainly carried out in Daund and Indapur and to some extent in the Ghod river basin of Shirur tehsil. “We have arrested over 100 persons in around 60 complaints registered in these areas from January. We have also shortlisted villages where such activities are rampant. Our local police have been asked to inspect these villages regularly. Basic training with the help of the disaster management team is being imparted to our personnel from Daund and Indapur police stations for operating motor boats and conducting patrolling,” Deshmukh told TOI. “Often during the raid/operation, the miners leave the area in their boats. With the help of these boats, the police can now chase them on water and also conduct patrolling in areas where the activity is being carried out often,” Deshmukh said. Deshmukh said that for many people mining had become a main business in Daund and Indapur tehsils as there was a huge demand for it in the market. “Sand is being sold at a high price in the construction sector. So, many could make a lot of money from it over the years. Sand miners, with the help of local villagers, could extract large quantities of sand in Daund and Indapur,” a senior police officer said. The miners use earth movers and modified boats to carry sand from the river to its bank. With the revenue department’s help, the police have been destroying boats used by the miners in the district, police said. “Over 50 boats have been destroyed in the last two years.This move has helped us control the mining to some extent. Since these boats are not locally available, the miners couldn’t continue their activities agrressiveely,” the police officer said. The sand mining has also created rivalry among villagers and that has ultimately led to serious crimes, an officer said. “At least 10 murder cases have been reported in the district that are linked with mining. As a result, we have to keep a close eye on the people involved in this activity,”added another senior police officer from the local crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-cops-get-2-speedboats-to-curb-illegal-sand-mining/articleshow/85162473.cms||Sandip Dighe

But compared to last year, when all institutes were shut and struggling to learn the ropes of online education, this year the campuses are more prepared with a year’s experience. But for the students, it would mean very limited interaction within the campus with fewer students present in every classroom, online education still being the norm, and occupancy limited at hostels. The pandemic has also spurred the residential campuses to create isolation and emergency care units. At IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), the arriving students are put up first under quarantine for a few days in the hostel, before they can access facilities. Likewise, at MICA, there’s an isolation facility with nurses, oxygen concentrators and oxygen cylinders for any contingency. The institute has also banned outside food parcels for the time being. Cept University has also arranged for a physician and counsellor on campus. On arrival at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A), students go into self-isolation for four days and are administered another RT-PCR test on the fifth day. Library and common facilities are currently open to students on a limited basis to take care of Covid norms related to social distancing capacity etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/back-to-campus-but-conditions-apply/articleshow/85162618.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Aurangabad||GMCH study: Higher percentage of non-comorbid deaths during 2nd wave||Aurangabad: A study carried out by the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad, has underlined the fact that the second wave of Covid-19 was more intense than the first wave and took a relatively larger toll on patients who did not have any comorbid conditions.As per the study, at 52.02%, more deaths of patients without comorbidities were observed during the second wave. In comparison, there were 30.16% such deaths during the first wave. The GMCH authorities analysed 3,110 Covid deaths between April 2020 and July 2021 and found that 924 patients succumbed to the viral infection without having any comorbid conditions. This accounts for roughly 30% of total deaths and next to Covid deaths among patients with hypertension (35%) and diabetes (29%). Dr Anil Joshi, the head of the department of pathology at GMCH, said a relatively younger population, which did not have any pre-existing illness, also fell prey to the Covid infection in large numbers during the second wave. “The virus exhibited rapid spread among many such patients, leading to the severity of the disease within few days. While no genome sequencing has been carried out to decide the variant of the coronavirus among the patients at the GMCH, it could be the Delta variant that is known to be more contagious and virulent,” he said. Referring to the higher percentage of deaths among non-comorbid patients during the second wave, the GMCH authorities have stressed on the need for speedy vaccination of the elderly population. “The vaccine can definitely reduce the severity of Covid infection and bring down the mortality rate. Doses of any vaccine from the available basket is advisable at the earliest. Besides, there is no substitute for Covid-appropriate behaviour and early testing in case of possible symptoms,” he said. In terms of gender distribution, of the total Covid fatalities at the GMCH, 62% were male patients and the remaining were female patients. The age-wise profiling of Covid moralities included the highest (30%) deaths in the 61-70 years category, followed by 23% in the 51-60 years age group among others. Some of the salient features of the Covid deaths during the second wave included many patients (43.66%) reporting late — after four to seven days of symptom onset. HRCT investigation of 40% of deaths revealed a high CT severity score (greater than 15/25) in 57.12% of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gmch-study-higher-percentage-of-non-comorbid-deaths-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/85158628.cms||Prasad Joshi

Unpaid bills, dip in tanker demand and free water scheme have all added to the drain in revenue despite the rain bounty. While the monthly bill demand from Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is roughly Rs 150 crore, the collection has been about Rs 80 crore, officials said. This despite the water supply to its 11.4 lakh customers being increased from 500 million gallons per day (MGD) to 530 MGD thanks to the heavy inflows. The water is being supplied from Godavari, Krishna, Manjeera and Singur. Water is also supplied in small quantities from Osmansagar and Himayatsagar, both these reservoirs are kept operational to prevent pipes from rusting. According to HMWS&SB records, of the Rs 150 crore monthly bill demand, Rs 85 crore is as per water meter, Rs 30 crore based on average consumption for consumers without meter and rest of those with locked premises as well as pending dues. The board, however, is far from meeting its bill demand. In fact, before launching the 20kl free water supply scheme, it used to earn between Rs 100 crore and Rs 120 crore per month. But now it has slipped to about Rs 80 crore per month. On top of this, the board is struggling to get dues of Rs 500 crore from various departments. To stay afloat, the board has to spend most of what it earns on salaries, bills and servicing debt, leaving little for repairs and maintenance, officials said.

When the first six months of 2021 and 2020 each are considered (done for parity as 2021 is ongoing) and then compared with the corresponding period of the pre-Covid years 2019 and 2018, one sees a 33% rise in cybercrime in Mumbai: cases rose from 1,784 in 2018-2019 (Jan-June) to 2,374 in 2020-2021 (same months), according to the cyber cell of the city police. Worryingly, the detection rate continues to be low, as per the released data. It has fallen by about 2% in the years under consideration, from 220 in 2018-2019 (Jan-June) to 216 in 2020-2021 (same months). Late filing of complaints is one of the reasons, say experts. TOI spoke to a cybercrime victim, a 36-year-old IT engineer who had registered a case of ‘Nigerian email fraud’. He claimed that he was duped of over Rs 12 lakh in 2018, and despite providing various documents to the police, his written complaint was not converted into an FIR for years. “Finally, I was called to the BKC police station on July 26 and an FIR was registered. I am wondering from where will the police be able to recover the money now, so long after the fraud. The police could have solved the case easily when I provided a report of a forensic investigation I had done over three months in 2019. But they sat on it.” With the local police disappointing him, the IT engineer mailed his forensic report to Dubai police by the end of 2019 since he had discovered a Dubai link to the fraud. “They took my statement over phone and video calls. Based on my evidence, they cracked the case within three months in 2020 and busted the racket in India, Dubai and Turkey,” he said. “Indian cops are always a step behind fraudsters.” The police say that for years, the cyber division was understaffed. Ultimately, after looking at the rise in numbers and the low detection rate, the state cyber cell was given 26 specialists from prestigious engineering colleges, including the IITs, who are expected to help clear the case backlog in Mumbai and also across the state. State cyber cell PRO and superintendent of police Sanjay Shintre said the team is working on detecting fraud along with other agencies who have come on board. “It is noticed that there are many instances where victims who lost meagre sums in online frauds do not approach the cops to lodge complaints. We urge everyone to come forward,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cybercrime-case-detection-low-though-incidents-on-rise/articleshow/85164812.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan on Sunday said it has been five years since Nayeem was killed in an encounter. Though the opposition parties had demanded a CBI probe into Nayeem’s dealings and his alleged links with big fish, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had constituted a SIT.  “Nearly 200 cases were registered in connection with Nayeem’s illegal activities. In how many cases, the charge sheets have been filed?,” he asked. He demanded that the government make public the details of money and property seized from Nayeem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/congress-make-public-nayeem-diary-sit-report/articleshow/85164764.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Afternoon onwards, the weather will remain cloudy. Sunny conditions prevailed in the city on Sunday morning while by evening it was mostly overcast. An IMD official attributed the rise in daytime temperature to clear skies. “Shivajinagar and Lohegaon recorded maximum temperatures of 31.8C and 30.9C, which were above normal by 4.3 and 2.9 degrees respectively. This weather is likely to prevail for the next few days, so people might feel the heat in the morning and afternoon hours,” said the official. Some pockets of Pune district, mostly in the ghat areas, received light spells of rainfall, said the officials. Anupam Kashyapi head of forecast at IMD, Pune, said, “At present there is no weather system over Maharashtra and adjacent states. As a result, there is no chance of monsoon reviving till August 14. The extended range forecast also suggests the same. From August 8, the city is likely to receive very light rainfall for the next couple of days.” The adjacent Konkan and Goa region, which covers Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts, had received very heavy rainfall in the past month leading to a flood -like situation in many towns and tehsils. “These districts are likely to get widespread rainfall but there is no warning,” said Kashyapi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/clear-skies-send-daytime-temperature-rising-light-rainfall-till-saturday-imd/articleshow/85162541.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Strict checks in Battis Shirala town during Nag Panchami||Kolhapur: The police, the forest department and the local administration will keep an eye on the residents of Battis Shirala town of Sangli during Nag Panchami. The town is famous for worshipping cobras on Nag Panchami — which falls on August 13 this year. The snake mandals usually catch the cobras, exhibit them and also carry out a procession. They also hold a competition among cobras and snakes that rise the highest and look the most beautiful are rewarded. After a decade-long battle led by wildlife activists, the tradition was banned by the Bombay high court in 2014. The review petition was also dismissed in 2017. Sangli’s acting additional district collector Mausami Chougule-Barde said, “We have appealed to the residents and organisations to celebrate the Nag Panchami as per the court order. The mandals and citizens should offer prayers to snake idols or images. There should be no catching and exhibition of snakes. Those violating the order will face action under Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972.”Before the ban, thousands of visitors used to come to the town to see the celebrations. The local youths used to go to the nearby jungles of Western Ghats to catch the cobras. The snakes were kept in cages and then made public on the day of Nag Panchami.With mishandling and being kept away from their natural habitat, the snakes condition weakened and sometimes they died. Since the ban, the residents perform these snake rituals illegally. Additional superintendent of police Manisha Dubule said, “We will deploy police security under 200 officers. The video recordings of public spaces will be made. Action against those violating the Covid rules will also be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/strict-checks-in-battis-shirala-town-during-nag-panchami/articleshow/85158690.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Finally, MC takes control of Industrial Areas phases VIII-A, B||Barinderjit.saluja Mohali: Finally, maintenance and operations of industrial area phase VIII-A and B in Mohali will be officially handed over to the Mohali Municipal Corporation by Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC). The handing over ceremony will be conducted on Monday by minister for industries and commerce, Punjab, Sunder Sham Arora, in the presence of minister for labour, health and family welfare, Punjab Balbir Singh Sidhu. Maintenance and operations will be handed over to mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu and MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg at MIA Bhawan in Industrial Area, Phase VII, Mohali. Being the original allottee, Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) maintained industrial areas. Garg said, “This was a long pending issue which has now been resolved and MC will take over maintenance from August 9 onwards. PSIEC will be transferring some funds and nine employees will be attached to MC to look after the industrial areas. Tenders will be floated once MC takes over.” Around 800 industrialists have been suffering as roads in these industrial areas are in very bad shape. Ridden with potholes and loose covered with gravel, they were dangerous for commuters. The profusion of overgrown weeds and vacant plots made the area a convenient hideout for criminals. No agency has been maintaining the area for the past one year, due to which the place has gone from bad to worse, with wild growth, bad roads and non-functional streetlights. Industrialists alleged that despite annual property tax payment of around Rs 16 crore to the MC, no agency came forward for maintenance. Mohali Industry Association (MIA) President Yogesh Sagar said, “It was our long pending demand and now we believe that the MC will change the face of these industrial areas.” The process of undertaking maintenance work of Industrial Area Phase-VIII and VIII-B from Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) by the MC began around 15 months back. For the past two decades, the area was under Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC), but after a series of meetings with officers in 2019, it was decided to hand over maintenance work to the civic body. However, with neither party maintaining it for the past four years, industrialists and workers have been complaining about badly maintained infrastructure, especially in the monsoon, when roads get waterlogged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/finally-mc-takes-control-of-industrial-areas-phases-viii-a-b/articleshow/85160386.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The dispute reached the court and the landlord was ordered to pay for the house repairs after the landlord repeatedly refused the tenant to carry out the repairs even at the tenant’s expenditure. This case involved 64-year-old Vinubhai Chauhan, whose family has been residing in a house owned by Sindukaur Sevasingh in a chawl in Amraiwadi for nearly six decades. Chauhan had been requesting the landlord to allow him to repair the house because it was in a very bad shape and it was becoming difficult for the family to live in it. He offered to bear the costs, but the landlord continued to refuse permission. In July 2017, Chauhan issued a notice to the landlord and sought permission to repair the house on his own expenses once again. When the landlord did not respond, Chauhan approached the small causes court arguing that the repairing work was not allowed to him in order to keep the house in poor condition so that his family vacates the property. He sought the court’s direction to the landlord to carry out necessary repairs because it is the landlord’s responsibility to carry out tenantable repairs under the Bombay Rent Act. The landlord, on the other hand, argued that Chauhan wanted to make permanent changes in the house, which was not allowed. The court accepted Chauhan’s case that Section 23(2) of the Act mandates the landlord to keep the premises in good and habitable condition. The landlord has been directed to make necessary repairing work in the house within three months, and then deduct the expenses of the repairs from the rent. The court has also ordered the tenant not to make any permanent construction in the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/landlord-ordered-to-repair-tenants-house/articleshow/85162608.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt to focus on high Covid risk areas in administering vax doses||HYDERABAD: The state government has devised a new Covid-19 vaccine administration strategy focussed on outbreak-prone areas to administer the first and second doses. The focussed vaccine drive for high-risk groups earlier was successful with science journals also taking note of the state’s initiative. Currently, only the second dose is provided throughout the state, but under the new plan, exemptions have been granted in outbreak-prone areas, and 11 such areas have been identified. G Srinivasa Rao, director of the state health department, stated that Covid- 19 cases are increasing in 11 districts across the state. The state’s R-value, a parameter used to determine how an infection spreads, is also a cause for concern as it currently stands at 0.95%. Apart from these factors, vaccine shortage has also compelled the state to adopt a plan for immunization in three stages. The bypoll-bound Karimnagar district, the border sharing regions of Khammam, Nalgonda, Suryapet, a few areas in Warangal (urban and rural) Mahbubabad, Peddapalli and Yadagiri Bhongir districts are the places where an outbreak is likely. Officials said that the plan to focus on outbreak-prone locations will continue in future, but that the places would be adjusted depending on the scenario. This plan also aligns with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) latest immunization administration strategy guidelines released a few days ago. According to the WHO, the focus should be on completing the immunization programme in areas where more cases are reported. During the first phase, the health department launched a major focussed immunization effort for high-risk groups. Jabs were given to around 35 lakh people in high-risk categories, including cab drivers, gas delivery persons, vegetable vendors, women of self-help groups and others who could have been highly exposed to the virus. In the next step, the vulnerable population will be identified across the state. Many people still lack antibodies, either because they were never infected or they refused to be immunized due to fear of the vaccine and lack of vaccine availability. “It is not easy to find out who such people are, but they can be identified based on their hospital or healthcare centre visits,” a top official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-to-focus-on-high-covid-risk-areas-in-administering-vax-doses/articleshow/85162573.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They said that at a time when there is no demand for engineering courses in the country, starting one in regional languages doesn’t make any sense. “This initiative is going to fail,” said KVK Rao, general secretary, All India Federation of Self Financing Technical Institutions, adding that at a time when not many engineering students are able to secure jobs, starting one in Telugu will not make any sense. He said that for emerging technology courses—Artificial Intelligence, Data Sciences, among others, translation into regional languages will be difficult. “Further, there won’t be any reference books in Telugu,” he added, and said that unless the central government plans to start MTech in Telugu, these students will not have any opportunities for higher studies. While one college in AP got permission to start an engineering course in Telugu, no college from Telangana has applied to start the course in the regional language. The managements of engineering colleges said that it is unlikely that any college will be applying for permission in the next or coming academic years. A few, however, said that this will be useful to those who want to get employed in Telugu states or their hometown. “This might not be useful if someone wants to secure a job in an MNC or global market. But, if a candidate what’s to stay in his home state, it is useful for them,” said NV Ramana Rao, director, NIT Warangal. Ramana Rao said that it is better to have command over the subject in Telugu rather than not knowing anything because the course is taught in English.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/move-to-offer-engg-in-telugu-will-fail-experts/articleshow/85162553.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

In its report prepared for the Rs 905 crore Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) fund for ecosystem restoration, the department mentions that the Nalsarovar site is the worst polluted, and worst affected because of poaching and suffers from high infestation of invasive species. In a survey carried out between late 2019 and early 2020 the forest department has claimed that on a index scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest, Nalsarovar scores a ‘5’ for pollution, poaching and scores a ‘4’ for infestation by invasive flora species. In it’s report, the department claims that Nalsarovar suffers major management issues which include, “ terrestrialization, higher anthropogenic pressures --pollution, poaching, fishing --and higher dependency of local community on its natural resources.” One of the five most vulnerable tribal communities of the state –the ‘Padhar’ — live in peripheral villages of Nalsarovar and they depend heavily on the resources of Nalsarovar for their day to day livelihood. Apart from this, the Ramsar wetland also faces major issues, and challenges for management include garbage, uncontrolled growth of reeds and weed, growth of Prosopis juliflora on the fringes of the wetland, poaching of birds, paucity of funds and staff for effective management of the site. While pegging the importance of the Nalsarovar site, the report claims “Gujarat is part of Central Asian Flyway of migratory birds largely due to large number of wetlands. Nalsarovar, Khijadiya, Porbandar, Marine National Park, Marine Wildlife Sanctuary, Wild Ass Sanctuary, Kutch Desert Sanctuary and Chari Dhand Conservation Reserve are wetlands notified as PAs. Eight of the state’s wetlands are recognized as nationally important wetlands,” claims the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nalsarovar-dirtiest-wetland-in-gujarat-but-most-vital/articleshow/85162614.cms||---

Those, who are wary of health issues, said the malls are much safer than the standalone shops. After the state government relaxed the restrictions on the re-opening of malls for a limited period during the weekdays and Saturdays, the citizens are trying to make full use of the available window period before the next curb is announced due to the expected third wave of Covid.Poonam Sonawane, a resident of the Kamatwade, said, “We are now vexed with online shopping. It was a new experience and fun when everything was closed. But that is no more the case, it does not give the feeling of live shopping. Shops and malls are the best solutions for the same.”For several others, the mall is an excuse to visit friends. “The tourist spots are closed. There are no places, where we can get together. The malls provide us with the best chance to come together and also go shopping,” said Aakanksha Mishra, and her friends.The shopkeepers and the mall administration are also happy about the state government allowing the reopening of the malls. “We offer complete protection for the visitors by ensuring a safe environment. We have ensured each of our employees has got at least one vaccine dose and we are stressing on Covid appropriate behaviour,” said an officer of one of the malls. Santosh Kotkar, a store owner in the malls, said the footfall in the first few days is increasing cautiously. “The hefty discounts are put up by the various store owners and citizens seem to benefit from the same,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/citizens-visit-malls-amid-relaxation-in-restrictions/articleshow/85158705.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Dengue stings Telangana, cases slowly rear head||HYDERABAD: With 283 cases of dengue recorded in the state up to June this year, Telangana is now at the 7th spot in case numbers in the country. As per data from the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDP), Tamil Nadu has the most number of cases (2,062), followed by Kerala (1,596), Karnataka (1,203), Maharashtra (936), Rajasthan (861) and Andhra Pradesh (508). A drastic rise in dengue cases has been reported by doctors in state. Interestingly, many patients have been struck by dengue despite using mosquito repellents and staying indoors. “None of the mosquito repellents is 100% safe and effective. Aedes mosquitoes tend to bite more during dawn and dusk when they are highly active, but they can also bite at any other time of the day,” said Dr Lakshmi Kanth, senior consultant, internal medicine at Medicover Hospitals, adding that over the last fortnight cases have seen a further upturn. The dengue spreading Aedes Agypti mosquitoes which breed in stagnated water, even if stagnated for a day, can also breed in clean water, making it very difficult to control. Right from undried utensils to flower pots or buckets, they can breed anywhere. What’s worse is that an egg laid over a year back can hatch anytime between one to two years, remaining stuck to the inside of an unused utensil. “This also means that once a house is infested with dengue causing mosquitoes, it is extremely difficult to get rid of them. While fogging and other measures can help, the best thing to do is to use mosquito nets and electric bats,” said Dr M Karuna, who had once earlier filed a PIL in High Court seeking intervention by the state to control the dengue menace. Apart from all this, doctors also suggest wearing clothes that fully cover the body to stay safe from mosquito bites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dengue-stings-t-cases-slowly-rear-head/articleshow/85162592.cms||Amrita Didyala

KTR had promised to provide about 100 customised scooters to the differently-abled persons during his birthday celebrations in July. In tune with his assurance, a special programme was organised here where in KTR handed over the scooters to the beneficiaries. He said that this was the first phase of the distribution of scooters, and that other beneficiaries would also be covered during subsequent phase of distribution. Speaking on the occasion, KTR said several public representatives came forward and donated ambulances following the initiative started by him last year. “Many ministers and TRS leaders have been donating hundreds of customised scooters and other vehicles which included 100 ambulances, under the gift a smile initiative,” he said. The minister interacted with all the beneficiaries while having lunch with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/it-minister-ktr-gifts-customised-scooters/articleshow/85164823.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Disturbing trend: Third wave taking turn for the worse, says physicist||HYDERABAD: University of Hyderabad (UoH) former pro-vice-chancellor and eminent physicist Dr Vipin Srivastava, who predicted the onset of third wave of Covid-19 on July 4, has now cautioned that there is a disturbing trend in the Covid-19 pattern across the country. The Covid-19 curve, which Dr Vipin has postulated based on daily death load (DDL), has not only continued after July 4 but also appears to have become worse in the past couple of weeks. The DDL has shifted more towards positive values, which is undesirable. In the 15 days period – July 24 to August 7 - it was positive on 10 occasions and seven times in the latter 10 days. This means the third wave is taking a turn for the worse, the officially reported figures notwithstanding. Dr Vipin also ruled out herd immunity in the country so far despite seropositivity in about two-thirds of the population. “The cause for concern is appearance of ‘wild’ fluctuations in DDL since July 4. This is found to occur whenever there is a crossover in the scenario, i.e. when the number of daily deaths changes from an increasing trend to a decreasing one, or vice versa. However, an intriguing aspect of the ongoing big fluctuations in the DDL is that they are much wilder than the earlier ones and that they are not showing signs of settling down even after a month,” he said. The reasons, Dr Vipin said, may partially lie in the uncertainties associated with the official data. The number of deaths was corrected a few times while the first wave of Covid-19 was on, but the uncertainties associated with this number apparently increased manifold since the second wave. This is clearly reflected in the huge fluctuations seen in the graph for daily Covid-19 deaths during the second wave. The physicist said that when the number of new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours was running in lakhs, the number of recovered cases was also in lakhs. And when the former reduced to thousands, the latter also came down to thousands. This ratio, called Patient Load (number of new patients added for every recovered patient) generally fluctuated around 1. The maximum value that this ratio attained was around 2.2, and this was when the number of deaths in 24 hours was increasing rapidly between March 9 and May 6, 2021 during the second wave. “Our results indicate that the severity of the Covid-19 situation has spread so much that the DDL deduced from the nationwide data is staying positive on daily basis. That is, the number of new Covid-19 positive cases in 24 hours is exceeding the number of recovered cases in the same 24 hours even though the number of Covid-19 deaths is hovering around 500,” Dr Vipin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/disturbing-trend-3rd-wave-taking-turn-for-the-worse-says-physicist/articleshow/85162623.cms||Syed Akbar

Earlier, a total of 18 ambulances were reserved to ferry only Covid patientsThough the calls dropped after May, it was decided to keep the 18 ambulances for Covid patients in view of the third wave. But now it has been decided to use for non-Covid patients as well.The dial 108 ambulance service ferried 143 Covid patients in January, followed by 80 in February, 837 in March, 1,484 in April, 785 in May, which dropped to 215 in June.Raghamwar said if there is a rise in the positivity rate and calls also increase to ferry Covid patients, the ambulances would be again reserved to ferry Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/18-ambulances-reserved-for-ncov-freed-up-for-non-covid-patients/articleshow/85158701.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Mandatory hallmarking leaves gold merchants in the lurch||HYDERABAD: Next time you go to a jewellery shop and find fewer designs to choose from, don’t fret, as confusion over a new rule of allotting a Hallmark Unique Identification (HUID) number to every piece of jewel has resulting in lakhs of ornaments piling up for scrutiny and hallmarking in inspection centres. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has set up only 35 assaying and hallmarking centres (AHCs) in seven out of 33 districts in Telangana, bringing more misery to gold and silver merchants. Every day, AHCs are receiving thousands of gold jewellery pieces and allotting HUID to every piece is becoming time-consuming, traders say as the rules say the process has to be completed in 48 hours. “Hyderabad jewellers have some infrastructure for the hallmarking process, but in several districts of Telangana, gold merchants have to travel at least 300 kilometres to get BIS hallmarking,” added Murali Krishna, who is member of a task force formed to look into the issue. In June, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) brought this new rule in place, but gold jewellery merchants have urged the central government to modify the system. “The gold jewellery industry in Telangana is very upset as several issues need to be addressed by the union government. The lack of clarity in this new rule will have an impact on the gold jewellery industry,” said gold merchant Mannepally Murali Krishna. Representatives from 55,000 jewellers registered with the Telangana Gold Jewellery Merchants Association have formed a task force to chalk out their strategies to resolve the issues. “Soon, the task force will meet central ministers will urge them to make certain changes in BIS rule to ensure hallmarking decisions in a smoother manner,” added a task force member. Chand Sreenivas Rao, director of a trade company in bullion market, for more than five decades, supported the issues raised by the gold jewellery traders. “The central government must carry out a study on possibilities and feasibilities,” Rao said, while the BIS head, K V Rao there won’t be any penalty till August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mandatory-hallmarking-leaves-gold-merchants-in-the-lurch/articleshow/85162654.cms||Sunil Mungara

Hyderabad BIS Scientist-E & Head, K V Rao told TOI that customers without any hallmarking on the jewellery can get it hallmarked now or melt them and make new jewellery. BIS Officials said that gold bullion in any shape, including biscuits, bars, sheet, foil, rod, wire, strip, tube or coin, gold wrist watches, fountain pens and special types of jewellery will be exempted from hallmarking. “Export and re-import of jewellery as per trade policy of the government, Jewellery for international exhibitions, jewellery for government approved B2B business and domestic exhibitions will be exempted from mandatory gold hallmarking,” KV Rao added. After BIS introduced a new rule of hallmarking, it showed a major impact on smaller jewellery businessmen in the city as well as in districts. Despite the BIS new rule in place, the jewellers can continue to buy back old gold jewellery without a hallmark from customers. In fact, customers can also check bills properly and ensure that the jeweller has to mention the hallmarking charges are mentioned separately in the bill, cautioned BIS. “The customer has the right to approach the jeweller concerned, if any fraud is detected in purity and fineness. The jeweller is responsible and also liable to compensate the customer in such cases,” another official said. //end//||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/denizens-concerned-about-old-jewellery-even-as-bis-exempts-exhibitions-from-hallmarking/articleshow/85162627.cms||Sunil Mungara

It is the same neighbourhood where banners were raised and a few Hindu families had threatened exodus after two houses were sold to members of the minority community. Police have barred the entry of the activists of the lesser-known outfit into the colony. The activists led by Priyanshu had sat on a hunger strike and demanded to cancel the registry of the Muslim buyers. The hunger strike was called off after requests by the district administration on Saturday. Additional SP (rural) Vidya Sagar Mishra said, “We have registered an FIR under section 505-2 (statements creating or promoting hatred or enmity between classes) against Priyanshu and 14 others for the activities they carried out at a neighbourhood in Kathghar area. Impartial investigation will be carried out in the case.” An official, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI, “The Muslim families have voluntarily agreed to transfer the ownership back in the sellers’ names. The decision was taken during a meeting as they wanted to stay away from controversies.” When contacted, additional city magistrate (ACM) Rajesh Kumar told TOI, “We are not aware of this development, but we had told them that it is their constitutional right to live in any part of the country and would also ensure their security if needed. We are also carrying out an investigation to identify the people who deliberately ignited this issue. Prima facie, it appears that someone was trying to buy the properties himself at a low price but it was purchased by others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/right-wing-outfit-activists-booked-for-fomenting-tension-in-moradabad-colony/articleshow/85158794.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Pune||Much-needed respite for service sector employees||Pune: For employees of restaurants and malls — the segments first to close and last to open — Sunday’s relaxation orders, by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, were a salve to their pain. For Salim Shaikh, who is involved in the management of a restaurant in Bavdhan, the uncertainty of opening and closing of businesses is now deep-rooted in his psyche; while happy with the fresh orders, he wants reforms. “Of course, this order is welcome, and will help sustain our business and create more jobs. But due to the uncertainty over the past year, where restaurants and malls have been severely restricted, a sense of fear has set in — we don’t know whether restrictions will be re-imposed if Covid-19 cases rise again. In June, for instance, malls and restaurants were allowed to open for longer hours, and then, in a week or two, restrictions were imposed again,” Shaikh said, adding, “I feel the government should issue strict instructions on how restaurants should operate — given that Covid-19 will be around for a long time — such as mandatory vaccination or hygiene measures. If some restaurants don’t operate according to these guidelines, they could be fined or sealed.” For Shaikh, who has been in the hospitality industry for decades, the severe restrictions came at a massive financial cost. “Our employers paid us at least half our salaries through the past year, despite the restrictions. But still there are expenses that I need to meet, such as school fees or loan instalments. And because I am in my fifties now and have worked in the same industry for many years, it is difficult to switch my line of work,” he added. Others, meanwhile, had to dip into their savings to stay afloat as they lived away from their families and were pursuing education too. “I stay away from my parents and my hometown, so I have to manage all expenses on my own. And since malls have opened and closed over the past year, salaries have been lower than usual. I am pursuing my education here as well, so I must take care of the fees too. I had planned everything, but those plans have now gone for a toss. I had to dip into my savings to make up the deficit, as well as borrowing from friends, and now my savings and money in hand have both been exhausted,” a marketing executive of a mall in Pune said. The loss of income for some also meant taking on longer hours at a second job, sacrificing days off and hours of sleep.“I had no option but to take on a food delivery job — which I take up after my day gets over at the office, as well as on my days off — which goes on till midnight or further, After all, even though I received part of my salary, there was still a deficit that I had to make up because of school fees and medical expenses in my family, as well as EMIs. At least we could avail ourselves of a moratorium last year, but there was nothing of that sort when the second wave came round,” said an accounting executive of a mall in Pune. Nobody can afford to relax now, as the deputy chief minister clearly stated on Sunday, while announcing the curbs, that the relaxations will be rolled back if the positivity rate goes above 5% — Covid-appropriate behaviour like social distancing and wearing marks must strictly be adhered to, Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/much-needed-respite-for-service-sector-employees/articleshow/85164875.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Madurai||Tangedco rejects man with colour vision defect, HC upholds it||Madurai: Madras high court has set aside a single judge order which directed the authorities to appoint a candidate found deficient in identifying colours to the post of assistant electrical engineer in Tangedco. The candidate had qualified in all regards before he underwent a medical examination at which he was found to be deficient in identifying colours. Subsequently, the authorities constituted a committee including an ophthalmologist and examined the man. Tangedco rejected his candidature stating that since the job of an engineer would involve dealing with colour-coded power cables and individual wires, the man would be at risk or would not be efficient in discharging the duties assigned to the post. He challenged the rejection order through a petition before HC Madurai bench last year. The single judge on March 17, 2021 allowed his petition stating that since the man was not colour-blind as such his condition of “defective colour vision” may not be an impediment to discharging duties of an assistant electrical engineer. Challenging the order, Tangedco filed the present appeal. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice T S Sivagnanam observed that a specialised committee, after due deliberations, came to a unanimous opinion that the man could not be allowed to take up the post. The judges observed that engineers need to function, sometimes in closed places with the help of a torch or flashlight. In emergency situations, engineers need to decide, in a split-second, as to which wire to pull and which not to touch. Courts should be slow in interfering in such areas, particularly where judges may not have the requisite expertise. Though the man deserves the court’s sympathy, such misplaced sympathy cannot be a substitute for cogent grounds to undo an administrative order, observed the judges, while allowing Tangedco’s appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tangedco-rejects-man-with-colour-vision-defect-hc-upholds-it/articleshow/85162776.cms||---

Like the other commerce results, this one too recorded 97.5%. Out of a total of 5,739 candidates who took the exam, which was modelled on choice-based credit system, 4,897 cleared it. In fact, results of 10 other exams were also declared. “The MCQ format of exams has resulted in almost all students clearing the exam,” said a former dean. “The exam really does not translate into anything much as these marks are inflated.” Earlier, out of 67,974 students, 94.5% students (49,796 students) cleared the BCom examination. Close to 18,000 students have cleared their papers in the final semester but many are yet to clear their Allowed to Keep Term (ATKT) subjects from first and second years, so their final result is withheld, said an officer from the university’s examination department. This is the second consecutive year that nearly 95% of the TYBCom batch cleared the exam. Before the pandemic, this percentage stood at 70%-74% every year. The success rate, which used to hover around 70%, has jumped higher, partly also because students are taking the exams from home and most colleges have not invested in proctoring software, said a faculty. “While it may be wrong to state that students would have indulged in cheating, it is the format of this exam that allows students to score full marks,” said a faculty member. Regular exams have a mix of descriptive and short answer questions, but this year, MU asked colleges to continue exams online in the MCQ format. An online test of 50 marks was given for undergraduate degree and post-graduate examinations of traditional streams (Arts, Commerce and Science) which was entirely MCQ based. Students were given an hour for the examination. The MU also released the results of five engineering streams, as also those of some masters programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mcq-pattern-helps-improve-pass-rate-97-5-clear-tybcom/articleshow/85164896.cms||---

---||Madurai||Cops shouldn’t seek separate order to offer protection: HC||Madurai: Clarifying that police should readily grant protection to those seeking to implement a civil court decree obtained in their favour without insisting on a separate court order, Madras high court directed the director general of police (DGP) to issue a reminder to all police stations to follow a GO passed in this regard in 2008.The court was hearing a petition filed by P Packianathan seeking protection for himself and to perform agriculture work on his land situated at Seikipatti village in Melur taluk in Madurai. Following a civil dispute between him and others regarding the land, he had obtained a civil court decree in his favour. When he petitioned the police for protection, he was asked to obtain a separate court order. Hence, he filed the present petition before HC Madurai bench.Justice J Nisha Banu observed that the main concern of the decree holder is that if his right to property (possession and enjoyment) as confirmed by the decree can be protected only by getting police protection, it has to be conferred. The only question is whether there should be a separate order by the court directing the police to offer police protection.The judge observed that a GO passed in 2008 by the home department states that when police protection is sought to implement a civil court decree, it should be readily given and the police should not insist on a specific (separate) court direction for this. Even after all these years, the GO is not implemented in letter and spirit, driving people unnecessarily to the court for separate orders. It is high time police officers respect the orders of this court and also the GO. Hence, to avoid such recurrence, the judge directed DGP to send reminders to all stations on following the GO.The judge observed that the demarcating line of jurisdiction for police as to when to interfere and when not to has been specified in an earlier order of this court. Perhaps, without understanding the stage at which they can interfere in civil matters, the police are insisting on the production of separate orders to provide protection. If necessary, the DGP may also issue a clarification in this regard, said the judge while disposing of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cops-shouldnt-seek-separate-order-to-offer-protection-hc/articleshow/85162737.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||HC: Redefine jurisdiction of family courts||Madurai: It is time for the legislature to redefine the jurisdiction of family courts by taking into account the fact that foreign marriages are innumerable at present, Madras high court has said. The court was hearing the civil revision petition filed by a woman seeking a direction to the Kanyakumari family court to take on file her petition filed under provisions of Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, seeking her child’s custody. Justice J Nisha Banu observed that the Act was enacted in 1890 when inter-country marriages or foreign marriages were not even contemplated unlike now when numerous such marriages are happening. Hence, it is time for the legislature to redefine the jurisdiction of the family court so that neither the children nor the person interested in the welfare of the children shall suffer, she observed. The woman had filed a petition before Kanyakumari family court seeking to declare her as the natural guardian of her minor son and to hand over his personal custody to her. The petition was returned by the court saying it lacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition as the couple from Kanyakumari had left India in 2014. The judge observed that as per Section 9 of the Act, if the application is with respect to guardianship of the minor, it shall be made to the jurisdictional district court of the place where the minor ordinarily resides. The word ‘ordinary resides’ would also include a mere temporary residence. Hence, the judge directed the family court to take on file the petition subject to the proof that would be adduced to show that the child was ordinarily residing at Kanyakumari as contemplated under Section 9 of the Act. If the issue relating to jurisdiction is doubtful, then it will be open to the family court to consider the same, said the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-redefine-jurisdiction-of-family-courts/articleshow/85162755.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||India||Opposition unity in house not temporary, follows discussions at leadership level: Jairam Ramesh||Rahul Gandhi has always been active and his presence only underlines the expectation in Congress that he take charge as president, senior party functionary and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh tells TOI. Excerpts from the interview:Rahul Gandhi is active again after a gap. What does it point to?Rahul Gandhi has always been active. It is the expectation of every Congressperson that Rahul gets elected as party president. We had announced an election schedule for June 30 which was deferred because of the second wave. But I am reflecting the sentiments of Congress workers across the country who are anticipating that Rahul will come back as party president. Has Congress settled its "GenNext vs old" faultline?The "young vs old" is a media creation. There was never such debate in Congress. Every party has to renew itself. You have to open the doors to a new generation. For every Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasada, the children of privilege who leave us for greener pastures, there are thousands of youngsters without the benefit of degree and pedigree who are slogging it out. Read AlsoRahul Gandhi meets opposition leaders over breakfast, rides bicycle to Parliament to protest fuel hikeIn a bid to present a united face on the Pegasus spyware issue, leaders of several opposition parties attended a breakfast meeting hosted by former Congress President Rahul Gandhi at the Constitution Club here on Tuesday. Apart from around 100 MPs of the Congress, leaders of several oppositionYou have to reflect their aspirations. We are a party of experience and veterans, we have to bring all together. And Rahul recognises that. Is the opposition unity limited to Parliament or will it shape the future anti-BJP alliance?This unity in Parliament reflects the commonality of views outside Parliament. It's a coming together of like-minded parties and though it is not yet a formal alliance, but these are parties who have had conversations at the leader-level and on two occasions submitted a joint memorandum to the Prime Minister on Covid and farm laws. For it to crytallize into a pre-poll alliance will require a lot of homework at the level of leaders. It is an evolving unity. The fact that Rahul Gandhi has been present in two meetings of the floor leaders and hosted a breakfast meeting... with Rahul at helm, they have spoken about issues which unite us. There are parties we are fighting in states who have attended these meetings, like AAP. How it evolves for 2024 is something we will take as it comes. Read Also'I am not a political astrologer': Mamata Banerjee on who will lead the proposed opposition alliance against BJPWest Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is on a mission to unite the opposition parties against the BJP, on Wednesday said she cannot predict about the leader of the proposed alliance as she is not a political astrologer. The West Bengal chief minister said the issue of leadership wouldCongress has seen repeated setbacks lately. Can it claw back against BJP in north and west India?We were expecting to form the government in Assam and Kerala and we did not expect a zero in Bengal polls. But we have to move on. We have to take these knocks and learn appropriate lessons. Congress won the last elections in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan against BJP, and we are a force in Jharkhand, Gujarat, Haryana. The 2014 results were a disappointment and 2019 were a deep shock. It is a wake-up call but Congress is a party with great resilience and name recognition across country and Congress system is the only way of managing India - see, how BJP uses "High Command", and hypocritically employs "Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas" slogan. There is still a lot of goodwill for Congress and we have to be effective in translating it into votes. Since the parties are ducking it, will the leadership issue prove the deal breaker again?These are premature issues and what is required is unity of purpose and programme. We are united to rid the country of Narendra Modi and the BJP government. But to consolidate the opposition, it has to have a solid programmatic content. The unity is riding the Bengal poll outcome. Could the next assembly polls early 2022 set it back?The opposition unity has multiple pillars, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and now Mamata Banerjee's magnificent victory. The TMC has been part of meetings in Parliament. Bengal is a transformative moment in the country's political story. We are optimistic that opposition unity will go beyond next assembly polls because all the parties realise the damage done to country's democratic institutions, economy and society by this "one-man show, two-men army of government".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oppn-unity-in-house-not-temporary-follows-discussions-at-leadership-level-jairam-ramesh/articleshow/85166380.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

But there too they had difficulty in getting beds. Hence, the number of beds is being increased in all the Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) to ensure better treatment in rural areas,” Dr Ashok Thorat, civil surgeon, said. The rural hospitals in Harsul (Trimbakeshwar taluka), Dindori (Dind ori), Dodi (Sinnar) and Ghoti (Igatpuri) will now have 40 beds, while the sub-district hospital in Trimbakeshwar will now have 80 beds. These hospitals did not have any oxygen beds earlier.Making the oxygen beds available in these hospitals will bring huge relief for the health administration as it will ensure people will get better treatment in their home towns instead of rushing towards Nashik city where they can find it difficult to get beds, even in private establishments.Oxygen beds will go up in Yeola, Kalwan and Chandwad’s sub-district hospitals to 100, while in Malegaon general hospital and Pimpalgaon sub-district hospitals will go up to 200. The number of beds in SMBT College will increase from 100 to 300 and in civil hospital from 200 to 400. “Besides, increasing the number of beds, it has been decided to ensure these beds have round-the-clock oxygen supply as well,” Thorat said. The health authorities are ensuring ample supply of oxygen through Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) Oxygen plant, Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tank or jumbo cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/o2-bed-count-in-rural-nashik-to-be-increased/articleshow/85158852.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Many festivals are celebrated in the month of aadi in temples which causes a surge in crowds during the period. As there was a marginal rise in Covid-19 cases in some of the districts, the Tamil Nadu government had announced some restrictions in regard to the temples. Rameswaram, the coastal temple town which sees lakhs of devotees coming to perform obeisance for their elders during Aadi amavasai, wore a deserted look. Police checkpoints were established at 32 places where the beach is accessible, from Uchipuli to Rameswaram, and people were prevented from bathing in the sea. However, in Madurai city large crowds gathered on the Vaigai river bed since early morning and were later sent away by the police personnel. They left a trail of plastic garbage on the river bed as they had started performing rituals from early morning with the help of priests. Temples like the Sathurgiri Sundaramahalingam temple, where thousands of people trek for Aadi amavasai, was deserted, and pujas were performed in all the temples without devotees. People were also not allowed to take a dip in the Thamirabarini river in Tirunelveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aadi-amavasai-remains-low-key-in-south-tn/articleshow/85162812.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro work faces club hurdle near Ruby-Kavi Subhas stretch||KOLKATA: Now a club near Ruby crossing that organises Jagaddhatri Puja has come in the way of the New Garia-Airport Metro’s Ruby-Kavi Subhas stretch that is veered towards an early-2022 commissioning. The implementing agency Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), eyeing to start operations along the priority section by February 2022, is desperately trying to expedite civil construction along the 5km viaduct and the five Metro stations dotting it. It has just overcome one hurdle at the same site in front of Passport Seva Kendra (PSK), where one of the four entry-exit points of the Hemanta Mukherjee Metro station is supposed to come up. Twenty-nine touts, who help people with filling up passport forms, have agreed to clear the site after RVNL set up makeshift shacks for them across the road. As CESC was about to divert its cable network to make way for the construction of the two entrances on the eastern side of EM Bypass, there came a new stumbling block for the project. At a meeting on June 15, KMDA, the custodian of EM Bypass — through which 10km of the 32km New Garia-Airport Metro runs — had instructed CESC to make way for the two station entry points and shift its cables along a 3m dedicated corridor on the extreme end of the eastern carriageway. To create the cable corridor, the structure housing the club must be razed. There is a tug of war over the club’s control. Golpark Shabhya Brind club member, who is also a local Trinamool leader, said, “We can’t have the club pulled down either. Ours is a 25-year-old organization that conducts Jagaddhatri Puja here.” He added, “One of our members, Uttam Saha, switched to BJP in the Assembly elections. He tried to stake claim to the club by putting up BJP flags. To prevent the takeover, we have locked the room since. This issue also needs to be sorted.” Saha, the BJP leader, could not be reached for comments. Among the five stations, the construction of entry points at the three —Kavi Subhash terminal (New Garia), Satyajit Ray and JN Nandy — is over. Kavi Sukanta (Avishikta crossing) has one entry point completed. The rest three will come up once the 120m viaduct gap at Avishikta crossing is filled in the next two months. But RVNL seems stuck with the station at Ruby crossing. An engineer said, “So far, we have only managed to construct one of the four accesses to Hemanta Mukherjee station. We don’t know how to meet the deadline for commissioning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-work-faces-club-hurdle-near-ruby/articleshow/85162813.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Madurai||‘Thirukkural fraud’: Spl court attaches Rs 65.5cr assets of firm||Madurai: A special court for TNPID (Tamil Nadu Protection of Interest of Depositors Act) cases in Madurai has ordered the attachment of properties worth Rs 65.46 crore of a firm that cheated people using ‘Thirukkural’ as its logo. The firm offered schemes requiring acquisition of the book in large numbers and defrauded over 45,000 people of their money.Paramount Marketing Corporation had functioned on Hakkim Ajmal Khan road in Chinna Chokkikulam in Madurai. It had five partners, all family members of managing director Sheik Mohideen, a former policeman with the forensic department who was relieved from service in 2005. His wife Shanu Sheik, sons Ghouse Sardhar Hussain and Ghouse Yacoob Hussain and the latter’s wife S Banu were the others. They floated various schemes, wherein the depositors had to deposit a specified amount for a specific number of copies of Thirukkural and were promised high returns. Many who did not get their money back filed complaints in 2010 following which the economic offences wing filed a case on May 6 that year and Sheik Mohideen was arrested. The chargesheet was filed in 2013 and criminal proceedings are under way in the high court. The accused are now out on bail. Among the five schemes, the most popular was the one in which depositors had to deposit Rs 10,000 for 100 Thirukkural books, which many of them did not receive but were assured of Rs 46,900 at the end of 36 months. The firm had prominently displayed a set of 1,000 books in its office room, but they were never given according to the depositors. Many deposited the money in multiples of Rs 10,000 and preferred not to receive the books. Nearly 45,501 depositors deposited a sum of Rs 65,46,87,508. They were also lured with lucrative commissions for bringing in new members.S Muthukrishnan had deposited Rs 7.98 lakh but received only Rs 2,59,600 in return. R Surlinathan deposited Rs 6.55 lakh but received just over Rs one lakh in return. One of them, a retired government employee who deposited his retirement benefits, was among the first complainants. The high court had directed the competent authority, the DRO, to take action and attach the properties of the firm and return the money to the depositors, but the accused kept going to court seeking extensions and relief leading to the case getting prolonged.Special court judge T V Hemanandkumar, who delivered the judgement recently, has ordered attachment of properties to the tune of Rs 65.46 crore from the fraudulent firm and repay the depositors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/thirukkural-fraud-spl-court-attaches-rs-65-5cr-assets-of-firm/articleshow/85162786.cms||---
---||Goa||Batim locals protest further devpt at largely destroyed historic site||Panaji: Water resources department’s (WRD) Rs 3.8-crore beautification project at Batim lake — the historic 17th century site where Goa’s first indigenous order was established — is kicking up more dust among villagers. Determined to halt further degradation of this historical site, locals have filed a complaint at the Agasaim police station for belated action against the quarrying activities that destroyed the Batim hill here. The nearly three-decade-long quarrying activities on the hill had led to a landslide some years ago in which an altar and Holy Cross dating to the 17th century were lost. The cross was recovered and erected in the quarry below. In the belated complaint filed by Confraria Reunidas da Igreja de Batim, a body of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, Batim, Confraria president Francisco Xavier Jacques, stated, “The historic landmark at Batim hill, marking the site where India’s first indigenous congregation of Catholic priests and perhaps Asia’s first, too, was set up, has been destroyed.” The altar and Holy Cross were part of the priests’ monastery — chapel of St John of Desert — in which Fr Pascoal D’Costa Jeremias of Margao along with four other priests set up the first Goan congregation, Holy Cross of Miracle, in October 1682. What makes it even more significant is that, during this era in Portuguese Goa, natives were banned from joining religious orders. In recent months, more parts of the hill caved in, opening a wider red gash in the green hill above the lake. Now, locals are worried that the lake beautification project, which comprises multiple infrastructure works at Zauro Udo, Batim, like desilting and de-weeding of the lake and stabilising of the fragile hillside on its northern border, may lead to concretisation of the green surroundings. Batim, in fact, has a multi-layered past and is home to several religious and historical stuctures. A copper plate found with a Keni family indicates that Batim lake was built by a certain Gandogopala Keni of Panjar Khani during the Kadamba era. A section of villagers are unhappy about the project. “I agree this is our first complaint in the matter. But we don’t want any more activities at the site,” Jacques said. The mines department had permitted quarrying in past years, but Jacques said that as a chairman of the Batim Tenants’ Association, he had stopped it for some time. As of date, the hill has lost a major part of its southern face and historicity. “It has been eaten up by road embankments of NH66, its recent expansion and other works,” another villager said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/batim-locals-protest-further-devpt-at-largely-destroyed-historic-site/articleshow/85162811.cms||Paul Fernandes

The corporation has now plans to acquire a robotic excavator for Rs 8 crore to solve the problem.Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said that the corporation had earlier proposed to purchase an amphibian machine, but the plan was ditched as it was big and it would have been difficult to navigate the narrow channels. Now, they have sent a proposal for a robotic excavator which traverse in narrow channels, climb bridges and is easy to transport. It is being acquired under the Swachh Bharath Mission scheme, with both Central and state government funds. “It would be slightly cheaper than the amphibian machine. The corporation will ask to include five years maintenance,” he said.The important channels in the city are Panthalkudi channel (2.4km), Vandiyur channel (3.2km) and Thathaneri channel (2.7 km) on the northern side of Vaigai river and Anuppanadi channel (3km), Panaiyur channel (1km) and Sottathatti channel (1km ) on the south side. Houses along the channels encroach it apart from letting in sewage and dumping garbage into it, which chokes it up. The channels were cleaned and sidewall constructed along it in 2008 under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, but that did not bring respite to these channels.K Hakkim, of Nelpettai said that the corporation should start educating people on keeping the channels clean. “When we tell people to stop dumping garbage into them, they tell us it is already a sewage channel and its purpose is to carry sewage and garbage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-to-acquire-robotic-excavator-to-clean-water-channels/articleshow/85162816.cms||---

A task force that has been formed with NKDA, Hidco, transport department officials, cops and other stakeholders to develop green transport in New Town has started taking an online citizen feedback survey, based on which plans would be drawn up to promote more environment-friendly modes of transport in the township. “About 600 people have so far responded to the survey. We have also sent the survey form to different educational institutes in the township so that we can also get feedback and ideas from students,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of resident forums in New Town, who is also involved with the task force. Das said the residents, who have responded, suggested that there should be a transport like mono rail or circular rail in the township. The survey questions that have been put on the NKDA website for the residents to respond include their age group, number of family members, whether the person uses private car or avails of public transport etc. The residents are also asked what mode of transport they used to take before the pandemic. App-based Toto and auto services that were introduced last year had been withdrawn within a few months. Hidco is operating three electric buses in the township now but the residents want the authorities to curtail the existing routes that are much long and increase the frequency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-residents-back-green-transport/articleshow/85162867.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Schooling through cable TV networks that was started by the Mangaon gram panchayat has become a template for many local bodies to overcome the challenges of online classes through smartphones. The Mangaon gram panchayat has been live streaming the classes through cable networks. However, in the case of KMC, pre-recorded videos will be streamed initially and then live streaming of classes through multiple channels will start. The pre-recorded videos will also be uploaded on YouTube. Shankar Yadav, the chief administrator of KMC’s education department said, “There are several limitations of online teaching through smartphones. We have an option to teach students in clusters, however, it had limitations due to the rain and floods. Now we are switching to teaching through local cable TV networks. We have set up pre-recorded teaching videos. We will start teaching the students appearing for scholarship exams, which are just a few days away. Then we will start teaching students of classes 1 to 7 on regular basis. The live streaming of lectures also has some limitations so we have decided to go for streaming pre-recorded videos, which will have good video quality and will be audible.” Yadav said schooling through cable TV networks has been planned with the focus on students from Kolhapur city, but it will benefit the students across the district and two talukas of neighbouring Sangli district, which have the reach of the cable networks in most households. “These cable networks have a total reach of six lakh households,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kmc-to-impart-lessons-via-local-cable-tv-networks/articleshow/85158875.cms||---

Even with less than 5,000 active cases and a fraction of it hospitalised, the city currently needs 200 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen a day. In the peak of the second wave in April, the demand touched 260-270 MT, triggering a frantic search to refill oxygen for at least five days. “We don’t want to see that kind of crisis again. Our plan is to ensure the city has 400 MT, and is almost self-sufficient,” said P Velrasu, additional civic commissioner (projects).  The plan broadly involves installing more liquid medical oxygen tanks in hospitals, creating PSA (Pressure swing Adsorption) plants through CSR and self-funding, and set up refill stations. Emphasis is on building PSA plants as each can generate over 1 metric tonne oxygen. Seven of these plants are created with CSR funds and set up at Kasturba, Bhabha and Cooper hospitals. Also, BMC is installing 16 more PSA plants at nine hospitals that would generate 41MT of oxygen. Although commission and implementation of the plants are mired in controversy, Velrasu said they will be functional by August 15. “All PSA plants put together will generate almost 48 MT of oxygen which will help wards become self-sufficient,” he said.  It is also proposed to set up another 45 PSA plants at an estimated cost of Rs 240 crore. A proposal is on and could take two months. Installing a PSA plant involves a cost of Rs 2-2.5crore. But, while PSA plants can sustain wards, they can’t replace need for high-pressure oxygen — the mainstay of ICUs.  At present, all 200MT of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) comes from suppliers like Inox and Linde who deliver to hospitals having 10-13kilolitre tanks to store it. While 21 LMOs were installed after the first wave, BMC plans to add four 13KL tanks in jumbo facilities at NSCI, Nesco, Richardson & Cruddas in Byculla and Somaiya in Sion. Two 40KL tanks are being imported from China to be installed at jumbos in Kanjurmarg and Somaiya.  A refilling station is also coming up at Mahalaxmi, where upto 100 dura cylinders can be filled daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/to-pre-empt-oxygen-crisis-bmc-begins-work-on-doubling-supply-in-mumbai/articleshow/85165261.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Dehradun||Himalayan grit: In a first, 2 ITBP women graduates to get in combat roles||MUSSOORIE: Two women officers who graduated as part of a batch of 53 officers to pass out from the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) academy on Sunday will become the first women officers to be deployed in combatised roles by the mountain warfare force. Prakriti and Diksha (both of them use only their first names) were commissioned into the force as assistant commandants (general duty) after completing a 52-week course at the academy. Prakriti hails from Bihar while Diksha hails from Uttar Pradesh. Prakriti's father has retired from the Indian Air Force (IAF) whereas Diksha’s father Kamlesh Kumar is an inspector in ITBP. Kumar, in his khaki uniform, saluted his daughter after the parade and got a crisp salute in return following which they hugged each other. “My father is my role model. He never considered me lesser than anyone,” Diksha said. Prakriti, who holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, said life in the force is “very tough but it is also challenging and exciting.” The ITBP started recruiting women combat officers in its cadre from 2016 through an all-India examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Before this, it only had women in combat roles in the constabulary ranks. Bhanu Pratap Singh, deputy commandant of the academy, told TOI that earlier, the women officers who passed out were deputed in non-combat roles like the medical service. Chief minister of Uttarakhand Pushkar Singh Dhami, who was the chief guest at the Passing Out Parade congratulated the young officers who he said were taking their “first step for serving the nation.” “I am the son of a soldier and I have seen from up close the struggles that families of defence personnel go through,” Dhami said. The CM also lauded the force for bringing out its first-ever history book, which has some 1,000 unseen operational photographs starting from the period when the Union government was planning to raise the ITBP. “The book has been published in view of making a reference volume for factual history and knowledge of the force to the officers and jawans. It will also be useful for administrative and training purposes and for gaining in-depth details and is the official history of the force,” ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said. S S Deswal, director general of ITBP, said that the force had been maintaining the highest level of professionalism by training its personnel in the emerging and changing security scenario. He added that ITBP personnel had also been at the forefront in the fight against Covid-19 in the country. The officers who passed out on Sunday included 42 officers who have completed the 52-week course and will be posted in the field as assistant commandant (general duty) while the rest 11 have completed a 25-week course, and will be posted as assistant commandant (engineer).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-a-first-2-women-officers-graduating-from-itbp-academy-to-be-posted-in-combat-roles/articleshow/85156705.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Goa||UP man accused in Pramod Sawant fake ID case gets bail||PANAJI: A Panaji court has granted conditional bail to 26-year-old Mohammed Sakir Hussain, who was arrested by the crime branch for allegedly creating a fake social media account in the name of chief minister Pramod Sawant, and requesting people to transfer money into a Paytm account with an intention to cheat them. “It is pertinent to note that the accused is in custody since August 2. Besides, the investigation in the present case would primarily involve information from service providers and other institutes, which would take a considerable amount of time. The investigation being mostly documentary, further custodial interrogation is not warranted. Even otherwise, police had sufficient time for custodial interrogation,” the court held. “Further, as the investigation would need substantial time, the accused cannot be kept languishing in jail until such investigation is completed,” the court stated, adding that there was no ground made out for further custodial interrogation. Hussain’s lawyer D Dhond told the court that he is not connected to the offence and is a seller of SIM cards, who sells them to factory workers. He submitted that the UP resident has no knowledge of computers and is residing with his wife and four children, and is the only earning member of his family. He added that no complaint has been made by any person of being cheated, and that the complaint is filed against unknown persons and therefore there’s no direct link of the applicant. The investigating officer submitted to the court that the investigation is at a preliminary stage, and that his custody is required to interrogate him, and that he is not a permanent resident of Goa and could jump bail. The officer said that if released on bail, there’s a possibility he will continue to commit similar crimes and dupe more people using the same modus operandi. It was also pointed out that the SIM cards were sold without confirming the buyers’ ID cards, and fake documents were used while issuing the cards. Even the identity of the applicant is not certain, as his photograph appears on an Aadhar card in the name of one Anil Kumar, the court was told.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/up-man-accused-in-sawant-fake-id-case-gets-bail/articleshow/85162877.cms||---

Speaking to reporters, Badami said, “The land on the hilly slopes which had already become very fragile could not hold the excess rainwater of the monsoon that flowed down, resulting in the landslides. This aggravates the flood situation on the banks of the Mhadei river in Sattari. After studying the matter in detail we will plan the strategy to cope with the problem.” Deforestation has been taking place over the last three decades in the upper reaches of the Kalsa river in Chikhale, Parwad and the old settlement of Amgao. Environmentalists in Goa and Karnataka had earlier informed the forest department of Karnataka about the deforestation. Currently while forest clearances have been curtailed, heavy rain water this year gushed down causing severe landslides, destroying forest cover in an area of more than two kilometres. Huge quantities of sediment has been flowing through the Kalsa nallah into the Mhadei. The seasonal nallah from the forest of the Ambyacho Gawal has also drastically changed its course. Landslides have been responsible for numerous geological changes in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fragile-hill-slopes-could-not-hold-excess-rainwater/articleshow/85162958.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Rajendra, a resident of Turkichhajan under Kudhani block in Muzaffarpur district, was admitted to the hospital on August 6. SKMCH head of paediatrics department, Dr Gopal Shankar Sahni, said on Sunday the victim was brought to the facility in a critical condition. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the paediatrics ward, but couldn’t survive. “We tried our level best to save the child but in vain,” he added. The victim's relative, Santu Manjhi, said, “Rajendra complained of high fever, body ache and convulsion two days back. The family contacted a local quack, who gave him some drugs. On Thursday, he was referred to the SKMCH where he died on Saturday.” According to an official data released by the Muzaffarpur district administration, altogether 57 cases of AES have been reported to the SKMCH from different districts in north Bihar since January this year. Of them, 13 died and 41 were discharged after their health improved. At present, only one child was undergoing treatment in the PICU ward of the hospital after being diagnosed as AES infected. Two people had earlier left the hospital without informing the authorities concerned, a senior health department official said. SKMCH superintendent Dr B S Jha said an awareness campaign was underway in the areas earmarked as worst hit due to AES. Majority of the cases were reported from Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, East Champaran and West Champaran districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-more-child-dies-of-aes-at-muz-hospital-toll-rises-to-13/articleshow/85156779.cms||Ramashankar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BEST set to restart feeder services from railway stations on August 15||MUMBAI: With the city’s lifeline — local trains — all set to welcome its quintessential commuter, at least those who have been fully vaccinated, from August 15, the city’s red bus — BEST — will ply on ‘feeder routes’ in a full-fledged manner. This means that buses which used to run from railway stations to pockets at the far west or the east will now be pressed into service for commuter convenience. The feeder routes had been discontinued since the outbreak of thepandemic due to which locals trains were out of bounds for the general public. In another development, the BEST announced that it has now truncated most of its ‘long-distance’ routes, and will instead run buses on ‘short’ routes as a majority of commuters — at least 60% — prefer to travel by the red buses on short-distances, said a senior official. As part of the plan to run buses on short-distance routes, the BEST announced on Sunday that it has cobbled up seven ‘hubs’ which officials claimed would help in seamless travel and improve the frequency of buses. “When there are shorter routes, we can connect them through a hub which will be an intermediary bus station where commuters can terminate his trip or catch a second bus as per his or her convenience,” the official said. At a hub, there will soon be indicators showing expected time of next buses departing from that bus station. It will be more convenient for commuters to change buses at a hub rather than get down at any stop and change a route,” he said. One of these hubs will be the revamped Mahim bus station, with four bus tracks, which was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday. The other hubs will be at Sion, Wadala, Dadar, Jogeshwari, Andheri and Santacruz, the official said. Commuters can interchange buses at the hubs. So to travel from western suburbs to south Mumbai, one can travel up to Mahim and get a seamless connect in another bus to Colaba/Cuffe Parade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-set-to-restart-feeder-services-from-railway-stations-on-august-15/articleshow/85164955.cms||Somit Sen
---||Goa||Cannot get quarantine exemption for friendly, Malaysia tells AIFF||Panaji: The Football Association of Malaysia has told the All India Football Federation that they would not be able to host an international friendly during the August-September Fifa window in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia and India were keen to play each other in Kuala Lumpur during the Fifa window later this month. However, the Malaysian government’s mandatory 14-day quarantine for all incoming travellers means the friendly is no longer possible. “Our request to get the mandatory 14-days quarantine exempted has failed due to the rising number of cases recorded daily here in Malaysia,” FAM general secretary Stuart Ramalingam wrote to AIFF general secretary Kushal Das on Saturday. Malaysia added 17,236 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, while another 212 deaths were reported, bringing the death toll to 10,961. The letter from FAM was the latest setback for AIFF who have been trying to arrange friendlies for the national team. Indonesia, Singapore and Palestine were also contacted, while a planned visit to Turkey for friendlies against Libya and Jordan did not materialise due to strict Covid-19 protocols. “We are starting the camp in mid-August. We need to start working at least 10-14 days before the friendlies in September. But I also need to tell you now that it's really difficult to find opponents in Asia,” national coach Igor Stimac told TOI in an interview last week. Meanwhile, with an eye on preparations for the friendlies next month, the national team will be camping in Kolkata from August 15. “The camp will be conducted under a secured bio-bubble adhering to the laid-down health parameters in wake of the current pandemic situation. The contingent will also be undergoing regular testing,” the AIFF said in a statement on Monday. Stimac has named his initial list of 23 probables, leaving out players from ATK Mohun Bagan and Bengaluru FC due to their commitments in the AFC Cup in the Maldives. Players from both clubs will join the squad immediately after finishing their club commitments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cannot-get-quarantine-exemption-for-friendly-malaysia-tells-aiff/articleshow/85190663.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

In all, 973 such children were identified in the previous survey held in November 2020. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) will be organising the survey jointly with child labour elimination and effective rehabilitation society(CHEERS), Child Line and others in the 16 blocks. Block-level teams comprising SSA volunteers (out of school children) and others including government school headmasters and teachers will be carrying out door-to-door survey. “The survey was to be held in May, but due to the second wave, it is being conducted now,” said SSA district coordinator (out of children) M Anbarasu. He said that the 973 children identified in the previous survey included 344 intermittent explosive disorder (IED) children, 302 children who discontinued studies due to lack of interest or encouragement from parents, 198 who had the calibre to study but dropped out and 129 child labourers. IED children have been given education at 18 centres under school readiness programme with each centre having 15 to 25 students. For those who dropped out of education due to various reasons including family disputes, SSA has been running 14 special training centres (STCs) with 302 children. Out of 14 STCS, 65 children in the categories are given accommodation in two residential STCs since they are orphaned. The last year survey also rescued 129 child labourers. Anbarasu pointed out that urban pockets have more such children than rural areas. Besides the yearly survey, CHEERS, Magalir Thittam, labour department and child line identified 148 child labourers from April 2020 to the present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/survey-of-disabled-out-of-school-kids-from-aug-10/articleshow/85162983.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Further, TCs are not mandatory to get admitted to a government school. “Private schools are already reeling under financial losses as we have been unable to collect the allowed fees properly during the last year. Granting TC without requiring to settle the pending fees will only further the burden of schools. We have no qualms in amicably settling the fees before giving the TC. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have only been lenient in giving parents time to pay the fees. The government must consider welfare of private schools as well,” said M Arumugam, state president of Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). Private schools say such decisions will only be taken advantage by parents. “We are not apathetic to the financial situation of parents. But giving such leeway for paying fees without holding parents accountable for anything will greatly affect functioning of private schools and teachers. We have seen some parents not even notifying the school before getting admission to another school,” said the principal of a private matriculation school in Madurai. School principals further noted that many parents are yet to pay even some of the fees pending since the start of 2020. A maths teacher who teaches for middle school students said that few parents are also looking to jump to government schools temporarily, mainly to avail subsidies and avoid paying fees, while on the other hand rely on private tuition classes. Arumugam also said that students are getting enrolled in another school by just using their TN Educational Management Information System (EMIS) ID number without even notifying the previous school and urged that it must be made mandatory that EMIS ID number can be shared only with consent of the previous school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pvt-schools-upset-over-hc-govt-orders-against-holding-back-tcs/articleshow/85162960.cms||---

Party won’t see if it’s a man or woman candidate. Ultimately, the party looks for a winnable candidate,” Srinivasan said. Addressing the BJP Goa mahila morcha state executive, she also said that BJP is the “only national party that has vigorously worked towards women empowerment”. She further said that under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, women are the biggest beneficiaries of many schemes launched by his government. “BJP aims at empowering women,” she said. “Whenever our PM contemplates launching a new initiative, he thinks about women’s empowerment. Under his government, we have 11 women ministers in the cabinet. Our daughters are winning medals for this country,” she said. She also emphasised that women candidates have been recognised and rewarded accordingly. Meanwhile, BJP general secretary Sukhpreet Kaur applauded the women karyakartas for their round-the-clock efforts and dedication towards the party. Kaur maintained that women play a vital role in their respective homes as well as for the party. “Women play a vital role, and this is the strength of our sanghatan. So, if a woman at home tells that BJP should be voted to office, the entire family votes for the party. Such is the reach of a woman,” she said. Kaur urged the women karyakartas in Goa to make their presence felt on social media platforms in order to publicise the various schemes of the Modi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-ticket-bjp-looks-at-winnability-not-gender/articleshow/85163076.cms||---

Businessman and real estate entrepreneur Altone D’Costa and Kavlekar’s former aide Arjun Velip are strong contenders for the Congress ticket. Meanwhile, staunch Congressman and former Quepem municipality chairperson Raul Pereira has decided to part ways with the party. Pereira held a meeting with his supporters on Sunday who, it is learnt, gave him the go-ahead to join AAP and contest the 2022 elections. Speaking to TOI after the meeting, Pereira confirmed that he has made up his mind to leave Congress as he was “hurt” over being sidelined by the party leadership. “I have been a Congressman since the last several decades. Besides working for Kavlekar’s victory in the last several elections, I have also worked for the party in the last two Loksabha elections. Recently, I also toured the entire Quepem constituency with party president Girish Chodankar. Ahead of the elections, I feel that the party hasn’t recognised my services and I am being sidelined,” Pereira said. What has apparently upset Pereira is the party’s decision to ignore his candidature to succeed Manuel Colaco, who died recently, as the Quepem Congress block president. “I may or may not join AAP. But I will definitely contest the 2022 polls. I have a point to prove and I am confident of winning the elections this time,” Pereira said. Meanwhile, senior BJP functionary and former minister Prakash Velip on Thursday remained evasive over whether he would stake claim for the party ticket from Quepem constituency, but stressed that he would support any candidate finalised by the party. However, he kept everybody guessing about his decision to contest the 2022 assembly elections with his loaded reply to a pointed question. “I contested my first election when I was 31. Now I have completed 68 years of my life. How many more years should one be in politics?” he told reporters.  In 2012, Velip had contested the assembly elections as an independent, but lost to Kavlekar. He contested the 2017 on BJP ticket, but lost to Kavlekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quepem-set-for-twist-as-4-time-ex-cong-mla-readies-for-bjp-ticket/articleshow/85163046.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Gold heist bid: Accused plotted to murder cops||Kozhikode: In a new twist to the Ramanattukara gold heist bid, it has emerged that the accused in the case had allegedly hatched a plan to murder the investigating officers. The police stumbled upon the plan to kill the investigating officers by orchestrating a fake road accident when they examined the mobile phone of Riyas, one of the accused arrested in the case. Riyas hailing from Koduvally was nabbed on July 2. Karipur police officers said that during the forensic examination of the mobile phone, deleted chats and messages were retrieved which mentioned about engaging a quotation gang to eliminate the investigating officers by crashing a lorry onto their vehicle. The chat messages allegedly mentioned about keeping a lorry without proper documents ready for the purpose. One of the investigating officers in the case had also received a threatening phone call stating that his family members will be kidnapped. Police officiers conducted raids at Koduvally on Sunday in the houses of persons suspected to be involved in the plan. The police team probing the Ramanattukara gold heist case had so far arrested 27 accused and seized 16 vehicles. None of the arrested accused has been granted bail so far. The gold heist bid came to light when five persons belonging to the 15-member Cherupulassery gang had died in a road accident after their car collided with a lorry on June 21. They were returning after pursuing a car on the belief that a carrier who had brought gold was in the vehicle without knowing that customs had seized the 2.3kg gold which the gang had planned to rob. Multiple gangs were part of the operation and police had registered case under IPC section 399 (making preparation to commit dacoity) in connection with the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/gold-heist-bid-accused-plotted-to-murder-cops/articleshow/85160729.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: KG kids get hands-on training in planting trees||Mumbai: After six-year-old Vivana Shah gingerly placed her tree sapling in a hole in the mud at Kamla Nehru Park, she dusted her hands and said to her best friend, “When we grow up, you can climb up my pomegranate tree and I will climb your chikoo tree... and we will share our fruits in our break box.” Her friend replied, “And if you spot a parrot on mine, let me know.” Last weekend, the children of Cathedral Infant School left their Zoom school, put on their little masks and got their hands dirty planting 243 fruit trees across various public gardens in Mumbai. After nurturing baby saplings at home for a month until they were a little stronger, the children planted them across four parks and then proudly announced to their parents: Each tree will grow up and each will give the city 120kg of oxygen a year. “When you engage all their senses—eyes, hands and ears—it starts sinking in and reaching their subconscious,” says Jignasa Shah, a school mother who has been conducting gardening and environment awareness exercises with the children, and initiated the tree planting drive through her family’s horticultural business. “For example, you can demonstrate soil erosion with a blow dryer and then show how planting a sapling prevents that. They start correlating things.” She recalls how some of the children were chattering about how corona came because the earth was not happy. The initiative was a collaboration between the BMC and the Cathedral & John Connon Infant School. “Every school should do this,” says Jyotsna Mehta, BMC corporator who supported the drive along with the civic garden department. “We have done this before with older children, but this was the first time with such tiny children. If you start young, they will develop an incredible love for nature which will keep revealing itself as they grow older.” The city lost 2,363 trees during the recent cyclone and many more as part of ongoing infrastructure development. The children will go back to monitor the plants after six months and a year. “I am particularly glad about that because the children will realise that the trees need to be nurtured, and also learn that all the trees will not survive, how difficult it is to grow a tree to the length that we see around us,” says environmentalist Zoru Bhathena, who has grown into one of the city’s most beloved tree activists. “So, the entire chain of events is important for the children. There may be a bit of heartbreak because they are so little, but they will also learn what goes into creating a giant sheltering tree.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kg-kids-get-hands-on-training-in-planting-trees/articleshow/85164985.cms||Namita Devidayal

Although the corridor has Sidco industrial estates, with hundreds of industries into engineering and fabrication deprived of work orders, the trade organisations want the government to promote food industries in the region known for agrarian activities. With most of the industries on the Trichy - Thanjavur stretch heavily relying on Bhel for orders to manufacture components for thermal power plants, the global hesitation in erecting new thermal power plants has hit MSMEs hard. With the pandemic heavily impacting even the surviving organisations, MSMEs in Trichy and delta districts have been eyeing the food sector to diversify into. Since Trichy-Thanjavur NH has five industrial estates, entrepreneurs said that subsidies and soft loans to promote the corridor will augment employment opportunities. “The defence corridor project is ignoring MSMEs in Trichy while the Sipcot industrial park in Manapparai remains underutilised. At least the government should help us make a foray into food processing sector,” R Ilango, president of Tiruchirapalli district tiny & small scale industries association (Tiditssia) said. The trade bodies said the fall in orders from Bhel for ancillary units did not allow them to expand. Instead, the existing industries have only shut.As the presence of Indian Institute of Food Processing and Technology (IIFPT) in Thanjavur and National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) Trichy will technically help entrepreneurs to hone the skills required for food processing and value addition, the trade bodies urged the government to declare a corridor for delta districts. “Food processing industries in delta districts will ensure a win-win situation for farmers and industries. The region did not get the required focus as far as industrial development is concerned in recent years,” said V Ramachandran, president, Nagapattinam district tiny & small scale industries association. Also with the semi-ring road work under way to interlink Trichy-Thanjavur NH with four other highways connecting southern and western districts, the entrepreneurs said they have approached the government to push for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/msmes-pitch-for-industrial-corridor-along-trichy-nagapattinam-nh/articleshow/85163106.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal food plan to feed 6,000 at 209 shelters||NEW DELHI: Around 6,000 people living in the 209 shelter homes in Delhi would now get two wholesome meals a day free thanks to the Mukhyamantri Poshahaar Yojana launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday. Delhi government has launched the shelter home feeding initiative in collaboration with Akshaya Patra Foundation. As part of the initiative, people at shelter homes run by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) would be provided a nutritious lunch and dinner. The number of those staying at the shelter homes doubles during winters and apart from these people, 3,000 labourers at Delhi government’s project sites would also get benefit of the initiative, the government stated. “The poorest of the poor reside in shelter homes operated by the government,” Kejriwal said after launching the initiative on Sunday. He said these people are forced to sleep on roads and footpaths and come to shelter homes to escape the harsh weather and get a place to sleep. These people, Kejriwal added, do not make up the vote-bank of any political party, and a majority of them do not even possess voter ID cards. “This is why no matter which party came into power, they did not care about the condition of all these people,” he claimed. The CM said that in the past 6-7 years, Delhi government has transformed the condition of shelter homes in the city. “Earlier, the condition was so disastrous that not even the poorest wanted to come and live under the roof of the shelter homes; the toilets were terrible, there was no drinking water, no provision of bathing,” he said. “The time has now come for a new beginning. At the start of the pandemic-induced lockdown last year, we had started arrangements for two meals a day in the shelter homes. Now I am delighted that Akshaya Patra Foundation has come forward to take the initiative ahead,” Kejriwal added. Urban development minister Satyendar Jain said that Akshaya Patra will be providing free meals twice a day to the people at shelter homes. He said provisions are being made to feed everyone in the winter months too, when the number at the shelter homes doubles. “I am thankful to Akshaya Patra them for coming forward to take up the responsibility,” Jain added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-food-plan-to-feed-6k-at-209-shelters/articleshow/85163093.cms||---
---||Goa||Elvis joins Congress, Girish says Gomes and Yuri will work together||Panaji: Bureaucrat turned politician and former AAP state convener, who was also the party’s chief ministerial candidate in 2017, Elvis Gomes joined Congress on Sunday, saying that Congress remains the “best option” in the current political situation. Welcoming his entry into the party fold, state Congress president Girish Chodankar brushed aside rumblings in Salcete about two contenders emerging for the Cuncolim assembly seat in the 2022 elections. Chodankar said that the AICC would decide on the Cuncolim assembly candidate based on independent surveys and as per the party’s laid down procedure for selecting candidates. Former minister Joaquim Alemao’s son Yuri Alemao is vying for the Cuncolim seat and Gomes has also made his intentions clear to contest from the same place. “Yuri and Elvis will work together to take Congress forward in Cuncolim,” said Chodankar. “Yuri and Elvis are two different individuals with different skills and specialities. Congress will take a decision in the interest of both and the party, and in the interest of Goa at the appropriate time.” Gomes and Alemao, while speaking at the party headquarters, said that they will work together in the interest of the party. “All of us feel that BJP is the enemy and we have to oust them. Congress should reach pan Goa, as per our survey we will win 25-26 seats. I will be the first to welcome anyone into the party,” said Alemao, who made it a point to shake hands with Gomes after the latter’s induction. The only victorious panel in the civic polls was floated by Alemao in Cuncolim. “The High Command will take the right decision and there will be no injustice to anyone. Our process of candidate selection has not started. The high command and we have decided that we both will be doing an independent survey and based it a decision will be taken about the candidates,” Chodankar said. “Congress is the best option for Goa with a pan-India reach,” Gomes said. As a bureaucrat, Gomes has served as the commissioner of the Corporation of the City of Panaji as well as the director of tourism and municipal administration. Gomes was a bitter critic of Congress and often slammed the party for allowing MLAs to switch sides to BJP. Gomes said he stands by his views. “I stand by every word that I said against anybody that time because I have spoken on the basis of facts,” Gomes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/elvis-joins-congress-girish-says-gomes-and-yuri-will-work-together/articleshow/85163107.cms||---

Returning officer Kabir Shirgaonkar said the no-confidence motion was rejected owing to absence of all opposition councillors. Consequently, the Dharmesh Sagalani-led ‘Together For Sakhali’ ruling group has retained control over SMC's administration once again while foiling yet another attempt by BJP functionaries to wrest control of the civic body. The ruling panel now comprises Parsekar, Rajesh Sawal, Rajendra Ameshkar, Kunda Madkar, Jyoti Blagan, Ansira Khan and their leader Dharmesh Saglani. Sakhali municipality is part of CM Pramod Sawant’s Sakhali assembly constituency. “BJP has made many attempts to change our ruling body, but it has not been successful. Now at least, instead of making such moves, everyone should come together and work for the development of Sakhali town,” Parsekar said. He further said that with assembly elections just six months away, BJP functionaries should concentrate on completing the pending issues and focus on development instead of planning such attempts to destabilise the council. “If everybody works unitedly, it will ultimately help to develop Sakhali town with vigour and enthusiasm,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sakhali-municipal-chief-survives-no-trust-motion/articleshow/85163166.cms||---
---||Trichy||Work begins on Srirangam STEM park||Trichy: Trichy corporation has started the work on Trichy city’s first science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) park under the smart cities mission programme at Srirangam. The park will be the second-largest in the city in area after Panjappur Green Park. Civic body sources said that the STEM park will be constructed at a cost of Rs 14.90 crore on a site near the Yatri Nivas on Flood Bank Road that was found unsuitable for the Srirangam bus stand project. Of the total six acres of land, the civic body will utilise 3.6 acres for the STEM park. The edutainment facility is likely to be named after Sir C V Raman, a Nobel laureate in Physics hailed from the city. The park will have a mini planetarium and mini theatre each having a capacity to accommodate 50 people. An indoor science exhibit centre to induce curiosity among children to learn science, mathematics and technology through physical exhibits are part of the proposal. Outdoor interactive equipment will also be set up for kids to learn the fundamentals of science in an innovative manner, the officials said. “There was a slight delay in launching the civil work due to the pandemic. The contractor has engaged workers in full swing to commission the park in six months,” a corporation official said. As there is a science park at Thennur, queries were raised whether the new park will also be similar to the existing one. However, officials clarified that the proposed STEM park will have state-of-the-art science equipment different from those in the public parks. The civic body floated a tender for the STEM park in September 2020. As the site identified was a low-lying area, the civic body said that the process of increasing the ground level to that of the access road had consumed time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/work-begins-on-srirangam-stem-park/articleshow/85163079.cms||Deepak Karthik

The residents of Narian Street had complained of overgrown weeds occupying the channel that helped in breeding of mosquitoes. However, the civic body blamed the residents for dumping solid waste and discharging wastewater in the canal that helps the growth of weeds. The corporation said that the residents had complained about the weeds to the Srirangam MLA M Palaniyandi. After MLA’s direction, the corporation workers through machinery had removed tonnes of weeds from the 500m-long channel passing through Narian Street and adjacent railway tracks in Srirangam. Although ward number 3 in Srirangam was facilitated with the UGD network long back, the corporation acknowledged that there were several establishments still not connected to the network. “We have submitted a proposal to streamline the existing UGD network by covering these establishments. The collected sewage can be sent to the sewage treatment plant by establishing additional pumping houses, this will be the permanent solution,” an official with the civic body said. In the next few days, the corporation has planned to clear the water hyacinths from the same channel passing through Salai Road and Melur Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/desilting-work-begins-in-srirangam-channel/articleshow/85163118.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Single-use plastic still problem, action plan to push alternatives||NEW DELHI: With the government proposing to prohibit plastic items in stages, the environment department of Delhi government is formulating an action plan after consulting experts on possible alternatives for identified single-use plastic. Two meetings with stakeholders have been conducted to seek suggestions on possible alternatives. The environment ministry has proposed prohibiting sale and manufacture of six items, including earbuds, plastic sticks, balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks and polystyrene (thermocol) from January 2022 and 13 items, including plates, cups, glasses and cutlery, from July 2022. As the Centre is targeting to phase out single-use plastic in mission mode by 2022 from the country, the government plans to prohibit the sale and manufacture of plastic bags less than 240 microns from this October. The banning of these items is part of the draft Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2021. A senior official said the environment department is conducting virtual discussions with leading FMCGs, research institutes, plastic associations, recyclers, consultants, sustainability entrepreneurs, private sector and brand owners for brainstorming on potential single-use plastic alternatives and its feasibility. “We have been asking all speakers to give suggestions on feasible alternatives of 19 single-use plastic items as per the draft Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2021 for the purpose of drafting a policy note, specific to Delhi,” said the official. The chief secretary has stressed the importance of all stakeholders working together and evolving a pragmatic action plan with clear timelines and responsibilities for phasing out single-use plastic, the official added. At the recent meeting of the stakeholders, some suggestions that were presented were reduction of tax for entrepreneurs manufacturing plastic alternatives, replacing plastic bags with eco-friendly options, incentivising green and sustainable products, conducting mass awareness campaigns for both consumers and manufacturers, recycling of some products and ensuring strong enforcement on implementation of alternatives to single-use plastics. The special task force, which has been constituted to work for phasing out single-use plastic, had asked Delhi Pollution Control Committee to make concerted efforts to ensure that all industrial units functioning in Delhi and are falling within the purview of the Plastic Waste Management (amended) Act, 2016 are registered under the relevant provisions of the Act within a prescribed time limit. “DPCC should conduct awareness regarding registration of manufacturers, producers and recyclers to bring more producers into the registration net by August. Thereafter, DPCC should conduct a special enforcement drive in September and October against unregistered plastic manufacturing and recycling units,” suggested an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/single-use-plastic-still-problem-action-plan-to-push-alternatives/articleshow/85163149.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||Chicalim youth transplant paddy as part of agri challenge||Vasco: The Chicalim Youth Farmers Club (CYFC), which is cultivating a fallow field as part of an ‘agriculture revival challenge’, has recently completed the transplanting stage of paddy farming. This activity was taken up with mechanical support provided by the agro group, ‘Goenche Xetkar’, which is mentored by Fr George Quadros. From clearing up the field of weeds, to tilling the land, ploughing it and levelling it in preparation for plating the crop, and now transplanting the paddy seedlings, the young members of the club have been working hard under the guidance of local farmer Rui da Costa Araujo. Commenting on the activity, Alisha Pereira, a teacher at Regina Mundi School said, “This field has been lying fallow for over 25 years. In fact, I have never seen it cultivated till date. Today, however, it is great to see it all green. Watching the transplanter at work was also a great experience. Mechanised farming methods are a great help to do a lot of work in a short period of time. Also, I got a chance to grab a ride on the transplanter,” Pereira said. Meanwhile, Araujo, who has been mentoring the youngsters said, “Happy to see that the youth of Chicalim got a chance to work with the soil, including getting their hands dirty, in order to take up this challenge of cultivating a field. Hope the enthusiasm and interest remains alive in the years to come.” “The CYFC, a group of youth, for youth and by youth, was formed with a vision to help youngsters reconnect with nature. The agricultural revival challenge initiative was taken up by them in a bid to encourage more people, especially youngsters to take up community farming,” said Chicalim parish priest and CYFC mentor, Fr Bolmax Pereira. The challenge was launched on June 5, on the occasion of World Environment Day. The challenge itself has been fraught with many difficulties for the youth, including working through incessant rain and stormy weather. And though the number of participants kept dwindling, the determination and self-confidence of a few members helped the group get the field ready for cultivation. They are now hopeful that their hard work converts into a bountiful harvest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicalim-youth-transplant-paddy-as-part-of-agri-challenge/articleshow/85163157.cms||Ruvina Khan

However, as the devotees were barred from opting to perform pujas (archanai) owing to Covid-19 restrictions, the temples are awaiting the government order in this regard.The temples in Trichy that have the option of performing archanai in Tamil include Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam, Woraiyur Arulmigu Vekkaliamman temple, Samayapuram Arulmigu Mariamman temple and Thiruvanaikoil Arulmigu Jambukeswarar temple. HR&CE sources said that ever since the government made an announcement to encourage Tamil medium of worship, devotees are enquiring about worshipping the deities in their mother tongue.“Since people can understand the prayers in Tamil, they are keen to avail the option. Even sankalpam rituals will be offered in Tamil,” S Gnanasekaran, assistant commissioner, Vekkaliamman temple, said. At Srirangam and Samayapuram temples, the managements have placed information boards with the contact number of the priests who can perform the prayers in Tamil. Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple management has distributed books in Tamil to the priests to encourage the usage of Tamil in offering prayers. Officials said, in the past the priests had performed prayers in Tamil, which will be revived after the state government nod to implement the proposal in full swing. “Offering archanai in temples is yet to be resumed due to Covid-19 restrictions. We are anticipating a government order in this regard,” an official added. The temple management was instructed by the HR&CE to install information boards at entrances and exits in a common pattern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/hrce-puts-up-info-boards-about-offering-archanai-in-tamil/articleshow/85163133.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: RTR underpass to miss 6th deadline||NEW DELHI: While the much-delayed RTR flyover was inaugurated in July 2019, the second part of the project, in which an underpass is being developed from Benito Juarez Marg to San Martin Marg passing through Outer Ring Road near South Campus, is yet to be constructed. So far, the underpass has missed five deadlines and considering the pace of work, the sixth deadline of August 31 seems an uphill task. A PWD official said the approach roads had been completed and digging work was being carried out on Outer Ring Road. Concrete boxes would be installed in the underground portion. “A stretch measuring 11 metres lies directly under Ring Road. Of this, the box wall will be one-metre thick and the height and width of the structure will be 5.5m and 8.9m, respectively. We have created a traffic diversion right after the Delhi Metro station by making a temporary road over the boxes that have already been installed. Work on the project was delayed due to the lockdown during the second Covid-19 wave. We are working round the clock to finish the project,” added the official. A skywalk to take pedestrians to Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus Metro Station had also been planned, but it would have taken more time as some components that were supposed to be imported were not procured due to the pandemic. “We will have to make some design changes,” the official said. The underpass from Benito Juarez Marg to San Martin Marg, which was conceived in 2013, would cater to traffic coming from IGI Airport and take vehicular load off Outer Ring Road. Construction, which began in November 2015, remained stuck for over 2.5 years due to a delay in shifting several high-tension wires that power a railways traction substation. The initial cost was estimated at Rs 102.4 crore, but delay, shifting of utilities and cutting trees increased it. “Most of the cost escalation is due to complicated shifting of utilities that belong to agencies like DJB, BSES, MTNL, etc. We will not be allowing any more cost escalation after this,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rtr-underpass-to-miss-6th-deadline/articleshow/85163126.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 8 held for cheating doctor of Rs 2 crore||MUMBAI: The city police have arrested eight persons who allegedly cheated a doctor of Rs two crore. The complainant, who had sold his land, had invested money at a business office in Zaveri Bazar near Crawford market. When the office owners did not respond to his calls for getting his money back, he visited and found the office was shut. His suspicion aroused and he lodged an FIR for cheating and criminal breach of trust. The LT Marg police, which registered the case, arrested eight accused from various cities. “The complainant had sold some land in Solapur and got Rs two crore. He wanted to invest this money in business so he told one of his acquaintances, Milind Ghadge, who is also from Solapur. Ghadge introduced the victim to Vijay Makwani who in turn introduced him to one Ram Kumar, a Jaipur resident,” said a police officer. The gang had more people and names of others came to light only after police arrested them. The accused persons had taken a commercial shop on rent. The complainant was taken to this shop where he handed over Rs two crore. The accused promised to transfer the money through RTGS soon after using the money and also promised to give him profit. However, after the doctor did not get his money, he got anxious and started making calls to the accused. However, he did not get a response. He then visited the shop and was shocked to find that it was shut and the company board was also removed from there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-8-held-for-cheating-doctor-of-rs-rs-2-crore/articleshow/85164999.cms||---

While the huge delay had posed numerous financial difficulties before the affected workforce, the teaching community concerned has demanded the release of salaries on the first day of every month as per order from the state government. Meanwhile, the ZP administration has issued an internal communication asking departments concerned to plug gaps in the system that cause delays in crediting the salaries of teachers. “We have asked the department concerned to ensure availability of funds towards the release of salary at least a month in advance. Also, the departments have been asked to depute special manpower for completing necessary formalities well in time,” chief accounts and finance officer of Aurangabad ZP Appasaheb Chate said on Sunday. The ZP administration has also warned of disciplinary action in case its latest order is not followed. Meanwhile, the Association of ZP School Teachers has demanded that its members should not face excess delays in getting salaries in the future. “It is ironic that we have to often fight for getting the timely release of salary. Such delay is demoralizing and should be avoided at any cost in the future,” association spokesperson Rajesh Hiwale has said. TOI on August 2 carried a report highlighting the non-release of salaries of teachers for June which posed difficulties before many teachers in fulfilling their financial liabilities, including payment of EMIs towards different loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/zp-teachers-get-june-salary-finally/articleshow/85157042.cms||---
---||Delhi||NEP will allow students to build careers based on interest, talent, says Pradhan||Greater Noida: The Modi government’s initiatives under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 will empower students to chart academic paths that revolve around their interests and talents, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who holds the education and skill development and entrepreneurship portfolios, said at Bennett University’s third annual convocation on Sunday.Lauding Bennett University for sensitising the higher education fraternity about NEP through webinars and seminars, Pradhan said, “I’m happy to note that Bennett University is embracing the multidisciplinary nature of learning as envisioned in NEP 2020. I laud the committee formed by the university to implement the policy in letter and spirit.”Pradhan, the chief guest at the convocation, which was held virtually, emphasised that the Centre’s NEP initiatives like academic credit banks, allowing multiple entry-exits and the National Education Technology Forum, along with the Prime Minister’s interventions, would help create an ecosystem where students felt more empowered.The minister congratulated the new graduates, observing that the university was funding 55 out of its 98 registered PhD students, who were being mentored by faculty with a strong record of publications in reputable national and international journals. “The faculty and students have filed 18 patents. With strong commitment and dedication like yours, these numbers are bound to soar in future,” Pradhan said.In his address inaugurating the convocation, Bennett, Coleman & Co Ltd managing director and Bennett University chancellor Vineet Jain said India’s future as a superpower depends heavily on education and employability. “The honorable Prime Minister’s decision to entrust Shri Pradhan with the two portfolios he now holds is a recognition of the close inter-linkages between the two,” said Jain.“Our mission at Bennett University has been to create a class of young men and women who are future-ready. We have every hope that the honorable minister will encourage and incentivise private educational institutions – which have made serious investments in faculty, infrastructure and students – to be a partner in nation-building,” Jain added. The university’s ability, said the chancellor, to seamlessly move to a technology-enabled teaching and learning platform and ensure student success in internships, placements and higher studies – even amid lockdowns and other restrictions necessitated by the pandemic – is a testament to its capability to stand alongside the best and contribute to youth empowerment. “Private institutions in India will continue to play a vital role and I am proud to say that Bennett University will strive to lead from the front. Bennett University will leverage technology and its various resources to reach a larger section of society with the aim of inclusiveness and access to high-quality education and support the core values espoused in NEP 2020,” added Jain.Five recipients of the chancellor’s medal were felicitated. BBA student Hardik Aggarwal won the gold medal and Sejal Bhatnagar (BBA), Siddhant Iyer (BTech), Aditya Mishra (BA, J&MC) and Tunap Paul (BTech) won silver medals. Nine toppers in the batch of 2021 were awarded the vice-chancellor’s gold medals.Across its four distinct schools – Engineering and Applied Sciences, Law, Times School of Media and Management and Liberal Arts – Bennett University has over 20 degree programmes, 150-plus faculty members and 3,000 students. Four hundred students are graduating this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nep-will-allow-students-to-build-careers-based-on-interest-talent-says-pradhan/articleshow/85163184.cms||---

But the postmortem report revealed that the girl had been subjected to sexual abuse many times. The abuse used to take place while the parents of the child were away at work. Police said Arjun used to lure the child with chocolates. Even the day he murdered her, he had bought chocolates for her from a nearby shop, said the police. Vandiperiyar SHO said that the accused had confessed that he had been sexually abusing the girl since she was three years old.

During the discussion, Gadkari agreed for having a single flyover across Jalna Road on the lines of other metro cities and asked for a feasibility study for interlinking existing flyovers,” Jaleel told media on Sunday. He said the minister has asked the NHAI to accomplish the feasibility study within the next one month. “The interlinking of flyovers would also witness widening of width of lanes. The local civic body and the state government would have to play a crucial role in the proposed project which could address traffic woes on Jalna Road,” the MP said. Earlier, Jaleel had launched a social media campaign against the proposed flyover in front of airport. “Simply because we, as citizens, do not raise our voice, we get what we don’t want!... Since people who matter i.e. you all do not express your views strongly, NHAI is just going ahead with what they have decided and not what the city’s pressing requirements are,” he had said, appealing to the citizens to express their views through letter or tweet to Gadkari. Meanwhile, referring to his discussion with Gadkari, Jaleel said the proposed flyover between Aurangabad and Pune would be in three phases. “The first phase of the work will involve such flyover from Pune to Ahmednagar, followed by covering remaining section upto Waluj near Aurangabad,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/feasibility-study-for-interlinking-flyovers-in-aurangabad-mp/articleshow/85157044.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Houseful shows during weekend, cinemas hope for normal business soon||KOLKATA: Saturday registered the first houseful show in the city after the government allowed the halls to reopen with 50% occupancy from July 31. Encouraging patrons and exhibitors, INOX Quest saw the 2.45pm shows of ‘The Suicide Squad’ at the Insignia screen being sold out on Saturday and Sunday. So was the Sunday evening show. Despite the seat availability and the price of tickets varying in different theatres, all exhibitors have noticed an increase in sales since cinemas reopened. Amitava Guha Thakurta, regional director at INOX (East), told TOI that this response will help in the company’s faster return to normalcy, considering Bengal’s significance in its national business landscape. Even the food and beverage sales have been impressive. Last time when the cinemas had reopened, there was almost no new content available initially. The scenario is different this time with a new Hollywood movie having released on August 5. A mixed lineup of new English, Hindi and Bengali releases is available too. “Thanks to the fascinating content flow that was available from the day we resumed operations, the bond of trust that we enjoy with our patrons and lastly, our immaculate preparations have resulted in the warm response that we have received across our cinemas in Kolkata,” he said. The sale of tickets over the weekend was equally impressive at Star Theatre. Joydeep Mukherjee, who has the lease for the cinema, said the sale of tickets has been “increasing daily”. “Now I feel my risk has paid off. Unless exhibitors take the risk and builds confidence among viewers, producers won’t come forward,” Mukherjee said. On Saturday, 29 tickets were sold at Star for Salman Khan’s ‘Radhe’. On Sunday, the figures for ‘Radhe’ dropped to 22. The highest number of tickets for the shows of ‘The Suicide Squad’ on Saturday was 19. That increased to 43 on Sunday. Keeping the 50% cap in mind, Star Theatre can sell 250 tickets per show. Naysayers might suggest that in terms of percentage, the ratio of tickets sold in comparison to the seats available is not huge. “But we sometimes haven’t sold 43 tickets even during normal circumstances. Some fear that reopening cinemas might be risky when it comes to spreading the virus. But the fact is that sanitized cinemas are safer than the overcrowded markets. Patrons who have once watched movies at a sanitized theatre are spreading this message to others. That’s why our numbers are increasing,” said Mukherjee. Meanwhile, state-owned Nandan also saw a rise in sales over the weekend, despite both films being earlier Bengali reruns. Currently, Nandan 1 can sell 463 tickets. Koel Mallick’s ‘Flyover’ at 5pm is registering better sales than Soham Chakraborty and Sohini Sarkar’s ‘Ei Ami Renu’ at 2.30pm. On Sunday afternoon, more than 70 tickets for ‘Ei Ami Renu’ were sold. The evening show of ‘Flyover’ had a better response. Over 150 viewers, especially youngsters, watched the film.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/houseful-shows-during-weekend-cinemas-hope-for-normal-biz-soon/articleshow/85160828.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

A Srinivasa Rao (45), an accountant from Srinagar Colony, and his friend N Vijay Krishna (37) from Nallakunta, were arrested after a complaint on August 5 by a woman who lost Rs 2.5 lakh. The accused confessed they had opened bank accounts in the name of fictitious firms as per instructions from the Chinese scamsters. The woman had clicked on a WhatsApp link for a work-from-home investment scheme and was directed to register on a website mall008.com via Telegram. “The victim initially deposited small amounts to the scamsters’ bank account through a QR code. The amount doubled in a few days and till the investment was small the victim was allowed to withdraw. But when she invested Rs 2.5 lakh, she lost access,” Cyber crime ACP KVM Prasad said. Rao and Krishna were picked up after cops tracked their transactions.  “The accused were working for a commission. We do not know the location of the main accused. We have seized two mobiles, five cheque books, four debit cards and Rs 21,500. Banks have been told to freeze Rs 19 lakh in the two accounts,” a cop said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-men-held-for-running-chinese-investment-fraud/articleshow/85165009.cms||---
---||Delhi||No regular posts of spl educators at KV schools: RTI||New Delhi: There are no regular posts of special educators to teach children with disabilities in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan institutions. This has been revealed by a RTI reply. Instead, the teachers have been hired on contract. In 2015, CBSE had passed an order saying it was mandatory to appoint special educators in all schools affiliated with it. All KVs are affiliated with the board.The RTI was filed by lawyer Utkarsh Kumar seeking details about the sanctioned strength of special educators in KVs. The reply stated, “In KVs, there are no regular posts of special educators. KV had given instructions in 2016 regarding the mandatory appointment of special educators on contractual basis.”Ashok Agarwal, who’d earlier filed a case in Delhi High Court regarding the appointment of special educators in schools of local bodies and Delhi government, said he was planning to file a petition in the matter.“In 2009, the high court had directed Delhi government and the local bodies to have at least two special educators in each of their schools. Later, a similar direction was issued by the court to private schools. KVs should also be directed to create regular posts of special educators ensuring at least two such teachers are present in each of their schools. Not having regular posts discourages children with disabilities from coming to regular schools,” said Agarwal.The CBSE order of 2016 stated, “A special educator is specifically required in schools to work with children and young adults who require additional support to complete their learning successfully. These teachers may work with children with physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities such as autism, mental retardation, cerebral palsy and specific learning disabilities as they are emotionally vulnerable and have behavioural difficulties.”However, a spokesperson of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan said, “We do not have sanctioned posts, but that doesn’t mean there are no special educators. Such teachers are working on contractual basis and a process has been initiated towards their regularisation.”In 2020, there were 4,091 students with disabilities studying in KV schools. On March 31, 2021, there were 5,017 differently-abled students in 1,239 KV institutions across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-regular-posts-of-spl-educators-at-kv-schools-rti/articleshow/85163302.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||‘World entering era of biology & computational science’||Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, executive chairperson of Biocon, said that while the first two decades of this century belonged to information technology, the world is now entering an era of biology and computational science. “Through research-led innovation, I believe we can power economic development by transforming healthcare, agriculture, livestock management, industrial processing, and environmental sustainability,” she said at Bennett University’s annual convocation, where she was conferred an honorary doctor of philosophy degree in biotechnology.Conferring the degree on Mazumdar-Shaw, Bennett University vice-chancellor, Dr Prabhu Aggarwal, said the name Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and biotechnology are synonymous in India. Mazumdar-Shaw, he noted “has leveraged advanced science, innovative tech platforms and international research collaborations to develop therapies that can lower treatment costs, increase access and improve healthcare outcomes for diseases like diabetes and cancer”.Suresh Narayanan, chairman & MD at Nestle India, was also conferred an honorary doctor of philosophy in management. Aggarwal said Narayanan’s rise up the ranks in the corporate world “reflects his extensively rich and incredibly wide-ranging experience of over 35 years in the FMCG Industry, spanning multiple countries and cultures". Narayanan dedicated the degree to his parents, wife and daughter. “I happened to join this call from my parents’ home in Chennai and while both of them are not around to see me receive this honour, I know for them there was a very high value for education. My father with his middle-class income afforded the best education that he could at that point in time to make me worthy of being a good citizen of India,” he said. Nasscom president Debjani Ghosh, who was a special guest at the convocation, told graduating students to get comfortable with the uncomfortable. “Uncertainty, volatility, ambiguity – this is the only certainty that you will have. The skills that you need will constantly change. Your ability to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty is going to become your biggest competitive advantage and therefore one of the skills I have learnt is to step out of my comfort zone and become comfortable with the uncomfortable,” she said.Ghosh added that India’s tech industry has become more agile for not just resilience, but resilience with empathy. That, she said, has been key to the kind of success the industry is seeing even in the Covid crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/world-entering-era-of-biology-computational-science/articleshow/85163256.cms||---

---||Goa||Batim locals protest further devpt at largely destroyed historic site||Panaji: Water resources department’s (WRD) Rs 3.8-crore beautification project at Batim lake — the historic 17th century site where Goa’s first indigenous order was established — is kicking up more dust among villagers. Determined to halt further degradation of this historical site, locals have filed a complaint at the Agasaim police station for belated action against the quarrying activities that destroyed the Batim hill here. The nearly three-decade-long quarrying activities on the hill had led to a landslide some years ago in whichsome markers of history —an altar and Holy Cross — dating to the 17th century were lost. The cross was recovered eventually and erected in the quarry below. In the belated complaint filed by Confraria Reunidas da Igreja de Batim, a body of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, Batim, Confraria president Francisco Xavier Jacques, stated, “The historic landmark at Batim hill, marking the site where India’s first indigenous congregation of Catholic priests and perhaps Asia’s first, too, was set up, has been destroyed.” The altar and Holy Cross were part of the priests’ monastery — chapel of St John of Desert — in which Fr Pascoal D’Costa Jeremias of Margao along with four other priests set up, with the archbishop’s permission, the first Goan congregation, Holy Cross of Miracle, in October 1682. What makes it even more significant is that, during this era in Portuguese Goa, natives were banned from joining religious orders. The monastery, barring the altar and cross, had collapsed soon after in 1683 due to its dilapidated conditionIn recent months, more parts of the hill caved in, opening a wider red gash in the green hill above the lake. Now, locals are worried that the lake beautification project, which comprises multiple infrastructure works at Zauro Udo, Batim, like desilting and de-weeding of the lake and stabilising of the fragile hillside on its northern border, may lead to concretisation of the green surroundings. Batim, in fact, has a multi-layered past and is home to several landmarks of bothreligious and historical stuctures. A copper plate found with a Keni family indicates that Batim lake — now a popular birding site —was built by a certain Gandogopala Keni of Panjar Khani during the Kadamba era. A section of villagers are unhappy about the project. “I agree this is our first complaint in the matter. But we don’t want any more activities, including beautificationat the site,” Jacques said. The mines department had permitted quarrying in past years, but Jacques said that as a chairman of the Batim Tenants’ Association, he had stopped it for some time. As of date, the hill has lost a major part of its southern face and historicity. “It has been eaten up by road embankments of NH66, its recent expansion and other works,” another villager said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/batim-locals-protest-further-devpt-at-largely-destroyed-historic-site/articleshow/85163292.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Delhi||DDMA nod to weekly markets on roadsides||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday allowed the opening of all authorised weekly markets with strict compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour and other guidelines. “All authorised weekly markets shall be allowed, subject to strict compliance of SOPs and instructions/guidelines issued by the central and Delhi governments from time to time to contain the spread of Covid 19. No unauthorised weekly market shall be allowed to function. In case any field office of DDMA finds that Covid-appropriate behaviour or prescribed SOPs are not being followed, the weekly market shall be closed by the district magistrate or deputy commissioner of the municipal body concerned,” stated the order. The order was issued a day after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that weekly markets would be allowed to operate with strict compliance to norms. The decision was welcomed by the weekly market associations, who were worried about not getting permission for operating markets on the roadsides. Rajesh Gupta of north Delhi weekly market association said, “We are really happy as the latest order doesn’t object to the operation of markets on roadsides. In the previous DDMA order, only one market in each zone per day was allowed with the rider that no market on roadsides would be permissible. As a result, the civic bodies were barely given permission to any market to operate. They had argued that there was barely any open space to accommodate so many vendors.” Ashwani Bagri, convener of Delhi Weekly Bazaar United Front and president of Hawkers Joint Action Committee, north Delhi unit, said that vendors would extend all cooperation and follow all Covid guidelines, including maintaining distance of two yards and wearing a mask. “The customers at these markets are usually locals or those passing through the area. No one finds a ground or park where weekly markets can be held. We are happy with the decision. But categorising markets as authorised (those issued slips by civic bodies) and unauthorised is surprising considering that Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 provides protection to all,” added Bagri. A north corporation official said they had received the order and would take one more day to prepare a plan and get formal approval before allowing these markets. “We will be able to allow opening of weekly markets from Tuesday,” added the official. According to the order, arrangements for RT-PCR/RAT test of vendors and customers would be conducted randomly by the district magistrate. “In case of a positive test report, action should be taken as per the protocol prescribed by the health department of Delhi government,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddma-nod-to-weekly-markets-on-roadsides/articleshow/85163342.cms||Vibha Sharma

She later tried to end her life. The woman used to have regular fights with her husband over financial issues. The incident was reported from Ghosipura village under Katghar police station. Their family informed police that after hearing a loud noise from her room, they rushed inside and found the younger son lying in a pool of blood. Moradabad police said one of the children succumbed on the spot while the woman and her elder son Daksh (6) were rushed to a private medical facility in Pakhwara area of Moradabad. The deceased boy has been identified as Adarsh (4). According to the family, the woman’s husband Devendra, who works as a contractor at a firm, was getting his salary late which resulted in frequent fights between the two. Preeti even wanted him to change his job. On Friday night, too, he had left for work after a brief fight. And, on Saturday, the woman tried to take the extreme step. Adarsh's grandmother Munni Devi told police that their daughter-in-law had attacked her children with a sharp object while they were asleep. Moradabad SP Amit Anand said, "The woman, according to the family, was having some dispute with her husband. She was disturbed and took the extreme step.

We are planning to install solar panels of 20-kilowatt capacity in the remaining buildings with bigger roofs and have signed a memorandum of understanding with NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Limited,” said an SDMC official. The solar projects were specified in the budget for financial year 2021-22, he added. Exporting the surplus solar power to BSES has also helped the SDMC to earn profits. “In the financial year 2020-21, 73 lakh units of electricity generated from plants at 209 schools helped to earn Rs 7.1 crore from the discom BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL),” said the official.However, the progress on two projects at 105-acre land in Gumanhera and 9.45-acre land in Ferozepur, Faridabad has been slowed down due to no viability in the evacuation process. Power evacuation is a process that allows the generated power to be immediately transmitted from a plant to the grid for further transmission or distribution to load centres.“While talks are going on with BSES Rajdhani Power for Gumanhera, the Ferozpur project is not working out,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-plans-solar-panels-at-schools-by-mar/articleshow/85163321.cms||Vibha Sharma

This was decided at the central committee meeting of the party. However, the central committee has decided that the party meetings will be rescheduled if the third wave of the pandemic hits hard in the country. It has been decided to begin all the state conferences from October this year. “The district conference will begin in September and the state conferences will begin in October. It has been decided to organize the party congress by April next year,” said CPM politburo member Prakash Karat, in New Delhi after the central committee meeting on Sunday. The last party congress that was held in the state was in 2012 in Kozhikode. The state committee had put forward a proposal before the central committee for convening the party congress either in Kannur or Kollam this year. It was in the backdrop of the party’s spectacular win for a successive government in the state that the central committee decided to have the party congress in Kerala itself. The central committee also reviewed the state assembly election results of West Bengal and Kerala. The party had received a severe drubbing in West Bengal. The committee also discussed the preparations the party has to make for the impending assembly elections in Tripura in 2023. It is learnt that in the central committee meeting, the party leadership of West Bengal came under severe attack for the wrong policies they had taken in the last assembly election. The committee is learnt to have observed that the tie up with the Congress was not well received by the people and hence it was one of the reasons for the party’s dismal performance. The leaders opined that the party conferences should evolve concrete measures to rejuvenate the party cadres in West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-party-congress-to-be-held-in-kannur/articleshow/85160862.cms||---

Of the 3.87 lakh applications received by the department, 52,388 have been approved and 53,869 are still pending for clearance (as on August 6). Of the total applications, 2.18 lakh applications have been sent back to the applicants/e-Mitra kiosks seeking more documents. The state had stopped registering new names as it had almost reached the upper limit of 4.46 crore beneficiaries set by the Centre. Among the districts, 11,959 applications have been rejected in Nagaur, which is the highest, followed by Bhilwara with 6081 rejections and Bharatpur with 4989 rejections. While Jhunjhunu has the highest number of pending applications, at 6979, Banswara has the lowest number of pending applications, at 36. Meanwhile, in all, 12 districts have performed poorly in terms of de-linking of Aadhaar number seeded with multiple ration cards of NFSA beneficiaries in the state. Their performance percentage is less than 20 per cent in terms of delinking one Aadhaar number with multiple ration cards, data received from the food and civil services department said.

When he stepped out of the car, there was nobody around. The players were scheduled to arrive for their first day of training 90 minutes later, but the Spanish coach couldn’t wait. He stepped inside the ground and started jogging, alone. Ferrando is clearly eager to get going this year after Covid-19 pandemic meant there was little time to prepare the team last season. Goa did make it to the playoffs, set a 15-match unbeaten record too, but lost to eventual champions Mumbai City FC on penalties in the semi-finals. “Juan wanted to start pre-season with the Indian players. He wants to spend more time with the domestic players and set a few things right,” said Ravi Puskur, the club’s director of football. Goa kickstarted their preparations for the season with 23 players on Monday. The big guns were all there. Brandon Fernandes, Seriton Fernandes, Glan Martins, Saviour Gama and Amarjit Singh all looked in good touch. They were energetic and looked like enjoying the return to the field. Brandon was the sharpest. Then there were the newcomers, among whom Muhammed Nemil grabbed the most attention. This is his first session with the senior team, and having trained and played in Spain for the last two years, he knew what to expect. New signing Kunal Kundaikar clearly stood out due to his height, while Manushawn Fernandes, also a centre-back, took time to convince himself that this was a different world from Youth Club of Manora who he represented last season in the Goa Professionnal League. Goalkeeper Ritwik Das and Christy Davis from the developmental squad have also been handed a chance to catch Ferrando’s eye. Midfielders Princeton Rebello and Flan Gomes trained separately, watched eagerly by the physiotherapists. They are on the road to recovery and need to be properly assessed before being allowed to join the rest of the team. Dheeraj Singh, Alexander Romario and Ishan Pandita have all been granted extra days at home due to personal reasons. “Our foreign players will join us later this month or early next month,” said Puskur. Among the foreign players, captain Edu Bedia, Ivan Gonzalez, Alberto Noguera and Jorge Ortiz all have existing contracts, while the club continues its search for a foreign striker and Asian defender. “Maybe we will have news this week,” said Puskur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-hit-the-ground-running/articleshow/85191004.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kochi||Ex-PWD min’s poem rakes up controversy||Kochi: A poem written by CPM state committee member and former minister G Sudhakaran has stormed up a controversy. It is being interpreted as his reaction to the issues related to the last assembly polls. In the poem, the poet says that he completed his duties, which is a thankless job. The poet says that “manuja parvam kazhinju” (life as a human being is over) and also that he “leaves behind the merits and demerits of that life”. There are allegations that Sudhakaran tried to see that H Salam, the party candidate who contested from Ambalappuzha constituency, doesn't emerge as the winner in the assembly elections. Although Ambalappuzha is the constituency from where Sudhakaran won multiple times, he did nothing to ensure the success of Salam, some of the party leaders from Alappuzha had alleged. The party's state committee and state secretariat had discussed the issue. The state secretariat appointed a two-member commission to look into the matter. It is at a time when the probe is on that the poetry has caught controversy. But, Sudhakaran said that the poem has nothing to do with the party, and the media are giving unnecessary colour to it. “The poem has nothing to do with the party. It is all about human life and history. But, a section of the media has given an interpretation with an ulterior motive,” Sudhakaran said. “Even if we agree, for the sake of argument, that the poem is about the party, why don’t they see the poem in its totality? In the poem, I welcome the newcomers. Why don’t they highlight it?” he asked. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ex-pwd-mins-poem-rakes-up-controversy/articleshow/85160947.cms||---

His body was found in a three-layered sack just 5 km from the house of the accused. Six people have been booked for the murder. Preliminary investigations revealed that Sunil Kumar Sharma was beaten to death with an iron rod as severe head injuries were found on the rear side of his head. Sharma, a resident of Trans Yamuna Colony, had gone to office on August 2 and went missing. CCTV footage of the area revealed that he had gone to meet one Ajay and his wife, Mona, in Gandhinagar, who earlier lived in his neighbourhood. Muniraj G , Agra SSP, said Sharma wanted to buy a plot with the help of Ajay. On August 2, Ajay called Sharma for the final deal of the plot. He was expecting that Sharma would come with a large sum of money. However, the accused found only Rs 6,000 in Sharma’s pocket after killing him, he added. An FIR was registered against six people, including Ajay and Mona. While Mona has been arrested, Ajay is at large. During interrogation, Mona told the police about the sack which they had used to dispose of the body in Transport Nagar, after committing the murder. “The body has been sent for post-mortem and the further investigations are on,” said sub inspector Anil Kumar Singh of Etmaddula police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/one-wk-on-missing-sales-officers-body-found-in-agra-6-booked-for-murder/articleshow/85159280.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Delta variant still predominant in Maharashtra, Delta-plus cases rise to 45||MUMBAI: Delta, the highly contagious coronavirus variant driving the pandemic globally, continues to be predominant in Maharashtra and has been detected in over 80% of genome sequenced samples till recently. Its mutated form Delta-plus has been found in just 45 samples (0.5%) of the 8,000-odd sequenced, indicating that it is not as transmissible as initially feared. The state’s public health department on Sunday issued a release stating that Delta-plus cases have increased to just 45 from the initial 21 detected in June. Jalgaon has the most cases (13), followed by Ratnagiri (11), Mumbai (6), Thane (5) and Pune (3). One case each has been found in Palghar, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Nandurbar, Aurangabad, Kolhapur and Beed. About 10 of these cases are recent infections, although most have mild to moderate symptoms. Delta-plus or ‘AY.1’ variant carries all mutations present in Delta plus an additional one ‘K417N’. Mumbai’s count of Delta-pl-us cases has increased to six from two in June. On Saturday, BMC was informed of the case of a 21-year-old nursing student from the western suburbs. “We are gathering details about the case. It appears the person had tested Covid-19 positive a month ago,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. While the state said Mumbai has six Delta-plus cases, BMC officials said they had information only for four. “None of these cases are recent. They have all recovered,” she added. State officials said although the majority of the cases are at least two weeks old, a full contact tracing and surveillance exercise would be carried out in districts. Local authorities have gathered information on about 35 of the 45 patients. “Our analysis shows that all patients had mild to moderate symptoms. There has been only one death. Importantly, in districts where Delta-plus cases have been fou-nd, there is no increase in transmission,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state’s surveillance officer. “Delta is still the dominant variant. In districts, up to 87% of samples have been found positive for Delta,” Dr Awate added. The one reported death from Delta-plus cohort was of an 80-year-old woman who had several comorbidities. The state also carried out an age-wise analysis and found that 20 of the 45 cases were in the 19-45 age group, also the most mobile. Fourteeen cases were in the 46-60 age group, five among senior citizens and six children up to 18 years of age. The state carries out genome sequencing through two methods—one is through 10 sentinel surveillance sites: five hospitals and five labs. Fifteen samples from these sites are sent to Pune’s NIV every fortnight. The state has also signed an MoU with Delhi’s Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology to sequence 3,500 samples every month; 100 from each district. Since May, Dr Awate said nearly 8,000 samples have been sequenced. “Cases of breakthrough infections or reinfections are also sent,” he said. Mumbai recently got its own genome sequencing lab in Kasturba Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/delta-variant-still-predominant-in-maharashtra-state-delta-plus-cases-rise-to-45/articleshow/85165036.cms||Sumitra Debroy

While Banswara, Pratapgarh and Jaipur secured ‘B’ grade with over 55% marks, Dholpur and Churu secured ‘C’ grade with just over 50% marks. Only Nagaur and Kota districts secured above 80% marks in their performance with A+ grade. Among all districts in the state, 21 of them secured A+ grade with above 65% marks (outstanding), six districts secured A grade with above 60% marks (very good), four districts secured ‘B’ grade with over 55% marks (good) and two districts secured ‘C’ grade with above 50% marks (satisfactory). However, no district has scored less than 50 per cent (D). The state social justice department had issued an order to start monthly ratings of various wings and directorates under the department based on their public service delivery and work performance by initiating a grading and ranking system. The district and block level offices were to be ranked and graded based on their performances under schemes like Palanhar, Mukhyamantri Corona Sahayata Yojana, social security pension scheme, post-matric scholarship, Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana, Inter Caste Marriage Scheme, Atrocity Prevention Scheme, hostel admission scheme, RREIS admission scheme and grievance disposal of complaints received on Sampark portal. Meanwhile, the data also showed that the overall marks obtained by the schemes was 74.01 per cent. It also showed that there was zero progress in terms of clearing applications/cases in disbursement of pension through money order (1558 cases), making correction/changing of bank account numbers of pensioners (4259 cases) and clearing applications/cases (13200) of beneficiaries through ex-gratia under social security scheme. Moreover, under the inter-caste marriage scheme, there was just 44.44 per cent progress. The order issued by social justice and empowerment department secretary Samit Sharma had also stated that the annual performance appraisal report of the officials will be evaluated based on the performances of these districts/blocks/directorates/wings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/social-justice-schemes-six-dists-log-below-60-marks/articleshow/85160873.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: PK Kunhalikutty’s hold over IUML slackens||KOZHIKODE: The decision of IUML’s high power committee against taking a stern disciplinary action against Panakkad Moyeen Ali Thangal, who had raised serious allegations against party national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty signals that a major churn is underway inside the party. The decision also shows that the absolute grip that the national general secretary has enjoyed in the party affairs for a long time is waning. Though Kunhalikutty insisted on taking action against Moyeen Ali Thangal, Muslim Youth League (MYL) national vice-president and son of IUML state president Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal, it didn’t find favour with a majority of the top leaders, including the members of Panakkad Thangal family, marking a rare occasion in recent times when the party didn’t toe his line. Kunhalikutty had always derived his power within the party capitalizing on his proximity to the Thangal family and being their confidante. But with the current row pitting him against a member of the Thangal family, Kunhalikutty didn’t get much support and was left with scarce legroom for his manoeuvrings. Also the fact that three members of the Thangal family had come to the meeting was, in itself, an attempt at affirming their stake in the party. It was pointed out by other party leaders at the meeting that action against a Thangal family member would negatively impact the standing of the family in the community and that would, in the long term, prove detrimental for the party itself, given the family’s religious leadership roles in the community. The controversy is likely to embolden the voices of criticism in the party against Kunhalikutty’s dominance in party affairs which had emerged during the recent party office-bearers meeting held in Kozhikode. Also, these recent developments are expected to make the ongoing election review exercise of the party more transparent and incisive given the fact that leaders like KM Shaji are in the 10-member committee formed by the party to review the party’s below-par performance in the recently-concluded assembly elections. Writer and social activist MN Karassery said that the row triggered by Moyeen Ali Thangal will bring in a greater-level of democracy within the party and could lead to a cleansing process in the party. “The notion of an unquestionable leader was not prevalent in IUML before Kunhalikutty’s rise to power. Party cadres and leaders had the freedom to question even stalwarts like CH Mohammed Koya and they had responded to it in a democratic manner. But for many years Kunhalikutty has had absolute control over the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kunhalikuttys-hold-over-iuml-slackens/articleshow/85159290.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal second best on fully vaccinated list||KOLKATA: Bengal has been able to completely vaccinate over 90 lakh people, which is the second highest in the country after Maharashtra. Among the fully vaccinated in Bengal, over 13 lakh are in Kolkata. Despite the slowdown in the second dose vaccination in August, Bengal has been able to completely vaccinate more people than other large states as it pushed to clear the second-dose backlog in May and July. The slowdown has been largely evident since July 19, when those who were being given the first dose outnumbered the second-dose recipients. Till July 19, Bengal had been administering more second doses than first doses. These numbers peaked on July 17 when 2.2 lakh people were given the second dose while 1.6 lakh people received their first doses. This also coincided with KMC clinics and mega centres prioritising second-dose vaccinations. From July 11-17, on three days, more than 2 lakh people were vaccinated with the second dose. This pattern of more second doses than first was first noticed in Bengal in Apriland continued till mid-May when the second wave peaked. From May 15, the first doses were administered in a larger scale, which continued in June. In the first three weeks of July, the state again prioritised second doses to clear the backlog and the trend reversed. However, vaccination data on the Co-Win dashboard shows a complete reversal of the trend since July 19. Last week, the state had thrice vaccinated more than 4 lakh people. August 2 was the highest with 4.4 lakh — 3.5 lakh got the first dose, and 83,139 received their second. This pattern was repeated on August 3 and August 5. The trend since August — where more first doses are administered than second — reflects a nationwide trend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-2nd-best-on-fully-vaxed-list/articleshow/85160886.cms||---

Anita allegedly attempted suicide at Khuiyala village near Ramgarh in Jaisalmer district. Her parents lodged a dowry murder case against her in-laws, while the husband of the deceased Hasmaram lodged a case of abetment to suicide against Anita’s parents. Notably, the couple had a love marriage five years ago and the woman’s parents had cut off all the links with her as they did not approve of the wedding. Ramgarh SHO Jetharam Choudhary said that Dabla resident Manoj Kumar filed a report stating that in 2016 his sister Anita got married to Hasamram, a resident of Khuiyala. On July 9, 2021 Anita tried to commit suicide at her residence. Her in-laws took her to Jawahar hospital from where she was referred to Jodhpur. She was undergoing treatment at MDM hospital and she died on Saturday. Kumar filed a dowry murder case against her in laws.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Medicine shops full of home-test kit stock as demand dips with slide in cases||KOLKATA: With Covid cases sliding since July, sale of self-use test kits that were approved by ICMR in June — when the second wave was at its peak — has tumbled in the city. Pharmacy owners, who had earlier expected sales to remain brisk, now believe the kits could only be back in demand if there is a fresh wave and getting a test done at a lab takes longer and involves transmission risk. In the past two months, since the first kit was launched, stocks across pharmacies have remained unsold and enquiries have been rare. It was different in April-May, when it had been taking up to three days to get a test done, creating a demand for self-test kits, said Sajal Ganguly, secretary of Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association (BCDA). “There were reports of such test kits being developed and people visited pharmacies on a regular basis to ask about them,” he said. By the time the first batch of these kits hit the Kolkata market in June, Covid numbers had started sliding. “We expected them to arrive earlier. But, by the time they arrived, numbers in Kolkata had started climbing down,” Ganguly said. “The off-take is very slow now, although a few companies have launched the kit. This is definitely not what we expected when the kit was launched. We do not have good sales reports from our shops although users are satisfied with the product,” said Rajendra Khandelwal, managing director of Dhanwantari Pharma Group. Somnath Ghosh of Metro Pharma said he had ordered nearly 350 test kits for his pharmacies, but sales have not picked up. “Whether it is Dum Dum, Baranagar or Garia, we don’t see more than seven-eight enquiries now. People are not showing much interest as the number of active cases is low now,” Ghosh said. After the launch, the central government reduced the GST on the kit from 12% to 5%, making it a more affordable option. The kit costs Rs 250, while an RT-PCR test costs between Rs 400 and Rs 1,500 and a rapid antigen test costs Rs 300-Rs 900 in different states. Using a self-test kit is as easy as a pregnancy test kit or checking blood sugar levels at home, said retailers. The test kits can provide results in 15 minutes and are more required in remote areas that do not have testing infrastructure or laboratories. “In May-end, the demand was low in Kolkata and it continued to remain so. But recently there has been a spike in demand in tourist spots like Digha. We are expecting offices to procure the kits as well. With a two-year shelf life, these kits can be quite useful,” said Rakesh Mehta of Exim Distributor. ICMR has advised self-test kits for those with symptoms or for high-risk contacts of positive patients. If the result is positive, the person will be considered Covid-positive and will not require RT-PCR as a confirmatory test. But if a person tests negative but has symptoms, he or she has to undergo an RT-PCR test.This test is synced with a mobile app, CoviSelf, which will directly feed the case report on the ICMR portal.  While a home test reduces the risk of transmission at a hospital or lab and swab collection is fairly simple and quick, and reduces overall testing expenditure, the reliability of results remains a major concern. The likelihood of the sample not being collected correctly, or the swab stick getting contaminated, is high. Also, rapid antigen tests come with a high chance of false negatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/med-shops-full-of-home-test-kit-stock-as-demand-dips-with-slide-in-cases/articleshow/85160934.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Delhi||Hry lifts timing curbs, lockdown till Aug 23||Gurgaon: The Haryana government on Sunday lifted time restrictions on shops, malls, restaurants, pubs, gyms and other such establishments. However, they will have to continue to operate at 50% capacity. The government also allowed swimming pools to open for all, provided Covid-appropriate behaviour is maintained. Until now, pools were open only for professional swimmers who needed to practise for any upcoming event. The government order also urged swimmers, visitors and staff to get vaccinated with both doses. Despite the relaxations, the government on Sunday extended the lockdown in the state for a fortnight till August 23. The order, however, insisted on the “no mask, no service” strategy. It said that only people with masks or face cover would be allowed to enter commercial establishments or board any public transport. Apart from testing, tracing and tracking, the government has also insisted on vaccinations and Covid-appropriate behaviour in its strategy to battle the pandemic. “It has been a gradual process of easing the lockdown restrictions as cases have come down and the positivity rate has declined. The district administration is constantly monitoring the situation and directives announced by the government from time to time are being complied with strictly,” said Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner. Garg also appealed to residents to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest and follow all Covid protocols. Although the government implemented the lockdown on May 3, it has been easing restrictions in a phase-wise manner from May 24. Until now, shops were allowed to open from 9am to 10pm, while malls were operating between 10am and 10pm. Similarly, the timings for standalone restaurants were 8am to 11pm while those for eateries in malls 10am to 11pm. Restaurant owners and traders appreciated the decision, saying it would provide a much-needed boost to business. They also urged the authorities to gradually open offices as a large section of their clientele is employees from various firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hry-lifts-timing-curbs-lockdown-till-aug-23/articleshow/85163419.cms||Akanksha Gupta

They have also asked people not to burst crackers, fly drones and sky lanterns around the airport that calls for legal provisions. A team of officials moved around the areas like Kaikhali, Dum Dum, Rajarhat and Narayanpur with loud hailers and multiple police vans to sensitize the residents about the matter. “We visited some of the densely populated areas like Bankra, Birati, Sarat Colony, Kaikhali, Bablatala near Jama Masjid, Narkelbagan, Narayanpur and Saurav Ganguly Avenue in Narayanpur. The residents were intensively sensitized about the importance of airport security and their roles,” said a CISF official. The CISF, Airport police officers and airport traffic cops were accompanied by Bankra Masjid committee members during the visit. The official said they have asked residents to inform CISF or local police if they find suspicious activities in their areas, including flying of drones. “We also asked the residents not to feed birds from their respective terraces as it increases the chance of ‘Bird Hit’ instances to the aircrafts and also not to burst crackers,” said an officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Cops also visited houses, where tenants live, to conduct a verification of unknown persons. The airport premises and the areas surrounding it are under the purview of additional safety measures from Sunday till August 20 owing to the high alert warning issued for the Independence Day security concerns. “Security measures have been tightened since the drone attack at an IAF station in Jammu five weeks ago. However, further additional safety measures have been taken in view of the next fortnight,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/i-day-security-no-drones-sky-lanterns-near-airport/articleshow/85160925.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

He advised the office-bearers to spend days and nights in constituencies to seek this information, which he said would be crucial for deciding candidates for the 2022 assembly polls. The main agenda of the party is “nationalism” (rashtravad) and “development” (vikasvad), said Nadda while addressing an organisational meeting of 68 people, including party presidents of 19 districts in the Braj region. He was accompanied by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, party’s general secretary BL Santosh, state president Swatantra Dev Singh. Talking to TOI, state secretary Vijay Shivhare said that Nadda had made it compulsory for the office-bearers in Braj region, including district in-charges and region in-charges, to spend nights in the divisions (one constituency has at least 5 divisions) every fortnight. “Out of 65 legislative assembly seats in three divisions of Agra, Aligarh and Bareilly, 57 MLAs are from BJP and we have been asked to get the feedback on their performance from the public,” said Shivhare, who is also BJP’s in-charge of Mathura district. He added that they have also been asked to make the public aware of the party’s welfare schemes at the centre and state levels through social media. “A sammelan of panna pramukhs (point persons engaging with 50 voters on every page of the electoral rolls) would be held on September 25 to coincide with the birth anniversary of party ideologue Deendayal Upadhyaya,” said Shivhare. Agra South MLA Yogendra Upadhyay told TOI that the party chief had asked all leaders to reach out to social, religious and professional bodies to develop direct communication with them as they play an important role in building image and spreading information about the government. After meeting with the party’s office-bearers, MLAs and MLCs, Nadda addressed a meeting of doctors who have been at the forefront of the war against Covid-19. In his address, Nadda praised doctors’ dedication during the first and second waves of the pandemic and urged them to continue their services with full dedication.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/nadda-asks-bjp-officer-bearers-to-make-a-detailed-report-card-on-performance-of-57-mlas-in-braj-region/articleshow/85159347.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

They had alleged that corruption, nepotism and diversion of funds were destroying the daily. In a letter dated May 30, employees under the banner of Chandrika Coordination Committee of KUWJ and KNEF had sought immediate intervention by the party leadership to save the newspaper and they had blamed finance director PMA Sameer for most issues plaguing the daily. The letter said that after Sameer took over, the accounts of the daily and its file system were handled through a parallel private office set up outside Chandrika. “Even subscriptions were enrolled and fees were collected without the knowledge of subscription department. Now, even the advertisement dues are being collected by the staff of that firm. It should be enquired if the amounts had reached Chandrika,” the letter said. The letter said that the employees were forced to write the letter to reveal the truth as attempts were made to mislead Panakkad family, party state leadership and director board members and even figures were forged in this case. According to the employees, large amounts were collected from the Gulf in 2017 for the modernization of Chandrika and even the receipts for the fund collection were printed and provided from Kozhikode, but the fact remains that the collected funds did not reach the daily. The letter said that as per official figures during 2016-17, the daily had received Rs 16 crore by way of enrolment of annual subscriptions. It asked where those funds, along with crores of rupees collected through subscription drive in 2020, had gone. Also the employees alleged that land belonging to the daily had been sold off in the past for paltry sums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chandrika-staff-raise-charges-of-irregularities/articleshow/85159321.cms||---
---||World||UK parliamentarians create group to raise awareness in Westminster of cross-border terrorism in Indo-Pacific||LONDON: A new parliamentary group focused on the Indo-Pacific has been set up to supply an overall perspective of the region to British parliamentarians and promote a better understanding in the UK parliament of the region’s issues to drive more cooperation between like-minded democracies. The objectives of the APPG (all-party parliamentary group) Indo-Pacific, made up of Labour and Conservative MPs and peers, include to raise awareness of cross-border infiltration, terrorist training camps, the impact on communities living in border areas, the treatment of minority communities, the radicalisation of youth and religious indoctrination, and the impact globally and on communities in the region. The APPG will promote closer cooperation between the UK and India on the fight against terrorism, and on security and trade. The announcement comes at a time of closer UK defence and security cooperation in the region. The UK’s Carrier Strike Group is in the region and on Thursday the UK formally became Asean’s first new dialogue partner since 1966. In March in its Integrated Review the UK realigned its foreign policy to "tilt" towards the Indo-Pacific. "The APPG Indo-Pacific provides a unique platform to raise the pitch on the subcontinental security paradigm in the UK parliament. There is a general lacuna in information and understanding on issues related to terrorism and the geopolitics of the region here in the UK," said Lord Rami Ranger, vice-chair of the APPG. "The focus of this APPG will be on the security paradigm in the Indo-Pacific and will include matters relating to geopolitics, radicalisation, secessionism, separatism and terrorism in the subcontinent and its impact globally and specifically in the UK," said Bob Blackman, the APPG’s chair. "The Indo-Pacific is fast emerging as one of the most vital regions in the post-Brexit, post-pandemic international order. It holds the key to the future of global trade," he said. "In the last few years we have seen serious escalation in the security situation with ongoing tensions with Pakistan on Jammu and Kashmir, Chinese aggression in Ladakh, continued impact of sponsored cross-border terrorism and radicalisation in the Kashmir Valley and support to other secessionist elements," Blackman said. "I hope to counter false propaganda on the region and keep political parties honest to information on the region and drive more cooperation between like-minded democracies on security issues," Blackman added. "This APPG will provide the opportunity to highlight the success seen in India over recent years in improving living standards and delivering greater prosperity," said vice-chair Theresa Villiers. The APPG will promote cross-party visits to the region, dialogue with representatives from the region, cross-community dialogues for the region and engagement with diaspora communities in the UK. APPGs are not official parliamentary bodies. The APPG Indo-Pacific will appear on the new edition of the register of APPGs, the authoritative list of such groups, on around August 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-parliamentarians-create-group-to-raise-awareness-in-westminster-of-cross-border-terrorism-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/85166458.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||Jodhpur||Jodhpur: No breakthrough yet in probe into death of 11 Pakistani migrants||JODHPUR: A year after 11 members of a Pakistani migrant family were found dead in a farm in Dechu near Jodhpur on August 9,2020, community members are still awaiting the result of the police investigation which has been dragging on at a snail’s pace. The post-mortem and FSL reports, however, had pointed to a mass suicide by consumption of some chemical but police continue to remain in dark with regard to allegations on police and some community agents. TOI tried to talk to the IGP (Jodhpur Range) Navjyoti Gogoi and SP (Jodhpur Rural) Anil Kayal to know about the progress in investigation, but none of them responded to the call. Some sources, however, informed that police investigation has been stuck with regard to psychological autopsy and Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) has been sent a requisition for the same, which is being awaited. “The FSL team here had conducted a psychological autopsy but the observations failed to help us reach any conclusion. So we have sent a request for CFSL examination and awaiting their arrival,” the source said. On the other hand, president of Seemant Lok Sangthan, Hindu Singh Sodha said that it was a matter of deep disappointment for the entire community that even such a serious incident involving the oppressed minority migrants from Pakistan failed to draw the seriousness of the government and police. “During his visit to the place after the incident, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had clearly said that if we were dissatisfied with the investigation, it could be handed over to the CBI. But it is disappointing that 1 year passed and nothing has happened yet,” Sodha said. It may be noted that Budharam Bheel, his wife, three daughters, one son and five grandchildren had been found dead under mysterious condition in a shack on the agriculture farm, that he had hired for farming, in Lodta village of Dechu tehsil in Jodhpur on August 9 last year. Police had found some chemical and injectable vials from the shack leading the police to believe that some poisonous substance had been administered to all the deceased. It is believed that two of the deceased Laxmi and Priya, daughters of Budharam, were practicing nurses and they administered poison laced injections to all after giving them some psychotropic drug mixed in the dinner. They both are the under signatory of the note. Acting on the FIR of the survivor Kewal Ram, lone survivor of the family, police also had detained his wife and some other persons and had interrogated them. Preliminary investigation had indicated a family dispute between the family and the families of the wives of two sons Ravi and Kewal Ram. Police had found a note written in Hindi language and a video clip mentioning the threats from the families of both the wives and harassment by police. The note mentioned that the family had been undergoing traumatic conditions and expressed its anguish getting tired of running since arrival in India in pursuit of a peaceful life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/no-breakthrough-yet-in-probe-into-death-of-11-pak-migrants/articleshow/85160952.cms||---

Delhi government will issue daily bulletins in the morning and evening regarding the level of the alert. There are four colour-coded alerts under GRAP — Yellow, Amber, Orange and Red — based on three parameters, including positivity rate for two consecutive days, cumulative number of new Covid-19 cases and average oxygenated bed occupancy for seven days. In an order issued on Sunday, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) directed that as soon as any one of the three parameters reached the specified level of alert, “the order of alert” would be issued and permissions and restrictions prescribed at such level would become operational automatically. Regarding domestic and interstate travel, orders would be issued separately based on the situation for imposing restrictions. DDMA has directed all authorities to take necessary action for ensuring compliance to the rules in their respective areas. Yellow Alert would come into effect if either the positivity rate is more than 0.5% for two consecutive days, there are 1,500 new cases or 500 beds are occupied on average for seven days. At this level, shops would open on odd-even basis and one weekly market per zone would operate, while cinema, gyms, etc would be closed and night curfew imposed. Red alert would come into effect when the positivity rate remains more than 5% for two consecutive days, there are 16,000 new cases or 3,000 beds are occupied for seven days. At this level, most activities would be prohibited and only essential services would be allowed. Delhi government’s additional chief secretary (health) has been entrusted with the task of broadcasting the level of alert daily in the morning and evening. All district magistrates, DCPs and other authorities would have to ensure that the alerts are immediately disseminated extensively. Principal secretary (education) and secretary (higher education) would have to ensure that the guidelines regarding the level of alerts are disseminated among students. DDMA has also directed all district-level officials to disseminate guidelines in their respective areas and ensure the public knows the reasons behind restrictions on economic activities so that they comply voluntarily. All DMs have been instructed to interact with RWAs, market associations, mall associations, bar associations and other such bodies in their district to circulate information on GRAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3rd-wave-prep-colour-coded-grap-in-force-for-covid-curbs/articleshow/85163456.cms||---
---||Delhi||Email threat over terror attack, but IGI hikes security||New Delhi: Security has been intensified at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport after a threat email was received by IGI police station, warning of a possible bomb attack by terrorist outfit Al Qaeda. The email, received by Delhi Police on Saturday evening, warned of a bomb that could be used at the airport in the next one to three days. However, the threat was later found to be “non-specific” and the Bomb Threat Assessment Committee, after an intensive search, was terminated from the airport. Sources claim the cops received an email, which stated that “planned bomb blast by Al Qaeda Sargana at IGI airport. Karanbir Suri alias Mohamad Jalal and Karanbir Suri’s wife Shaily Sharda alias Haseena are coming to India on Sunday from Singapore and plan to put the bomb at IGI in 1-3 days (sic).” Immediately, cops alerted the airport officials and the Airport Operations Control Centre, with checks carried out at the premises. Around 7.18pm, the BTAC declared the bomb-threat as “non-specific”. It, however, asked for heightened security to remain on the premises. Officials said an anti-sabotage check was carried out soon after, alongside access control at all terminal points, checking of vehicles on airport premises and increased patrolling and checking at nakas on the access road leading up to the airport. CISF officials said that checks by their quick-reaction teams would continue on the premises owing to the bomb threat, as well as Independence Day. Dog squad was also being put to use, with a bomb detection and disposal squad ready on alert. The Security Operations Control Centre of the airport, on inspection, found that a similar threat message had been received by the airport in March, mentioning similar names and the same threat. Even in March, the threat was declared ‘non-specific’ by BTAC, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/email-threat-over-terror-attack-but-igi-hikes-security/articleshow/85163462.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

KMDA officials said that the health study will be conducted as part of the third phase of structural condition assessments of its bridges and flyovers. Health audit of most of the flyovers and bridges in the city, which are maintained by KMDA, have been completed earlier, including their load taking capacity tests, and repair work of some of the bridges, like Kalighat bridge, are currently going on. Bridge experts said that the three bridges identified which will undergo structural assessments had been constructed several years ago, but have not been much supervised till date as the authorities want to check its present structural conditions. “It will be checked as to if there has been any deterioration in their structural condition or whether its load bearing capacity has reduced or not following which the required corrective steps will be taken,” said a bridge expert. Currently, KMDA is halfway into conducting repair work of Kalighat Setu with the bridge being strengthened up and corrosion on the piers removed. Work on the single span of the EM Bypass-bound Ultadanga flyover is almost finished and will now be followed up with a post-repair load test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-bridges-over-tollys-nullah-to-undergo-checks/articleshow/85160962.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The declaration of results have led to a chain of protests by students across Jharkhand and on Friday, some students were lathi-charged by the cops in Dhanbad when they were protesting outside the district collectorate demanding a reassessment of their Class XII (intermediate) results. Congress spokespersons Alok Kumar Dubey and Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo accused Prasad of attempting to defame the state government by declaring faulty results. They condemned the Dhanbad incident and claimed that some officials in the government are still acting as an ‘agents’ of the BJP. Dubey said, “Whatever controversy erupted after the JAC results were announced is because of the council chairman. The results were prepared under Singh’s supervision. Many students’ future is at stake now because of the results and this was a deliberate attempt by Singh to defame the government as he is known to have links with the BJP and RSS.” “There are many state officials who are acting as BJP agents and are working round- the-clock to put the coalition government in a bad light,” they said. The party also raised doubts on JAC’s evaluation system “as many meritorious students were declared failed”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-blames-jac-chairman-for-results-error/articleshow/85160234.cms||ASRP Mukesh

This comes after state government allowed educational institutes to reopen on August 6. Dr Sahir Pall, the additional chief medical officer of the district, said, “The district education officer has been asked to provide the health department with a compiled data of the teaching and non-teaching staff of all the schools and colleges.” He added that all the institutes have been reminded that they must implement Covid safety protocols in their respective campuses. “Not just in the classroom alone, but in the office and in the campus as well. Everyone there has to follow the safety protocols,” Pall said. Those staff members who have taken at least one dose of the vaccine, have been allowed to report for work. “With the help of the district administration, the remaining staff was inoculated at the school. We are through with 100% vaccination of the employees,” St Mary’s English School official A K Pandey said. The Private Unaided English Medium Schools Association’s senior functionary named B Chandrashekhar said, “Students are attending class on alternate days in the week to avert crowding.” More than 40 private English-medium schools and 20 undergraduate colleges have resumed offline classes from Friday and the attendance was 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/east-singbhum-plans-random-tests-on-school-college-staff/articleshow/85161907.cms||B Sridhar

Sources said that samples of the patients have been sent to laboratory for analysis. The two patients including a youth and a middle-aged man have been admitted in Covid-19 ward. The duo has travel history of Kerala. “They had gone to Kerala and after return developed Covid-19 symptoms. The reports are awaited,” said a hospital functionary. The duo earlier had taken treatment under home isolation but were admitted at the government hospital five days ago. Earlier in June, the first case of Delta plus variant of SARS-Cov-2 virus was recorded in Jarod village of Waghodiya taluka. Health officials had swung into action after it had come to light that a 38-year-old female resident of Jarod had become the first recorded case of the new variant in Vadodara.

Talking to TOI, BJP’s general secretary Aditya Sahu, who is part of the team, said, “We will submit their report to the state party leadership by Monday and demand strict action against all erring officials, including the cops for resorting to lathi-charge which left several pupils injured.” Besides Sahu, the fact-finding team comprises two MLAs — C P Singh (Ranchi) and Amar Kumar Bauri (Chandankyari) -- and Pradeep Verma, who is a senior office-bearer of the party. All of them spoke to the injured students and locals on Sunday. Sahu said, “About 15 cops, mostly male and the SDM, had lathi-charged the girl students. One Rinku Tiwari is still in hospital. We demand an FIR against the officials concerned and all of them must be jailed.” Asked about the party’s next course of action if their demands are not met, Sahu said that the party has not yet decided on that but BJP will continue to raise its voice in favour of students. “We have always stood by the students while the government continues to be apathetic towards them,” he added. On Friday, a team of administrative officials, led by Dhanbad SDO Surendra Kumar, allegedly lathicharged a group of students, mostly girls, when they were trying to enter the conference hall of the district collectorate to meet state health minister Banna Gupta while he was holding a meeting. On Saturday, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights took cognizance of the incident and sought detailed action taken report from the district administration within three days. The protesting students had failed in the matric and intermediate JAC (Jharkhand Academic Council) exams. The students dubbed the evaluation system as faulty and demanded that they be declared pass. While backing the protesters, state BJP president Deepak Prakash said, “Many students, who were declared fail, had already cleared medical and engineering entrance exams. This exposes the loopholes in JAC’s evaluation system. Other boards across the country took a humanitarian approach to prepare the results considering the pandemic. JAC too must hear out the students.” Questioning the logic behind supplementary exam, Prakash said, “JAC is now asking the students to appear for supplementary exam. But when main exams were not conducted in the first place and lakhs got passed, what is the logic behind conducting supplementary exam? This is an injustice for those who were declared failed. The CM is harassing the students by being silent.” Meanwhile, JAC has ruled out any further relaxations. The council’s secretary, Mahip Kumar Singh, said, “Those who couldn’t clear the exam based on the evaluation pattern have the option of taking the supplementary exam for which enrolment has already begun from August 7 and will be open till August 19. We shall soon declare the exam dates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-sends-fact-finding-team-to-dhanbad/articleshow/85160243.cms||ASRP Mukesh

JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, “We are in favour of a caste-based census. The Union government is scared to conduct it, as such an exercise will reveal that the creamy layers of society, which consists of Brahmins, Rajputs and others, hold the maximum representation in positions of power and a larger pie of the government jobs. Stating that JMM will carry out protests to demand a caste-based census, Bhattacharjee added, “Fearing that such a census will let the cats out of the bag, the Centre has refused to conduct it.” The Congress party also rallied behind a caste based census. “Our state president Rameshwar Oraon is of the view that caste based census is imperative as it will give a true picture of the state’s and the country’s social status. Though the national census has not been conducted on caste lines, the Centre had in fact conducted a separate socio-economic caste census but did not make its findings public for some reasons,” Jharkhand Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey claimed. Last week, Ajsu-P chief Sudesh Mahto had written to Modi demanding a caste-based census. In his letter, Mahto claimed that not holding a caste based census will mean that the real picture of the backward classes will not be known and that in turn, will result in a flawed implementation of social justice and social welfare schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-ajsu-p-jmm-cong-favour-caste-based-census/articleshow/85161715.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Health minister bats for CNG autos to check pollution||JAMSHEDPUR: State health minister Banna Gupta raised concerns over the rise in pollution levels and said that the use of clean fuel was the need of the hour. Gupta said that time has come when public transport, including autorickshaws, should use clean fuel like CNG. He said diesel-run three-wheelers must be converted into CNG-compliant vehicles so that pollution levels can be brought down. Notably, the district transport department in the recent past has issued directives to autorickshaw unions that after January 2022, the administration will not allow any diesel-run three-wheelers to ply on Jamshedpur roads. The owners of the showrooms were also told to sell CNG-compliant vehicles. At present there are more than 30,000 diesel-run autos plying on city streets. The minister on Sunday said that the switch to CNG should be done to protect environment, but at the same time it should be kept in mind that most of the auto-drivers are poor so the switching over to the new fuel should not make a hole in their pockets. Gupta advised that switching over to CNG should be done in a phased manner. The minister assured that he would take up the issue with the transport commissioner and find a solution. Gupta recalled the initial days of his political career when he headed the auto rickshaw drivers’ union in the Steel City. He thanked the drivers for always backing him in his political career. Gupta added that he had even gone to jail in the past to fight for the rights of the drivers. On Saturday evening it was a pleasant surprise for the auto drivers at Sakchi roundabout. The minister stopped in front of the auto stand and started chatting with the drivers. Later he was seen on the driver's seat in one of the autos and with few of his followers at the back seat, switched on the ignition of the vehicle. Gupta drove the auto in the Sakchi area and this joy ride was loudly cheered by a large number of his followers there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-min-bats-for-cng-autos-to-check-pollution/articleshow/85162102.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

It also ordered compulsory institutional quarantine for all paramilitary personnel and policemen returning from other states to prevent another surge of the viral disease given the spread of the Delta-Plus variant in other states. On August 5, the department of health, medical education and family welfare directed the deputy commissioners of Ranchi, Bokaro, Ramgarh, East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Deoghar districts to keep a record of the passengers arriving from Maharashtra and Kerala and initiate their Covid-19 testing and contact-tracing exercises. The order issued by health secretary Arun Kumar Singh said the precautions were necessary to prevent another surge of Covid-19 infections in Jharkhand due to the mutant Delta-plus variant strain of the virus. “Covid-19 testing and contact tracing of all the passengers coming in trains from these states have to be ensured. That apart, the districts will have to inform the state surveillance cell about the timings and movements of the trains regularly,” Singh wrote. Stating that positivity rates in Kerala and Maharashtra had risen to over 12%, the department said it was imperative to screen the passengers coming from these states. As of August first week, Jharkhand’s positivity rate was hovering a little above 2%. Even though district administrations have deployed teams of health workers at all the busy railway stations of Jharkhand such as Ranchi, Hatia, Bokaro Steel City, Tatanagar (Jamshedpur), Barkakana (Ramgarh), Deoghar, only a small fraction of the thousands of passengers arriving at these stations are being put through rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests. “In most cases, it is not possible to screen 1,200-odd passengers who are arriving in express trains. We are being able to screen only a handful of them. There is a shortage of health workers and due to the waiting time, a lot of passengers get edgy and break through the barricades put up by the RPF personnel at the platforms,” a health worker at the Ranchi station said requesting anonymity. Around 800 passengers are being tested at the Hatia railway station each day. In another letter to Jharkhand DGP Neeraj Sinha, the health secretary directed him to ensure that all policemen, paramilitary personnel and home guard jawans, who are arriving from other states from leaves and duties, must undergo a mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine upon arrival at the districts which are their respective places of posting. “All such personnel must be quarantined for a week at the respective police lines. Those who are coming from districts with high positivity rates will have to be put through RT-PCR tests. If they are tested positive, they will be admitted to district Covid health centres and their contact-tracings will have to be carried out,” Singh wrote. Health department officials said placing incoming police personnel in institutional quarantine is aimed at eliminating any possibility of mass infection in the state’s police and paramilitary personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cops-paramilitary-forces-to-be-in-quarantine-on-return-to-jkhand/articleshow/85161989.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||BJP to challenge Hemant govt’s new job policy for grade III & IV staff in court||Ranchi: Opposition BJP is gearing up to take legal recourse to challenge Hemant Soren government’s new recruitment policy for Grade III and IV government jobs, which was passed by the cabinet recently, terming the decision ‘unconstitutional and anti-people’. Former chief minister and BJP’s national vice-president Raghubar Das on Sunday appealed to the state government to include Hindi in the list of languages which a candidate can opt for at the state-level examinations conducted by Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission. As per the amended recruitment policy, a candidate can opt for any of the 12 regional and tribal languages, including Mundari, Kharia, Ho, Santhali, Khortha, Panchpargania, Bangla, Urdu, Kurmali, Nagpuri, Khurukh and Odia. For district-level examinations, separate language lists will be notified by the government. A candidate will get weightage upon knowing local tradition and customs. Das said, “While we welcome the inclusion of Bangla and Odia languages, but we want to know why Hindi was excluded? Hindi is our national language and is also spoken in large parts of Jharkhand. So removing it is unconstitutional. Most important, in Jharkhand, all schools are either Hindi or English medium and there isn’t any provision for studies in tribal languages anywhere up till the intermediate level. It is in this light, we urge Hindi to be included.” He added that BJP is planning to challenge this new amended policy in court if the government doesn’t include Hindi. “As the first step, we are appealing to the Hemant government to rectify its mistake. Otherwise, we will be forced to approach the judiciary,” he said. Das, whose government had in 2016 come up with local residents policy for jobs, said, “The current policy is solely intended to give jobs to outsiders. In our policy, we have made the provision that a candidate must either be born in this state or should have completed matric from here. But this amended policy says that candidate who appeared for the matric or intermediate exam from here will be eligible to apply in government jobs. This means, any outsider can study Class IX somewhere else and then give the boards here and be eligible for government jobs. In other words, it is opening avenues for outsiders to get jobs here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-to-challenge-hemant-govts-new-job-policy-for-grade-iii-iv-staff-in-court/articleshow/85160308.cms||ASRP Mukesh

According to sources, the three boys — Shubham Kumar Mishra, Harsh Raj and Basant Kumar — all students of MGM Higher Secondary School and residents of Sector 3, Sector 9 and Sector 12 police station areas, along with six other had gone to the river for a bath after leaving their homes in the morning. The boys told their parents that they were going for tuition classes and to play a cricket match. Currently, Damodar is in spate because of the monsoon and with Tenughat Dam opening its sluice gates. MGM school principal Father Rezi C Varghese described the incident as “very unfortunate” and requested the district administration to find the children. Harla police station officer-in-charge Jai Gobind Gupta said they have started a rescue operation. Describing the incident, Gupta said five of the students were standing on the bank while four of them took bath. “When Shubham started to drown, Basant went to help him but he alone could not and Harsh also joined to help the duo. However, all of them were being washed away by the strong current and another of their friends, Nitin, also tried to help but could not and came out of the water,” Gupta said. Following the incident, the other students fled from the spot but Nitin immediately informed the local people, who in turn contacted the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-class-xi-students-from-bokaro-drown-in-damodar-river/articleshow/85160180.cms||Divy Khare
---||Nagpur||After Pune, Nagpur too relaxes curbs; restaurants till 10pm, coaching classes to open||Nagpur: From Monday, Nagpur city will witness major easing of restrictions for non-essential businesses, as district guardian minister Nitin Raut stayed firm on ‘unlocking’ just as Pune had announced on Sunday evening. A similar order for rural Nagpur is expected in a few days, as the paperwork for it has to be approved from Mantralaya. Now, on all through the week, restaurants can remain open till 10pm for dine-ins with 50% capacity, while coaching classes can operate at 50% capacity and all non-essential shops (including malls) can operate till 8pm. Even as bureaucratic guidelines on issuing such orders were being reviewed, Raut held on to his view that the unlocking process has to move ahead. Raut said that there is no denying that businesses, especially the smaller ones, are in dire straits. “I can never forget that these businessmen supported us by honouring the lockdown guidelines even though every single day was a massive struggle for them. At the government level, we have to take steps while looking at multiple issues, hence it did take time to start the unlock process, but I have kept my promise to them,” he told TOI. With this, Nagpur becomes the second city in the state to ease restrictions considerably. On Sunday night, chief chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his web address said that the “hotels & restaurants” issue will be discussed during the Covid-19 task force meeting to be held on Monday. However, Raut clarified that even at the local level decisions can be taken. “The orders to unlock have been given after keeping all the guidelines and rules in mind. The civic body is authorized to issue such guidelines,” said Raut. In other major relaxations, timing for social, cultural, political and entertainment gatherings, and wedding ceremonies was extended till 8pm with 50% capacity on all days. But duration of such events should not be more than three hours. Gymnasiums, spas, hair cutting salons, wellness centres and beauty parlours can also operate till 8pm on all days. All playgrounds and gardens will remain open on regular basis and barring swimming, all sporting activities will be allowed. Timing of Gorewada safari and amusement parks was also increased to 6pm from 4pm. Mickey Arora, director of Hotel Centre Point, termed it as a big relief and thanked the guardian minister for the efforts. “The NMC order has come as a lifeline for our sinking sector and, hopefully, we can sustain this for a long time due to almost nil cases,” said Arora. After a long gap, coaching classes too have got the permission to operate on all days and at a much higher capacity. Rajnikant Bondre, president of Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI), said, “We are extremely happy about this decision and thank the guardian minister for even considering higher capacity. We can now operate at 50% capacity, as opposed to the much older order when only 20 students were allowed. This will ensure that students can now get proper coaching for competitive exams.” Apart from Nagpur, no other district in Vidarbha has issued unlocking orders. Amravati collector Pawaneet Kaur said, “No change in the level of restrictions is expected for the district.” Akola district collector Nima Arora had allowed restaurants attached to bars to function up to 8pm on weekdays through her order issued on August 3. Following this, the bar-restaurants had started entertaining consumers with 50% of the capacity from August 4. But, the collector issued a fresh order on August 7 and cancelled the relaxations given to the bar-restaurants. Now, Akola will continue to be in the Level 3 restrictions and no restaurants attached to bar will function after 4pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-pune-nagpur-too-relaxes-curbs-restaurants-till-10pm-coaching-classes-to-open/articleshow/85164030.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||India||Driven by rural India boost, daily vaccination gathers pace in Aug||NEW DELHI: Daily vaccinations have picked up in August with an average of 51.45 lakh doses per day in the week July 31-Aug 6, up over 27% from 40.31 lakh doses a day a fortnight ago (July 17-23) with a high uptake in rural areas. Vaccination has averaged at around 48.25 lakh doses in the previous week of July 24-30. The rise in daily vaccinations is mainly driven by higher vaccination in rural areas that accounts for more than 60% of daily inoculations. During July 31-August 6, nearly 65% of 3.6 crore vaccine doses were administered to recipients at rural centres. "While there were initial apprehensions in rural areas, the uptake in these areas is commendable," an official said. Five states of MP, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have administered over one crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine in the age group of 18-44 years. Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Uttarakhand and West Bengal have vaccinated more than 10 lakh beneficiaries in the 18-44 group for the first dose of vaccine. Despite a slowdown in Covaxin supplies from the new Bengaluru facility of Bharat Biotech, overall supply of vaccines have improved over last few months. The government has given a visibility of 15 crore doses to be supplied during August, whereas it is likely to supply at least 20 crore doses in September. The government has already placed an order for 66 crore doses of Covid vaccines to be made available between August and December. This includes 37.5 crore doses of Covishield and 28.5 crore doses of Covaxin. Besides, the Centre has also made an advance arrangement with Biological E to reserve 30 crore doses of its Corbevax vaccine. The government has supplied over 52.37 crore vaccine doses so far and a further 8,99,260 doses are in the pipeline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/driven-by-rural-india-boost-daily-vaccination-gathers-pace-in-aug/articleshow/85166540.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Pune||Pune: Malls to reopen, 8pm deadline for shops; weekend curbs go||PUNE: After an extended run of restrictions that led to traders and mall operators getting restive, the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations on Sunday offered a slew of relaxations which take effect from Monday. The orders were issued after a review meeting chaired by deputy chief minister and Pune’s guardian minister Ajit Pawar at Council Hall on Sunday. The orders apply to the Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road cantonment limits too, while rural areas of the district, where the positivity rate remains above 5%, will operate with Level 3 restrictions. Authorities said curbs on night-time travel will remain in place from 11pm to 5am but essential services are exempt. From Monday, essential and non-essential shops can stay open till 8pm six days a week, while malls have the same deadline and can keep open through the week. Restaurants, bars and eateries can offer dine-in services at 50% seating capacity till 10pm, while takeaways/home deliveries are allowed till 11pm, as was the case under earlier restrictions. Public gardens will now be open in the evenings too. Pawar said these relaxations were conditional. “In the event that the positivity rate rises above 7%, the restrictions will again be imposed,” he said. “We are unlocking services and extending timings, but citizens must ensure that they follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. We will withdraw these relaxations if there is a surge in Covid cases,” he added. Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations followed up Pawar’s announcement with orders that stated, “People visiting malls must be fully vaccinated. Similarly, employees of malls must be fully vaccinated and undergo fortnightly Covid-19 tests.” Public gardens will now be open from 6am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm on all days, while indoor and outdoor sporting activities, except contact sports, will be allowed. Swimming pools will remain shut till further notice, while gyms, salons, beauty parlours, spas and wellness centres can operate with prior appointments till 8pm at 50% capacity, the orders stated. Schools, colleges and educational institutions will remain shut till further notice, while online classes will continue. Competitive exam coaching centres can operate till 8pm at 50% capacity. Teachers and students of these centres must be at least partly vaccinated, the orders added. The state’s decision on July 31 to maintain restrictions in 11 districts, including Pune, had disappointed residents, traders and businesspeople in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, who were expecting some relaxations given the sub-5% positivity rate. The decision was largely based on the situation in rural Pune, but sparked protests from traders and mall employees, who had no respite for nearly four months. The Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP), which has 40,000 members in Pune Metropolitan Region, had staged a protest and defied the 4pm deadline, while mall owners and employees too held agitations. Sunday’s review meeting was held against this backdrop after the authorities submitted a detailed report on the prevailing situation. Pawar said, “The decision on reopening schools and religious places will be taken as per a state-wide policy. These establishments will be remain shut for now,” On compliance of Covid norms, Pawar said the authorities have consistently received complaints about many citizens not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Appropriate action will also be taken against shop owners who flouted the norms and kept their establishments open during the lockdown,” he said. Pawar said establishments must ensure they were vaccinating their employees. “Along with government vaccination centres, even private facilities are now available for these establishments. Only those who are vaccinated will be allowed to work,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-to-reopen-8pm-deadline-for-shops-weekend-curbs-go/articleshow/85164887.cms||---

For, while the efforts of the battery of worlwide photographers and documentary filmmakers’ coverage of the historic event, on March 12, 1930, got instant acclaim, the 27-year-old Dalit artist, Chhaganlal Jadav’s sketches of the iconic ‘Salt March’, however, got buried in the sands of time.These pictorial documentary was awaiting discovery at the Gurjari bazaar, amid flea market’s hidden treasures, by Rizwan Kadri, an Ahmedabad-based historian, who found the priceless ‘drawing book’. Jadav’s sketches will now be displayed at the Baroda Museum and Picture Gallery. Starting from this Independence Day on August 15, all the 71 sketches that have been compiled and presented in form of a coffee table book, ‘Unseen Drawings of Dandi March’, will be exhibited till October 2, Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary. “It will be presented in all the three languages – Gujarati, Hindi and English,” Kadri told TOI.“This is one memoir that was never shown to the world. On March 12, 1930, Gandhiji with his 78 handpicked followers had begun the march from the ashram. Chhaganlal had joined the group and made ‘live paintings record’ of the memorable moments while moving with it. He was a member of a group called ‘Arunodaya Tukdi’ that had travelled in advance of the march and organized Bapu’s journey,” said Kadri, adding that the artist had found time to draw a few scenes and painted memorable poses of Gandhiji. When Gandhiji was arrested in Karadi on May 5, Chhaganlal too was sentenced to three months in prison. “During these months he drew paintings and drawings of daily life in Nasik prison,” said Kadri, adding that the drawing book is thus a rare collection and a live document of the historical Dandi March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dandi-march-sketch-found-in-flea-market-to-be-displayed-on-i-day/articleshow/85160144.cms||Prashant Rupera

Except for the army base and Kunduz’s airport, the insurgents have taken control of all the government buildings with their white flag flying at the central roundabout of the city, the capital of the northern province with the same name. “Heavy clashes started yesterday [Saturday] afternoon, all government headquarters are in control of the Taliban, only the army base and the airport is with ANDSF ( Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) from where they are resisting the Taliban,” Amrudddin Wali, a provincial lawmaker of Kunduz assembly, told reporters. While the country’s interior ministry claimed Afghan commandoes are conducting coordinated operations, the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group has captured the police headquarters, the governor’s compound, intelligence department and the prison in Kunduz. “The government is denying that Kunduz has fallen but the Taliban fighters are present in most part of the city,” Rafiq Sherzad, a local journalist, told TOI on phone, describing the situation in the city as “too chaotic”. “Fire has engulfed buildings, shops and markets with debris scattered all around. A fire at a shoe market has caused huge financial losses to people,” Sherzad said, adding that families were seen fleeing the city amid heavy firing and shelling. Health officials in Kunduz said 14 bodies, including those of women and children, and more than 30 injured people were received at the city’s hospital. Hours after seizing Kunduz, the Taliban took control of government buildings in the northern provincial capital of Sar-e-Pul, forcing Afghan forces out of the main city to a nearby military base, said Mohammad Noor Rahmani, a provincial council member of Sar-e-Pul province. Since Friday, four provincial capitals have fallen to the Taliban with Kunduz considered to be their most important gain due to its strategic importance. The militants had captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but had failed to hold it for long. Home to around 270,000 people, Kunduz is considered a gateway to Afghanistan’s mineral-rich northern provinces and Central Asia. On Saturday, the militants had captured Shehberghan, the capital of Jawzjan, a day after Zaranj, the capital of Nimruz, fell to the group without a fight. Violence has escalated across the war-ravaged country after the US and Nato forces began withdrawal from it after 20 years of military operations. The troops pullout had coincided with rapid advances of the Taliban, causing displacement of thousands of civilians. Currently, intense fighting continued in the capitals of southern Kandahar and Helmand provinces. The Taliban have now been trying for weeks to take over Kandahar and Lashkar Gah, the provincial capitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-capture-key-afghan-city-of-kunduz/articleshow/85166600.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

However, restaurants, pubs and gyms will have to continue to operate at 50% capacity. The government also allowed swimming pools to open for all, provided Covid-appropriate behaviour is maintained. Until now, pools were open only for professional swimmers who needed to practise for any upcoming event. The government order also urged swimmers, visitors and staff to get vaccinated with both doses. Despite the relaxations, the government on Sunday extended the lockdown in the state for a fortnight till August 23. The order, however, insisted on the “no mask, no service” strategy. It said that only people with masks or face cover would be allowed to enter government offices or board any public transport. Apart from testing, tracing and tracking, the government has also insisted on vaccinations and Covid-appropriate behaviour in its strategy to battle the pandemic. “It has been a gradual process of easing the lockdown restrictions as cases have come down and the positivity rate has declined. The district administration is constantly monitoring the situation and directives announced by the government from time to time are being complied with strictly,” said Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner. Garg also appealed to Gurugram residents to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest and follow all Covid protocols. Although the government implemented the lockdown on May 3, it has been easing restrictions in a phase-wise manner from May 24. Until now, shops were allowed to open from 9am to 10pm, while malls had been operating between 10am and 10pm. Similarly, the timings for standalone restaurants were 8am to 11pm while those for eateries in malls 10am to 11pm. Restaurant owners and traders appreciated the decision, saying it would provide a much-needed boost to business. They also urged the authorities to gradually open offices as a large section of their clientele is employees from various firms. “It’s a good decision, should have been taken earlier. But nonetheless, we are happy as it will definitely boost business. So far, we have been mostly serving families. But we are waiting for the corporate crowd,” said Gagan Vashist, the owner of Dhaba 29, a restaurant. “The lifting of time restrictions will definitely widen the scope of our business. But without the corporate crowd, it will take some time for things to become normal. It’s the discretion of the government and corporate leaders, but we will appreciate if people start attending offices slowly. Most of the businesses are inter-linked,” he added. Tej Singh, president of the Vyapar Kendra Market Association, said that maintaining social distance and following other such Covid protocols were key to keeping cases low. “We have been appealing to people to wear masks and follow social distancing. But there are some who always violate the rules. The administration should look into this strictly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-lifts-timing-curbs-but-50-capacity-rule-to-stay/articleshow/85164731.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Pune||Covishield-Covaxin combo safe, shows ICMR study||PUNE: A combination of Covishield and Covaxin doses produces a more potent immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants than two jabs of the same vaccine, a preliminary study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found. The researchers studied 18 out of 20 individuals who were mistakenly given Covishield as the first jab and Covaxin as the second in Uttar Pradesh in April-May this year. The individuals’ blood samples were analysed at different stages for 60 to 70 days after vaccination. “The mix-and-match of Covishield and Covaxin as first and second dose provoked a superior immune response than two doses of either vaccine,” said senior ICMR scientist Rajni Kant, the study’s lead investigator. This is the first report of mixed immunisation using an adenovirus vector-based Covishield and an inactivated whole virion-based Covaxin in humans that has demonstrated safety and significantly improved immune response. The findings are important as experts have asked if Covishield and Covaxin doses can be mixed to get around supply shortages. Currently, deliberate mixing of the two vaccines is not advised. The findings could also have a significant bearing on the Covid-19 vaccination programme — a heterologous (mix-and-match) approach to immunisation could pave the way for strategies that provide better protection against variants. But to conclusively prove these findings, the ICMR researchers said a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) would be needed. A vaccine’s immunogenicity is the ability of a foreign substance, such as vaccine-induced antigen (virus particles), to provoke an immune response. Kant said, “The immunogenicity profile against Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants in the group that received Covishield and Covaxin was superior. The IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody response of the participants were also significantly higher compared to that in homologous groups, in which participants had received two doses of either Covishield or Covaxin.” Another investigator in the study, senior scientist Pragya Yadav of the ICMR-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), said, “The findings suggest immunisation with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine (Covishield) followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine (Covaxin) is not only safe but also elicits better immunogenicity.” In other countries too, scientists are testing combinations of Covid-19 vaccines that have already been deployed. In May, researchers in Spain found that mixing shots had produced a vastly higher antibody responsem 14 days after receiving a Pfizer booster that followed an initial dose of the AstraZeneca jab (which is Covishield in India).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covishield-covaxin-combo-safe-shows-icmr-study/articleshow/85164864.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Longer hours for shops & eateries, malls restart in Pune||PUNE: Traders, restaurateurs and those managing malls in the city are determined to do everything possible to ensure that the positivity rate remains under check so that no fresh curbs and closures are put in place. The business community is squarely conscious about the chances of Covid-19 restrictions being reintroduced if the positivity rate in Pune rises beyond 7%. The ongoing protests by traders, who kept their shutters open till 7pm without permit, came to an end on Sunday after the announcement of relaxations followed by orders issued by the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations. “We have asked all our members to stringently follow safety protocols with a view to make business safe for shopkeepers, staff, customers and the general public,” said Fatehchand Ranka, president of Federation of Trade Association Pune. Members of the association will put up ‘No mask, no entry’ posters in their establishments and encourage frequent sanitisation and vaccination. “About 90% of our members and their staff are fully vaccinated. We have requested the PMC to supply us with doses so that we can get 100% of the staff vaccinated at the earliest,” he added. “Traders can continue with their weekly offs, which can be any day barring peak weekend days. With an 8pm deadline, there will be less crowding,” Ranka said. Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association president Ganesh Shetty said, “About 95% of our members have been fully vaccinated, but their staff, most of whom are below 45 years old and have taken Covishield, have only received their first dose. We have encouraged all members to get their staff fully vaccinated at the earliest with paid or free doses. It is in everyone’s best interest to take safety protocols seriously.” Samir Shetty, secretary of United Hospitality Association, said, “This time, with the focus on vaccination, we are making sure that our member-restaurateurs follow all government directives. While 80% of our members and their staff have received at least the first shot, we will encourage our customers to get vaccinated through informational posters, standees, and social media posts.” Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer of Amanora Mall, said, “As per civic orders, we will allow only visitors, who have taken both doses of the vaccine. All visitors must download the Arogya Setu app and show the final vaccination certificate to the security staff before being allowed in. People, who have received only one dose of the vaccine, will not be allowed in. At the same time, we will request civic authorities for a consideration to be made for visitors aged below 45 years, who have taken their first dose.” Jayen Naik, senior vice president, operations and projects, Nexus Malls, said, “We will open both Westend Mall, Aundh, and The Pavilion, SB Road, at 10am on Monday, after both premises are thoroughly sanitized and kept ready on the basis of SoP’s shared by the local administration and Shopping Centre Association of India. Across both malls, we will open with all possible brands as per the advisory. We will also have our food court and restaurants open. We are certain that over the next week all our retail partners would be trading with us. Our floor wardens will ensure Covid-appropriate behavior is followed at all times within the premises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/longer-hrs-for-shops-eateries-malls-restart/articleshow/85164866.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Chandigarh||Parliamentary panel red-flags poor upkeep of canals in Punjab, Rajasthan||CHANDIGARH: The parliamentary standing committee on water resources has expressed concern about improper maintenance of very old canals in Punjab and Rajasthan, which is resulting in additional flow of water to Pakistan from Harike Barrage in Punjab. The committee is studying flood management and international water treaties. Headed by Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, Lok Sabha MP from Pashchim Champaran in Bihar, the committee has recommended that the canal system in Punjab and Rajasthan be repaired, strengthened and properly maintained in order to increase water carrying capacity of water channels. In its report submitted to the Parliament during the ongoing Monsoon Session, the panel highlighted that canals like Rajasthan feeder and Sirhind feeder are working below capacity — 1/3rd of their full capacity - resulting in release of water from Harike Barrage to Pakistan. It has also urged the central government to expedite work for finishing dam projects like Ujh and Shahpur Kandi so as to exploit the full potential of western rivers for irrigation and other purposes. Indus Water Treaty rights underutilised : Parl panelThe parliamentary panel is also studying international water treaties in the field of water resource management with particular reference to treaty or agreement entered into with China, Pakistan and Bhutan. Emphasising the need for the Centre to renegotiate the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan, the committee has said that the present-day pressing issues such as climate change, global warming and environmental impact assessment were not taken into account while framing the treaty at that time. “The committee is constrained to note that though India, as per the Indus Water Treaty, has the right to create water capacity storage up to 3.6 million acre-feet on western rivers, however, no storage capacity has been created so far by India. Further, out of an estimated power potential of about 20,000MW, which could be harnessed from western river power projects, only capacity of 3,482MW have been constructed so far on western rivers,” reads the report. The Indus Water Treaty was signed between India and Pakistan for sharing of waters of the Indus basin in 1960 after eight years of negotiations under the aegis of the World Bank. Total quantity of waters of the eastern rivers — Satluj, Beas and Ravi — is allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab — is allocated largely to Pakistan. However, India is permitted to use the water of the western rivers for domestic use, non-consumptive use, agricultural and generation of hydro-electric power. The committee added that the Indus Water Treaty provides India the right to develop irrigated cropped area (ICA) of 13.43 lakh acres (9.12 lakh acres without creating any storage and 4.31 lakh acres after creation of conservation storage and release of a specified quantum of water into the river annually) through waters of western rivers. However, as per the latest data for the crop year 2019-20, the ICA developed by India on western rivers is 7.59 lakh acres. BBMB water release inundates PunjabIt also highlighted that water release from Bhakra Beas Management Board projects in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab is creating flood like situation in Punjab. As per the report, Punjab suffered total damages to crops, houses and public utilities from floods and heavy rain amounting to Rs 124 crore in 2018. The central government has released Rs 40 crore to the Punjab government under the flood management programme in three years from 2017-18 to 2019-20 and Rs 814 crore to Himachal during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parliamentary-panel-red-flags-poor-upkeep-of-canals-in-punjab-rajasthan/articleshow/85166652.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Goa||Goa: Clubs, casinos shut & nothing to do, tourists line up for vaccination||CALANGUTE: With entertainment venues such as nightclubs and casinos shut and watersports suspended due to pandemic restrictions, a number of tourists in the Calangute-Candolim beach belt are using their holiday to get themselves vaccinated against Covid-19 instead. Medical officer at the Candolim primary health centre, Dr Roshan Nazareth, confirmed this. “We are witnessing a lot of tourists visiting the vaccination centre,” he said. Nikhil Pillai, a Delhi-based IT specialist who took his first shot late last month, said he visits Goa two-three times a year as he has a holiday home at Nagoa, Bardez. “Due to the pandemic, I work from home. I was infected with Covid at the end of April while in Delhi and was told that I would have to wait for 90 days to get vaccinated. As I had planned to travel to Goa around that time, I thought it would be a good idea to get vaccinated here,” he said. Like Pillai, Pooja Biltoria from Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, also decided to take her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at Candolim, recently. “Travelling and working from home, I was looking for a peaceful place where I could continue working. It was an added advantage that I could get vaccinated in Goa, too,” she said. Ayush medical officer Dr Suvira Bandekar, who is in charge of the Covid-19 vaccination centre set up in a house along the Candolim-Sinquerim road, said many tourists do visit the centre to inquire if they could get a jab. “It is likely that they are unable to get vaccinated easily in their home states due to high demand and long queues,” she said. Interestingly, a few foreign tourists, who have been stuck in Goa due the Covid-induced suspension of regular international flights have also opted to get vaccinated in the sunshine state. “I’m very happy with the experience of being vaccinated in Goa. It is a quick, professional procedure, well-organised and available to everyone who seeks it,” Kateryn, a tourist from Ukraine, said. “In my country I would have had to wait longer and the vaccine is not available in stock.” Anticipating an increase in tourist arrivals in the near future if the government further relaxes Covid restrictions, hoteliers and resort owners have also begun calling their non-Goan staff back to the state. “Many such staff arrive at the railway stations from their home states and head straight to the vaccination centre,” Nazareth said. “Goa allows anybody working in the tourism industry to take the vaccine. That’s why I came here,” Pallabh Mondal from West Bengal, said. Mondal, who returned to Goa recently and works at a restaurant in Candolim, said he expects to remain here till the end of the coming season. “We have to work by maintaining Covid protocols,” he said. However, it’s early days yet, Calangute sarpanch and hotelier Shawn Martins said. “Staff are returning, but slowly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/clubs-casinos-shut-nothing-to-do-tourists-line-up-for-vax/articleshow/85163041.cms||Joseph Zuzarte

It took at least two hours for the PMRDA and the Pune fire brigade personnel to douse the fire. A paint booth in a neighbouring garage and two buses parked on the premises were completely damaged in the fire. The godown shed had to be knocked over by an earth moving machine to douse the fire completelyVaishali Chandgude, senior inspector of the Uttamnagar police said the deceased has been identified as Brijesh Sahani of Warje Malwadi. His cousin, Sanjay Sahani (37), sustained 15% burns. “Prima facie probe revealed that the fire broke out at the chemical godown but the cause is being ascertained,” Chandgude said. Sahani had taken the godown on rent from the land owner, Raju Gaikwad. “Due to lockdown, the godown was shut for many days. About two months ago, Sahani had started operating it again. He and his cousin used to manage it and used to visit the godown once or twice a week,” Vijay Gaikwad, the land owner’s brother told TOI. Mahesh Devle, who owns the garage next to the godown, told TOI that the fire broke out around 10.45pm on Saturday. “We were about to shut the garage when we heard commotion outside and also an explosion. When we came out we saw the fire at the godown,” Devle said. Devle and his colleagues first shifted three cars from the garage. “While shifting the vehicles, we saw two men coming out of the garage. One of them was completely charred. One of the local residents took a vehicle from our garage and shifted the duo to the hospital,” Devle said. He said that the fire also spread to the garage. “The paint booth, which is the costliest unit in our garage, was completely damaged in the fire. Two buses belonging to the landlord, which were parked outside the garage, were damaged by the fire too. This is why the fire tenders could not reach till the garage,” Devle said. Devendra Potphode, chief officer of the PMRDA fire brigade told TOI, “Our two tenders were sent to the spot to douse the fire. With the help of a locals, our men shifted around eight vehicles parked in front the godown.” Gajanan Pathrudkar, fire officer from the Pune fire brigade, told TOI, “We had to use foam to douse the fire as it was a type of liquid fire. There were over 15 barrels filled with chemicals. A few of the tin barrels exploded as gas had accumulated inside them due to the heat, while the plastic barrels melted,” Pathrudkar said. Due to the fire and extreme heat, it was not possible for the firemen to reach inside the godown. “We somehow managed to shift a few chemical barrels. After initial cooling, we used an earth moving machine to to break the melted structure of the godown and douse the fire. It took us around two hours to completely douse the fire,” Pathrudkar said. He said that the structure of the godown was not suitable for storing the chemicals in large quantity. “There was no fire fighting system installed in the godown,” Pathrudkar said, adding, “To store such a large quantity of chemicals, there must be a concrete structure with proper drainage system so that the chemical which spilled on the floor while shifting can drain out,” Pathrudkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-killed-in-chemical-godown-fire-near-warje/articleshow/85161898.cms||Mihir Tanksale

GPSC chairman Jose Manual Noronha said the successful candidates will now have to answer the main computer-based recruitment test (CBRT) followed by a written exam and an interview. Around 3,000 applications were received for the 15 positions advertised. As in the last pre-screening exam, this time too, 60% of the successful candidates were engineers while the other 40% belonged to the faculties of humanities, commerce science, medicine, dentistry, architecture, law and pharmacy. Noronha said that at the earlier JSO pre-screening exam, a similar number of candidates had attempted the examination of which 101 were successful. The current figure shows a marked improvement in the performance of candidates. The syllabus for the main CBRT comprises Indian history, environment and ecology, governance, innovation, geography, logical reasoning and analytical ability and English. The 75-mark examination consists of multiple choice type questions which must be completed within 75 minutes. “There is no negative marking at these exams and every right answer is assigned one mark and a wrong answer zero marks. The results are declared when the examination ends and each candidate can see his/her score on the computer screen,” Noronha said This is the commission’s fifth attempt at selecting candidates for JSO positions. In the earlier attempts the commission could select one, two, six and seven candidates at the first, second , third and fourth attempts respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/docs-engineers-among-230-vying-for-junior-officer-posts/articleshow/85163051.cms||Murari Shetye

It expressed its disapproval over the undemocratic manner in which the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021, was passed and stated that it has created confusion between persons of Goan origin, referred to as Bhumiputra, against the issue of domicile. “A mere thirty years of residence cannot grant the status of Goan origin to any person. The passing of the Bill created needless tensions between locals and migrants,” president of the Goa unit, Ranjan Solomon stated. He said that the bill does not make any distinction between an encroacher or a rent-paying tenant and/or residing in a house under an agreement. “Even a person who is ordered to be evicted by a court of law in force could claim protection. It is clearly an assault on the citizens’ right to property. The law was so shoddily drafted that any person occupying a structure in April 2019 with house tax, water and electricity connection that does not even stand in that person’s name can claim ownership,” he stated. Referring to a 2016 law brought in to regularise unauthorised structures just before the 2017 assembly elections, Solomon said only the influential few may have benefited from the law that too was used as part of an election strategy. NCHRO stated that a law must emerge as a result of discussion and debate at societal level so that the law gets public sanctity. “Law cannot be reduced to an instrument of sheer electioneering,” the confederation stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/have-housing-for-poor-dont-legalise-illegal-structures/articleshow/85163176.cms||---

---||India||Oppn may use 'OBC bill' to seek 50% quota cap removal||NEW DELHI: The opposition may use the 127th constitutional amendment bill in Parliament, intended to restore power of states to maintain "state list" of OBCs, to demand that the government make a provision to remove the 50% cap on reservations. While the removal of 50% cap on quota is an old demand of OBC outfits, there is an indication that even Congress may join the bandwagon as part of the 127th amendment bill. The convergence of views emerged as part of a discussion held between Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, Congress and NCP leaders on Sunday night. The bill seeks to undo the May 5 Supreme Court judgement, which was delivered in the Maratha quota issue where the quota provision was rejected because of the 50% cap that it breached. The Modi government is set to introduce the 127th amendment bill in Lok Sabha on Monday and it will come up for discussion in the two Houses during the week. As the opposition is demanding that a discussion on Pegasus be held before any other agenda, a meeting of floor leaders of opposition parties called by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge will take a final call on whether to join the debate on OBC bill and make a break in the blockade of Parliament. There is a view in the opposition that they can join the debate as it's their issue, while pushing for their agenda of 50%, thereby holding the blockade temporarily. The demand for 50% cap waiver is an issue the BJP government will have to negotiate. The discussion between Maharashtra parties and Congress showed "that there was little benefit in restoring the power of states to identify state list of OBCs if the cap on reservation stayed". It was said that 27 states have pending issues of reservation hampered by the 50% ceiling. While the opposition parties, which comprises many regional outfits, are for the bill, it is also seen as a government ploy to break the blockade over Pegasus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oppn-may-use-obc-bill-to-seek-50-quota-cap-removal/articleshow/85166723.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The lawyer filed an FIR with the Deccan Gymkhana police on Saturday. Inspector Sanjay Mogle told TOI that on June 9, the woman received a call from an unknown person, who posed as an executive of her mobile operator’s customer care. “The man told her that the company would soon stop services of her SIM card and told her to update it,” Mogle said. The man told her that to complete the process she would have to transfer Re1 to his bank account via NEFT. The woman transferred the amount. “The man then took her bank details from her and siphoned Rs5.5 lakh from her account,” the inspector said. A case has been registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Information and Technology (IT) Act. Baner man loses Rs 5.7L Cybercrooks duped a 46-year-old man from Baner of Rs5.7 lakh on the promise of helping him get a dealership of a renowned cosmetics and Ayurvedic products company. The incident occurred between October 2020 and November 2020. The man filed an FIR with the Chatushrungi police on August 7, 2021. An officer from the Chatushrungi police told TOI that an unknown caller, who posed as a chief executive officer (CEO), offered the dealership to the complainant and his brother. “The caller told them to transfer amounts under the pretext of advance, registration charges and some other charges. The complainant and his brother transferred the amounts to the bank accounts in Punjab and Assam,” the officer said. He said that when they did not get the dealership of the company, the man filed a complaint with the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lawyer-duped-of-rs-5-5-lakh-over-sim-card-update/articleshow/85162520.cms||---
---||Goa||Dhangars community in Goa await inclusion in scheduled tribes category||MARGAO: Even as World Tribal Day is celebrated on Monday, the dhangar community in Goa awaits its inclusion in the scheduled tribes (ST) category. Chief minister Pramod Sawant along with deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar had met Union home minister Amit Shah and tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda last month to discuss the inclusion of Goa’s dhangar community in the ST category. The dhangar community has accused successive governments of paying lip service to their cause, and also charged them of using the community as their vote banks. Sources said that both Shah and Munda assured the state government that necessary steps would be taken in that regard. The Registrar General of India (RGI) had raised several queries over the proposal and refused to accept the case of dhangars as a distinct tribal community, a primary criterion for inclusion into the ST. “The state government has submitted a 500-page research report about the tribes to support the proposal of including the dhangars in the ST category. Information with regards to the explanation sought by the RGI is contained in the report, which may have been overlooked by the officials,” a senior official aware of the development told TOI. In June 1999, the government had approved modalities for deciding cases for inclusion, exclusion and other modifications in the list of SCs and STs. Indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness were the criteria adopted for determining tribal character of a community. The dhangars of Goa, who are also called as Goulys, had fought alongside the gaudas, kunbis and velips to demand their inclusion into the ST category, in what came to be known as the GAKUVED movement. After a protracted battle, the gauda, kunbi and velip communities were accorded constitutional status as notified tribes in 2003, but the dhangars have since been left out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dhangars-await-inclusion-in-scheduled-tribes-category/articleshow/85163364.cms||---

A court granted each of the 12 party members bail on a bond of Rs 50,000. Banerjee questioned the “selective detention” of TMC workers under pandemic laws, even as no action was taken against protesting BJP workers. While leaving, he also addressed Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb: “Mark my words. You can keep trying but will fall short. We know how to defeat the BJP.” Trinamool would stage a dharna on the issue at the foot of the Gandhi statue at the Parliament complex on Monday against BJP and police atrocities on TMC workers and BJP misrule in Tripura, Banerjee said. Banerjee added that he would fly the three TMC functionaries, injured in at attack on Saturday (youth leaders Debangshu Bhattacharya, Jaya Dutta, and Sudip Raha) to Kolkata for treatment late on Sunday, since “no medical help was extended to them for nearly 24 hours.” Deb did not respond directly to Banerjee, but sent off multiple tweets. “Some parties who are trying to be active in Tripura lag the state in development indexes”, read one; in another, Deb said, “Some are conspiring to halt development in Tripura to give shape to their political interests. But alert people in Tripura will never allow this to succeed.” In the first incident, stones were hurled at vehicles carrying Banerjee, Bengal education minister Bratya Basu, Rajya Sabha MP Dola Sen and party functionary Kunal Ghosh as they were headed to Khowai district court, where Tripura Trinamool leader Subal Bhowmik had moved a bail petition for the release of 12 TMC leaders. Bhowmik and some others sustained minor injuries but Banerjee and the other leaders, who had flown in from Kolkata in the morning, were unhurt. Stones were again thrown when the TMC group, including Banerjee, stepped out of the police station in the evening. Three of the vehicles were said to be damaged. “The TMC leaders were detained for violation of Covid curfew and as per law, they were forwarded to court. They have got bail,” said additional SP Rajib Sengupta. The bail hearings, however, was preceded by an eight-hour dharna by the Trinamool functionaries at the police station, in which they repeatedly questioned the “selective arrests”. As the team remained inside the police station, hundreds of BJP workers raised “go back” slogans and showed black flags to the TMC team. BJP leaders, both in Tripura and Bengal, dismissed all allegations of attack and arrest of TMC functionaries. Tripura BJP president Manik Saha denied allegations of his party’s involvement, saying it was a “spontaneous reaction of the people who do not like Mamata Banerjee.” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “I don’t think anybody is even bothered about the TMC in Tripura.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/abhishek-attacked-in-tripura-leads-dharna/articleshow/85165079.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||CPM to hoist Tricolour 74 yrs after ‘ye azadi jhoota hai’ days||Kolkata: CPM will unfurl the Tricolour at the state headquarters at Alimuddin Street on Independence Day on August 15, taking the over-seven-decade communist journey from the ‘ye azadi jhoota hai’ days of 1948 to a full circle in 2021. The proposal to hoist the national flag at party offices was adopted in the three-day virtual meeting of the CPM central committee that ended on Sunday to emphasize the point that the Left, unlike the BJP, had a glorious role in the freedom struggle. “The national flag has been hoisted earlier by Left mass organizations. We have issued a circular this time urging party units to hoist the national flag to mark the 75th anniversary of our independence,” said CPM leader Rabin Deb. The party will firm up its future programmes at the Party Congress to be held in Kerala in April 2022. “Communists had a glorious role in the freedom struggle. But there is a concerted campaign against the role of the Left in the country’s freedom struggle. What the communists said was India won political independence but the people didn’t attain economic independence,” said CPM central committee member Sujan Chakraborty. Chakraborty left it to the CPM CC to announce the national flag hoisting programme on Independence Day. The undivided CPI, under the leadership of BT Ranadive, had reached the ‘ye azadi jhoota hai’ formulation that was later discarded as a “Left adventurist” line. Jyoti Basu, a CPI politburo member who later joined CPM after the split in 1964, held that India won political independence but had to go a long way to achieve economic independence in a class-divided society. A few years ago, CPM’s youth wing DYFI decided to unfurl the national flag to send out the message that Left youths were no less patriotic than the “fascistic” BJP that is spreading hatred in the name of nationalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cpm-to-hoist-tricolour-74-yrs-after-ye-azadi-jhoota-hai-days/articleshow/85163560.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Vadodara||Gujarat’s first gold medallist javelin thrower lives in obscurity||VADODARA: India is celebrating Neeraj Chopra and his golden spear, which scripted history for the country in javelin throwing at Tokyo Olympics on Saturday. But sadly, the country has forgotten all about another golden spear that dominated track athletics at both national and international-level games around four decades ago. Today, that spear-holder, Gujarati athlete from Vadodara, Razia Sheikh, is living an obscure life, fighting an existential battle to meet her daily needs. “I was in tears when I heard that Chopra won a gold in javelin throwing – a sport that is so close to my heart,” said 62-year-old Sheikh, who was the first woman from India to cross the 50-metre barrier in javelin throwing in 1987 South Asian Federation Games. Her performance in national javelin throwing tournaments too was stunning. Sheikh, who now survives on railways pension, told TOI, that it is heartening to see all the appreciation and cash awards he (Chopra) is getting and I hope this inspires many more youngsters to take up athletics professionally. “The Haryana government is extending him all the support too. Sadly, our state government doesn’t recognize its sporting heroes much,” she said. Sheikh said that she had been given the Sardar Patel award, but didn’t get much support beyond it. Ideally, the government should not just look after its sportspersons but also engage veterans to prepare the next generation of athletes, said Sheikh, who nurtured hopes of becoming a sportsperson since childhood despite her humble origins. “In 1979, I participated in my first national javelin throwing tournament and won a silver medal. I didn’t look back then,” said the veteran athlete who went on to win 25 gold medals and 12 silver medals in national tournaments. Sheikh started playing cricket at YSC club at the age of 15 and used to be a dreaded fast bowler on field. But after she was kept as an extra player in the Gujarat team in 1978, Sheikh started exploring athletics and carved a niche in track athletics. In 1982, Sheikh played her first international tournament at Asian Games in Delhi. “I won my first gold in the 1987 South Asian Games in Kolkata and became the first Indian woman to cross the 50-metre barrier,” recalled the feisty player. Sheikh broke a 19-year-old national record of Indian female javelin thrower at the Playmakers Athletics Meet in Delhi in 1986. She won nine medals including two golds in international games. “I was offered a job by the railways but I quit in 2003 due to work politics. I had to make my ends meet so I started doing part time jobs in schools but life was tough for several years before my pension amount increased,” she added. “It’s unfortunate that medal-winning sportspersons don’t get their due in our country. I hope the performance of our athletes in the Tokyo Olympics brings a positive change in people’s attitude towards sportspersons,” she added.

Biswas immediately coordinated with NDRF to rescue the woman and arranged for her admission to hospital. NDRF inspector Jyotirmoy Das, who led the operation, said: “We reached the village after receiving the message from the SDO and rescued the woman and her husband.” “Later, a 72-year-old lady, who was suffering unbearable pain because a tumour in her abdomen, was also rescued by an NDRF team led by commander inspector Kanishka Pangti,” he added. The two successful rescue operations have spread goodwill about the seamless coordination between the district administration and the central rescue team on the eve of CM Mamata Banerjee’s visit on Tuesday. She will go to some of the worst-hit areas in Ghatal by boat. The flood situation in Howrah, Hooghly and East Burdwan has slowly started improving. In Howrah, people have started returning home from shelters. A part of Udaynarayanpur, however, still remains flooded. In Hooghly district, the situation is improving in block I of Khanakul but four villages of Khanakul block II are still under water. The Hooghly district administration said 8,000 people are staying at 60 shelters. Incessant rain from Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning led to a significant rise in the Gandheswari and Dwarakeswar rivers in Bankura. In Murshidabad, the swelling river started causing erosion at Sridharpur village under Sekendra gram panchayat.

Health department data shows that nearly 1.3 lakh HCWs and over 1 lakh FLWs are in this category. Vaccination for healthcare workers began on February 8 in Karnataka. While over 9 lakh HCWs were registered, 5.5 lakh have got both doses, and nearly 2.5 lakh are partially vaccinated. Over 10.2 lakh FLWs are enrolled, of which 5.7 lakh have got only one dose and 3.4 lakh are fully vaccinated. This category was prioritised when vaccination was rolled out across the country. The objective was to complete inoculating them first before the general public. Data shows this has not been achieved even after six months. ‘Many jabbed, data not updated’In Bengaluru, 54,031 HCWs are yet to get even one dose but the data may be flawed, said Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association. “Several doctors work in multiple hospitals as consultants. Their names have been repeated and that inflates th number of workers,” said Dr HM Prasanna, president, PHANA. Some HCWs have deliberately avoided vaccination, he admitted. “Some HCWs, who hadn’t taken the vaccine when it was launched in January 2021, got infected during the peak in April and May. They have to complete three months from the time of infection to get the jab and may take it in August or September,” he added. Health department authorities claim the issue is not about vaccine hesitancy but data. “There are concerns about data inconsistency and it’s being reconciled,” said Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka. “Many FCWs workers have already received the second dose, but it’s not reflected in data. That could be a reason for higher number of first dose and partial vaccination categories,” said Dr Chandrashekar. She added that many HCWs and FLWs missed the jabs in January and February and took the first dose in April and May. Multiple hospitals said over 95% of staffers have been vaccinated, with stray cases of doctors choosing not to get jabbed. During the recent post-graduate medical course exams, an external examiner in a city-based private college was found unvaccinated. “He is a senior surgeon. Vaccination is a must for all those taking part in the examination process,” said sources. According to Dr BK Vijendra, chief health officer, BBMP, data doesn’t reflect the total number of beneficiaries as many haven’t downloaded certificates. Officers said those who passed out from nursing colleges in 2020 were added to the list and his resulted in higher numbers. “Some non-allopathic doctors and medicos showed reluctance. If Ayush medical college faculty have reservations about vaccination, students follow suit,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/6-months-on-ktaka-yet-to-fully-jab-healthcare-and-frontline-staff/articleshow/85169033.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Guwahati||Trucks start moving from Assam to Mizoram||SILCHAR: Movement of trucks carrying supplies from Assam to Mizoram resumed late on Saturday after two Assam ministers convinced local protesters to let them pass, ending the unofficial economic blockade since the July 26 border firing that had left the hill state battling a shortage of essentials. While movement of trucks via NH-306 from Assam's Cachar district resumed first after 13 days, vehicles started to move through NH-6 to Mizoram on Sunday night. Minister Ashok Singhal, who was part of the first round of conciliatory talks in Aizawl, said trucks started moving following the Mizoram government's assurance that they would institute an inquiry into the firing in which six Assam cops were killed and scores injured. Protesters in the Barak Valley had vandalised 12 trucks at Lailapur on Saturday just as they started moving towards Mizoram. They agreed to end the blockade after Singhal and his colleague Parimal Suklabaidya intervened. Suklabaidya on Sunday said that there had been no encroachment on Assam's territory by Mizoram since the BJP-led government took over the reins in 2016. "The border dispute with Mizoram has been going on since 1982 because of no clear-cut demarcation of the boundary."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/after-13-days-trucks-move-from-assam-into-mizoram/articleshow/85166759.cms||BB Goswami
---||India||SC questions state buses' insurance waiver||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has asked the Union government to consider withdrawing the exemption from insurance to 1.5 lakh buses owned by state road transport corporations (SRTCs), steeped in heavy losses, as it found victims and injured in accidents involving these buses are made to wait for years to get compensation from government-run corporations. This was one of the major issues before a bench of Justices Sanjay K Kaul and Justice Hrishikesh Roy, which for the last six months is engaged in streamlining the process for speedy disbursal of compensation to victims or injured by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACTs). The bench has entrusted additional solicitor general Jayant Sud with the task of analysing the difficulties, devising innovative solutions in coordination/consultation with the states and appraising the court for issuance of directions for all-India implementation. During a hearing on the issue last week, Justice Kaul-led bench said, "The vehicles of the State Transport Corporations are not insured because of exemption provided and, as a result thereof, compensation is not paid for long period of time as most of these corporations are running in losses". It is reported by the Union ministry of transport and highways that 49 of the 56 SRTUs suffered losses. Top five loss-making SRTUs during 2016-17 were - Delhi Transport Corporation (Rs 3,832 crore); Kerala SRTC (Rs 1,771 crore); BEST Undertaking (Rs 990 crore); Telangana SRTC (Rs 749 crore) and Haryana ST (Rs 598 crore). These five together accounted for about 69% of the total losses by SRTUs. . The bench said, "In fact, there are numerous illustrations where the vehicles had to be attached for coercive recovery from the SRTUs to make payment to the claimants". The SC again fell back on the ASG to "examine the possibility of either withdrawing the exemption (from insurance for SRTUs buses) or for (devising) a mechanism to ensure that sufficient fund pool is available with these corporations for meeting their liabilities (in motor accidents involving SRTUs buses) towards claimants. Sud informed the court that efforts to streamline the process for speedy payment of compensation to the kin of accident victims or injured through development of a mobile application gained sufficient traction as he has been able to bring on board all 26 insurance companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-questions-state-buses-insurance-waiver/articleshow/85166806.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: With campuses closed, popularity of online-only schools skyrockets||BENGALURU: With the pandemic disrupting functioning of schools for the second year in a row, many parents are considering the option of online-only schooling for their children, especially those in the lower grades. Educationists say many online-only schools — earlier limited to home-schoolers — have mushroomed and their popularity is growing among parents. However, these schools are not affiliated to any board. “Parents are interested in online-only schools primarily because fees are significantly lower than that charged by regular schools. I know many parents who opted for online only schools and many of them are happy,” said Shwetha Saran, co-administrator of Bangalore Schools, a social media group that has nearly 50,000 parents. 21K School, an online-only school that launched in June 2020, said enrolments shot up eight times this academic year. They now have over 2,500 students and the management expects student strength to increase to 15,000 in subsequent years. “Parents want transparency in education,” said Yeshwanth Raj Parasmal, director and co-founder, 21K School. “A quarter of our students used to go to a school that charged annual fees of over Rs 1 lakh. Many parents say online-only schools are affordable and offer the same facilities and a better education. A few may go back when schools reopen, but we think most others will stay on.” He said parents in smaller towns prefer online-only schools for a different reason – poor quality of schoolteachers. “Online schools give them the opportunity to study with their peers from various parts of the country with better teachers,” he said. Class of One is another online school for primary grades that began operations in July 2020. It already has 100 students, in the age group 3-12 years, on its rolls. Headquartered in Noida, most of Class of One students are from Bengaluru. “Bengaluru is tech savvy and people are educated and more open to the concept. People are looking for affordable options and superior quality,” said Nidhi Sabarwal, head, marketing and admissions, Class of One. Most students in the 4-8 years age group. “We thought of this idea last year, but it took us a while to work on it and sort out some glitches before launch,” she said. 3E Home school, a school away from school, launched last month and now has 18 students. Founder Latha Murthy, a former principal, said they conducted a survey before launch and found parents were frustrated with online classes in regular schools. “Parents realised teachers are not trained and there is no difference between classwork and homework,” Latha said. “In Karnataka, fees are another major issue. So, we decided to start an online school that would offer everything that a normal school would.” Many online schools have a sizeable number of Indian students abroad. “Parents feel it might be easier for them to adjust to Indian curriculum when they return,” said Parasmal of 21K School. Sheela Anagolum, an educationist and home-schooling expert, said her two social media groups have seen an increase in members from 1,000 to nearly 10,000 in a span of a few months. “To bridge the gap between face-to-face and online learning experiences, online schools need to adopt best practices of online instruction, manage teacher attrition and create online ecosystems that foster a sense of belonging and help students thrive,” Sheela said. D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka, believes most students would return to regular schools once regular classes resume. “Children who are home-schooled or are part of online schools can be accommodated in age- appropriate classes when they move to a regular school,” Kumar said. “But they will have disadvantages in the future like not getting a domicile quota. We have recommended to the government to account for homeschooled children so as to avoid misuse of the online system for social evils like child labour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-with-campuses-closed-popularity-of-online-only-schools-skyrockets/articleshow/85166801.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: In Chikkamagaluru, locals block tourists’ vehicles||BENGALURU: Locals in Chikkamagaluru city on Sunday blocked vehicles of tourists headed to Mullayanagiri, the highest peak in Karnataka, over fears the influx of people would lead to Covid-19 infections spreading in the area. Locals were also upset with the Chikkamagaluru district administration for allowing unbridled access to tourist spots in the district. Nearly 200 vehicles were held up at the spot following a snap protest and it threw traffic out of gear in the area. Although tourists pleaded with protesters to allow them to pass, residents refused to budge and continued to block traffic. Eventually, Chikkamagaluru police rushed to the spot and pacified protesters. Visitors, most of whom were from Bengaluru, had to wait for hours and eventually returned without visiting the peak. Protesters demanded that the authorities regulate the flow of travellers and make it mandatory that they furnish Covid negative reports in order to enter the district. While the daily number of positive cases has reduced in the state, it continues to be high in the Malnad district and this has locals worried. As soon as residents took out a protest at Kaimara Circle in the town, Youth Congress workers joined in and supported the protest against tourists in the greenrich district. KN Ramesh, district deputy commissioner, said the district administration will frame rules to restrict tourists in the coming days. He said they will set up a special task force to keep track of tourist flow, but he refused to comment on the demand of locals that visitors produce Covid negative reports at checkposts. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Shivamogga district, authorities continued to face a tough time to regulate visitors to Jog Falls. The district administration had made it mandatory for those visiting the falls to furnish Covid-19 negative reports. The Jog Management Authority has set up three layers of security to manage the rush. Srinivas, director of Jog Management Authority, said they have set up a checkpost to screen tourists and to check for Covid negative reports. He said it has helped prevent crowding at the falls. He said although high, the crowd was smaller on Sunday compared to previous weekends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-in-chikkamagaluru-locals-block-tourists-vehicles/articleshow/85166807.cms||R Uday Kumar
---||Amritsar||Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee elections to be held on August 22||AMRITSAR/JALANDHAR: Polling for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) will take place on August 22. The Delhi gurdwara elections director announced it on Sunday through a public notice. Counting will take place on August 25, and the election process will be completed by August 31. The process for DSGMC elections was on when the second wave of Covid-19 started. On April 23, just two days before the polling, the Delhi lieutenant governor had issued a notification to defer the election. The process of filing nominations had already been completed in April last and candidates were campaigning, mainly through social media. For the last few days, candidates of different parties have already been campaigning as they expected that the election process could be resumed anytime. It is expected to be a three-cornered contest among Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), former DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK-led Jag Aasra Guru Ott (Jago) and Paramjit Singh Sarna-led Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi), who also has alliance with former Akal Takht jathedar Bhai Ranjit Singh-led Panthic Akali Lehar. Only SAD (Badal) is contesting on all the 46 seats while GK’s party is contesting from 41, Sarna’s from 35 and his ally Bhai Ranjit Singh’s group’s from eight seats. Though efforts were made by some quarters to come to some sort of arrangement between Manjit Singh GK and Sarna, it could not be worked out. Leaders of all the groups are in full campaigning mode both offline and online. The results of DSGMC election may also have some impact on perception battle in Punjab, especially for SAD (Badal) as just six months are left for elections in Punjab. DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa has been highlighting various tasks during his tenure, especially during second Covid wave. Earlier he was highlighting the support extended to farm movement and especially the help extended in getting bails to the farmers who was arrested after January 26 incident when farmers had reached Red Fort and a Sikh flag was hoisted there. However, his opponents are highlighting issuance of Look Out Circular (LOC) against Sirsa to stop him from flying abroad in connection with a case of misappropriation by DSGMC office bearers when he was general secretary of the Sikh body. Though election was suspended, the parties and candidates could not really come out of election-mode and they continued attacking the rivals or rushing to the places where they could get some credit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/dsgmc-elections-to-be-held-on-aug-22/articleshow/85163895.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||SAD draws caste card, fields SC candidate from general seat||Jalandhar: By announcing Punjab Safai Mazdoor Federation president Chandan Grewal as a candidate from Jalandhar Central constituency, whose name figured in the list of 12 candidates announced on Sunday, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has made the unusual move of having a scheduled caste (SC) candidate from a general seat. Grewal, who belongs to the Balmiki community, was AAP candidate from Kartarpur assembly seat in the 2017 elections. At a time there is a lot of focus on Dalit votes, the party has — with Grewal’s candidature from a general seat — made a move expected to impact Balmiki voters at other seats too. The party has also sought to strike a balance as SC voters don’t make a homogenous mass. Mazhabi Sikhs/Balmikis and Ravidasia/Adi-dharmi are two biggest SC communities in Punjab. Even as Bahujan Samaj Party claims to be a party of Dalits, it has a support base only in the Ravidasia/Adi-dharmi community. In Doaba region, Ravidasia/Adi-dharmi community dominates among SCs. In the present arrangement between SAD and BSP, all eight reserved seats would go to leaders from this community. SAD already has three MLAs from the community, while BSP has also announced one candidate from the same community. For the remaining three also, the alliance would go for candidates from this caste. However, Mazhabi Sikhs and Balmikis too have reasonable presence in some pockets which have the potential to tilt balance. Out of five SC MLAs of Congress from Doaba region, one is from Mazhabi Sikh community and one from Balmiki community. In 2017 elections also, SAD fielded advocate Paramjit Singh, a Mazhabi Sikh, from Kapurthala, a general constituency. In 2019 parliamentary elections, SAD, which was then in an alliance with BJP, fielded former Lok Sabha deputy speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal, also a Mazhabi Sikh, and it turned out to be a very tough competition for Congress. After contesting on an AAP ticket from Kartarpur, Grewal had resigned. In 2019, he was set to join Congress and had even met chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on April 13, 2019. In a press note issued at the time, Congress had claimed that Grewal had joined the party, but he had later clarified that he had only called on the CM and would join the party later in a separate function. However, some time later, he joined Akali Dal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-draws-caste-card-fields-sc-candidate-from-general-seat/articleshow/85163972.cms||IP Singh

The minister said it had been decided to refer the case to the vigilance department for investigation. He added to prevent such cases in future, a committee of departmental officers had been constituted and directed to submit their report within three weeks. Ashu said the department of food and supplies had deputed the central vigilance committee (CVC) from head office to undertake a special physical verification of Pungrain wheat stocks at Jandiala Guru in Amritsar, after it came to notice that the inspector concerned, Jasdev Singh, was absconding. He said CVC constituted various teams to verify wheat stocks in godowns and plinths of Pungrain at Jandiala Guru. As per the preliminary report, 1.84 lakh bags (50 kg jute and 30 kg polypropylene) pertaining to crop year 2018-19, 2020-21 and 2021-22 had been found to be short and their cost came to approximately Rs 20 crore. Ashu said that he had ordered departmental proceedings for major penalties against all staff responsible for the shortage of wheat stock. District food and supply officer Amarinder Singh and assistant food and supply officer Arshdeep Singh at Jandiala Guru have been placed under suspension and departmental proceedings, including issuance of charge sheet, has been ordered. The departmental proceedings have also been initiated against Amritsar district food and supply controller Raj Rishi Mehra and his predecessor Jasjit Kaur for supervisory lapse, and charge sheets are to be issued to both the officers. Also, FIR has been registered against the inspector at Jandiala police station on August 6, he added. The minister said the CVC, in its preliminary report, apprehended that there might be bogus purchase of wheat and embezzlement of wheat distributed under the National Food Security Act (NFSA)-2013/ Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana(PMGKY). In this regard, CVC has been directed to undertake thorough enquiry of the matter and verify the central pool wheat stocks of Rabi Marketing Season(RMS) 2018-19 onwards and also report regarding distribution of wheat under NFSA-2013/ PMGKY.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-20cr-wheat-missing-minister-says-will-refer-case-to-vigilance-dept/articleshow/85164050.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||As power demand rises to 11k MW, snags at 2 plants||Patiala: A unit each of Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL), Mansa, and GVK Thermal Power Plant, Goindwal Sahib, were shutdown on Sunday due to a technical fault, even as power demand in the state rose to 11,000 MW. At both private plants, only a single unit was operational. Sources said two units of the state-run power plant at Ropar and three units of the government thermal station at Lehra were operational during the day. In-house generation capacity of the state, including thermal and hydro, was around 4,000 MW, while around 7,000 MW demand was met from outside sources. The state government has already ordered cancellation of it power purchase agreement with TSPL as it failed to meet the power requirements of the state during the peak paddy season. One Of TSPL’s three units was shut down in March this year, while another got shut down during the peak season when the state was facing a power crisis. A large number of farmers had also protested against the state government and gheraoed PSPCL’s power grids following shortage of power supply to the agriculture fields despite the state government promise to provide uninterrupted power supply. A spokesperson at GVK said a unit was shut on Saturday night after a problem in the boiler, but it will soon be rectified. There were power cuts across the state. A resident of Mohali said, “We faced a power cut for over five hours on Sunday. The complaint numbers provided on the website are also not working, while the official 1912 complaint number remains busy.” On Sunday, around 21,978 complaints were registered in the state. Of these, 16,786 had been resolved till 7pm. Staff restart stir PSPCL employees have started a protest again over pending demands, including the constitution of a Wage formulation committee (WFC). These employees had announced to keep their mobiles switched off during working hours and exited WhatsApp groups later, leading to breakdown of communication. On August 11, these employees would return SIM cards.

This is the third time this week that the single-day tally of UP has crossed 50 though 50 districts reported zero cases. Because of a rise in cases — from 28 on Saturday to 58 on Sunday —and 49 recoveries, the number of active cases went up to 593, from 586 on Saturday. The daily positivity rate of cases, which was 0.01%, also went up again and was recorded at 0.02%. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said: “No death was reported in the state in the past 24 hours and only 58 fresh cases were found. Besides, 50 out of the total 75 districts recorded no case and 10 districts have no active case presently.” “Over 2.5 lakh tests including 1.35 lakh RT PCR tests were conducted in the last 24 hours and 49 people recovered from the disease. The daily positivity is now at 0.02% and the overall positivity is at 2.53%,” he added. Prasad also sounded caution saying that while infection rate is low, the disease has not been eradicated fully yet. “Several states and even countries have restarted getting a high number of daily cases. The US alone is recording 1 lakh cases daily on an average. We need to follow hand hygiene, use masks to cover our mouth and nose and follow physical distance from one another,” he said. On the vaccination front, UP administered over 2.9 lakh doses in the past 24 hours, reaching a cumulative of over 5.35 crore of its population vaccinated so far. “On Saturday and Sunday, we focus on routine immunization of children, which is also very important and protects children from diseases such as measles, hepatitis, rubella, diphtheria and others,” Prasad said.

To meet the safety norms of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation DGCA), it should have 40 metre space on both sides of the centre line of the runway but has less on the right side. Also, it has suffered damage due to floods in the Beas, which flows next to the airport. The inspection committee of the airport has now written to the Himachal Pradesh chief minister to arrange for land to make the airport safe and secure. Kullu-Manali Airport advisory committee member Budhi Parkash said he submitted a letter to the chief minister on Saturday, to speed up the land acquisition process so that the Bhuntar airport could meet minimum safety standards. “The airport is the backbone of tourism and prosperity of the place. This airport has some small technical problems related to its expansion and widening. The safety area towards the Beas at both ends of the runway does not meet the norms of DGCA. I have requested the chief minister to direct the department concerned for immediate action,” he said. The airport authority has been trying to acquire land for airport expansion but procedural issues related to land acquisition have come in the way. An official said that land next to the airport belongs to the forest department and can be acquired only after completing the procedure under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Now, the state tourism department has been involved in this process. Officials of the tourism department had recently met the Kullu airport director to discuss the land transfer process and asked the airport authority to complete the process in a way that they have to pay only the cost of compensatory afforestation and consultant charges. However, they were informed by the director that the Airport Authority of India does not bear land acquisition charges but will spend on development of land after it is transferred in its (AAI) name. The airport has just 1,087m long runway and is not capable of handling large or mid-size planes. Planes land and take off with load penalty to avoid collision with Larji hills and have to land at first attempt, failing which they can collide with the Bijli Mahadev temple and nearby hills. Only one plane lands at the airport in a day and the fare is extremely high, which makes it is out of reach of ordinary people and only high end tourists or people in emergency use it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/kullu-manali-airports-bid-to-meet-safety-norms-stuck/articleshow/85166902.cms||Suresh Sharma

Tomar, who reached Sheopur to assess flood situation on Saturday was forced to leave by slogan shouting mob. When Tomar visited Sheopur’s Karatia Bazaar, which falls under Morena Lok Sabha constituency, people raised slogans accusing him of delayed response to the crisis and mismanagement in relief. Some of them hurled mud and stones at the vehicles in the minister’s convoy. The ‘protest’ video had gone viral on social media. Residents in Sheopur town are complaining that there was a delay in alerting them about the floods, adding, that failure of district administration in taking timely action led to massive damage to their properties. Subsequently, Sheopur district collector Rakesh Srivastava was shifted as the deputy secretary in the state secretariat in Bhopal. He has been replaced by Shivam Verma, who is currently the commissioner of the Gwalior Municipal Corporation. Sheopur SP shifted to PHQIn a separate order from the home department, Sheopur’s superintendent of police (SP), Sampat Upadhyaya, was shifted to the police headquarters in Bhopal as assistant inspector general (AIG).

The farmers will end the sansad on Monday evening after passing the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government and also moving a fresh resolution for a law on minimum support price making it mandatory to purchase all the commodities of all farmers on MSP. Initially it was planned that Kisan Sansad will continue till the end of monsoon session of Parliament on August 13, but going by the restrictions to be imposed by Delhi Police in the area ahead of Independence Day celebrations, the morcha decided to end it on August 9, said farmer leader Buta Singh Burjgill, who presided over a meeting where the decision was taken in this regard. Sources said all the farm groups were not on the same page on this issue and some wanted to continue as per the initial plan, but later relented after recording their reservations. The decision was taken without any heated exchange, they added. Burjgill said the motive for which the Kisan Sansad was called has been achieved as farmers held discussions for 78 hours in 12 sittings of the sansad, which attracted attention of masses not only in the country but in many other countries too. Likewise, the ‘peoples’ whip’ issued to MPs too worked well as members acted as per the whip except for the day when Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu had assumed office. Going by all this, farmers decided to end the ‘sansad’ on Monday to prepare for tractor marches at tehsil and district headquarters on Independence Day across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/kisan-sansad-cut-short-to-end-today/articleshow/85166949.cms||Neel Kamal

"Public market investors want to come into private markets now," Udaan co-founder Vaibhav Gupta told during an interaction. Budget hotels startup Oyo too recently closed a $660-million debt financing round aiming to use the capital to reduce a part of its existing debt and bolster its tech capabilities. Gupta said that some investors are looking to invest ahead of the company's listing as they believe that they may have to pay a lower premium. "The fundraising tools have become more sophisticated. When you can raise debt at a cheaper rate, why dilute? You need to be watchful," he said. Bengaluru-headquartered Udaan, which competes with brick-and-mortar wholesale retailers such as Metro Cash and Carry and Reliance as well as online players such as Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, sells goods to other businesses, including kirana stores. The average ticket price on the platform currently hovers around the Rs 8,000-mark. "We are looking to increase our sales to around one lakh tonnes every day in five years from the 5,000 tonnes that we are currently doing," said Gupta. Udaan currently has a gross merchandise value (GMV) of around $3 billion. While the company plans to increase the number of users to 3-5 million during the period (in five years), the number of active users is between 0.5-1 million at present. "We are looking to widen our portfolio too and beef up logistics," said Sujeet Kumar, co-founder at Udaan. "While we are currently servicing 12,000 pin codes, which is roughly equivalent to 70-80% of the population, our aim is to expand our food business to 200 cities up from 100." Udaan, founded five years ago by former Flipkart executives, has set itself a lofty goal - grabbing around 10% of India's overall B2B trade in 10 years. E-commerce penetration in the B2B market is pegged at less than 1% of which Udaan claims to have 80% market share. When asked about the draft e-commerce rules that look to rein in online players engaging in anti-competitive activities, Kumar said the policy environment is favourable for B2B players as they provide a boost to small and medium businesses across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/b2b-e-commerce-co-udaan-may-raise-debt-funding/articleshow/85166997.cms||John Sarkar

The accident took place at Nawabganj tehsil of Gonda, barely 65km off the July 28 accident site at Ramsanehi Ghat, where a speeding truck crushed passengers in their sleep. Senior police officials supervising relief operations admitted to TOI that no lessons were learnt from the Barabanki crash. “Buses plying into Uttar Pradesh from other states are not being checked. Highway patrolling too hasn’t resumed.” Last week, transport commissioner, Dheeraj Sahu, had issued guidelines to avert Barabankilike accidents and directed installation of interceptors to check speeding and drunk driving. He also sought deployment of patrol vehicles, ambulances and recovery vans in 40km radius of toll plazas by National Highways Authority of India. Talking to TOI, Tarabganj circle officer Sansar Singh Rathi said, 85 passengers were on board the Bihar-bound private bus, which was coming from Delhi. “Around 8am, when the speeding bus crossed the Saryu bridge and reached Maheshpur village, it collided head-on with a stranded truck near Royal Hotel,” said Rathi. Two passengers perched near the bus door were crushed between the two vehicles and died before they could be extricated from the wreckage. They were identified as Mamam Kumar, 22, of Bihar’s Vaishali district and Shyam Narayan Singh, 40, of Basti district in UP. After the big bang, villagers rushed to the accident site and sent an SOS to police. Passengers trapped in the wrecked bus were rescued and sent to district hospital in Ayodhya. Superintendent of police, Gonda, Santosh Mishra, said, the bus driver has been booked for causing death by negligence and rash driving. “A preliminary probe revealed the driver was drunk and dozed off on the wheel and this triggered the accident,” said Mishra. He also said, the bus which had a registration number of Supaul district, Bihar, would be examined by a RTO technical team. Passengers were given medical aid and another bus was arranged to ferry them to their destination in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/barabanki-crash-re-run-on-killer-nh-28-two-die/articleshow/85167056.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: For boy with genetic disorder, a drug of hope||GURUGRAM: The parents of Ayansh Madan, a 16-month-old boy from Sector 70 who is suffering from a rare genetic disorder, are seeking funds for his treatment, which will cost over Rs 16 crore. Ayansh is the only child with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 in Haryana at present, according to data from Cure SMA Foundation of India, an NGO. SMA is a rare disorder that affects a baby’s muscle control and paralyses movement with age. It can be treated by gene therapy using the drug Zolgensma, which replaces the defective gene with a working copy. The therapy can be given to a child till the age of two, so Ayansh has around eight months before he can’t be treated. His parents, Praveen (43) and Vandana Madan (37), have managed to raise Rs 3.6 crore in five months with the help of crowdfunding and social media. “His condition is deteriorating every day and his spine has bent. We are giving him only liquid food. If he doesn’t get the cure soon, his condition will further deteriorate,” Vandana said. She is a homemaker while her husband is a software engineer. Ayansh is their only child and was born after 12 years of marriage. The couple noticed their child was having issues in movement only after he turned one. After he was diagnosed with SMA, they have been desperately trying to raise money for his cure. SMA is caused by loss of nerve cells that carry electrical signals from the brain to the muscles. Though there are nearly 25 children with SMA in Haryana, they all are above two years and are not eligible for gene therapy. SMA generally affects 1 in 10,000 children globally, and there are nearly 800 such children in India at present. Experts said most of these children die before they even reach their second year of birth. According to Cure SMA, nine babies have succumbed to the rare disease in the country this month, after their families gave up hope of affording the treatment. “A blood test is available to look for deletions or mutations of the SMN1 gene, which causes SMA. This test identifies almost all patients with SMA and may also reveal if a person is a carrier of a defective gene that could be passed on to children,” Dr CS Narayanan, head of the department of neurology at HCMCT Manipal Hospitals, Dwarka, said. He added that prenatal tests like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can be undertaken by pregnant women to diagnose the disease in unborn children. “Steps may be taken before pregnancy to lower the risk of passing on SMA. A drug called Nusinersen stimulates production of SMN1 protein, and another, Zolgensma, replaces the faulty gene,” Narayanan added. Cure SMA said the government should offer relief to children suffering from the genetic disorder. “Kids with SMA don’t live for long without treatment, which is very costly. We are trying to bring more options in India for such children. There is a medicine which can be taken orally by a child, but it can cost up to Rs 72 lakh per year. The government needs to provide some relief to parents by ensuring affordable treatment for such children,” said Archana Panda, director (patient advocacy), Cure SMA. It is a parent-led community initiated in January 2014 by a group of parents of children suffering from SMA. Cure SMA has requested Novartis, the Swiss drugmaker that manufactures Zolgensma, to make the drug available in India. At present, it is sent from the US, and any delays could lead to the expiry of the drug as it has a shelf life of around two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/for-boy-with-genetic-disorder-a-drug-of-hope/articleshow/85163585.cms||Ipsita Pati

The residents blame the RWA for the mess, which they say not only poses health risks but has also been causing severe damage to the environment. A sewage treatment plant (STP) with a capacity of 850 KLD has been installed in the society, however the parameter of its operation is not being monitored regularly, according to the residents. “The untreated water was earlier used for horticulture purposes, which was emanating a foul smell, so when we raised our concern, the RWA started discharging the same outside the society, which is a health hazard,” said Aman Chawla. Other residents claim that their repeated complaints to the authorities concerned have only fallen on deaf ears. “The RWA is discharging the untreated sewage water directly on the road and the green belt due to which water is accumulated on the road creating an unhygienic environment further damaging the road,” Praveen Malik, another resident, said. “The stagnated dirty water is also a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes, which poses serious health risks to the residents living in the society. Despite raising our concern, the RWA is not paying any heed to address them,” he added. However, the RWA has refuted the claims as “baseless”. Hariom Vishwakarma, RWA president of the society, said, “Our STP is functioning properly at full capacity and we are not violating any rules. Phase 1 and 2 of our society are low-rise complexes and due to heavy rains on Monday, water has accumulated that needs to be pumped out. As of now, we are using the treated water for horticulture purposes inside the society and the greenbelt area.” When contacted, Sandeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said, “We have received a complaint from the residents and sought permission for inspection from the headquarters, accordingly action will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/untreated-waste-flowing-into-parks-say-residents/articleshow/85163610.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Commuters suffer as few evening buses to Tiruvallur||CHENNAI: Poor frequency of direct buses to Tiruvallur from CMBT during peak hours has resulted in severe crowding on the buses. Commuters from the neighbouring have complained that there is not a single direct MTC bus for nearly three hours in the evening, putting office-goers in misery. Thousands of private employees, traders and daily wagers from Tiruvallur largely depend on bus number 153A to CMBT to reach workplaces in the city and to head back home. One has to rush from their office to catch the 5.25pm bus from CMBT to Tiruvallur, failing which they have to wait till 8.25pm for the next direct bus home. Raghavendra Bhat, a resident-activist from Tiruvallur, said the services run late in the mornings too. “MTC buses that ply from Tiruvallur have to reach the district from depots in Chennai, so many arrive late. People travelling for work are unable to reach offices on time,” said Bhat. Similarly, there is no direct bus from Poonamallee to Tiruvallur between 7pm and 7.45pm, said K Baskar, a transportation activist from Tiruvallur. Lack of services has led to crowding in the available buses with nil possibility of physical distancing. Passengers also travel on footboard which is a risk in itself, Baskar added. When asked about the grievance, MTC said delays were inevitable on such longdistance routes. Six buses are operated on route 153A but they reach the destinations late due to traffic, said a senior official. He agreed to improve the bus frequency on the said route. Bhat stressed the need for a separate MTC bus depot and a central bus stand at Tiruvallur district headquarters, from where there are buses to even neighbouring states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-commuters-suffer-as-few-evening-buses-to-tiruvallur/articleshow/85167196.cms||Ram Sundaram

All those who have taken at least one dose of vaccine will be allowed to stay at hotels and resorts while a similar condition will be applicable for employees also, he said. The minister said such tourist accommodations would be allowed even in containment zones. A mobile application was being prepared by connecting all unexplored tourist locations in the state. The state’s tourism sector has suffered a loss of approximately Rs 33,000 crore during March-December 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. In addition, an approximate Rs 7,000 crore has been lost by way of foreign exchange, he said. Expat orgs will be made part of celebrationOn Onam celebrations, Riyas said Kerala's arts, culture, food varieties and prominent tourist destinations would be showcased virtually with the help of visual media and other means.

The aim is to distribute grafted plants to panchayats, schools and housing societies. Grafting is a horticulture procedure in which parts of plants are joined so as to continue their growth and produce better quality fruits in lesser time. The grafted plants retain the characteristics of the original variety and start yielding early. It provides food for animals and birds and saves farmers from the destruction caused by wild animals. A budget of Rs 8 lakh has been sanctioned for this plan. “We will distribute grafted species of fruits that are apt for the consumption of wild animals,” said MS Malik, CCF wildlife, Gurgaon. Some of the grafted species to will be provided by the wildlife department include thornless bamboo, neem, tamarind, mango, jamun, guava and banana, he added. When asked why the department is focusing on grafted trees, he said that they will provide a guaranteed variety and offer pest and disease resistance. They withstand harsh climates as well. In addition to producing new trees of selected varieties, grafting can also be used to grow more than one variety or even different kinds of fruits on one tree. Describing the process, he pointed out that it involves attaching part of a plant or tree, called a scion, onto another branch, called a rootstock. This way, the plants yield fruits quicker and provide food to the wildlife as the animal population thriving in the region. As per the MCG records, around 30,000 monkeys are estimated to be present in the city. Also, there are more than 50,000 birds in the area. Besides, other animals include Grey Mongoose, Small Indian Civet, Indian Crested Porcupine, Indian Hare, Wild Pig, Rhesus Macaque, Blue-bull (Nilgai) and Indian Gazelle (Chinkara).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/saplings-in-6-south-hry-districts-to-be-grafted-gifted-to-schools-societies/articleshow/85163650.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Work from home, e-classes push up wireline users in May||CHENNAI: Work from home and online classes pushed up the demand for internet connections in Tamil Nadu in May when the second wave of Covid-19 was intense. While the number of wireline connections including internet subscriptions spiked in the month, the number of mobile phone subscribers plunged. It is in contrast to the trend of wireline connections declining for several years, after mobile phone density increased. Data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) shows Tamil Nadu and Chennai telecom circles jointly recorded an increase of around 10% in wireline subscriptions from April to May 2021. Nearly 1.9 lakh new subscriptions including BSNL-FTTH voice-connections increased in a month and private telecom operators offering fibernet services recorded a jump of 4% in the wireline vertical. FTTH and fibernet are provided through wireline. On the other hand, the number of wireline connections dropped by more than 52,000 between April and June last year, which further decreased to 18,920 between September and October. The state lost 5.7 lakh mobile phone connections in 30 days between April and May 2021, a trend common across the country. The mobile phone vertical has been fluctuating since the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. Currently, Tamil Nadu has 8.2 crore mobile connections with a teledensity of more than 108%. Tele-density is the number of telephone connections (fixed lines and mobile phone subscribers) per 100 inhabitants within a geographical area. V K Sanjeevi, chief general manager of BSNL Chennai Telephones, said the demand for WFH and online classes increased the demand for internet connections at home. “The need for home internet shot up as more people are preferring Wi-Fi at their places to work from home and online classes. They find it more convenient than using data through mobile phones,” he said. The number of inquiries for home internet connections rose in rural areas, as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-work-from-home-e-classes-push-up-wireline-users-in-may/articleshow/85167204.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

Police said that the woman was Anandhi, wife of Ravikumar of Payyanur near Mamallapuram. The couple had two teenage children. Police said that Ravi Kumar, was a tailor. He also used to take up menial jobs and spent the monthly wages by drinking liquor. Since the family faced a financial crunch during the subsequent lockdowns, the woman opposed his drinking habit which led to frequent fights. The neighbours often came to pacify the couple as he would beat her up using a knife and logs. He also attempted to kill her on previous occasions. Anandhi kept warning him to refrain from harassing her and threatened to lodge a complaint at All Women Police Station. On Saturday night, Ravi came home drunk again and beat up his wife. Anandhi warned him that she would go to the police station on Sunday, and went to sleep. Ravi Kumar, who woke up in the midnight, hit his wife with a dumbbell on her head, leaving her dead.

District health authorities said there is five per cent increase in Covid patients getting admitted to ICUs in the past two weeks compared to previous weeks. They are hopeful that the ICU admissions would not spiral out of control, since more people are getting vaccinated. The number of Covid patients in ICUs were 261 on July 23. It rose to 312 on Saturday. “The ICU admission had come down during the second wave. But it started to rise again slowly. We don’t know what situation awaits us. Though people started to wear face masks properly, unlike after first wave, they do not follow social distancing,” said Dr Junaid Rehman, former president of IMA, Ernakulam chapter. “Though breakthrough infections are reported, they do not go to ICUs. The vaccinated Covid cases which go to ICUs rarely now are due to comorbid conditions. We do not expect surge in ICU and ventilator admissions with the existing variants of the coronavirus,” said Dr Mathew Numpeli, NHM district programme officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ernakulam-witnesses-rise-in-covid-icu-admissions/articleshow/85167396.cms||---

---||Kochi||Two persons arrested for bike lifting in Kochi||KOCHI: High drama prevailed near Mangalavanam on Sunday as police officers chased down and arrested two bike lifters who tried to escape the police and ran towards the Mangalavanam bird sanctuary. The arrested persons were identified as Firoz Khan, 19, of Mannanikulam, Thattamala, Kollam and Amarjith, 19, of Paramel, Chathamangalam, Kozhikode. According to police, the accused came through MG Road in the city in two bikes having only the ‘for-registration’ signs. The vehicles were being ridden callously and the sub-inspector who was on duty waved them down. However, the accused did not stop and sped away, said police. “A report about two persons threatening a security guard of a bike showroom at Aluva at knife point and stealing two new bikes from the showroom was shared in the internal WhatsApp group among officers. The photos of the suspects were also widely shared. SI Vipin, who had noticed this message became suspicious about the two youths being the same miscreants and followed them in the police vehicle,” said an officer with central police. The accused had ridden the bike towards the high court and went towards the Mangalavanam bird sanctuary. “When the accused realized that it was a dead end, they abandoned the bike and tried to run. Police managed to overpower one among them at the spot itself. The other accused, Firoz, jumped into the sanctuary premises by scaling a compound wall,” said the officer. Later, the police chased him down. Preliminary enquiries suggested that the accused had cases against them in Kollam East, Paravoor, Punnapra, Thrissur and Aluva stations, said police. Apart from cases for stealing bikes the accused had cases against them for stealing cash, laptops, etc. Police said that the accused has also admitted to breaking open shops at Perumbavoor to steal a phone and a tattooing machine. They have also admitted to breaking open a shop at Palarivattom to steal helmets. A probe is on to find the details behind these cases, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/two-persons-arrested-for-bike-lifting-in-kochi/articleshow/85167463.cms||---
---||Noida||Ghaziabad, Noida account for over 30% of cybercrime in UP||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Out of every 100 complaints of cybercrime from the state, at least 15 are from Ghaziabad and another 15 from Gautam Budh Nagar, according to the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCCRP). The Union ministry of home affairs had launched NCCRP for the reporting of such crimes in January 2020. Till July-end, a total of 49,779 complaints have been recorded from UP. Data from the UP Police cyber cell shows that while Ghaziabad has reported the maximum complaints — 7,644 (15.36%) — GB Nagar comes a close second at 7,633 (15.33%), followed by Lucknow at 5,600 (11.6%). As many as 2,719 complaints have been reported from Kanpur (5.5%), 1,900 from Prayagraj (3.8%), 1,700 from Varanasi (3.4%) and 1,400 from Meerut (2.8%). Lucknow SP (cybercrime) Triveni Singh told TOI that a similar trend has been witnessed in complaints received on the national helpline for reporting cybercrime and financial fraud, 155260. “Ever since the 155260 helpline was made operational recently, over 4,000 calls have already been received from UP. The maximum complaints have originated from Ghaziabad, followed by Gautam Budh Nagar,” he said. Due to the helpline, fraudulent transactions worth about Rs 75 lakh have been stopped by UP Police till now, he added. 3 types of fraud being reportedThe maximum number of complaints that are being received on the portal and helpline from UP are of financial fraud through online transactions. Cases of fraud via social media platforms and online shopping platforms also make up a large chunk of complaints, followed by ransomware attacks and fraud related to cryptocurrency, Singh said. “Almost 50% of the complaints are of financial fraud, where complainants are being duped by callers pretending to be representatives of various companies and government agencies. They cheat the complainants by asking for the OTP or making the latter click a link, after which money is deducted from bank accounts through online transactions,” the SP said. A senior officer of the UP Police cyber cell said blackmail with threats of posting private photos or videos on social media and seeking money by creating fake IDs of the complainant’s friends or government officials have become very common, especially during the lockdown. “Moreover, cases of fraud on online shopping platforms, where a product is bought online but no delivery is made, are also being reported. Some ransomware attacks and frauds via cryptocurrency like Bitcoin have also been reported,” the officer said. Most of the complaints from Ghaziabad and GB Nagar are of social media fraud. Some ‘high-tech’ fraud cases have also been reported, including ransomware attacks and dealings in cryptocurrency. Other UP districts have largely reported financial fraud cases. Call helpline immediately if cheated: PoliceIf a person has suffered a financial loss due to fraud, he/she should immediately call the helpline 155260 and report the matter so that the money can be recovered, police said. “A call at 155260 is handled by the state police concerned with the help of the citizen financial cyber fraud reporting and management system,” said Baljeet Singh, who is in charge of the GB Nagar cyber cell. The system, which has been developed by the Centre to integrate law enforcement agencies, banks, wallets and other financial intermediaries, enables every state to share a particular complaint and notify the bank, wallet and online merchant concerned. Complainants can also contact the cybercrime help desk by dialling 112, police said. “After dialling 112, they can inform police about the crime. The call will be transferred to the help desk at the cyber cell headquarters in Lucknow. Dedicated officers have been deployed to answer such calls,” SP Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ghaziabad-noida-account-for-over-30-of-cybercrime-in-up/articleshow/85164982.cms||Shikha Salaria

On a petition filed against the decision by the six founding members -- PS Jain, Arun Kalra, Satish Khanna, Sushil Aggarwal, Girja Singh and Aruna Arora -- of the RWA umbrella body, the court ruled the decision unjustified. Jain said, “The annual general meeting (AGM) of FONRWA held on November 11, 2020 had terminated the rights of its founding members to vote and contest elections for the RWA body. We had sent an objection letter against the decision to the deputy registrar chits, funds and societies, Meerut. However, the deputy registrar passed his order, dated February 23, 2021, justifying the FONRWA decision and the founding members were unable to take part in the recently held elections.” Subsequently, the founding members filed an appeal against the decision in the Allahabad high court, which passed its order on August 6 by putting a stay on the Meerut deputy registrar’s February order. When contacted, KK Jain, secretary general of FONRWA, told TOI that they are yet to receive the court order and will follow the legal course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/voting-rights-members-of-fonrwa-get-hc-relief/articleshow/85164990.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The joint inspection team comprising Foreigners’ Regional Registration officer Anoop Krishnan, senior commandant, Aviation Security Group-CISF, Sunit Sarma, and Mohammed Yousaf, Commissioner of Customs, visited Terminal -2 and analysed Cial’s plans. Cial managing director S Suhas IAS explained the project details to the team. The inspection team has instructed Cial to prepare a report to be submitted to the higher authorities for getting formal approval, a statement said. Suhas said the joint inspection has instilled confidence in the project team and the renovation work could be started by September 2021. “Chairman and the board of directors have earmarked the T2 conversion project as high priority. This is part of Cial’s plan to activate several revenue streams, improve passenger experience and ensure sustainability in income flow,” he said. Terminal 2, having a builtup area of one lakh square feet, was previously used for the domestic operation and was then earmarked for future expansion. The T2 conversion plan envisages a cost-effective renovation of the interior into three blocks. Thirty per cent of the builtup area will be used for block one which will be converted as an exclusive business jet terminal with three lounges. Block-2 is earmarked to house a VVIP safe house. This concept will ensure a hasslefree movement of passengers during the VVIP visit. In block-3 there are plans to build 50 budget rooms for passengers who intend to stay at the airport. It is planned to apply the dynamic tariff concept; wherein the rent will be calculated on an hour based scale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cochin-international-airport-revamp-joint-inspection-held/articleshow/85167511.cms||Sivadas Varma
---||Noida||Year on, no action yet against STP violators||Noida: Over a year since the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) team visited all sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Noida and Ghaziabad and found 10 of the 14 STPs not functioning properly, no action has been taken against the violators in Noida. The NMCG team had directed the DMs and state pollution control board to take action against the concerned officials and the private companies operating these STPs. The team found that over 371 MLD untreated sewage was being discharged in Yamuna and Hindon from these STPs. While NMCG, and in turn the DMs, had recommended action within a week, nothing has been done to improve the situation of the STPs in the past one year. After environmental activists raised the issue last month, the NMCG team responded saying that they are still awaiting reports from both districts. “STP discharge can be easily managed, but the authorities seem to not pay attention to it at all. Untreated water being discharged from STPs has also invited criticism from NGT. Despite the NMCG teams declaring them non-compliant, the authorities have reported no improvement in their condition in the past one year,” said activist Vikrant Tongad. In GB Nagar, four of the eight STPs that were found non-compliant included those in Sector 123, sector 168, Kasna Road and Ecotech III. Meanwhile, sources in Noida Authority explained that the STPs had remained non-functional due to disputes among partners of the operating firm, which has been resolved now. “All STPs are working now and discharging treated water only. When the NMCG team had visited, we had not been issued consent to operate from the state. Now there are regular checks, and a monthly water quality report is also sent to IIT Delhi. An external agency also regularly tests and inlet and outlet water samples,” said a senior official from Noida Authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/year-on-no-action-yet-against-stp-violators/articleshow/85165031.cms||Snehil Sinha

Yediyurappa, in a letter, requested CM Basavaraj Bommai to withdraw the order giving him cabinet rank till the end of Bommai’s tenure as chief minister. Sources said the facilities offered included perks, vehicle and staff, but it was reportedly to help Yediyurappa keep government bungalow Cauvery, the designated residence of a serving chief minister. Bommai, according to sources, has decided to function out of Kumara Krupa guest- house since his residence in RT Nagar is not spacious. Sources said Yediyurappa’s move to decline the government’s cabinet-rank offer is to preempt criticism from opposition parties. Siddaramaiah, as former chief minister, had continued to stay in Cauvery during the JD(S)-Congress coalition regime, while the bungalow was allotted to then industries minister KJ George. HD Kumaraswamy, as CM, had chosen to work from a hotel, for which he had faced criticism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bsy-declines-govt-offer-of-cabinet-rank-facilities/articleshow/85160674.cms||---

In a review meeting of the horticulture department recently, CEO Ritu Maheshwari directed to expedite work and set revised deadlines for the wetland and the children’s park, officials said, adding that the earlier deadline was September and December 2021. While cost, design and labour issues are being assessed for the said work, monsoon and tendering delays have slowed down the pace of the work, said an official from the authority, who added that even though the work is being expedited, it’s unlikely to meet the new deadline. Elaborating on the status of the work, the official added that work on walkways and elevated pathways is underway at the wetland. “Recent showers have led to a delay. However, we have increased the labour from 25-30 to 60-70 per day to meet the new deadline,” said the official. Similarly, work at the Shivalik Park, which is being developed as an adventure sports park for children in Sector 33, has begun with boundary wall construction but the design has just been submitted by the consultant. “Here too the work force has been doubled. But elements such as caves, walkways and play areas etc. will have to be delivered by the consultant,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/wetland-shivalik-park-may-not-meet-revised-deadlines/articleshow/85165032.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Gurgaon||Haryana: 2 lakh students switch from private to govt schools amid fee dispute||GURUGRAM: More than two lakh students have shifted from private schools to state-run institutions in the current academic year, registering an increase of 11% in overall enrolment compared to last year. Parents and school officials said a dispute over fee could be one of the main reasons for students switching to government schools. According to data compiled by the school education department, 2,33,685 new admissions have been registered in classes I-XII across 14,000 government schools in 22 districts of the state. Currently, over 24 lakh students study in government schools. “It is encouraging to see that we have added over three lakh students in two years. This year, we added more than two lakh children. It is an indicator that our policies are bringing tangible changes,” said the additional chief secretary of the education department, Dr Mahavir Singh. Last year, 1,17,903 students moved out of private schools. Between 2014 and 2019, government schools recorded an average of 4% decline in yearly enrolment. In 2019-20, government schools registered a dropout number of nearly 30,000. While 20,87,363 students were enrolled for 2018-19, 20,58,109 were admitted in 2019-20. This time, Nuh has recorded the highest number of new admissions at 21,000. It is followed by Faridabad (18,512), Hisar (17,263), Karnal (15,473), Bhiwani (14,133), and Gurugram (13,221) In terms of percentage increase, Faridabad has recorded the maximum rise in enrolment at 17%. It is followed by Charkhi Dadri (16%), Bhiwani (14%,), Panchkula (13%), Karnal (12.3%), and Hisar (12%). Gurugram has recorded an 11% increase in overall enrolment in government schools compared to last year. As classes shifted to online mode and the lockdown resulted in reduced household income, the state government allowed schools to collect only tuition fees for all students. Parents of children studying in smaller private schools had wanted full or partial waiver of fees. Confusion on the matter stayed for months and multiple court orders were issued.  “Students of smaller private schools were largely excluded from the online education system due to lack of resources and trained teaching staff. On the other hand, many children from bigger private schools were blocked from attending online classes over the fee dispute. Hence, moving children to government schools was a viable option,” said Kailash Sharma, general secretary, Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body. While government school officials claim that distribution of free tablets among students and launch of English-medium institutions were some of the major reasons for the numbers to increase, the drive launched in May to find out-of-school children and enrol them in their nearest institutions also helped. Some have, however, accused government schools of allowing new admissions without mandatory submission of School Leaving Certificates (SLCs). “They have flouted the SLC provision. As a result, parents found it a great opportunity to not clear dues and admit children to government schools. Maybe, next year, they will switch back to private schools,” said Kulbhushan Sharma, president, National Independent Schools Alliance, a body of parents whose children are in smaller private institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/2-lakh-students-switch-from-private-to-government-schools-amid-fee-dispute/articleshow/85163464.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: Doctors say vaccine hesitancy is high among lactating women||BENGALURU: Although the government has allowed lactating women to take the Covid-19 vaccine, fear among families and new mothers of taking the shot needs to be addressed, doctors say. Many lactating women want the shot deferred till the baby is a year old and when they can stop breastfeeding, but gynaecologists and paediatricians say they are not only risking their health, but that of their babies too. The first week of August is observed as breastfeeding awareness week. “Babies can be breastfed even on the day the mother takes the vaccine. The dose does not cause harm to the baby. There is a lack of awareness which is why most women fear taking the shot,” said Dr Ravneet Joshi, paediatrician and lactating consultant, Manipal Hospitals. She said breastfeeding babies up to two years is best for the child. A gynaecologist from a general hospital said in most cases, family members decide for mothers. “Many families are confused about letting lactating women take the dose. They themselves decide to let the baby be fed for a year at least and then the mother can take the jab. We explain this is wrong and give the right details,” the doctor said. The doctor said families worry over what would happen if the child falls sick after the mother gets a shot. “This requires awareness drives,” the doctor said. Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, Covid Technical Advisory Committee, said it is “a very wrong notion” to postpone vaccination for lactating mothers. “Covid vaccines are not live virus vaccines and it is not passed through breast milk to the baby. So, vaccination of the mother does not affect the health of the baby. They must realise the vaccine prevents severity of the disease and mortality.” However, lactating women, who are mostly in the 18-44 years age category, are not a priority group and are not eligible for free shots offered in government facilities. They must pay for the dose in private hospitals. Dr Meghana Reddy, obstetrician and gynaecologist, Rainbow Children’s Hospital, Marathahalli, said the challenge is to make a section of educated people and their family members aware. “Women who are well educated do not have any issues taking the vaccine. Ditto with people from rural areas who follow our advice,” said Dr Reddy. She said after delivery, Rainbow Children’s Hospital counsels women on the need to take the vaccine and many take the first dose before they are discharged. Anganwadi workers, who work closely with mothers and newborn babies, said they explain the benefits of the vaccine to new mothers, but fear is still high. “There is a need to create awareness. Also, doses are not easily available in government hospitals and one must wait in long queues. Mothers with newborn babies are afraid to stand in queues for long,” said M Jayamma, general secretary, Anganwadi Association, a wing of All India Trade Union Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-doctors-say-vaccine-hesitancy-is-high-among-lactating-women/articleshow/85167740.cms||---

Also, over 100 hospitals will function as Covid facilities in case of a third wave as many smaller nursing homes have given their consent in this regard. For comparison, the district had 50 private Covid hospitals during the last wave. It is expected that children will be affected more in the third wave, due to which, the IMA has directed to keep at least 20 beds reserved in Neo-natal Intensive Care Units (NICU) and Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) in all private Covid hospitals operating in the district. The IMA has also decided to provide training to government doctors in handling PICU and NICU wards. IMA’s national vice president Dr Ashok Rai, who was present during the first meeting of the IMA (UP) working committee at IMA Bhawan on Sunday, said: “It is being feared that children may be more affected in the third wave. IMA branches across India are doing all kinds of preparations so that children get accurate and timely treatment.” IMA Ghaziabad president Dr Ashish Aggarwal said, “Efforts are being made to increase the number of hospitals so that patients can get access near their homes. IMA is making efforts that even small hospitals or nursing homes get permission from the administration for Covid treatment.” Dr Aggarwal added that IMA has constituted a task force to monitor changes in treatment, the status of beds and oxygen, condition of patients and inform IMA officials regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/increase-beds-by-25-ima-tells-hospitals-in-gzb/articleshow/85163631.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Mysuru||Despite third wave looming, BJP plans rallies in 24 Karnataka districts||Even while the state government is tightening safety measures in a bid to prevent a third wave of Covid-19 infections — there has been an uptick in fresh cases in some districts, notably Dakshina Kannada in the past couple of weeks — the state unit of the BJP has decided to organise public rallies as part of its outreach programme. The Janashirvada programme is aimed at MPs who were recently inducted into the Union council of ministers to the people. Party functionaries led by the four new Union ministers from Karnataka, will traverse 24 districts in four divisions and will hold public meetings from August 16 to 19. Incidentally, weekend curfew imposed by the state government in eight districts as a preventive measure against Covid, is effective till August 16. BJP office bearers said the newly inducted ministers — Bhagawanth Khuba, Shobha Karandlaje, Rajeev Chandrashekhar and A Narayanaswamy — will lead four teams which will hold rallies in Kalyana-Karnataka, coastal Karnataka and Mumbai-Karnataka besides Bengaluru. The plan is to cover two districts every day. Captain Ganesh Karnik, state BJP spokesperson, said the programme is a nationwide initiative and not a decision of the BJP Karnataka unit alone. He justified conducting such rallies amid such trying circumstances, saying opposition parties are not allowing the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha — both democratically elected houses — to conduct business. “Even though there are major issues which need democratic deliberations and detailed discussion, the opposition has set a bad precedent in Parliament by not allowing the introduction of new ministers,” Karnik said. “These rallies will be held to protest anti-democratic policies of Congress and other opposition parties and are aimed at introducing new ministers to the nation.” Eranna Kadadi, Rajya Sabha MP, told ToI disruptions by the opposition are making it difficult for the government to convey recent propeople policies. “Hence, it is necessary for the party to reach both the general public and the cadre as well,” he said. “These new ministers are grass root workers of the party and their elevation is a big example.” On the question of the timing of the event, Kadadi said keeping the pandemic in mind, the party may hold small public meetings as against mega rallies it had initially planned. However, Ashok Chandaragi, a political analyst from Kalyana-Karnataka, said the event is poorly timed. “As a responsible party, the organisation should not hold any public gatherings at least till December,” Chandaragi said. “The fear of a third wave still looms large, and the state government itself has imposed curbs in various districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/despite-third-wave-looming-bjp-plans-rallies-in-24-karnataka-districts/articleshow/85167781.cms||Shreyas HS

---||Mumbai||BJP MLA Nitesh Rane attacks Maharashtra govt over Ganeshotsav guidelines, says 'Hindu religion in danger'||MUMBAI: Maharashtra BJP MLA Nitesh Rane launched a scathing attack on the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Sunday over guidelines for the upcoming Ganesh festival and went on to claim that Hindu religion was "in danger" under its rule.  "The situation in Mumbai is similar to that of West Bengal, where Durga Puja celebrations were restricted. It is difficult for Ganesh Utsav Mandals to celebrate the festival in accordance with new rules. We raised our concerns with the Governor," Rane told reporters.  "Some time ago, other religious festivals were celebrated, they did not face any inconvenience. Then why only Hindus? Hindu religion is in danger. We told the Governor to protect our festival, or else, Thackeray govt will gradually end the festival...celebrations," added the BJP MLA.  In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government restricted the height of the idols being used in public celebrations to four feet while those in homes to two feet, in order to reduce fanfare.  Last year as well, the celebrations of the festival were subdued due to the rampant surge in Covid-19 cases in the state.  Last year the famed Lalbaughcha Raja Ganeshotsav Mandal had decided not to hold the festivities in the wake of the pandemic. This year they said they will go ahead but will decrease the size of the idol to adhere to the state government's guidelines.  Ganesh Chaturthi, a 10-day festival that starts on the fourth day of the Hindu lunisolar calendar month Bhadrapada, will start on September 10 this year.  It is celebrated with much fanfare in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra with lakhs of devotees converging into mandals to seek blessing from Lord Ganesh. -- With inputs from ANI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-mla-nitesh-rane-attacks-maharashtra-govt-over-ganeshotsav-guidelines-says-hindu-religion-in-danger/articleshow/85167787.cms||---
---||Noida||Ghaziabad: Symptoms similar, those with fever advised H1N1, Covid tests||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: Doctors are suggesting both swine flu and Covid tests for those turning up at clinics with fever. The number of patients with flu has increased in the past two weeks and since most symptoms of flu, swine flu and Covid are similar, doctors are relying on the reports to determine the line of treatment. At Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital, Kaushambi, about five cases of swine flu have been reported at the OPD in the past few days. The district health department officials, however, said they have no such information so far. “We have not received any information about swine flu cases. Influenza is quite common in this weather,” district surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said. Senior physician, Yashoda Hospital, Dr AP Singh, said in the past few days, he has seen about five swine flu cases. “About 15 influenza A (H3N2) patients and a few with influenza B were also here. Swine flu virus spreads rapidly through coughs and sneezes. It is important to exercise caution,” the doctor said. People who are most at risk are those with liver and kidney ailments, TB, HIV, anaemia, blood pressure problems and diabetes. Elderly people, pregnant women and children have to be extra careful, he added. Symptoms of swine flu include cold, cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, fever, chest pain, muscle pain, sore throat, trouble with sleep, tiredness, and headache. Most of these symptoms are seen among flu and Covid patients as well. Dr RP Singh, senior consultant, MMG District Hospital, said about 20% of the 200 patients who visit his OPD clinic daily have the flu. “We are asking for swine flu tests as well so that we can rule out the options. We have not seen any positive cases so far,” he added. Dr Ashish Agarwal, IMA president, Ghaziabad, said it is important to follow Covid protocols. “Regular use of masks can be effective in controlling the spread of swine flu as well,” he said, adding that no cases have been reported at the facility. In Gautam Budh Nagar, no swine flu cases have been detected yet. “However, with more rains this year, we are asking residents to sanitise their premises,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer. At most hospitals, officials said 20-30% of all OPD patients have seasonal flu and Malaria cases have gone up from two to 10 in the past 15 days. “Flu is common in this season. We ask for tests when the index of suspicion is high,” said Dr Brigadier (retired) Rakesh Gupta, director, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/symptoms-similar-those-with-fever-advised-h1n1-covid-tests/articleshow/85163680.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Noida||4 die in 2 expressway accidents in Gr Noida||Greater Noida: Four persons died and around 20 were injured in two separate accidents on expressways in Greater Noida on Sunday. One of the accidents took place on the Yamuna Expressway, where four persons had got off their car when a tyre got punctured and were hit by a vehicle coming from behind. Three of them died, while a 55-year-old woman — a sub-inspector in Delhi Police — is battling for life. The other accident occurred on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway during the wee hours, when a crowded bus rammed into a stationary truck. A woman in her thirties died. Around 12.30pm, a Honda City carrying four persons from Mathura had to stop on a side of the Yamuna Expressway when one of its tyres punctured near the Salarpur underpass in Dankaur. While one of them was busy fixing the tyre, the others got out to help him. A vehicle coming from behind failed to slam the brakes in time and crashed into the Honda and those around it. A police team rushed to the spot after getting a call from a passerby and took all the four to Kailash Hospital. Three were declared dead on arrival while the fourth, the sub-inspector, is undergoing treatment. All the four were related to each other and were headed for Delhi. The three who died have been identified as Bhaskar Sharma (25), his mother Kanchan Sharma (62) and Bhavya Sharma (19), Kanchan’s niece. Poonam Sharma (55), Kanchan’s younger sister, is being treated for critical injuries to her head. Arvind Pathak, the SHO of Dankaur police station, said they were trying to identify the vehicle and its driver from CCTV footage. “It is not clear if it was a car or a heavy vehicle. We have registered a case against unknown persons under sections 304A (death due to negligence) and 279 (rash driving) of the IPC. We are scanning CCTV footage,” he added. In the other accident, a private bus carrying 70 passengers to Bihar from Punjab rammed a stationary truck on the EPE in Dadri around 5am. The truck driver had parked his vehicle on the side of the expressway to take a quick nap. He, however, fled the spot after the accident. While a woman, aged around 35, died, 19 others in the bus were injured and taken to a private hospital. Nine were discharged after first-aid, while the remaining 10 were referred to District Hospital as they suffered injuries to their heads. They are likely to be discharged on Monday. Pradeep Tripathi, the SHO of Dadri police station, said the accident took place around 5am. “The woman who died was traveling alone. Police have checked her luggage but didn’t find any document or identity card. We also don’t know if she carried a phone,” he added. Most passengers in the bus were asleep when it rammed into the truck. “I was jolted out of sleep by a sudden jerk. My head had hit the backrest of the front seat and my legs also got jammed between the seats. It took almost an hour for the police to bring us out,” Tripathi said. The SHO pointed out that most accidents on expressways took place between 2am and 5am, when drivers faced the risk of dozing off. “These bus drivers are sleep-deprived anyway. The bus was also crowded beyond its capacity. The driver may have dozed off for a few seconds and the bus crashed into the truck,” Tripathi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/4-die-in-2-expressway-accidents-in-gr-noida/articleshow/85165101.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

Police said Abhishek Tyagi, who was originally from Meerut, met with the accident around 2am on Saturday while he was on his way to his rented accommodation in Sahibabad. “A police team took him to a private hospital. We also informed his family members,” said Nagendra Chaubey, the SHO of Sahibabad police station. Tyagi was declared dead around 7pm. The body was handed over to his family members, who left for Meerut for the last rites. Tyagi was supposed to get married by the end of this year.

Police have recovered cash worth Rs 5,02,000, one Ertiga car, 10 mobile phones, a fridge, washing machine, grinder along with other household items, a laptop, three Aadhaar cards, two PAN cards, 23 ATM cards and five cheque books from different banks. The arrested accused are identified as Vipin Rathore, Bhanu Prakash, Trilok and Deepak. The matter came to light after Gaurav Gupta, brother of Agra SGST officer, had made a complaint that in December last year that his SIM card was closed due to some reason. The same number was linked with his bank account and he had asked the bank to change his mobile number but the bank hasn’t changed it. Meanwhile, Gupta had a land deal for which Rs 15 lakh was deposited in his account in April and an additional Rs 20 lakh was supposed to be deposited to his account on July 15. To check this, Gupta had gone to the bank to update his passbook and then he came to know that from December 2020 to June 2021, the fraudsters had withdrawn Rs 15.9 lakh from his account. This withdrawal was done through internet banking and from ATMs. Nipurn Aggarwal, SP (City-1), said that after three months since Gupta’s mobile number had been closed, the same number was issued to Vipin Rathore, one of the arrested accused. As soon as Rathore got the SIM card activated, he received a message from Bank of Baroda stating that Rs 12 has been deducted from the account — which is Gupta’s bank account — and the remaining balance amount is about Rs 15.9 lakh. Abhay Mishra, circle officer (Indirapuram) and in-charge of cyber cell said that after seeing the message, the accused planned to withdraw all the money. “Somehow, Rathore managed to get all the information of Gupta’s SIM card. He first changed the internet banking password through the mobile number and applied for a new ATM card as well. Gupta’s old SIM card was also registered with his Aadhaar card. Rathore somehow changed the details of Gupta’s Aadhaar card as well. The accused had also received the message that the bank was supposed to deliver the new ATM card. Rathore then went to Gupta’s address and took the new ATM card from the postman,” the officer added. Mishra said that once the accused received the ATM card he started withdrawing cash from different ATMs. All the accused have been booked under 420 (cheating), 379 (theft), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of IPC and relevant sections of IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/phone-number-linked-to-bank-not-changed-man-loses-rs-15l-to-fraud/articleshow/85169375.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka CM likely to face challenge as OBC list may be decentralised||BENGALURU: The Centre’s move to restore states’ power to identify backward classes has given a ray of hope to communities like Panchamasali Lingayats and Vokkaligas, which are fighting for more share of quota under the other backward classes (OBC) category. However, it’s likely to pose a challenge to newly sworn-in chief minister Basavaraj Bommai as the same communities are likely to step up pressure on the state government. The Union cabinet last week cleared an amendment bill, which is likely to be placed in Parliament this week. If passed, it will reverse the constitutional amendment that the Centre introduced in 2018, according to which only the Union government can draw up the list of socially and educationally backward classes. “It is a much-needed move to protect the federal structure, wherein states have a say,” said H Kantharaju, former chairman of Karnataka Backward Classes Commission. But it comes at a time when Panchamasalis are planning to revive the agitation demanding inclusion in 2A category of backward classes, which provides 15% reservation as opposed to 5% in the current 3B category. They are gearing up for a statewide campaign, Panchamasali Pratigna Panchayati, as the six-month time frame the government had sought to consider their demand is set to expire next month. Basava Jaya Mruthyunjaya Swamy, pontiff of Kudalasangama Panchamasali Peeta, has announced he would lead a dharna on October 1 in Bengaluru. Community heads are scheduled to meet in Mysuru on Monday to discuss this. “All these days, the state was putting the onus on the Centre and escaping from its responsibility. We are urging the Centre to enact the amendment without delay,” said Mruthyunjaya Swamy, who had taken out a 450km padayatra in January-February. Panchamasalis and other Lingayats are now categorised as 3B in the OBC list. The difficulty for the government, however, is that Vokkaligas, who are now under 3A category that provides 4% reservation, are also seeking 2A category. While both are dominant communities in the state, their inclusion in 2A category is set to disturb the balance as 102 communities are already in it. It may also open a Pandora’s box as other communities, including Balijas and Marathas, have also sought the 2A status. “It will lead to chaos given the political situation in Karnataka. It will also test the capability of CM Bommai. We expect him to handle it deftly,” said GP Patil, national general secretary, Jagatika Lingayat Mahasabha. Backward classes minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari said the government will wait till the amendment is enacted and follow the recommendations of the state backward classes commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bommai-likely-to-face-challenge-as-obc-list-may-be-decentralised/articleshow/85160671.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

The five sectors where these vending zones will come up are Beta 1 and 2, Sector 36, Delta 2 and Alpha 2. Officials said the designs, which have been made by a Delhi-based architecture firm, were ready and tenders were likely to be floated in a couple of months. GNIDA hopes to make these vending zones operational by this year. The zones will not only have platforms and sheds for the vendors, but also toilets and parking lots. Benches will also be placed for shoppers. “We are working on setting up vending zones in five sectors of Greater Noida. A total of 200 vendors will be accommodated there. The cost estimates are being prepared and tenders will be floated in about two months,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the CEO of GNIDA. The senior official said construction would start soon after the companies were chosen. “We want to have these zones ready by the end of 2021 so that vendors and residents of Greater Noida can be given a New Year’s gift. This will also add to the beauty of the city and give it a distinct identity,” Bhooshan said. If the project is successful, GNIDA would set up vending zones in other areas too. “When these modern vendor markets are set up, the streets of Greater Noida and its green belts would be free of encroachment by hawkers,” a GNIDA official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/vending-zones-for-200-hawkers-to-come-up-in-five-gr-noida-sectors/articleshow/85164170.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The slow pace of vaccinations and the handling of the pandemic caused a wave of protests against the government of Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, who was dismissed by President Kais Saied two weeks ago among a series of emergency measures.  Five months after the start of vaccinations in the North African country, 1.3 million Tunisians have received two doses.  In an effort to speed up the vaccination schedule, Tunisia opened vaccinations for those over the age of 40, with thousands flocking to inoculation centers. The Health Ministry said 551,00 people received a vaccination on Sunday.  Intensive care units and emergency departments are full in hospitals across Tunisia. Doctors have complained of exhaustion and a shortage of oxygen supplies.  Tunisia seeks to vaccinate 50% of its 11.6 million people by mid-October.  The country has reported more than 20,000 deaths and more than 610,000 coronavirus infections since the pandemic began.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/tunisia-vaccinates-more-than-half-a-million-people-in-a-day/articleshow/85167978.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: No quota for needy in UG admission||KOLKATA: Colleges and universities in the state have not provided reservation for the economically weaker section (EWS) even this year due to the pandemic and the way it has disrupted the entire education system shutting down all on-campus activities and rejigging the priority of policymakers. None of the colleges and universities have mentioned anything about the EWS quota in their admission guidelines which were published on August 2, the first day when they started accepting applications for UG courses. According to principals, the education department is yet to formulate guidelines on how to implement the EWS quota in educational institutions and notify it to institutes. In 2019, the Centre approved a 10% quota in jobs and educational institutions for economically weaker sections among general category. The education department was instructed to form its own guidelines for implementation. The primary criteria to declare a person economically weaker under the Centre’s guidelines are a family income of less than Rs 8 lakh per year, ownership of less than five hectares of agriculture land or home measuring less than 1,000 sqft. “We have not received any notification about implementation of EWS quota,” said Subiresh Bhattacharya, president of the All Bengal Principals’ Council and secretary of West Bengal Vice Chancellors’ Council. According to officials in higher education department, the pandemic and how it has forced the administration to rejig its priorities might be one of the reasons that the guidelines have not been framed and implemented from this year. “The pandemic and subsequent curbs since March 2020 has changed our priorities. We are focussing more on trying to figure out how to bridge the digital divide for online classes, ensure examinations and admissions happen on time and figure out when is the right time to ease restrictions in colleges and universities,” said an official. The state cabinet passed the decision to implement EWS quota in jobs and education in July 2019 and instructed education department to draw up its own guidelines. A principal said another reason for not implementing it is the fact that seats in general category have not been increased in the past few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-quota-for-needy-in-ug-admission/articleshow/85161881.cms||Zeeshan Javed
