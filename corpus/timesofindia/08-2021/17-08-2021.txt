Torrential rains battered the country's northwestern Black Sea provinces on Aug. 11, causing floods that demolished homes and bridges, swept away cars and blocked access to numerous roads.  The Turkish disaster management agency, AFAD, said at least 62 people were killed in the province of Kastamonu, 14 died in Sinop and one in Bartin.  Emergency crews on Monday pressed ahead with efforts to locate dozens of people who were still reported missing in Kastamonu and Sinop. AFAD said some 8,000 personnel, backed by 20 rescue dogs, are involved in the rescue and assistance efforts.  About 2,400 people were evacuated across the region amid the floods - scores of them lifted to safety by helicopters. Many are being temporarily housed in student dormitories.  Around 40 villages remain without power, according to AFAD.  Heavy rains along the northern coast of the Black Sea last week also forced 1,500 people to evacuate in Russia.  The heavy flooding came after Turkey endured a searing heat wave and as crews in the south were taming wildfires that raced across the country's Mediterranean coast.  Climate scientists say there's little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving more extreme events - such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms - as the planet warms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/flooding-death-toll-in-turkey-climbs-to-77-dozens-missing/articleshow/85381793.cms||---

Afghan cities fell in just days and on Monday civilians thronged Kabul's international airport after President Ashraf Ghani fled, saying he wanted to avoid a bloodbath, and the Taliban seized the capital. "Afghanistan must not become the haven for terrorists that it once was," Macron said in a national address. "It is a challenge for peace and international stability, against a common enemy. We will do everything we can so that Russia, the United States and Europe can cooperate efficiently, because our interests are the same. "The United Nations' security council will have to come up with a common and united answer." There was a risk that a wave of migrants would sweep towards Europe, Macron said. France would continue to protect the most vulnerable and would play its part in an organised and fair international effort to share the burden, he added. France, Germany and some other European countries would take the initiative to build a "robust, united, and coordinated response" with the help of transit countries, Macron said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/frances-macron-urges-un-to-act-with-single-voice-on-afghanistan/articleshow/85381767.cms||---
---||World||Canada's Conservatives promise job boom to challenge Trudeau||OTTAWA: Canada's main opposition Conservative Party set out its election platform on Monday, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's top rival pledging to bring back jobs lost to the Covid-19 pandemic and to balance the federal budget within 10 years. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole, speaking on the first full day of campaigning ahead of the September 20 vote, also said he would scrap the governing Liberal Party's national daycare plan and again opposed a vaccine mandate for federal government workers. "We want to help get all people back to work, in all sectors and all regions," O'Toole told reporters. "There are thousands of small and medium-sized businesses ... hanging on by a thread. So our plan will secure those jobs, help them thrive and that will help us get a growing economy." Trudeau launched the campaign on Sunday, two years ahead of schedule, hoping that high vaccination rates and a post-pandemic economic rebound will help him regain a parliamentary majority. O'Toole, speaking in Ottawa, vowed a Conservative government would recover a million jobs lost during the pandemic within its first year in power. Employment in Canada remains about 246,000 jobs short of pre-pandemic levels. The election platform also promised billions in spending to prop up the economy and bolster the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, while limiting new structural spending in order to balance the budget within a decade. It did not provide cost details, with O'Toole saying they were waiting for Canada's budgetary watchdog to finish vetting the numbers. Trudeau, who was campaigning in the Montreal area, promised if re-elected to extend emergency supports for businesses and workers, and outlined a suite of new programs for hard-hit industries. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-leaning New Democratic Party, said he would claw back executive compensation paid out by companies who also took government pandemic supports. O'Toole promised to immediately cancel the C$30 billion ($23.9 billion) national childcare program launched by the Liberals, which would end deals with eight provinces and territories. Instead, he pledged to give parents bigger tax credits. "We're going to help all parents, all parents, immediately," said O'Toole. The Conservatives also took aim at Canada's hot housing market, saying they would boost supply by building a million homes over three years and ban non-resident foreign investors from buying for two years, while also promising to loosen mortgage requirements for some Canadians. Trudeau's Liberals lead nationally with 35% of the vote compared with 30% for the Conservatives and 19% for the New Democrats, a Leger Marketing poll showed on August 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canadas-conservatives-promise-job-boom-to-challenge-trudeau/articleshow/85382137.cms||---

Weekend thunderstorms across the northern Sierra didn't produce much rain, instead of whipping up winds and unleashing lightning strikes that bedevilled the more than 6,000 firefighters trying to contain the month-old Dixie Fire amid temperatures forecast to top 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius).  "We're definitely still dealing with the possibility of lightning. Winds are all over the place. Things are going to be pretty unstable for the next couple of days," said fire spokesman Edwin Zuniga.  Gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) on Saturday pushed flames closer to Janesville, a town of about 1,500 people just east of Greenville, the small gold rush-era community decimated by the fire 10 days ago.  James Reichle evacuated from Greenville and has been sleeping with his dog in a trailer outside a church. His home survived the flames but he's been unable to return because the roads are closed. He said he feels for his neighbours at the evacuation centre who lost everything.  "These are all people who either don't have a home or don't have access to a home. I still have a house standing, no damage. But I can't get into it," he said Saturday.  The Dixie Fire was the largest among more than 100 big blazes burning in more than a dozen states in the West, a region seared by drought and hot, bone-dry weather that turned forests, brushlands, meadows and pastures into tinder.  The US Forest Service said it is operating in crisis mode, fully deploying firefighters and maxing out its support system.  The roughly 21,000 federal firefighters working on the ground is more than double the number of firefighters sent to contain forest fires at this time a year ago, said Anthony Scardina, a deputy forester for the agency's Pacific Southwest region.  The Dixie Fire has ravaged nearly 867 square miles (2,246 square kilometres) - an area the size of Tokyo, or more than twice the size of Indianapolis. It was 31% contained on Sunday.  Near Taylorsville, California, some firefighters on Sunday were monitoring a bear cub who was possibly orphaned in the fire. A wildlife rescue team was waiting to extract the emaciated cub from the burn-scarred area.  "Generally if you see them with a sow or a mother bear, they'll stay with the mother bear and runoff," said firefighter Johnnie Macy, who was deployed from Golden, Colorado to battle the Dixie Fire. "This bear hasn't done that, so because of that we think that the bear's orphaned as a result of the fire."  More than 1,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed and nearly 15,000 structures were still under threat from the Dixie fire, whose cause has not been determined. Pacific Gas and Electric has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on its power line.  A few hundred miles to the south, evacuations were ordered Sunday after a blaze that broke out the night before churned through California forestland near the remote community of Omo Ranch. There was no containment of the Caldor Fire burning in El Dorado County, about 60 miles (73 kilometres) east of Sacramento.  Meanwhile, a small wildfire that blew up Saturday east of Salt Lake City, temporarily shutting down Interstate 80 and leading to evacuation orders for some 8,000 residences, was caused by a vehicle with a malfunctioning catalytic converter, Utah Fire Info said. The Parleys Canyon Fire then calmed significantly, and homes were no longer threatened, officials said Sunday.  In southeastern Montana, firefighters gained ground on a pair of blazes that chewed through vast rangelands and at one point threatened the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. those fires were caused by heat from coal seams, the deposits of coal found in the ground in the area, said Peggy Miller, a spokeswoman for the fires.  Mandatory evacuations for the tribal headquarters town of Lame Deer were lifted Sunday but remained in place for those with medical conditions, and heavy smoke made air quality unhealthy across much of Montana, according to the state Department of Environmental Quality.  Smoke also drove air pollution levels to unhealthy or very unhealthy levels in parts of Northern California, Oregon and Idaho.  Climate change has made the US West warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-fire-threatens-homes-as-blazes-burn-across-west/articleshow/85382536.cms||---

"The export of Covid-19 rapid antigen testing kits has been put under the restricted category with immediate effect," said a notification by the Directorate General of foreign trade (DGFT). Now, exporters have to seek a license or permission from the DGFT for shipping items under the restricted category. These restrictions will increase the availability of the kits in the country. Earlier, in May, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suggested use of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits for mass screening. It also said that the RAT should be allowed in government and private healthcare facilities across the country in cities, towns, schools, colleges, and community centres. The Indian Council of Medical Research also issued an advisory for Covid-19 home testing using rapid antigen kits. The spread of coronavirus to rural areas, where RT-PCR testing labs are not available was the main reason behind this strategy. According to Central government's data on August 4, there are some warning signals that showed India's R number above 1, for the first time from May. An R-value above 1 means every Covid-19 infected person or individual is infecting more than one other person. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said a rise in coronavirus cases is being witnessed in 18 districts, primarily in Kerala (10 districts), Maharashtra, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-restricts-export-of-covid-19-rapid-antigen-testing-kits-amid-third-wave-concerns/articleshow/85382639.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Assam: Congress shocked, clueless and blindsided by Sushmita Dev exit||GUWAHATI: Did Sushmita Dev blindside the Congress? Seems so, going by the defeaning silence of the Congress leadership to the exodus of party leaders. The helplessness of the Congress to keep its leaders and grassroots workers within the party fold has been evident before the 2016 Assembly polls when its members started hobnobbing with the BJP. But what came as a rude shock was the resignation of All India Mahila Congress (AIMC) president and former MP from Assam, Sushmita Dev. It was only last Saturday, when a Congress delegation from the state, headed by AICC general secretary and Assam in-charge Jitendra Singh and Assam PCC president Bhupen Borah met Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi at the latter's 12, Tughlak Lane residence in New Delhi. The two leaders were clueless that a national-level leader of the Congress like Sushmita — whose family was deeply rooted in the Grand Old party with father Santosh Mohan Dev being one of the close confidants of the Gandhi family — can “suddenly disappear” from the national capital to fly to Kolkata to join Trinamool Congress on Monday. She tendered her resignation on Sunday and hardly anyone, including Assam PCC leaders, were aware of the development. During Saturday's meeting at Rahul's residence, Congress insiders said Sushmita seemed to be an obedient Congress soldier who will continue to fight against the BJP's “divisive politics”. “Sushmita fully participated with us during the meeting with Soniaji on Saturday. Yesterday, I was discussing strategies with her regarding municipal elections to be held in Assam next. In fact, she was guiding me with ideas to go ahead to show Congress strength in the civic body polls. I cannot believe that she quit all of a sudden,” Borah told TOI as Sushmita's joining the Trinamool was making headlines on TV at his Ghoramora residence here on Monday. When Borah was planning to meet senior leaders of the Assam Jatiya Parishad later in the afternoon to boost ties with a new regional party that forayed into state politics with the resolution to oust the BJP from power, Sushmita's resignation came as a jolt for him. The Congress in Assam already received a double blow after the 2021 Assembly polls when sitting MLAs from Mariani and Thowra, Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain, joined the BJP. While the resignation of the two leaders came a major setback in upper Assam where tea tribes and Ahom community have been the backbone of Congress politics since Independence, Congress sources said Sushmita's departure will hurt the party's plans in the Hindu Bengali-inhabited areas, especially the Barak Valley. “Sushmita's joining the Trinamool is a big gain for Mamata Banerjee as Trinamool Congress is trying to make inroads into Bengali-inhabited areas of Assam by banking on the Bangla sentiment. But immediately, Trinamool must have planned to utilise her in Tripura which is going for back-to-back elections in 2023 (Assembly polls) and 2024 (general election),” said the source. The source, however, added that dwindling confidence of a section of Congress leaders, after seeing the rise of the BJP, has also compelled them to try luck in other parties. Byelection is due in five Assembly seats in Assam and the resignation of the senior leaders of the party has brought more worries for the Congress. Even as Sushmita's anti-BJP stand can turn even more firm after joining hands with Mamata, Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) feels that while holding such a responsible post as president of AIMC, her resignation from the party is indeed very shocking. “Sushmita Dev as AIMC president was leading lakhs of Congress women all over India. The Congress never expected this from her as it had always respected her talent and had given her a lot of opportunities to grow as a leader," said Bobbeeta Sharma, chairperson of the media department of the Assam PCC. “The Congress encouraged youth in politics and she was given the opportunity to become an MLA or an MP to serve the people at a very young age. Moreover, she is the daughter of a Congress stalwart — late Santosh Mohan Dev — whose rise in politics of Barak Valley and Assam was nurtured by our leaders like Indiraji and Rajivji. Being out of power should not be a reason to leave the party,” she added. Nevertheless, the PCC, in an official statement, wished Sushmita success in her new party and hoped she will continue to serve the public with all sincerity and integrity that a leader is expected to serve with. AICC general secretary Jitendra Singh recently expressed concern over leaders leaving the Congress, without citing any grievances. On the resignation of Sushanta Borgohain, he told TOI,”Leaders like Sushanta had no problem with the party. They are grateful to Congress but still leaving. Power corrupts.” Assam CLP leader Debabrata Saikia termed such resignations “temporary setbacks” but rued that senior leaders should first present their grievances on the party platform, before resigning. “Sushmita was president of the AIMC. She could have easily met the AICC president to express her feelings or if she was unhappy with any policy or functioning of the party. Such sudden resignations without citing any cause is unfortunate," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cong-shocked-clueless-and-blindsided-by-sushmita-exit/articleshow/85382897.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||World||Ivory Coast begins Ebola vaccinations after case confirmed in Abidjan||ABIDJAN: Ivory Coast begin vaccinating health workers in the commercial capital Abidjan against Ebola on Monday after a case of the deadly virus was confirmed over the weekend. An 18-year-old woman tested positive on Saturday after travelling by bus to Abidjan from neighbouring Guinea. It is Ivory Coast's first confirmed case of Ebola in 25 years. Workers at the hospital in Abidjan where the woman was admitted were the first to receive vaccinations as the health ministry officially launched its vaccination campaign. The country has 5,000 doses available, the ministry said. In total, health authorities have identified nine people the woman came into contact with, including three family members and six hospital staffers, the World Health Organization (WHO) told partners in a report. The woman and one suspected Ebola case are in hospital, it said. The WHO has said it is deeply concerned about the virus' presence in Abidjan, a densely-populated city of more than 4 million people. Ebola spreads through contact with body fluids and typically kills about half of those it infects, although vaccines and new treatments have proved highly effective in reducing fatality rates. In Guinea, the health ministry said on Monday that it would begin vaccinating, although it did not say when. The country was declared free of Ebola on June 19, after a four-month outbreak in the south killed 12 people. Authorities believe the woman who tested positive travelled from northern Guinea by bus, passing through the Nzerekore region in the southeast, where the last outbreak began. She then crossed Guinea's southern border into Ivory Coast and reached Abidjan several hundred kilometres farther south on Aug. 11. She was hospitalised the next day. WHO said preliminary genetic sequencing showed a close match between her case and the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak, which killed a record 11,300 people. That epidemic originated in southeastern Guinea before spreading to Liberia and Sierra. Last week, Guinea confirmed one death from the Marburg virus, West Africa's first case of the highly infectious hemorrhagic fever which is similar to Ebola.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ivory-coast-begins-ebola-vaccinations-after-case-confirmed-in-abidjan/articleshow/85382747.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Sushmita Dev may play key role for Trinamool in region||GUWAHATI: Congress’s most prominent face among the Bengali Hindus in the northeast and All India Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev’s resignation from the primary membership of the Grand Old Party may not help BJP anyway but can change the fortune of the Trinamool Congress in the region. As Mamata Banerjee is putting in all efforts to make the party’s presence felt in Tripura and Assam ahead of the 2024 general elections, Sushmita joined TMC on Monday and all set to get major responsibility to steer the Trinamool ship. Putting the Congress leaders in the dark, Sushmita shot off her resignation letter only to AICC president Sonia Gandhi dated August 15. BJP sources told TOI that there had been no communication between her and saffron leadership like in the case of scores of other leaders, from state to national level, who joined the saffron party this year. Sushmita has been a heavyweight leader from Assam’s Bengali-inhabited Barak Valley. “She was the face of Bengali Hindus for the Congress in Assam. But right now, she is more important for Tripura where the assembly election is due in 2023,” a Trinamool Congress leader said. Sushmita did not respond to multiple telephone calls from TOI since Monday morning. But it’s not only from the media, she even remains unreachable for senior party leaders, including AICC general secretary and Assam in-charge Jitendra Singh. The letter shot off to Sonia reads, “I cherish my three-decade long association with the Indian National Congress. May I take this opportunity to thank the party, all its leaders, members and workers who have been a part of my memorable journey.” She thanked Sonia for guiding and giving her opportunities and recollected the “enriching experience.” Her final words made it loud and clear about the new political affiliation which she was about to get. “I hope I have your good wishes as I begin a new chapter in my life of public service.” Even as the credibility of the letter was questioned by the likes of Jitendra Singh, Assam Congress president Bhupen Borah said Sushmita was highly demoralized after Congress’s defeat in two successive assembly elections in Assam. “Perhaps she was not morally strong enough to believe that Congress can reclaim the Barak Valley and Silchar seat from where she had been a MP. She was a stalwart in Congress and won’t enjoy such prominence in any other party,” said Borah, who informed that he had even approached the Congress high command to send her to the Rajya Sabha from somewhere in the country. “We had new plans for her. She was aware that Congress was trying to send her to the Rajya Sabha. Still, she left,” he rued. Borah said, “Sushmita was coordinating closely with him to formulate strategies for the upcoming municipal elections in the state.” The Trinamool Congress, in its official Twitter handle on Monday afternoon, confirmed her joining. “We warmly welcome the former President of All India Mahila Congress @sushmitadevinc to our Trinamool family!” It added, “Inspired by @MamataOfficial, she joins us today in the presence of our National General Secretary @abhishekaitc & Parliamentary Party Leader, Rajya Sabha, @derekobrienmp.” The photographs in the Twitter handle showed a contended Sushmita welcomed by TMC leaders Abhishek Banerjee and Derek O’Brien. Sushmita took to Twitter to praise Abhishek and Mamata’s leadership. “I arrived at Kolkata this morning accompanied by MP Derek O’Brien. I had the opportunity to meet Abhishek Banerjee. He has excellent vision and clarity for the party. All three of us went to meet the West Bengal chief minister at her office. There was an excellent discussion. Clearly, she has an excellent vision for the party and I hope to be helpful in that regard,” she said. Hailing from a family of freedom fighters with old Congress roots, Sushmita is the daughter of former Union minister Santosh Mohan Dev, who was a five -time MP from Silchar in the Barak Valley. But the Trinamool is expected to exploit her father’s Tripura connection to bestow key responsibilities on her to win Tripura, where several senior Trinamool leaders have been camping since the last few weeks. Santosh Mohan was elected from Tripura West constituency to the Lok Sabha in 1989 and again in 1991. The family still has relevance in Tripura politics. While Trinamool’s efforts to make a headway in Tripura amid alleged dissidence within the BJP have brought Mamata close to Sushmita, Congress insiders say differences started between her (Sushmita) and Congress started to crop up after the latter objected to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Sushmita and several other Congress leaders in the Barak Valley were supporting the citizenship law that has been welcomed by the Hindus in the Barak Valley. Another Congress source said she wanted MP Pradyut Bordoloi to be the next Assam PCC chief but the Congress high command picked AICC secretary Bhupen Borah for the task. Even as Trinamool and Congress will board the same ship to dethrone the BJP from power, the Congress leaders expressed anguish over her decision to desert the party in difficult times. “Sushmita was allowed to continue as All India Mahila Congress president even as she lost the Lok Sabha election in 2019. I am really anguished at her decision to leave Congress,” said Lok Sabha MP from Assam Gaurav Gogoi. AICC general secretary Singh was unable to speak to Sushmita till noon but was hopeful that she would take the “right decision”. “Sushmita and her father had upheld the Congress legacy for long. Sushmita is a capable lady and helped Congress to improve its tally in the Barak Valley in the last assembly election,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/dev-may-play-key-role-for-trinamool-in-region/articleshow/85382969.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Guwahati||Sushmita Dev’s exit will weaken Congress in Barak: Assam BJP chief||GUWAHATI: Reacting to former Silchar MP Sushmita Dev’s shift from Congress to Trinamool Congress, state BJP president Bhabesh Kalita on Monday said that it will not harm the BJP in any way. For the BJP, Sushmita’s departure from Congress will weaken the Grand Old Party, particularly in the Barak valley in Assam, as she was a strong leader in the valley. Kalita said, “It is her personal call to quit the Congress. We have nothing to say about it. But I can say one thing that even Mamata Banerjee will not be able to win and become the chief minister of Assam.” Coming down heavily on the Congress, he asked the state president of the Grand Old Party, Bhupen Kumar Borah, to find out ways to prevent the erosion in Congress. “The party has faced massive erosion. The state president of Congress should focus on finding ways to prevent it rather than staying engaged in criticizing BJP,” he said. Dev’s departure from the Congress following the exit of former Golaghat MLA Ajanta Neog (currently finance minister of Assam), former four-time Mariani MLA Rupjyoti Kurmi and former Thowra MLA Sushanta Borgohain is being considered as a major blow to the Congress. While Neog, Kurmi and Borgohain joined the BJP, Dev joined the TMC on Monday. Silchar MP Rajdeep Roy said, “Sushmita’s joining TMC was a bit of surprise for me as I had never thought that after having a relationship spanning over for four generations with the Congress, she will leave the party for personal political gains. The Congress is a sinking ship today. However, it was her personal call.” He added, “She is a great politician. She always wanted to work for the people. But probably things did not happen with the Congress leadership for which she had to take the call.” BJP national general secretary and Mangaldai MP Dilip Saikia said, “I welcome Sushmita Dev’s decision to quit Congress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/devs-exit-will-weaken-cong-in-barak-assam-bjp-chief/articleshow/85382974.cms||Mukut Das

Indian Oil chairman S.M.Vaidya flagged off the dispatch of the first batch on August 13 to retail outlets. Vaidya elaborated on the role of bio-fuel and bio-gas in the energy sector in the country saying these two are going to be the major gamechangers for Indian Oil in the near future. He stressed on the importance of increasing ethanol blending in the northeast, where it is still significantly low at only around 2 per cent. The chairman also shared Indian Oil’s plans for increasing bio-fuel production and supply, which includes a commitment to have pan-India 10 per cent ethanol blending by the end of next year. The energy demand in India has been on the rise rapidly, fuelled by economic expansion, urbanisation, evolving lifestyles and rise in spending power. While 98 per cent of the fuel used in transportation industry is met by oil from crude refining, the rest is met by bio fuels. India is currently importing 85 per cent of its crude oil requirement. The 2018 edition of the biofuel policy proposes a target of 20 per cent blending of ethanol in motor spirit by the year 2030, which has now been brought forward to 2025. As a part of this plan, supply of ethanol to the refineries in the northeast is being enhanced so that the percentage of ethanol blending for Assam and NE states may be increased substantially, Indian Oil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/bongaigaon-refinery-sends-out-ethanol-blended-motor-spirit/articleshow/85383026.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

She will spend one night at her native place and fly to Lucknow on Wednesday for a felicitation programme by the Uttar Pradesh government. Informing this, Lovlina's father Tiken Borgohain told TOI, “After attending the felicitation programme in Lucknow, she will go to Kolkata for some personal work, and then return home on August 25.” The bronze medalist, who is currently in New Delhi, will fly from the Indira Gandhi International Airport at around 11.30 am and land at Dimapur airport at around 2.10 pm on Tuesday. Dimapur airport, about 100 km from her hometown, is the nearest airport. Sarupathar MLA Biswajit Phukan and the Golaghat district administration will welcome her at the airport. She will be taken in a rally to the Barpathar High School playground from the airport where a felicitation programme has been planned by the district administration at 4 pm. A number of organizations, including the All Assam Tea Students’ Association (Aatsa) and All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu), and civilians will also felicitate her at the playground. A huge pandal has been erected for the welcome and felicitation ceremony. Banners, hoardings and billboards with Lovlina’s photographs can be seen everywhere. Lovlina was felicitated by the Assam government on Thursday at the Srimanta Sankardeva International Auditorium here. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had presented her with Rs 1 crore and offered the post of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) in the state police department. She flew back to Delhi the next day to attend the Independence Day event, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi met the Olympic medalists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/lovlina-to-return-to-her-native-village-today/articleshow/85383031.cms||Mukut Das
---||World||Overwhelmed Philippines hospitals hit by staff resignations||MANILA: Exhausted by the Covid-19 workload, Loui quit her job as an intensive care unit nurse at a private hospital in the Philippines earlier this year. The 30-year-old, who declined to give her last name for fear of reprisals, is among thousands of medical workers who have resigned during the pandemic, complaining of low pay and poor working conditions. Others have sought better jobs abroad. "We can't even take a proper day off because we are often called back to cover for other staff who were in quarantine or resigned," said Loui, who was earning 20,000 pesos ($394) a month, including overtime, before she quit in March. Hospitals fear the desertions have reached a critical point just as the Delta variant sends the number of cases soaring, as it has done elsewhere in Southeast Asia and worldwide. The Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines (PHAPi) estimated that 40% of private hospital nurses resigned last year, but more followed new waves of infections this year. Public hospitals are facing similar challenges. "If we want to increase bed capacity, that is easy, but the problem is the nursing component," PHAPi's president, Jose Rene de Grano, told Reuters. More than a year and a half into the pandemic, reported coronavirus infections in the Philippines have soared to more than 1.75 million, the second highest in Southeast Asia, while deaths have exceeded 30,000. 'Demoralised'Philippine Nurses Association President Melbert Reyes said he feared that hospitals could see even more nurses quit if their demands for better benefits and conditions went unmet. "A lot of our nurses are demoralised," Reyes told Reuters. Union leaders in several hospitals in virus hot spots last week threatened to strike, while a nursing group warned that dozens could resign over unpaid allowance and benefits. The state auditor last week flagged "deficiencies" involving 67.3 billion pesos, casting doubts on the regularity of related transactions in the health ministry's pandemic response. "But to the issue of whether the money has been stolen, that is pure bullshit," Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said in a weekly national address late on Monday. The lure of better paying jobs abroad is also making it harder to fill nursing vacancies, said Donnel John Siason, president of the union at the University of Santo Tomas hospital. This year nearly 7,000 nurses have moved abroad, including to the United States and Britain, joining hundreds of thousands of other Filipino nurses already working abroad. Dave Santos, a 39-year old nurse at the Quezon City General Hospital, said he hoped to leave the Philippines too. "We are giving our best," said Santos, a father of three. "But we are just people who get tired and we have needs."

They have been allowed to offer prayers inside the temple until August 20. In the wake of the second Covid wave, the 12th century shrine had been shut for devotees since April 24. The servitors and their family members were the first ones to be allowed to enter the temple on Thursday and Friday. “I am falling short of words to express my feelings on having a darshan of the deities after not being allowed to participate in many festivals, including the Rath Yatra,” Pradosh Tripathy, a resident of Puri town, said. The temple will reopen for all the devotees, irrespective of place of residence, from August 23. The devotees must either show their RT-PCR negative reports obtained 96 hours before their visit or the final vaccination certificates for a hassle-free access to the temple. The temple will remain closed on all Saturdays and Sundays in view of the weekend shutdown in Puri. The devotees can have a darshan from 7am until 7pm on the weekdays. The shrine will also remain shut on major festive occasions to avoid large congregations. According to the SOP issued last week, the Jagannath Temple will be closed for the devotees on Janmashtami, which falls on August 30 and also on Ganesh Chaturthi on September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/jagannath-temple-reopens-for-puri-urban-area-locals/articleshow/85382580.cms||---

---||World||Imran Khan endorses takeover of Afghanistan||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Monday endorsed the takeover of Afghanistan by Taliban saying the insurgent group has “broken the chains of slavery”. Referring to the developments in Afghanistan, Khan said that an enslaved mind can never do great things. “Only original thinking, not copies, prosper in the world,” he said, while slamming the adoption of clothing of different cultures. “When you adopt someone's culture you believe it to be superior and you end up becoming a slave to it.” Later on, Khan chaired a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC), Pakistan’s top civil-military body for decisions on security and foreign affairs, which was convened to deliberate on the emerging situation in Afghanistan. The civil-military leadership discussed latest developments in Afghanistan and their possible impact on Pakistan and the region and endorsed US president Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw troops from the neighbouring country. The NSC noted that Pakistan remained committed to an inclusive political settlement in the war-ravaged country as the way forward representing all Afghan ethnic groups. It was endorsed that Pakistan would continue to work with the international community and all Afghan stakeholders to facilitate an inclusive political settlement in the country. The participants also stressed that the principle of non-interference in Afghanistan must be adhered to despite claims by several countries that Pakistan’s military establishment was allegedly the main sponsor and supporter of the Afghan militants. Khan directed that all possible facilities be made available to repatriate Pakistanis, diplomats, journalists and staff of international organizations seeking to leave Afghanistan. The NSC reiterated Pakistan’s stance that the conflict in Afghanistan never had a military solution. “The ideal time to end the conflict through negotiations might have been when the US and Nato troops were at the maximum military strength in Afghanistan,” read a handout issued after the meeting. “The continuation of foreign military presence for a longer duration now would not have yielded a different outcome. Therefore, endorsement by the Biden administration of the previous US administration’s decision of troops withdrawal is indeed a logical conclusion to this conflict,” it stated. “It is now time for the international community to work together to ensure an inclusive political settlement for long term peace, security and development of Afghanistan/ the region,” the statement added. Earlier, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who met a delegation of Afghan leaders at the Foreign Office, urged the international community to cooperate and provide economic assistance for making the situation better in Afghanistan. Qureshi said that he had presented Pakistan’s point of view in the meeting with the delegation, which comprised representatives from all Afghan ethnic groups, and got the opportunity to understand the expectations the Afghan leaders have from his country. “We do not want Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries to face the effects of turmoil and chaos over there,” he said. A day earlier, Qureshi had said that “when the time comes, Pakistan will recognise the Taliban government in line with international consensus, ground realities, as well as Pakistan’s national interests”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/imran-khan-endorses-takeover-of-afghanistan/articleshow/85383456.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Guwahati||Blow to Congress as Sushmita Dev quits, joins Trinamool Congress in Kolkata||SILCHAR: Former Mahila Congress president and MP Sushmita Dev, who submitted her resignation from the Congress on Sunday, officially joined the Trinamool Congress in Kolkata on Monday. Sushmita’s exit has come as a huge jolt to the Congress in the state at a time when the party is failing to keep its flock together, losing several of its senior leaders to the BJP before and after the recent Assembly election. But, unlike her colleagues, who have jumped to the saffron party, Sushmita has chosen to go the TMC way. In a letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Sunday, Sushmita informed her about her resignation. However, she did not mention any reason behind her move to snap ties with the Congress. According to sources, Sushmita held a meeting with TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee at his office on Camac Street, Kolkata, on Monday afternoon. Sushmita will strengthen TMC: SinghSoon after that, she joined the TMC in his presence and that of Derek O’Brien. The TMC, via a tweet on Monday, confirmed her association with the party. The post (tweet) said, “We warmly welcome the former President of All India Mahila Congress @sushmitadevinc to our Trinamool family! Inspired by @MamataOfficial, she joins us today in the presence of our National General Secretary @abhishekaitc and Parliamentary Party Leader, Rajya Sabha @derekobrienmp". Sharing his reaction, TMC’s Cachar district general secretary Shanti Kumar Singh told TOI that the association of Sushmita with the TMC would strengthen the party to a great extent. “There is resentment among a large section of people in Assam and Tripura towards the present BJP government. Sushmita's inclusion in the party will really help it spread its wings across the northeast region,” he said. Sushmita, who is the daughter of seven-time parliamentarian (late) Santosh Mohan Dev and former MLA Bithika Dev, had begun her political career in 2009 after she was elected the chairperson of Silchar Municipal Board. She became an MLA in 2011 and later an MP in 2014. She lost to BJP's Rajdeep Roy in Silchar in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Congress party insiders said she was one of the most active leaders and someone who always inspired the party workers by her pro-active and dynamic attitude and naturally her resignation has come as a massive blow for the Congress. In the recently concluded Assembly elections in May, the Congress — which had partnered with Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) — was defeated by the NDA alliance. Since then, at least two prominent Congress legislators — Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain — have jumped ship to the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/blow-to-cong-as-sushmita-dev-quits-joins-tmc/articleshow/85383733.cms||BB Goswami
---||World||World leaders adapt to new Afghan political realities||PARIS: World leaders were adjusting to the new political reality in Afghanistan on Monday, the downbeat mood in the West leavened by a more pragmatic approach from some other powers.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the return of the Taliban to power as "particularly dramatic and terrible".  "It is terrible for the millions of Afghans who had worked for a freer society and who, with the support of the Western community, have focused on democracy, on education, on women's rights," she said.  It was also devastating for the loved ones of soldiers who paid with their lives in the NATO operation, she said. On Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose country holds the rotating G7 presidency, called for a virtual meeting of the group's leaders to discuss the crisis to agree a "unified approach".  Before the previous Afghan administration collapsed, Johnson had said Friday the UK and its partners should ensure "the government of Kabul does not allow that country, again, to be a breeding ground for terror".  French President Emmanuel Macron took a similar line in a televised address Monday.  Afghanistan should not once again become the "sanctuary of terrorism" that it had been until the US-led invasion two decades ago, he said.  "This is key for international security and peace... we will do everything for Russia, the United States and Europe to cooperate efficiently as our interests are the same," he added.  The European Union would set up an initiative to prevent large migrant flows from the country, he added. EU foreign ministers are to discuss the crisis on Tuesday. Russia, one of the few countries not evacuating its diplomatic staff from Kabul, said it was suspending judgment on the regime.  Foreign ministry official Zamir Kabulov said Russia would decide on recognising the new Taliban government based "on the conduct of the new authorities".  Moscow had "established working contacts with representatives of the new authorities", and Russia's ambassador was due to meet the Taliban on Tuesday.  A Chinese government spokesman said Monday Beijing was ready to deepen "friendly and cooperative" relations with Afghanistan.  "The Taliban have repeatedly expressed their hope to develop good relations with China, and that they look forward to China's participation in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan," said a foreign ministry spokeswoman.  Iran's new ultraconservative President Ebrahim Raisi saw the chance of something positive.  "The military defeat and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan should offer an opportunity to restore life, security and lasting peace in that country," said Raisi, quoted by his office.  While his statement did not directly mention the Taliban, it did say Tehran wanted good relations with its eastern neighbour and was "closely monitoring" developments there.  Iran hosts nearly 3.5 million Afghans, who make up nearly four percent of its population, according to the UN refugee agency.  Others meanwhile, welcomed the Taliban's return to power.  The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said it "congratulates the Taliban movement and its courageous leadership on this victory, which was the culmination of its long struggle over the past 20 years".  US President Joe Biden was due to address the nation later Monday, having cut short his holiday and returned to Washington.  His administration has come under heavy criticism, with even some allies arguing that once the US decided to pull out its troops they had no choice but to follow.  Addressing the rapid collapse of the previous Afghan government and its army to the Taliban, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday there was only so much the US could do.  "You can resource, you can train, you can support, you can advise, you can assist," he said.  "You cannot buy will, you cannot purchase leadership, and leadership was missing."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/world-leaders-adapt-to-new-afghan-political-realities/articleshow/85383876.cms||---

While most of these establishments aren't screening new releases just as yet, they engage audiences with themed weekend screenings. On Sunday, Gurgaon's Sunset Cinema Club combined the patriotic fervour of Independence Day with the newfound craze for hockey in India to host a special screening of the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chak De! India. Hockey has been talked about quite a lot courtesy the performances of the Indian men and women teams at the recently-concluded Tokyo Olympics. The men's team won a bronze medal there – India's first in hockey in 41 years – while the women's team finished fourth, their best ever finish. The twin triumphs have put the spotlight back on hockey and consequently Chak De, the movie most audiences connect with hockey. Sahil, owner of Sunset Cinema Club, says, "We wanted to screen a patriotic film for Independence Day but not necessarily a war film as that is not always family viewing. We wanted something light and given how hockey is being talked about so much right now, Chak De! India was the perfect fit." The organisers say they received a good response to the screening with about 20 cars in attendance. The screenings are conducted with all COVID safety protocols in place, say the organisers, with thermal screening and sanitisation of the audience members and proper social distancing at the venue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hockey-win-effect-chak-de-screened-at-gurgaons-drive-in-theatre-on-i-day/articleshow/85372770.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

Biren Singh has claimed that the state has achieved remarkable progress and development in the past four and a half years. Biren Singh said this while speaking at the 75th Independence Day celebrations at the parade ground of the 1st BN Manipur Rifles here on Sunday. The chief minister, who hoisted the Tricolour, also took the guard of honour and salute from 12 march-past contingents on the occasion. “The government’s pro-active efforts to make Manipur a blockade and bandh-free state to ensure its all-round development had resulted in drastic drop in such agitations in the past few years,” he said. The improvement in law and order has allowed the state to reap the benefits of peace and Manipur continues to excel in several areas, he said. In the second edition of Indian Innovation Index, 2020, prepared by Niti Aayog, Manipur was ranked third under northeastern and hill states category and first in the NE states category. The Manipur State Power Distribution Company Limited (MSPDCL) had been awarded the Best Performance Improvement Award and Overall Winner, he said. It also received Overall Innovation with Impact Award (Northeastern States) in 14th India Energy Summit 2021, the CM added. Stating that Manipur has seen significant improvement in law and order, he said altogether 1,039 rebels have laid down arms till date. Among them, 20 cadres of Thadou Peoples’ Liberation Army and valley-based groups surrendered in March this year, Biren Singh said. On the “War on Drugs campaign”, he said that the narcotics cells of the police department have been established in all the districts. Maintaining that one should never politicise the issues related to the drug menace, the CM said in the past four years and a half, the state's law-enforcement agencies seized over 1,000kg of opium and derivatives, more than 100kg of heroin and many other contraband substances. Informing that many clandestine brown sugar-processing laboratories have also been busted, Biren Singh said a fast-track court for trial of cases under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotopic Substanes (NDPS) Act was established in 2018. The court had disposed of 314 cases with 51 convictions and the separate special NDPS court had also disposed of 962 cases with 87 convictions since January 1, 2017, he said, adding that Manipur police had also arrested Kyaw Kyaw Naing, a Myanmarese national and an international drug dealer. The government has also helped poor farmers, who were affected after their poppy crop was destroyed, take up farming of other economically viable horticultural crops on a sustainable basis, the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/biren-drastic-drop-in-bandhs-and-blockades-in-manipur/articleshow/85378817.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma
---||World||Prince Andrew 'a person of interest' in Epstein probe: Source||WASHINGTON: US prosecutors probing the activities of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and others linked to US financier Jeffrey Epstein consider Prince Andrew a person of interest in the investigation, a source familiar with the US inquiry said. Investigators want to interview Andrew, Queen Elizabeth’s second son, about his friendship with Epstein as part of their inquiry into possible co-conspirators, the source said. As a person of interest he is viewed at least as a potential witness. Prosecutors in 2020 said Andrew had “sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” but had given no interview to federal authorities and had repeatedly declined requests to talk with investigators. While Andrew remains a person of interest to prosecutors in the office of the US attorney for the southern district of New York, they do not expect to be able to interview him in the foreseeable future, if ever, according to the source. "He doesn't seem to want to talk to us," said the source. Representatives of the Prince declined to comment. Earlier this month, Virginia Giuffre, who has said she was abused by Epstein, filed a civil complaint against Andrew in Manhattan federal court. Giuffre alleges Andrew forced her to have unwanted sexual intercourse at Maxwell's London home. Andrew has denied the allegation. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking minors. Ghislaine Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to charges that she procured teenage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse between 1994 and 2004. She is expected to go on trial in November. Prosecutors last year sent the British government a formal request, known as a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) submission, asking for access to the prince so they could talk to him. The MLAT is a procedure used in criminal investigations to gather material from foreign countries which cannot readily be obtained on a cooperative basis. Giuffre's lawyer had no immediate comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/prince-andrew-a-person-of-interest-in-epstein-probe-source/articleshow/85384836.cms||---

---||India||Govt denies Pegasus charge, says SC can appoint expert panel to probe row||NEW DELHI: The government on Monday denied allegations levelled against it in the Pegasus controversy and said it is open to the Supreme Court appointing a technical committee, comprising neutral and independent experts, to inquire into all aspects of the case — whether the spyware was purchased by the Centre, and, if so, which of its agencies used it and for what purpose. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta made this offer on behalf of the Union government to a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose shortly after senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for some of the 10 PIL petitioners, dismissed the Centre's two-page affidavit denying illegal snooping as an eyewash. The bench said a technical committee has certain limitations as it can go into the issue — whether the phones were infiltrated by Pegasus but no further. "How will a technical committee examine whether permissions by authorities were given for interception of telephones, whether procedures established by law were adhered to or not and who purchased the software? Experts can go into the angle of whether a particular software was used or not in the phones. Other issues about permissions and sanctions, procurement, which agencies did this, private or state, has to be examined by somebody. Who will examine that," it asked. Mehta responded, saying, "The committee can be authorised by the Supreme Court to go into all issues. The government has nothing to hide. The committee can comprise neutral and independent experts and authorised by the court to go into all issues. The government has no difficulty in agreeing to this. The Supreme Court using its powers under Article 32 of the Constitution can decide whatever will be the terms of reference for the committee. The committee then will be carrying the mandate from the Supreme Court to go into all issues." Earlier in the day, the Centre filed an affidavit by an additional secretary, in the ministry of electronics and information technology, who "unequivocally denied" the allegations made in the PILs and said, "A bare perusal of the captioned petition and other connected petitions makes it clear that the same are based on conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material. It is submitted that the same cannot be the basis for invoking the writ jurisdiction of the SC." The affidavit said, "With a view to dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests and with an object of examining the issues raised, the Union government will constitute a Committee of Experts in the field which will go into all aspects of the issue." At the outset, Justice Bose clarified that he had social interaction with two of the petitioners, including journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, and wanted to know whether anyone had objections to him being part of the bench hearing the issue. Mehta said if at all anyone could have an objection, it would be the Union government, which in this case did not have any reservations. Referring to the Centre's affidavit, Sibal, appearing for journalist N Ram and Sashi Kumar, termed it an eyewash and said the government revealed nothing as also its minister in Parliament. "There is an admission from the government in 2019 on the floor of Parliament that it was aware of 121 Indians being snooped upon through the use of Pegasus. What did they do? Did they lodge an FIR? Did they take the matter with Israel or started an inquiry as is being done by the USA and France? The government has to come clean on this," he said. Sibal said, "The government needs to answer simple questions which would not touch upon national security concerns as feared by the solicitor general. The government can answer whether it purchased Pegasus, for what price; which of its agencies used it and for what purpose. Once the government gives this answer through an affidavit filed either by the home secretary or the cabinet secretary, things would become clear. In reality, the government is answering none of these questions through its short affidavit." The SG challenged the petitioners by saying, "If the government files an affidavit saying that it has nothing to do with Pegasus, will the petitioners be satisfied and withdraw their PILs? I know they will not. The purpose of filing these PILs is not to find facts but to gain traction in some other area. If the government files a reply saying it has nothing to do with Pegasus, then they will want an inquiry into the truthfulness of the government statement. So why not have a technical expert committee mandated by the SC to go into all the issues raised by petitioners to arrive at the facts in the case?" The CJI-led bench asked the SG to think over in the next 24 hours whether the government would like to file a detailed affidavit and inform the court accordingly. It posted the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-denies-pegasus-charge-says-sc-can-appoint-expert-panel-to-probe-row/articleshow/85384994.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Air raid sirens sound in Israel after rocket fired from Gaza||JERUSALEM: Air raid sirens sounded in southern Israel on Monday after a rocket was fired from the Gaza Strip, the first since the 11-day war between Israel and Palestinian militants in May. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the rocket fire. It came hours after Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian gunmen during a late-night arrest raid in the occupied West Bank, killing four Palestinians in one of the deadliest battles in the area in years. The Israeli military said in a statement that it identified one rocket launch that was intercepted by aerial defense batteries. Amateur video footage appeared to show the rocket being intercepted over the southern town of Sderot. The rocket fire could jeopardize three months of relative calm since Israel and the militant group Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip struck a cease-fire. In the clashes earlier, fighting erupted in Jenin, a city in the northern West Bank where tensions have been high since a man was killed in fighting with Israel earlier this month. Israel's paramilitary border police said its forces were attempting to arrest a suspect when they "came under heavy fire from close range'' by a number of gunmen. It said Israeli forces returned fire, and none of its officers were injured. The official Palestinian news agency, WAFA, said four men were killed by Israeli fire and a fifth was seriously wounded. Amateur footage from the scene appeared to show an intense exchange of gunfire in the streets of Jenin. Senior Palestinian official Hussein Al Sheikh accused Israel of "a heinous crime'' and tweeted that "the international community should be ashamed of its silence about this and its failure to provide protection to the Palestinian people from this oppression.'' During the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, Jenin experienced some of the heaviest fighting with Israel, though the area has generally been quiet in recent years. According to the Israeli military, there have been at least eight clashes between troops and Palestinian gunmen over the past two months. The West Bank has experienced an uptick in deadly violence in recent months, with over two dozen Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in recent weeks, including children and Palestinian protesters. Israel's war in May in the Gaza Strip, driven by friction in at a contest Jerusalem holy site and attempts by a settler group to evict Palestinians in east Jerusalem, and the recent establishment of a West Bank settlement outpost have contributed to the tensions. Last week, Israel's military chief urged troops to follow professional regulations and "act with discretion" in light of the complexity of the situation. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and in the decades since has established dozens of settlements where nearly 500,000 settlers reside. The Palestinians seek the West Bank as part of their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to resolving the conflict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/air-raid-sirens-sound-in-israel-after-rocket-fired-from-gaza/articleshow/85385089.cms||---
---||World||Biden says he stands 'squarely behind' Afghanistan decision||WASHINGTON: Striking a defiant tone, President Joe Biden said Monday that he stands "squarely behind" his decision to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan as he acknowledged the "gut-wrenching" images coming out of the country after the swift Taliban takeover of the government. Biden said he had to choose between sticking to a previously negotiated agreement to withdraw US troops this year or sending thousands more service members back into Afghanistan to fight a "third decade" of war. Biden, sounding resolute in the face of withering criticism of his handling of the situation, said he chose the latter so as not to repeat past mistakes. He reiterated that he had no regrets. "I stand squarely behind my decision," the president told the nation in a televised address from the White House East Room after he flew back from the Camp David presidential retreat. "After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces." Many disagree with Biden's decision, angered by the chaos the world witnessed over the weekend as the Taliban ultimately captured Kabul, the capital, and Afghanistan's president left the country. Biden said he'd rather take the criticism over the fallout than pass the decision of how and when to withdraw to a fifth US president. He said the decision to leave Afghanistan is "the right one for America" because keeping a US presence there was no longer a US national security interest. Biden described the images coming out of Afghanistan -- especially at the airport in Kabul, where Afghans descended in hopes of fleeing the country -- as "gut-wrenching." Video of Afghans clinging to a US Air Force plane and running alongside it as prepared to take off had circulated widely on the internet. But he did not admit any US fault in how the drawdown was executed. And after batting away the notion of a rapid Taliban takeover when questioned a little over a month ago, Biden acknowledged Monday that "the truth is this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated." He pledged that the US will continue to support the Afghan people, push for regional diplomacy and speak out for the rights of Afghans. Senior US military officials said the chaos at the airport in Kabul left seven people dead Monday, including some who fell from a departing American military transport jet. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss ongoing operations. Afghans rushed onto the tarmac as thousands tried to escape after the Taliban seized power. Some clung to the side of a US military plane before takeoff, in a widely shared video that captured the desperation as America's 20-year war comes to a chaotic end. Another video showed the Afghans falling as the plane gained altitude over Kabul. US troops resorted to firing warning shots and using helicopters to clear a path for transport aircraft. The Pentagon confirmed Monday that US forces shot and killed two individuals it said were armed, as Biden ordered another battalion of troops -- about 1,000 -- to secure the airfield, which was closed to arrivals and departures for hours Monday because of civilians on the runway. The speed of the Afghan government's collapse and the ensuing chaos posed the most serious test yet of Biden as commander in chief, and he came under intense criticism from Republicans who said he had failed. Yet the president said the rapid end of the Afghan government only vindicated his decision, noting how the Afghan army surrendered to the Taliban. "American troops cannot and should not be fighting the war, and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves," Biden said. Biden, who is viewed as an experienced foreign policy hand dating to his decades-long career in the Senate, including as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, expressed confidence in his decision and said he was prepared to take the heat. He said he was "deeply saddened by the facts we now face, but I do not regret my decision." Biden is the fourth US president to confront challenges in Afghanistan and had insisted he wouldn't hand America's longest war to his successor. But he is under pressure to explain how security in Afghanistan unraveled so quickly, especially since he and others in the administration had insisted it wouldn't happen. "The jury is still out, but the likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely," Biden said on July 8. Just last week, though, administration officials warned privately that the military was crumbling, prompting Biden on Thursday to order thousands of American troops into the region to speed up evacuation plans. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump also yearned to leave Afghanistan, but ultimately stood down in the face of resistance from military leaders and other political concerns. Biden, on the other hand, has been steadfast in his refusal to change the Aug. 31 deadline, in part because of his belief that the American public is on his side. A late July ABC News/Ipsos poll, for instance, showed 55% of Americans approving of Biden's handling of the troop withdrawal. Most Republicans have not pushed Biden to keep troops in Afghanistan over the long term and they also supported Trump's own push to exit the country. Still, some in the GOP stepped up their critique of Biden's withdrawal strategy and said images from Sunday of American helicopters circling the US Embassy in Kabul evoked the humiliating departure of U.S. personnel from Vietnam. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell deemed the scenes of withdrawal as "the embarrassment of a superpower laid low."

About 3.5 crore people of the state’s total 4.5 crore population will soon get smart health cards under the scheme, which was launched three years ago on August 15. Making the announcemnet at the state-level celebration of the country’s 75th Independence Day, Naveen said the initiative will go a long way in transforming the healthcare service delivery system. “All the people of Odisha are my family. The news of people selling land, jewellery and not sending children to school to manage their treatment costs pains me. Therefore, I decided that this type of distress must go. People should get hassle-free quality treatment at the best available healthcare facilities. So Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana was redesigned to provide smart health cards to people that will work as debit cards for a certain amount,” Naveen said. It must be noted that Odisha is among the states that have not implemented the Centre’s flagship scheme, the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY). It has instead come out out with its own health insurance scheme. Government sources said the cards will be given to the beneficiaries in a phased manner from September 1. The eligibility criteria have been revised to include the beneficiaries of the National and State Food Security Schemes, the Annapurna and Antodaya Anna Yojana. So far, beneficiaries of the Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana, families living below the poverty line (BPL), the Antyodaya card holders and those with less than Rs 2 lakh annual income were included in the BSKY. While each family can avail themselves of treatment cost up to Rs 5 lakh per annum, women members can avail of this benefit up to Rs 10 lakh every year.  The beneficiaries can avail of the health services in more than 200 hospital chains in and outside Odisha. The government has empanelled 183 hospitals within the state and 17 outside for the purpose.  It will empanel more hospitals of national repute outside the state to provide cashless care to BSKY card holders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/state-health-scheme-to-cover-25l-more-families/articleshow/85385659.cms||---

The police said Tripal Naik from Odisha’s Kalahandi, who was working as a daily labourer in Goa, had developed illicit relationships with two women, also daily wagers from the district, and killed the babies born out of wedlock with the help of their mothers. While Naik (36) and one of the women were arrested on July 30, the other one was arrested on August 13. Both the women are in their twenties. The police came to know about the murder of the two infants in Goa while probing the allegations of abduction and rape against Naik. One of the two women recently lodged a complaint with Golamunda police station in Kalahandi accusing Naik of abducting and raping her. During investigation, the police came to know that Naik and the two women had reached Goa two weeks before the lockdown was imposed in 2020 and started working at a construction site there. Naik had allegedly promised to marry both the women, who were aware of each other’s affair with him, and both had also reportedly agreed to live together as his wives in his home. “In June this year, one of the women gave birth to a child in Naik’s home in Goa. Since the baby was born out of wedlock, Naik insisted that she kill the baby. Naik and the second woman killed the baby and buried the body in a forest,” Kalahandi SP Saravana Vivek M said. Last month, the other woman gave birth to a child. Naik allegedly killed her newborn as well and buried the body in the same jungle. The police said in both the cases, the women had allegedly given their consents to Naik to kill their babies and had also helped him destroy the evidence. After some days, the trio returned to their villages in Kalahandi. Naik landed in trouble when he refused to marry them. When one of the women lodged a complaint of abduction and rape against Naik, the police unravelled the murder angle during the course of investigation. “Our team took Naik to Goa where he identified the place where he had buried the babies. The police exhumed the skeletal remains of only one infant in Goa on August 5e. The post-mortem of the exhumed body was done by forensic experts of Medical College, Goa on August 6,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/kalahandi-man-kills-2-babies-born-out-of-wedlock-with-2-from-dist-in-goa/articleshow/85385673.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Please share your observations about Maharashtra.The programmes in Maharashtra and Kerala were developed as a collaborative initiative between CSIR and the state governments. There are designed for surveillance, to provide early warning and aid public health policy. A key observation about Maharashtra is the systematic and uniform genome sequencing across each district. This helped identification of emerging variants and the state government promptly applied public health measures. Maharashtra should be the role model for other states. The Delta Plus cases in Maharashtra have increased from 21 to 76 in a few days. Can we now say Delta-plus is the variant to watch out for? While Delta has become the predominant lineage in India and many parts of the world, the virus will continue to evolve by accumulating more genetic mutations. The Delta sub-lineages are popularly called Delta Plus lineages as they have additional mutations in the genomic background of Delta. These sub-lineages are increasing, but the number of cases is not yet significantly large. Considering Delta has already affected crores of Indians and wreaked havoc across the country during the second wave, can it still cause another wave? Waves of Sars-CoV-2 infection have occurred across the world as people loosen their vigil and public health measures, and also because the antibody levels from pre-existing infection or vaccines wane over time. While nobody can definitely predict which variant would emerge and cause the next wave, examples from the past from across the globe suggest the same variant could indeed cause multiple waves in a country. As a larger proportion of the population becomes immune through vaccination and/or previous infection, the infections resulting in severe disease and deaths would significantly come down and the infection would become endemic. What about Delta’s sub-lineages (in terms of their ability to cause a wave)?There are 13 sub-lineages of Delta as of date (AY.1 to AY.12 and AY.3.1). At this moment, it is not possible to predict which one would cause a wave as it also depends on the susceptible population in the region. However, as none of these emergent sub-lineages can so far fully escape the immunity due to previous infections or vaccines, it is our urgent priority to vaccinate the entire population. In terms of whole genome sequencing, India still lags way behind the global yardstick of testing at least 5% of all positive samples. What can be done to change this? It would be improper to directly compare… Currently the genome surveillance strategy in India is very diverse, with some parts over-represented and others highly underrepresented. For the surveillance to be informative and effective, it is important we have a uniform and long-term surveillance strategy for India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delta-variants-cant-escape-immunity/articleshow/85385113.cms||---

A court in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, found Stsiapan Latypau, 41, guilty of violating public order, resisting police and fraud, the Viasna human rights group said. Latypau will also have to pay a fine of about $3,500. In June, Latypau used a pen to inflict a wound on his neck while he was sitting in court in a defendant's cage. Videos posted online showed him being carried out of the courthouse and put into an ambulance. He was hospitalized and operated on, but a day after the surgery he was placed back into pre-trial detention. Before stabbing himself, Latypau told his father during the court proceedings that investigators had threatened to open criminal cases against his relatives and associates if he failed to admit his guilt. He had been in jail since September, when he was arrested during big protests against Belarus' authoritarian leader, President Alexander Lukashenko. The protests were triggered by Lukashenko winning a sixth term in an August election that the opposition rejected as rigged. Lukashenko responded to demonstrations, the largest of which drew up to 200,000 people, with repression that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police. Addressing the court Thursday, Latypau described how police beat him in custody and used a plastic bag to suffocate him. "I was crying, struggling to breathe in the plastic bag and they just laughed,'' he said. "The masked men beat me with their hands, their feet and using truncheons, they beat me simultaneously and then one by one. They beat me with their fists and palms over my ears, and it felt like a hand grenade exploding inside my head.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/belarusian-activist-sentenced-to-8-1/2-years-in-prison/articleshow/85385842.cms||---
---||World||Vaccine mandates grow in NY; NYC venues to start checking||NEW YORK: Vaccine mandates expanded Monday as New York state ordered hospital and nursing home workers to get Covid-19 inoculations and New York City was poised to start requiring them for anyone in restaurant dining rooms, gyms, museums and many other leisure venues.  The new policies aim to goad people into getting vaccinated as New York, like the rest of the US, confronts a coronavirus wave powered by the highly infectious delta variant of the virus.  As the variant posed a growing threat and vaccination rates leveled off this summer, some cities, states and federal agencies have rapidly shifted from encouraging vaccination to either-or requirements - inoculation or testing - to a flat-out insistence on vaccination for some settings or workforces.  "Just buy into this because it's going to work for all of us, is going to make us all safer," New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday.  In a nationwide first for a city government, the Democrat announced earlier this month that proof of vaccination would be required to partake in much of public life, from indoor dining to gym workouts to theater. Other cities, including San Francisco, later followed New York's move.  It applies to patrons, employees, New Yorkers, commuters and visitors alike in settings ranging from arenas to coffee shops to yoga studios. Even strip clubs are included.  There are exceptions for children under 12 - who are not yet eligible for vaccination - and athletes, contractors and some performers who don't live in the city. The policy also excludes church potlucks, community centers, office buildings, house parties (even if they're catered) and people ducking in somewhere to pick up food or use the bathroom, among other exemptions.  It goes into effect Tuesday, but enforcement won't begin until Sept. 13, to give the public more time to get vaccinated. City officials promised training for businesses on how to handle possible confrontations between patrons and staffers, who will be on the frontlines of checking vaccination status.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the city's most visited venues, said it was working on how to implement the new rule but was happy to comply.  "We wholly support all efforts to increase vaccination rates," spokesperson Ken Weine said.  New York state's new policy for hospitals and long-term care facilities follows vaccination requirements for health care workers in California, members of the US military, and patient care staffers in the federal Health and Human Services Department and Department of Veterans Affairs. Some private businesses, from Google to United Airlines, also have ordered employees to get the shot.  "Our healthcare heroes led the battle against the virus, and now we need them to lead the battle between the variant and the vaccine," said Cuomo, a Democrat who is leaving office later this month after resigning over sexual harassment allegations, which he denies.  The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New York has risen over the past two weeks from over 2,400 new cases per day to nearly 4,200, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. New York City averaged 2,000 new cases of coronavirus per day over the past seven days, up from around 200 per day in late June.  New York state took a more limited step late last month, requiring vaccination for staffers who work directly with patients at state-owned hospitals and veterans homes. Asked whether the new policy applies only to front-line workers, and whether it would also extend to such settings as medical offices and home health care, state Health Department spokesperson Jill Montag said the agency was working to finalize the details.  About 75% of the roughly 450,000 hospital workers statewide, 68% of the 145,500 nursing home workers and 74% of the 30,000 other adult care facility workers are fully vaccinated, Cuomo's office said in a release. That compares to about 58% of all New Yorkers, and 70% of those 18 and older.  The Greater New York Hospital Association, a statewide advocacy group, called workers' vaccination rates "impressive," while endorsing the new requirement.  "This is a critical moment requiring bold action," President Kenneth Raske said, noting that many hospitals already had their own vaccine mandates.  There was no immediate comment from SEIU 1199, a major health care workers' union, or the New York State Nurses Association, which represents 42,000 nurses.  Under the new policy, workers in hospitals, nursing homes, adult care, and other congregate care settings will have to get at least a first dose of vaccine by Sept. 27, with what the state called "limited exceptions for those with religious or medical reasons."  While officials are urging some people to get vaccinated, the Health Department on Monday authorized additional doses for people with severely weakened immune systems.  The federal government on Friday approved third doses of the usually two-shot Pfizer or Moderna vaccines for transplant recipients and other similarly immune-compromised patients, but not the general public.  New York had its own task force of scientists and health experts review the matter before giving the OK in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/vaccine-mandates-grow-in-ny-nyc-venues-to-start-checking/articleshow/85386198.cms||---

Finding that its angst over non-appointment of chairpersons and members to 15 tribunals had fallen on deaf ears, a bench of CJI NV Ramana and justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose brushed aside solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s submission that the “appointments are in the process” and said it has been hearing these words from the government for the last one year and four months and yet “nothing is happening”. The bench gave ten days for the government to keep its words on filling up the vacancies with names already recommended by statutory selection committees headed by sitting SC Judges. On August 6, the CJI-led bench had asked the SG to inform the court in 10 days about filling up of vacancies for which names were recommended long back. The tribunals include Armed Forces Tribunal, National Green Tribunal, DRT, CESTAT, ITAT, TDSAT, NCLT, NCLAT and Central Administrative Tribunal. It then questioned the passage of the bill for amending the Tribunal Reforms Act to nullify the July 14 Madras Bar Association case judgment, in which the SC had insisted on a five-year tenure for chairpersons and struck down ordinance provision prescribing a four-year tenure. “What we saw recently is — an ordinance, which was struck down by court, was made into an Act. I haven’t come across any debate which has taken place in Parliament. We have no problem that the legislature has the right and prerogative to make any law. But, we should know what are the reasons for the government to introduce this bill again after striking down the ordinance,” he said. “I’ve verified the newspaper reports. The finance minister has said the court has not struck it down on constitutionality; It has only raised certain questions on some points,” he said. The bench said, “(The finance minister is) absolutely right. Show us the debate, what are the reasons and all.. It is a serious issue. What are we to understand from this Bill and the Act? Tribunals are to be continued or closed? These are issues we have to consider.” Meanwhile, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh moved the SC with a PIL challenging the validity of the new law that overrides the SC’s July 14 judgment to amend the tenure and service conditions of tribunal chairpersons and members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fill-tribunal-vacancies-in-10-days-sc-to-govt/articleshow/85385162.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

A decline of 2% still left the state with 1.37 lakh new cases during the week, accounting for 54% of all infections detected in India during the period. Meanwhile, India on Monday reported under 25,000 new cases for the first time in over five months. There were 24,577 fresh cases on Monday, the lowest daily count recorded since March 13 (24,866), mainly on account of a sharp dip in testing on Independence Day (Sunday). Just 11.8 lakh Covid tests were conducted on Sunday, down from over 20 lakh on most days of the week. Last week (August 9-15), Maharashtra recorded less than 40,000 cases, its lowest weekly count in nearly six months. The last time Maharashtra had posted under-40,000 weekly cases was in February 15-21, when the count was 36,606. Last week’s count was a 9% decline from the previous week’s numbers (43,134). The weekly graph remained largely plateaued in Karnataka (-5%) and TN (-2%), with both states recording nearly 11,000 new cases. HP continued to record a surge in cases, posting a 31% rise over the previous week. The state logged 2,256 cases as opposed to 1,726 in the previous week. This was the third straight week of rising infections in the Himalayan state. Meanwhile, several states and UTs where the number of fresh infections remain fairly low, recorded a spurt in cases. These included Chandigarh, where weekly numbers rose from 24 to 51, a rise of 113%. Punjab saw a spurt of 35%, Gujarat 34%, Puducherry 14% and Dadra, Nagar Haveli Daman and Diu 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/6-weeks-on-kerala-sees-dip-in-tally-india-daily-cases-fall-below-25000/articleshow/85386245.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The pointy-eared cub is seen rambling solo along a mountain road burned by the Dixie Fire near Taylorsville, peering through brush and leaping through plants covered in fire retardant chemicals.  "Generally when you see them with a sow or a mother bear, they'll stay with the mother bear and run off," said firefighter Johnnie Macy, who was deployed from Golden, Colorado, to battle the fire. "This bear hasn't done that, so because of that we think that the bear's orphaned as a result of the fire."  Macy said on Sunday that they've been monitoring the cub for several days, to determine if it is an orphan. A wildlife rescue team was waiting to extract the emaciated cub from the burn-scarred area.  Macy called the situation "heartbreaking," but said it is "Mother Nature taking its course."  The Dixie Fire has been burning for more than a month and destroyed more than 1,000 homes and businesses with nearly 15,000 structures still under threat. Pacific Gas & Electric has said the fire may have been sparked when a tree fell on its power line.  A bear named "Smokey" is, of course, the most famous orphan cub in the country rescued from wildfire.  The badly burned bear was rescued from a New Mexico wildfire in 1950 and became the living, breathing embodiment of a national campaign launched in 1944 when the U.S. Forest Service and Ad Council agreed that a fictional bear would be the symbol for a fire prevention campaign.  Earlier this month, a bear cub with burns to its paws and nose was rescued from a fire in eastern Siskiyou County in California. Also this month, an injured cub tunneled out of a Lake Tahoe wildlife care center where he was being treated for burns sustained in a wildfire. The bear has since been spotted in the wild.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/emaciated-bear-cub-may-have-lost-mom-to-california-wildfire/articleshow/85386313.cms||---

Though a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Krishna Murari and V Ramasubramanian agreed to hear his petition along with many similar ones challenging Section 45(1) of PMLA which was amended by government to limit grant of bail to an accused, but it refused to grant Deshmukh interim protection. The bench said Deshmukh can avail remedy under Criminal Procedure Code and approach the appropriate forum for relief. The court agreed with solicitor general Tushar Mehta who alleged anticipatory bail cannot be granted on petition challenging validity of a provision. "It is submitted that admittedly, the petitioner seeks interim relief on the basis of some constitutional issues that the petitioner has raised. It is submitted that it is settled law that no interim relief can be granted merely on the drop of a hat by raising some or the other constitutional issue without making out a case on facts. Further, it is trite law that all statutory enactments are presumed to be constitutional until declared otherwise by the courts," Mehta said. Apprehending arrest after he was summoned and his assistant was arrested in a money laundering case, Deshmukh moved directly SC challenging Section 45(1) of PMLA and also for interim relief. Responding to Deshmukh's plea, ED in its affidavit alleged Deshmukh's family and his close associates are involved in "laundering the money by creating a complex web of structure of companies and their transactions". It said the former home minister received Rs 4.7 crore from various bar owners between months of December, 2020 to February, 2021. "During the course of investigation, it is further revealed that, in 2008, Zodiac Dealcom Private Limited, a company controlled by Deshmukh family raised bogus share capital from 18 Kolkata based other shell companies. The said 18 shell companies belong to a known entry operator namely Manohar Lal Nangalia and his partner Babu Lal Banka. Total security premium of Rs.9.82 Crore was raised. In 2010, company was taken over by Deshmukh Group of Companies. Even the registered address of Zodiac Dealcom is of the Kolkata belongs to Nangalia," the affidavit said. "Accordingly, search operations were conducted at Kolkata on June 2 at the premises belonging to Nangalia and his partner Banka and from their statements recorded, it is apparent that Zodiac Dealcom (Deshmukh company) has converted Rs 10 crore cash as share sale at premium and the company had no actual activity other than banking transactions," it said.. The agency said from analysis of bank account of various companies it appears that money/ fund have been rotated from M/s Zodiac Dealcom Pvt. Ltd., (a paper company), to various companies directly controlled by Deshmukh family and the same has been utilised for expansion of business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-relief-for-anil-deshmukh-ed-tells-sc-that-ex-minister-used-shell-company-for-money-laundering/articleshow/85386374.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||World||Pfizer submits data for third dose approval in US||WASHINGTON: Pfizer and BioNTech on Monday submitted preliminary clinical data to US health authorities as part of their effort to seek authorization for a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine for all Americans.  Last week, the United States approved the booster shot of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for people with weakened immune systems.  Pfizer and BioNTech presented the results of their Phase One trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of a third shot.  "The data we've seen to date suggest a third dose of our vaccine elicits antibody levels that significantly exceed those seen after the two-dose primary schedule," Albert Bourla, Pfizer's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement.  "A booster vaccine could help reduce infection and disease rates in people who have previously been vaccinated and better control the spread of virus variants during the coming season," said BioNTech Co-founder Ugur Sahin.  The companies plan to submit the same information to European authorities in the coming weeks.  The move comes despite appeals by the World Health Organization for a moratorium on booster shots to help ease the drastic inequity in dose distribution between rich and poor nations. Israel has also began administering third doses to its citizens.  An advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions, a top US healthcare agency, is slated to meet in late August to discuss the approval of a third dose of the vaccine for adults over 65, care home residents and healthcare workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pfizer-submits-data-for-third-dose-approval-in-us/articleshow/85386400.cms||---

Environmentalists are alarmed and have flagged it as a move that could have disastrous consequences — the land could cave in any time and because most of these sites are in forest and riverbed areas, they would be in the direct line of impact if a landslide or flood hit. There are about 350 muck disposal sites along the 900-km project. On Saturday, state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj asked officials to come up with an action plan to develop 54 of these sites as “tourism spaces”. Of the 54 dumping zones being considered for this, a source told TOI, 30 are between Tanakpur and Pithoragarh, 10 between Dharasu and Yamunotri, six between Rishikesh and Mana, five between Rudraprayag and Gaurikund, three between Rishikesh and Dharasu, and one from Dharasu to Gangotri. “The move is also meant to generate employment,” an official told TOI. Many of these sites are also in ecologically sensitive forest areas or near river beds. “Concretising them would damage forests and alter the course of rivers. If a flood or landslide hit, these areas would be directly affected,” said environmentalist Reenu Paul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttarakhand-plans-hotels-on-char-dham-road-muck-sites-experts-raise-alarm/articleshow/85386354.cms||Shivani Azad

It asked the state government to consider issuing directions to police throughout the state to ensure it does not happen again. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka pointed out that the photographs placed before the court from March last year shows schoolchildren (two boys and a girl) being interrogated by five police personnel — four of them in full uniform and at least two carrying firearms. The bench noted that deputy superintendent of police Basaveshwar had not dealt with the photographs in his affidavit filed at the same time last year. What action has been taken against official, asks courtPrima facie this is a serious case of violation of rights of children and provisions of and Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act. We direct the state to respond by filing a response stating on record what action has been initiated against the police official who interrogated schoolchildren while wearing uniforms and while carrying firearms,” the bench said. The court noted that only plain clothes police personnel can interact with children, and where a girl is involved, women personnel should be brought in. It asked the DG and IGP to nominate a higher level officer to look into the violations and file a response by September 3, before the next hearing in the case. Acting on a complaint filed by an activist, Bidar police had booked a sedition case against the Shaheen group of institutions on January 26 last year over the staging of a play against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) on January 21. One of the girls in the play allegedly uttered an anti-Modi slogan. In March 2020, granting bail to management staffers, a district and sessions court had said there was nothing seditious in the play. The HC is hearing a PIL filed by advocate Nayana Jyothi Jhawar and South India Cell For Human Rights Education and Monitoring. The petitioners have sought a departmental inquiry and consequential action against police personnel for illegal questioning of minor students of the school. In addition, the petitioners have prayed for grant of compensation to parents or legal guardians of the children who were subjected to illegal questioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/grilling-shaheen-kids-violation-of-jj-act-hc/articleshow/85386410.cms||---

After the girl’s parents, both farmers, lodged a complaint, police found out that the girl’s family and the arrested person — a farmer who lives next door — frequently quarrelled over the broken dentures. VIJAYAPURA MURDERAccused lured girl with goodiesThe police officer said Sanganagouda Babugouda Biradar was angry that his mother was finding it difficult to consume food without the dentures. In the second week of August, Biradar lured the girl with goodies and took her to the stream, tied her hands and legs before assaulting her and dumping her in the stream, he said. The accused is in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-kills-girl-6-for-breaking-dentures-held/articleshow/85386411.cms||---

---||Business||Fuel pricing: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman blames UPA’s oil bonds||NEW DELHI: Accusing the UPA of “trickery”, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said the Modi government was paying for the Rs 2.5 lakh crore liability of oil bonds. “If I did not have the burden to service the oil bonds, I would have been in a position to reduce excise duty on fuel… Previous government has made our job difficult by issuing oil bonds,” the minister told reporters, adding that when the NDA came to power in 2014, it should have released a white paper on the liabilities inherited by it. While many saw the FM’s comment as an indication of the Centre’s inability to pare taxes on petrol and diesel, at least for the time being, Sitharaman maintained that she was “not suggesting anything” on changing the levies. The remark triggered a strong retort by the Congress, which accused the Centre of increasing taxes on auto fuel and pocketing Rs 4.5 lakh crore during the last fiscal year. Sitharaman, however, said that in 2013, taxes on fuel were “apparently brought down” but oil companies were made to bear the burden of oil bonds of around Rs 1.4 lakh crore, with taxpayers having to repay the debt for several years. Interest liability over the period is estimated at around Rs 1.1 lakh crore, according to estimates available with the finance ministry (see table). The final tranche of oil bonds is due for repayment in 2025-26. “Modi 2.0 is paying for the price reduction of 2013. The central government reduced prices, put the burden on oil companies and went away,” she said. Accusing the government of “falsehoods”, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted: “Don’t lie. Oil Bonds of 1.3 lakh CR are not even due for payment so far… Till April 2021, payment made on Oil Bonds is ?3,500 CR only, yet (yo)u falsely hold UPA responsible!” In the past, several economists have criticised the UPA for showing healthy financing by postponing the subsidy liability by issuing bonds that mature later and come with interest liability. With petrol prices crossing the Rs 100 a litre mark in several parts of the country, Sitharaman has been under pressure to reduce taxes on auto fuel as levies account for over half the pump prices. The government has so far refrained from doing so. Last year, as global oil prices fell and government finance were hit by the lockdown, the Centre as well as the states had raised levies. When asked about Tamil Nadu government’s move to reduce VAT, Sitharaman suggested that it was up to states to decide on the issue and argue that some of the states had only partially rolled back higher levies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fuel-pricing-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-blames-upas-oil-bonds/articleshow/85386419.cms||---

---||India||No Air India flights, IAF begins to evacuate stranded Indians||NEW DELHI: Describing the security situation in Kabul as having deteriorated significantly, and one changing rapidly, the Centre on Monday said it would stand by Afghans, who had been India’s partners in the promotion of “mutual developmental, educational and people-to-people endeavours’’. The statement is important keeping in mind a spurt in the number of Afghans queuing up in the past few weeks for Indian visas, fearing the worst from a vengeful Taliban, and is in addition to India’s promise to look out for Hindu and Sikh minorities who might want to seek refuge here. While the Centre didn’t confirm the number of Indians in Afghanistan citing security reasons, it is believed there were still a few hundred Indian nationals, other than security personnel, in Kabul till Monday evening. India deployed two IAF heavy-lift military aircraft on Sunday night to evacuate its nationals. The first C-17 Globemaster-III aircraft landed at Kabul at 11 pm on Sunday, picked up some passengers, including diplomatic staff, and then returned to India on Monday morning. The second C-17 was likely to land in Delhi late on Monday night, with sources saying more such sorties are being planned. Both the external affairs and defence ministries, however, were tight-lipped about the evacuation plans, apparently because of security reasons. The government said in a statement it’s in touch with Indian nationals who wish to return and also representatives of Afghan Sikh and Hindu communities. “We will facilitate repatriation to India of those who wish to leave Afghanistan,’’ said the foreign ministry. India also said commercial operations from Kabul airport had been suspended on Monday and that this had forced a pause in the repatriation efforts. “We are awaiting the resumption of flights to restart the process,” it said. The statement suggests that the government is not sure if a breakneck military evacuation can be carried out. Sources said there was too much uncertainty in Kabul for such efforts though no option is ruled out. Afghanistan was reported to have “released to the military’’ its airspace forcing commercial airlines to divert their flights. The Centre’s statement also suggests it is not considering shutting down the embassy even temporarily. Afghan nationals who have helped India with its developmental efforts will most likely see any such step as a betrayal. The government still has the option of scaling down diplomatic presence or running the embassy through local employees for a while. A decision is expected in the next few days. The government said it is closely monitoring all developments in Afghanistan. ``We have been issuing periodic advisories for the safety and security of Indian nationals in that country, including calling for their immediate return to India. We had circulated emergency contact numbers and had also been extending assistance to community members. We are aware that there are still some Indian nationals in Afghanistan who wish to return and we are in touch with them,’’ said the statement. “The situation in Afghanistan is being monitored on a constant basis at high levels. The government will take all steps to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals and our interests in Afghanistan,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-air-india-flights-iaf-begins-to-evacuate-stranded-indians/articleshow/85386522.cms||Sachin Parashar
---||India||Taliban try to allay fears of Afghanistan’s Hindus, Sikhs||AMRITSAR: Hours after entering Kabul, representatives of Taliban met leaders of the Sikh and Hindu communities in the Afghanistan capital and asked them not to be scared of them or leave the country. Instead, said a Sikh living in Moscow who has been in touch with his family in Kabul, they have shared their mobile phone numbers with them and asked them to contact the Taliban in case they faced any difficulty. Minorities have been expecting reprisal attacks by Taliban and a reversal of freedom they enjoyed under US occupation. However, for now, they are of the view that they can breathe easy. The Taliban have, however, asked them to raise white flags to avoid any misunderstanding. “On Sunday night, the Taliban entered Kabul. On Monday morning, a couple of their representatives went to Gurdwara Karte Parwan and met the representatives of Sikhs and Hindus. They (Taliban) asked them not to be frightened or leave the country,” said Charan Singh, an Afghan Sikh who is in Moscow at present. The two minority communities in Kabul had either confined themselves to their homes or took shelter at Gurdwara Karte Parwan, one of the six gurdwaras in Kabul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/taliban-try-to-allay-fears-of-afghanistans-hindus-sikhs/articleshow/85386530.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Business||How the pandemic put Tier-II cities on busy aviation map||MUMBAI: Unlike other metros, Mumbai with its congested single-runway airport offered a rather poor choice of direct flights to several Tier-II cities, pre-pandemic. With new work, travel and leisure trends in the past one year, though, flights to non-metros have become increasingly prominent on the city airport’s radar. Till July this year, 64% of the passengers who passed through Mumbai airport were those travelling to or returning from a non-metro on a direct flight, said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. After the lull in domestic travel brought on by the Covid-19 second wave in summer, the non-metro routes are back this month with the launch of four weekly direct flights from Mumbai to Bareilly and the relaunch of 18 weekly direct flights to Tier-IIs such as Ajmer, Porbandar, Tirupati and Vishakhapatnam. Last mon- th, Gwalior had joined Mumbai airport’s direct flight list. “Between January and July, Mumbai airport handled over 75 lakh domestic passengers, of whom over 48 lakh were flying to or from about 60 non-metros,” said a Mumbai International Airport ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. These included leisure travellers and passengers flying between home and their work city as is evident from the top three non-metro destinations out of Mumbai during this period — Goa, Ahmedabad and Varanasi — that is. But metro airports were the traffic kingpins with Delhi and Bengaluru among the overall top three domestic destinations out of Mumbai. Kapil Kaul of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, an aviation consultancy firm said, “Non-metro to metro routes are increasingly seeing more flight deployment during COVID. Prior to Covid, flight operations from Mumbai, especially to non-metros were significantly constrained due to capacity shortage.” The spike in demand for flights to non-metros began last year after domestic flights were restarted on May 25 following a two-month ban. In the new normal, business travel was negligible, metro-to-metro travel was down as flights packed migrants fleeing cities for their homes in tier-IIs realigned domestic air traffic pattern. According to Airports Authority of India statistics, the Tier-II destinations recovered faster, they registered a lower drop in passenger traffic as compared to the metros by the end of last fiscal. For instance, while Mumbai airport saw a 71% drop in passenger traffic in 2020-21 as compared to the previous year, the corresponding drop was 57% for Lucknow, 51% for Ranchi and Raipur, 48% for Varanasi, 40% for Patna, 25% for Gorakhpur, 13% for Pathankot, and so on. Kaul said, “We will see mo- re operations to non-metros as Mumbai airport now has capacity available and airlines like IndiGo are keen to broaden their network.” Prior to Covid, the airport’s lone runway handled about 950 flights in 24 hours. Today, it handles an average of 300 flights, less than a third of its capacity. A low-cost airline official said, “Regional connectivity scheme never really took off in Mumbai due to airport slot constraints. People bound for non-metros had to transit via Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata etc with no direct flights to smaller cities. But Covid has cha- nged that, for now at least.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/how-the-pandemic-put-tier-ii-cities-on-busy-aviation-map/articleshow/85386554.cms||Manju V
---||World||Afghanistan airspace shut for civilian planes, mayhem at airport, 7 die amid desperation to exit||The tarmac of Kabul airport turned into a tragic centrepiece of the Taliban’s conquest of Afghanistan on Monday as five people were reported killed amid a scramble to clamber onto any aircraft readying for take-off, including a US military plane that was seen taxiing with hundreds running along like it were a giant bus that could be stopped to squeeze in a few more passengers. The unfolding theatre of the absurd was capped by the Taliban political office declaring to Al Jazeera TV, “Thanks to God, the (20-year) war is over”. The Taliban also sought to stem the panic that has swept Kabul, saying “life, property and honour of no one shall be harmed but must be protected by the mujahideen”. None of these statements, of course, had any calming effect on the chaos at the airport, exacerbated by Afghan gunmen attacking US forces stationed at the terminal. Two of the gunmen were killed in retaliatory fire, the Pentagon said later. Press secretary John Kirby said one member of the US team had been reported injured. US troops also fired in the air to deter people trying to force their way into the military flight evacuating diplomats and embassy staff, another official said. It was unclear if the five people reported killed in the chaos at the airport were shot or died in a stampede. The Pentagon said US forces were working with Turkish and other international troops to clear Kabul airport to allow evacuation. US forces have taken over air traffic control at Kabul, it announced. With Afghanistan airspace shut for commercial planes, several Indians waiting to return home were left stranded in Kabul as Air India could not operate its Delhi-Kabul return flight that was to fly home over 160 people. Declaring Kabul airspace "uncontrolled", the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority issued two notices to airmen, advising overflying commercial aircraft to reroute. For Indian airlines flying overseas, it means taking longer routes. Far from the ravages of war in Kabul, a special session of the United Nations Security Council culminated in the US promising to be generous in resettling Afghans on its soil. It urged its neighbours to give refuge — temporary or permanent — to Afghans fleeing the Taliban. President Joe Biden remained combative in the face of mounting criticism, both within and without, of the US pullout that paved the way for the Taliban's return. He said the US's "longest war" had ended and the onus was on Afghan forces to fight back the Taliban. "If President Biden truly has no regrets about his decision to withdraw, then he is disconnected from reality when it comes to Afghanistan," Republican senator Lindsey Graham tweeted. British PM Boris Johnson intends to host a virtual meeting of G7 leaders to discuss the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, his office said on Monday, as the government stepped up efforts to evacuate its citizens from Kabul. Al Jazeera broadcast footage of what it said were Taliban commanders in the presidential palace, ringed by dozens of fighters. Mohammad Naeem, spokesperson for the Taliban's political office, said the contours of Afghanistan's new government would be made known soon. Saying the Taliban did not want to "live in isolation", he called for peaceful international relations and sought to project a moderate face by promising the regime would respect women's rights and protect both foreigners and Afghans. Runaway Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who fled Kabul on Sunday to let in the Taliban unopposed, said in a statement that he did so to "avoid bloodshed".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghanistan-airspace-shut-for-civilian-planes-mayhem-at-airport-7-die-amid-desperation-to-exit/articleshow/85386491.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The former students (names withheld on request) passed out between 2016 and 2020, GB University PRO Arvind Singh said. “All are safe as per my interaction with them on Sunday night,” he added. One of the students was posted in the presidential palace that has now been captured by the Taliban. Singh said fearing for their families’ safety, all of them are keeping a low profile and observing the developments. The former students blame the US exit policy and Pakistan for the Taliban’s takeover of the country and the political turmoil, he added. “They fear education could be in jeopardy and social security will be lost. They also feel cheated by outgoing Afghan President Ashraf Ghani who fled Kabul,” Singh said. Many students who had gained admission through Indian Council for Cultural Relations scholarships were expected to join this year. Now, however, they are in no position to confirm whether they will be able to. “We don’t know whether they will report for admission or not. The last date for taking admission is September 15,” Singh said. Situation not so alarming, say a few at ShardaAt Sharda University, a total of 173 Afghan students are part of the batch of 2021. Several students TOI spoke to supported the Taliban takeover favouring Sharia law. Mirwais Zarmalwal, a final-year BCA student, is from Kabul and plans to learn filmmaking in India. According to him, the situation is not as alarming as it is made out to be. “There is no problem in Afghanistan. Taliban have a grievance with the government and not with the people… They have also said they will work for the development of the country,” Mirwais said, adding that he looks forward to meeting his parents and his brother once back home. There is anxiety among the students as well. Abdul Saboor, a fourth-year BMLT (bachelor of medical lab technology) student, said, “We are very scared and don’t feel safe. We are not going to be in India forever. We hope that the UN intervenes and helps our citizens. My father was an engineer with the former Afghan government but is not working now. We do not know what our future will be.” Abdul said he wants to work in India and is training as a lab technician at Sharda hospital. Qudratullah Achakzai, who is in the third semester of MSc (water resources and environment), is concerned about his parents and siblings too. “I may call my parents to India if the situation demands,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/anxiety-among-af-students-and-a-voice-of-support/articleshow/85384852.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||World||Afghanistan crisis: Regional power shift comes as a worry||NEW DELHI: Will China be the first P5 country to recognise the Taliban emirate of Afghanistan? Beijing’s statement on Monday that it “welcomed” the opportunity to deepen ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban overran it and took power on Sunday, seemed to be pointing to that possibility which will have major implications for regional security and competition among the great powers. “The Taliban have repeatedly expressed their hope to develop good relations with China, and that they look forward to China’s participation in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. “China respects the right of the Afghan people to independently determine their own destiny and is willing to continue to develop... friendly and cooperative relations with Afghanistan.” The Chinese statement came even as the UN Security Council convened an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the Afghan situation, where the Afghan representative, a nominee of the deposed government, mourned the future of Afghan women and girls in a Taliban emirate. China took a more cautious stance at the UNSC, but it seems pretty clear Beijing is willing to engage the Taliban perhaps in return for economic concessions and access to Afghanistan’s considerable mineral wealth. Russia was the second P5 country to take a welcoming stance. Zamir Kabulov, the Russian special envoy, who has long been supportive of the Taliban, told Reuters that his country was already talking to the Taliban. “They are talking in Kabul. All contacts are being made there at the moment. The embassy is dealing with this,” Kabulov was quoted as saying. Neither China nor Russia had recognised the previous Taliban dispensation which was deemed to be a legitimate entity only by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, besides its chief patron Pakistan. Pakistan has generally stayed quiet, but Imran Khan broke away from the restraint on Monday to say Afghanistan had broken the shackles of “slavery”, referring to the US occupation of Afghanistan. Being Taliban’s longest supporter, Pakistan exerts considerable influence on them. Iran also issued a cautious welcome to the Taliban in Kabul, with its new president Ebrahim Raisi saying on Monday “America’s military defeat and its withdrawal must become an opportunity to restore life, security and durable peace in Afghanistan,” even as he asked “all groups in Afghanistan to reach a national agreement”. While Saudi Arabia and UAE have not revealed their stance, Qatar has promised to facilitate diplomatic evacuations out of Afghanistan, and Bahrain, which takes its foreign policy cues from Riyadh, has promised to start a GCC conversation on Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghanistan-crisis-regional-power-shift-comes-as-a-worry/articleshow/85386916.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Soon, 10% of Covid tests to focus on 0-19 age category||BENGALURU: The state government, which has on average been conducting more than 1.5 lakh tests a day in the past fortnight, will soon turn its focus on those in the 0-19 years age group as part of a renewed strategy to prevent a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections. Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer for Covid-19 testing in Karnataka, said: “The strategy in the coming days would be to give special attention to children aged up to 19 years. We have advised that at least 10% of daily tests be focused on this category, and it will begin soon.” He added that this would be achieved through random testing — both in the community and in schools and colleges — and priority districts such as Bengaluru and those with a high test positivity rate would implement this sooner than other districts. “But the strategy is for all districts to begin this, and it should happen soon,” he said. While Dr Manjunath did not elaborate any further, another official said that the focus on children is being advised as that category is not part of the inoculation drive and had been largely protected in the previous waves by containment measures. Peak testingKarnataka, whose 2020 peak testing was 1,589 per million each day, has been doing more tests each month since the second wave hit the state with the highest achievement reported in June. While the state crossed the 4-crore milestone earlier this month, nearly 48% of these tests — more than 1.9 crore — have been conducted in just four-and-a-half months since April. As of August 15, the state had conducted 4.09 crore tests, and the overall positivity rate stood at 0.86%. With more than 22.6 lakh tests conducted in the first 15 days of August, the state has conducted at least 2,250 tests per million (TPM) every day on average, which is nearly at par with the number of tests done overall in June. While August testing is already about 41% more than the first wave peak — 1,589 TPM reported in November 2020 — officials said that the month could end with more tests done than even in June. As reported by TOI earlier, overall testing in the state has been reasonably high, although some experts believe that it could be improved further, given that some states and UTs like Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Delhi, have reported a higher TPM than Karnataka in recent weeks. Dr Manjunath said: “At around 1.5 lakh tests per day, the numbers we are doing at present is very good as the overall positivity rate except in some districts is under 1%. But if need arises, the target will be increased to about 1.75 lakh to even 2 lakh per day.” At the present rate, Karnataka would end August with around 45.2 lakh tests, but officials said that the state could end up with more tests than that, which would make the average tests the highest since the pandemic broke in early 2020||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/10-of-covid-tests-to-focus-on-0-19-group/articleshow/85387010.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||World||India calls for ‘zero tolerance’ to Taliban terrorism at UN, says there are ‘opportunities’ in midst of challenges||NEW DELHI: India called for “zero tolerance” to terrorism by the Taliban dispensation in Afghanistan saying that in the middle of challenges there were “few opportunities”. Addressing an emergency UN security council meeting on Monday evening, India’s ambassador, T S Tirumurti said, “the current situation prevailing in the country is of great concern to us in India.” Saying that prior to the current unrest, India had ongoing development projects in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, Tirumurti said, “It is time for the international community to come together unitedly, rising above any partisan interests, to support the people of Afghanistan in their desire for peace, stability and security in the country and to enable all Afghans, including women, children and minorities, to live in peace and dignity.” Tirumurti said, “the current situation in Afghanistan has numerous challenges.

Addressing an emergency UN security council meeting on Monday evening, India’s ambassador, T S Tirumurti said, “the current situation prevailing in the country is of great concern to us in India.” Saying that prior to the current unrest, India had ongoing development projects in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, Tirumurti said, “It is time for the international community to come together unitedly, rising above any partisan interests, to support the people of Afghanistan in their desire for peace, stability and security in the country and to enable all Afghans, including women, children and minorities, to live in peace and dignity.” Tirumurti said, “the current situation in Afghanistan has numerous challenges. However, there are a few opportunities. If there is a zero-tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and it is ensured that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country, then Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region would feel safer.

Sarkar managed to reach the airport when the Taliban militia started entering Kabul and was lucky to board the last Air India flight which took off in the evening and landed in Delhi around 9pm on Sunday. “It was a horrible rush against time,” Sarkar told TOI after reaching a friend’s place in Delhi. “On Saturday night, there were blackouts and massive power outages. I lived close to the airport where US troops are stationed and thought it was a safe place. But on Sunday everything changed. We got an urgent reminder from the US embassy to burn all sensitive documents related to staffers and beneficiaries and leave as soon as possible. It was a horrible situation. Some of my colleagues went to banks to withdraw money but the banks had crashed. We sent the Afghan nationals home from office even as some of us frantically tried to destroy all documents. It was just a matter of hours,” recounts Sarkar. “Usually it takes 15-20 minutes to reach the airport from where I lived in Kabul but on Sunday the stretch was packed with thousands of cars and it took me over an hour. Thankfully, there were no attacks or checkpoints yet,” said Sarkar. Sarkar is now worried about the fate of her colleagues and their families, some of whom are already being targeted and threatened for working with American organisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/it-was-a-horrible-rush-to-catch-the-last-flight-home/articleshow/85387158.cms||Dipawali Mitra

He was speaking on the sidelines of a Prasar Bharati event to launch the second season of ‘Rag Rag Mein Ganga’, a Doordarshan travelogue, which is due to be aired on DD National every Saturday and Sunday from August 21. Exhorting everyone to turn mission ‘Clean Ganga’ into a people’s movement, Thakur said, “Gau, Gita, Gayatri and Ganga are integral part of Indian culture, and they touch our daily life positively. Let us all come together an contribute towards rejuvenation of Ganga.” The season of ‘Rag Rag Mein Ganga’ comprises 26 episodes and will cover cultural, mythological, historical and socio-economic details of the Ganges while centering the focus on its ‘Nirmalta (cleanliness)’ and ‘Aviralta (uninterrupted flow)’, a Doordarshan official said. The travel series will also establish the work being done by the National Mission for Clean Ganga. Thakur also said Doordarshan will become “the most-watched channel” in the next three to four years, saying the public broadcaster will focus on creating right content to increase its viewers. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ganga-also-has-economic-importance-people-must-help-rejuvenate-it-thakur/articleshow/85387287.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Joy of eating out cannot be replicated||My husband and I are foodies who love experimenting with a number of cuisines and that is only possible when we get to dine out at multiple restaurants across the city. But for the past few months, we had no option but staying indoors and having home cooked food or at the best ordering something from outside. But the joy of eating out and enjoying the ambience cannot be replicated at home. Hence, the moment I learned about the new relaxations I set out with my family and friends for a dine out last Saturday only to realise that the relaxations were effective from Monday. But nevertheless the information has helped us plan another dine out this weekend with my family and another group of friends to celebrate my husband’s birthday. Prior to the pandemic we used to eat out every weekend and at least seven to eight days in a month. My husband Samrat and my son Rayirth (11) are foodies as well just like me and hence, all our outings always ended with some good dinner at some restaurant in the city. But as the pandemic set in, we had to change our lifestyle. I am a decent cook but still cooking international cuisine is not everyone’s cup of tea. But my husband, who, prior to last year, didn’t even know how to make a pot of tea, had started experimenting with his culinary skills, albeit with the help of Youtube. Over the next few weeks he started baking, cooking continental dinners and what not. He kept pampering us with one dish after another, but even then eating is not just about food but also about the ambience and the company. We were missing our favourite joints and friends. Even during the unlock stage, we had slowly started coming out till the second wave set in but now that the situation has eased a bit for the time being, we would like to make the most of it. I am excited to get back to my once or twice-a-week dine-out plans again. Although I am a bit concerned about my son who is yet to be vaccinated, we always take adequate precautions but enjoy dine-ins like we used to do before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/joy-of-eating-out-cannot-be-replicated/articleshow/85381697.cms||---

---||Allahabad||HC seeks Govt response in PIL against online gambling sites||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Monday directed the Central government as well as the state government to file their respective replies in response to a PIL seeking ban on online gambling sites. The court further issued notices to officials of such websites allegedly owned by Chinese nationals and involved in online gambling and duping money from innocent public. Hearing a PIL filed by a social worker Shimla Shri Tripathi, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Rajendra Kumar fixed September 15 as the next date of hearing in the case. According to the petitioner, a large number of such websites are operating in India and offering gambling games like colour predicting game wherein the player has to place a certain amount of bet and guess the outcome of the colour before the declaration of the result by the website. It was alleged in the petition that first such websites let players win easily, but when players in large number start putting larger bets, website owners start manipulating the results, thereby ultimately most of the players lose in the game while website owners illegally gain. Appearing for the petitioner, his counsel Shashank Shri Tripathi argued that these websites also deduct huge amounts of money from winners in the name of tax on gambling claiming that the same will be paid to the government. According to the petitioner, “Chinese citizens are owning such gambling websites. These websites are usually controlled by Chinese servers and are a planned scheme of fraud.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-govt-response-in-pil-against-online-gambling-sites/articleshow/85385139.cms||---

Some of them had resumed their operations last week. The owners of different cinema halls told this reporter that they witnessed better footfalls this time than they did while resuming operations after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. One of them, Suman Kumar Sinha, claimed that the occupancy rate had been outstanding since August 13. “With such a positive response from cinephiles, we are running three shows every day. New releases in the upcoming weeks are likely to attract more people,” he hoped. Suman also thanked his customers for sticking to all the Covid safety protocols while watching films. Ratan Singh, the general manager of a mall in Patliputra Colony, said, “Altogether 240 people watched the six films screened on the first day. This number is expected to go up as more films will release in multiplexes from Friday.” He, however, urged the government to allow shopping malls to function on all days so that more cinephiles watch films in multiplexes. Cinema halls in areas like Station Road and Phulwarisharif also witnessed better footfalls than last time. A multiplex near Gandhi Maidan will be thrown open to the public on August 19. Meanwhile, the proprietor of a Hajipur-based cinema hall, Vishal Boobna, claimed that the sale of tickets was quite low. “At present, the footfalls are poor primarily due to the lack of good films. I hope new releases will attract more audiences soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cinephiles-flock-to-movie-halls/articleshow/85379042.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Ahmedabad||Girl stalked, court tells Guj to pay Rs1.5L compensation||Ahmedabad: A special Pocso court in Mehsana ordered the state government to give compensation of Rs 1.50 lakh to a girl who was being stalked on her way from her home to school causing her to stop going to school due to the harassment. The 24-year-old man accused of stalking, making obscene gestures and demanding sexual favours, Maheshji Thakor, has been sentenced to three years in jail. While convicting Thakor, special Pocso judge P S Saini heeded the prosecution’s request for compensation to the victim for physical and mental harassment. The incident took place in Ladol town in Mehsana district. In 2018-19, Thakor used to stalk the 17-year-old girl on her visits to school. She was studying in Class 12 and because of the harassment, she stopped going to school. Her family lodged a complaint in 2019. Thakor was booked under Sections 354A(1), 354D(1), criminal intimidation and under provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. In awarding the compensation to the victim under provision of the Gujarat Victim Compensation Scheme, the court said that due to this stalking, the victim has to live with a permanent scar for the rest of her life. Because of the incident, the victim’s career has been spoiled. She has not been subjected to any serious physical injury, but considering the mental torture that she had to undergo, it is justified to grant compensation to her. The court further said that the scheme for compensation aims at rehabilitation of victims of sexual harassment in society. The harassment caused to the victim makes her eligible for the minimum compensation under the scheme, which is Rs 1 lakh. And as she is a minor, the court thought it fit to grant 50% more compensation. The court ordered that of the Rs 1.50 lakh, 20% should be handed over and the remaining 80% be put in a fixed-deposit with a nationalized bank for at least three years or till she turns adult, whichever is earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/girl-stalked-court-tells-guj-to-pay-rs1-5l-compensation/articleshow/85383593.cms||Saeed Khan

Hearing the petition filed by Amararaja Batteries Company challenging closure notices by Pollution Control Board, the HC suggested both parties not use court proceedings for collateral purposes. Arguing on behalf of Amararaja, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao told the high court bench comprising Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice K Suresh Reddy that the PCB along with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, has conducted various tests in the premises of the company but they have not given any report yet.

---||Mumbai||Need to lift 50% cap on quota; NDA has misled OBC community: Sharad Pawar||MUMBAI: Targeting the Narendra Modi-led NDA government over reservations, NCP president Sharad Pawar on Monday said the Centre amended the Constitution for providing quota, but there was lack of political will and, in fact, it misled the entire OBC community. “Two years ago, the NDA government revoked the powers of state governments to decide the communities under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, and now it has amended the Constitution and restored the powers of states. But the amendment is misleading, since it will not benefit the OBC community owing to a ceiling of 50% on reservations,” Pawar said. “The only way out is to remove the 50% ceiling, only then justice will be done on the OBCs.” Pawar pointed out that in 1992, a constitution bench of the Supreme Court comprising nine judges had made it clear that reservations can’t exceed 50%. Then, the Centre had amended the Constitution to provide for additional 10% reservation, and now it has taken the view that states can prepare the list of OBC communities and take a decision on providing reservation for them. “I do not think that it will help the state government in any manner in view of the 50% cap imposed by the Centre following the SC order. In my opinion, the NDA government has taken the entire OBC community for a ride over providing them reservations. I am told, barring Maharashtra, most of the states have long back crossed the 50% mark.” Pawar added that the NCP will soon launch a massive movement to press its dem-and for removal of the 50% ceiling on quota. “We demand that the Centre initiate caste-based census, then it will be possible to do justice to small communities. For this, the Centre should provide empirical data to the state governments. When the issue came for discussion in Parliament, it was not taken seriously, as a result, the OBC community is at the receiving end,” the NCP chief said. He claimed that key issues in the row over reservations were raised by NCP members in Lok Sabha, but they were ignored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/need-to-lift-50-cap-on-quota-nda-has-misled-obc-community-in-mumbai-pawar/articleshow/85386574.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Business||Brands remove Olympic heroes from media posts||Chennai: Social media posts by HappyDent , Kotak Bank, Pan Bahar, Vicks and Apollo Group which piggybacked on Olympic medal winners to promote their brands have been removed, after PV Sindu’s celebrity management firm raised red flags citing violation of privacy.At a time when ‘going viral’ is a dream come true for brands, the popular ‘moment marketing’ is turning into ‘moment hijacking’. As India came together to celebrate Olympic winners PV Sindhu, Neeraj Chopra and others, some brands decided to ride in on the euphoria. Marquee brands including Happydent (Perfetti), Pan Bahar, Vicks maker P&G, Apollo Group, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and others posted congratulatory posters/messages on social media platforms with the athletes’ images next to brand logos bordering ‘opportunistic piggy backing.’ However, in a ‘moment’ of reckoning for these companies and for the marketing world, the ace shuttler through her team Baseline Ventures has slapped legal notices on around 20 such companies that associated Sindhu with the brand without her authorization. TOIs analysis of the social media posts shows that HappyDent , Kotak Bank, Pan Bahar, Vicks and Apollo Group are a few brands that have already taken down their content featuring PV Sindhu . Their claim -- it does not just invade Sindhu’s privacy but also flouts International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) norms around the blackout period when even the athletes’ official sponsors are not allowed to advertise. Unfair as they seem to the sportsmen, it is an animal created by the rise of social media, and as it grows more public personalities are getting cautious about protecting their brand. Legal recourse is often tedious and hence avoided. “There are all types of moment marketing from the charming (like Anand Mahindra offering an XUV700 to Neeraj Chopra) to the ridiculous (Karnataka offering Neeraj Chopra a gold card to travel on its buses),” said brand consultant Harish Bijoor. “The problem is that most of the brands that have jumped onto India’s successful show at the Tokyo Olympics have in fact moved ahead from moment marketing to moment hijacking. Companies cannot use this brand persona to hitch a free ride on the mood of the moment,” said Bijoor. “No wonder PV Sindhu has objected to this.” This time around many brands are in the dock as they also directly violated IOC’s intellectual property and trademark protection guidelines. “It is also unethical and illegal to ride on the winners’ success without engaging them as sponsors. The MNCs, which are quite aware when it comes to legal aspects, could have engaged with the star athletes as brand ambassadors before the Olympics began instead of trying to project to consumers that they are associated with them in some form observed,” Nitin Potdar, M&A partner, J. Sagar Associates, said. Speaking to TOI, Tuhin Mishra, co-founder and MD of Baseline Ventures, said companies using Sindhu’s image in congratulatory messages with brand messages / logos woven into the content is about riding on someone else’s success without compensating them. “Rule 40 of the Olympic Charter prohibits athletes’ own sponsors to associate for a specific period during the Olympics and many of Sindhu’s sponsors have observed a silent period but here are some brands who are taking out a message which has direct reference to P V Sindhu without her consent,” he said. For instance, a brand like Pan Bahar that spends huge on sponsoring cricketing events put out a message using Sindhu’s image without her consent, he added. “We are pursuing legal action against every such brand and a few brands have apologized and taken down references. Our move is not to make money out of all this but to raise awareness about these unethical practices,” Mishra said. Marketing professionals say the move also smacks of insensitivity and is unfair to athletes who come from humble backgrounds and are often starved of sponsorships. “It is unfair that companies that did not share in the struggle that the athlete went through preparing and training now wants a share of the Olympic glory. Brands can take advantage of an athlete they are supporting but hitching a free ride is unfair,” Basabdatta Chowdhury, an independent media consultant said. It is also unfair to those companies and organisations like JSW or Go Sports for example that have actually invested in the athlete, she added. After Sindhu’s move to protest the misuse of her brand, companies will likely be more careful in names or images of people without consent, and will treat all celebrities on par with a film star or cricketer with clout, experts note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/brands-remove-olympic-heroes-from-media-posts/articleshow/85381706.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Tax waiver for rural areas included in nagar nigams||LUCKNOW: Rural areas which have recently been included in nagar nigams will not have to pay taxes like water, house, sewerage for the next few years. In a decision taken by the state cabinet on Monday, these areas were left out of the taxation purview with the aim to first develop facilities there and only then tax residents. Government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh added that residents of these areas cannot be served notices either. Meanwhile, the cabinet also passed a decision to reorganise Jal Nigam into two parts, rural and urban. Due to a financial crunch being faced by the organisation, it has also been decided to send 1,238 surplus employees to local bodies on deputation. Family members of 263 deceased personnel of Jal Nigam will also be accommodated in local bodies, which have been staring at manpower crunch. The employees on deputation will be given pay equivalent to their grade in Jal Nigam. Meanwhile, under the UP Water Harvesting and Sewer System (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which will be introduced in the Assembly’s monsoon session, says that Jal Nigam will be reorganised into Jal Nigam (Urban) and Jal Nigam (Rural). In a move that seeks to benefit farmers ahead of the 2022 assembly polls, even though it will be implemented from the next financial year, the cabinet approved a proposal under which the government will implement a new scheme to give grants for purchase of wheat and rice seeds, equivalent to what is being provided under various central government schemes. To promote regional flights within UP, the government will bear 100% of the viability gap funding for three years for all the routes under UDAN 4.1. For aviation and flying training, the cabinet approved of a policy to use airstrips for flying clubs and academies. Under this, flying clubs and academies approved by the civil aviation department can use 13 airstrips and associated infrastructure like hangers in Amedkarnagar, Ghazipur, Shrawasti, Farukkhabad, Aligarh, Sultanpur, Sonebhadra, Etawah, Lakhimpur Kheri, Jhansi, Kanpur Dehat, Azamgarh and Chitrakoot for training purposes. The cabinet has approved of the ‘Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan’ scheme under the Adopt a Heritage policy. Under the policy, the directorate of archaeology under the culture dDepartment will carry out the maintenance, development and management of public utilities at memorials and heritage sites will be done in partnership with public enterprises and private sector. In the first phase, 11 prominent heritage sites have been selected by the government. These include Chhatar Manzil and Farhat Baksh Kothi, Kothi Gulestan-e-Iram, Darshan Vilas Kothi and Hulas Khera in Lucknow, Kusumvan Sarovar, Govardhan ki Chhatriyan and Raskhan Samadhi in Mathura, Gurudham Temple and Kardameshwar Mahadev Temple in Varanasi, Chunar Fort in Mirzapur and Prachin Durg Baruasagar in Jhansi. In another decision, the cabinet approved construction of a connecting road to link routes leading to the Vindhyavasini Temple in Mirzapur, construction of a parikrama route around the temple and construction of façade along the smaller lanes of the temple area. A memorial to Shaheed Ramchandra Vidyarthi and a museum will be set up on the land of the old court in Baans Deoria village in Deoria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tax-waiver-for-rural-areas-included-in-nagar-nigams/articleshow/85385976.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Forty-year-old Neeraj Kataria’s wife, Jyoti, and two sons had gone to Rajasthan on Sunday night. When the incident took place, his elderly parents were at home.On receiving the information, additional deputy commissioner of police-III Sameer Verma, assistant commissioner of police (west) Gurpreet Singh and Haibowal cops reached the spot. Verma said, “With his .32 bore licensed revolver, Neeraj fired two shots at his chest and died on the spot. He took the step at the first floor of his house. His elderly parents were on the ground floor when they heard the noise and thought something has fallen off. When they went upstairs, Neeraj’s room was locked from inside. As their repeated knocks went unanswered, they called up their younger son who had gone out for work.” When their second son came home, he broke open the door and found Neeraj dead in a pool of blood. The family then called the police. The police have recovered a suicide note from the spot in which Neeraj has accused Rajan Jain of Karol Bagh and Harish Sabharwal of 33 Feet Road, who had lent money to him, of harassing him and forcing him to take the extreme step. In the note, Neerja has also apologised to his family and stated that the moneylenders should not harass his brother.Verma said, “Rajan and Harish were harassing Neeraj to return the money.

Similar stalls will soon be put up at the Danapur station too. According to a railway official, this first-of-its-kind exhibition organised at a station under the jurisdiction of Danapur division of the East Central Railway will popularize handloom and khadi clothes among the masses. The senior divisional commercial manager of Danapur, Adhar Raj, told this reporter on Monday that the railways had collaborated with the state industries department to put up the handloom and khadi stalls at the Patna Junction. “One can buy saris, bed sheets, masks, dupattas, pyjamas, kurtas, suits and other dress materials at reasonable prices,” he added. Old train stoppages likely to be restored: With a view to checking the misuse of chain pulling, the railways is planning to restore old train stoppages in the state. It has launched a survey to identify the stations from where it had withdrawn stoppages of local trains amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Prabhat Kumar, who assumed charge as the new divisional railway manager of Danapur recently, said, “The railways has also decided to allow only passengers with confirmed tickets to enter different stations because Covid safety protocols are being followed strictly. Besides, nobody is allowed on the premises of stations without face masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/handloom-and-khadi-exhibition-thrown-open-to-public-at-patna-junction/articleshow/85379230.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Stay on quota vacated in private educational institutes||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday vacated the stay on the GO issued by the state government that mandates private educational institutes to provide 25% of seats to students from economically backward families free of cost. The court asked the government file an additional affidavit detailing what it plans to do to implement the GO. Adopting the Right to Education (RTE) Act, the AP government had issued GO 44 in July 2010, which mandated all private schools to give 25% of seats to students from poor families free of cost. Challenging the GO, an educational society moved the high court and obtained a stay order. The matter was pending since then. In the meanwhile, the Supreme Court adjudicated similar matters and ruled the Act was valid and legal. In 2017, advocate Thandava Yogesh filed an implead petition and a separate application for vacation of stay on GO 44 in view of the apex court judgement. The HC bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya had asked the educational society to respond to the petition but there was no response from them. The advocate who represented the educational society told the bench he did not get any reply from them, adding he doubted if the society is still in existence. The court on Monday vacated the stay on GO 44, and allowed the government pleader to file an additional affidavit in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stay-on-quota-vacated-in-pvt-edu-institutes/articleshow/85380438.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine has published the abstract of this study conducted by a team of doctors led by Dr Sanjeev Kumar of cardiothoracic and vascular surgery and nodal officer of the Covid facility at AIIMS-Patna. The sample size for the research included patients undergoing treatment in the hospital ICUs and wards. Others associated with the research included AIIMS-P director Dr PK Singh, Dr Abhyuday Kumar, Dr Divendu Bhushan, Dr Amarjeet Kumar, Dr Ajeet Kumar and Dr Veena Singh. “The data obtained during the tests indicated that moderate and severe Covid patients had extremely significant increase in arterial stiffness in comparison to those with mild symptoms,” he said. Dr Neeraj Kumar, in-charge of the research project, said all the measured parameters confirmed the increase in arterial stiffness as per the Covid disease severity in unison. This study established the functional deterioration of arteries in proportion with severity of Covid infection. “The effect of arterial stiffness could vary from one patient to another. Even after recovery, they are at risk of heart attack, brain stroke, vision loss and renal failure,” Dr Neeraj said. Such patients should regularly check and control their arterial stiffness to maintain cardiovascular health. The common symptoms of post-Covid arterial stiffness are features of hypertension, shortness of breath, fatigue, lack of sound sleep and sweating, he said. Dr Neeraj even advised people who recovered from the Covid infection to visit the AIIMS-P for test of their arterial stiffness so as to reduce the risk of long-term complications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-may-cause-arterial-stiffness/articleshow/85379121.cms||VK Tripathi

While there was a slight sense of relief at Patna, the menacing form of the Ganga shifted to its eastern reaches along the downstream from Hathidah in Patna district to Bhagalpur and Munger, as well as their surrounding areas.  On Monday, the Ganga was flowing 1.24 metres above the danger level at Digha and 1.74 metres at Gandhi Ghat in Patna. Also, the water level of 50.34 metres at Gandhi Ghat was still 2cm above the HFL. To add further to the relief in Patna, the water level of river Punpun had fallen to 1.09 metres above the danger level from the high of 1.60 metres recorded on Sunday. The floodwaters level had risen further on the campus of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University and its colleges as well as in its professors and teachers’ colonies, besides around 50 other localities in the town. The water pressure had caused a 10 metres breach in the Ismailpur-Bind Toli bund in Naugachhia subdivision on Sunday afternoon itself, the WRD bulletin said. On Monday, the Ganga floodwaters entered Naugachhia town, passing through the culverts. Bihpur, Naugachhia and Gopalpur blocks were also being menaced by the Kosi floodwaters from further north. In south Bhagalpur, along the Bhagalpur-Jamalpur railway and the NH-80 sections, the floodwaters threatened both the road and railway traffic between Bariarpur and railway stations. Consequently, trains between Bhagalpur and Jamalpur railway section had been stopped. The connection of Bhagalpur with Patna by road had also been disrupted due to the possible fear of floodwaters overtopping the NH-80. At Hathidah, the Ganga was flowing 20cm above the HFL of 43.33 metres. It was 3cm above the HFL in Bhagalpur, water resources department (WRD) flood bulletin said. The Bagmati was flowing above the danger level in Sitamarhi, Sheohar and Muzaffarpur districts. The water discharge through the Birpur barrage across Kosi increased to 2.44 lakh cusecs on Monday morning and then to 2.52 cusecs in the afternoon. The WRD bulletin said the water discharge had become steady and then started falling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/floodwaters-threaten-rail-road-traffic-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/85379788.cms||Abhay Singh

Babu pointed out that far from being able to predict the crime, the victim’s parents were not aware that Sasi Krishna and Ramya had developed a relationship through Instagram. “There is no scope for the police to have been aware of this crime to prevent it from happening. Our personnel managed to react swiftly and arrested the accused by the end of the day,” the DIG said. It was only after inquiring among Ramya’s friends that they rounded up a suspect list that led to Sasi Krishna’s arrest late on Sunday. Explaining the motive behind the crime, Babu said Sasi Krishna was upset after Ramya chose to distance herself from him, and started to harass and threaten her. “Krishna lured the girl through Instagram. However, when she met him in person, things were different. It is pertinent to note that building relationships on social media has its innate risks. A social media platform may not reflect who the person is in reality,” Babu noted. The 3rd year BTech student was stabbed to death in broad daylight at Old Guntur area and the crime captured on CCTV camera. Babu announced that the investigation will be conducted by Disha DSP K Ravi Kumar. Sasi Krishna was produced before the Mahila Sessions Court and sent to judicial remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sasi-krishna-harassed-victim-for-months-dig/articleshow/85380332.cms||---

On the other hand, the inoculation drive in the town area is continuing, albeit after a gap of one or two days. A source in the district health department told this reporter on Monday, “The acute shortage of Covishield has led to closure of several immunisation centres in the remote areas. Although the town is receiving its quota of vaccines, a large number of people living in rural areas are yet to be inoculated.” Earlier, as many as 25,000 doses of vaccines were being administered to the beneficiaries every day. According to the source, this figure has dipped considerably due to Covishield shortage. “We do not get any prior information about the supply of vaccines,” he alleged. The district immunisation officer, Dr D N Jha, claimed, “Altogether 7,234 people were vaccinated on August 11, 17,754 on August 12, and 4,715 on August 14.” He added, “Dandkhora, Kursela and Korha blocks have achieved 43%, 39% and 27% immunisation coverage respectively.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vax-shortage-hits-drive-in-katihar-district/articleshow/85379005.cms||---

Official sources said since Bojja has been handling Dalit Bandhu scheme in SC development department, he may be given the subject in the CMO. Sources in the government and TRS said the appointment was made by the CM as he does not want to give any scope for criticism of not having a Dalit officer in his office, that too when the TRS government has taken up a massive programme to extend financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh each to 17 lakh Dalit families in the state. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rahul-bojja-drafted-into-cmo-as-secy/articleshow/85385989.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier, a complaint from Bhabhu informed the CM about huge financial irregularities in Bhabhua Nagar Parishad. He said a probe was ordered by the Kaimur DM and the inquiry officer submitted his report. A copy of the report was also sent to the urban development and housing department (UDHD), but it was swept under the carpet in the secretariat. The CM asked the complainant to explain his matter before the UDHD’s senior officials sitting there. “They will take a quick action,” he assured him. Nitish also expressed surprise when a youth from Gopalganj district complained that though his village has been connected with ‘pucca’ road, the tola of scheduled caste (SC) families located nearby had been left out. “How can it be possible?” Nitish asked the officials of the rural works department. He said when an order to connect all ‘tolas’ of SC families with pucca road had already been issued, how this tola was left out. He asked the department concerned to take quick action in this matter. The CM heard the grievances of 143 people from different districts and gave necessary instructions to the officials of the departments concerned. Complaints related to the rural development department, rural works department, road construction, energy, PHED, agriculture, cooperative, water resources and few other departments were heard at the janata darbar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/take-action-in-bhabhua-civic-body-fraud-nitish/articleshow/85379864.cms||Madan Kumar

Tej had also said the chair (state president) was not someone’s permanent property. Singh, who used to come to the office religiously everyday between 10 and 11am and leave only in the evening, did not even participate in the flag hoisting ceremony on the Independence Day on Sunday. As per the protocol, the RJD state president has been hoisting the flag at the party office on Independence Day or Republic Day, except on a very few occasions when the vice-president had been given this responsibility.  But this Independence Day, neither Singh, nor any of the RJD’s state vice-presidents hoisted the flag. “None of the state vice-presidents wanted to face an embarrassing situation. To avoid any further controversy on the issue, leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, hoisted the national flag,” said a senior RJD leader. Sources in RJD said Tejashwi and other senior party leaders had tried to convince Singh to come to the office for flag hoisting, but in vain. A senior RJD leader said, “This was not the first time that Tej Pratap insulted Jagada Babu. Even during the foundation day ceremony, he tried to make a fun of him. Any person of Jagada Babu’s stature cannot tolerate such misbehaviour. His prolonged absence from the RJD office will badly affect the party. He had been strict and enforced discipline in its functioning, which many people did not like. Even on August 15, chaos and indiscipline was visible in the party office and his absence was felt.” However, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan cited health issues as the reason for Singh not coming to the office. “He is not keeping well, but still managing the party affairs. There are CCTV cameras in the office and he is monitoring everything and giving his instructions. Once fit, he will resume the office,” said Gagan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jagadanand-skips-flag-hoisting-at-rjd-office/articleshow/85379980.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The probe will be conducted by circle officer (CO) Sakaldiha. Additional SP Chandauli Dayaram Saroj said, “The video being made viral on social media contains a conversation between the complainant Vikas alias Ravi Upadhyaya of Dhina and inspector Dhanapur. The woman Poonam Dubey, who could be seen in the video, was accompanying Vikas.” “Though the alleged conversation seems to be out of context, the CO Sakaldiha has been asked to probe into the matter and submit his report at the earliest. Any action will be taken in this episode as per the outcome of the CO’s investigation,” he added. According to police, Vikas was married to one Khushi Pandey of a village in Dhanapur in 2020. After a few days of the marriage, a dispute occurred between the couple and their families on the issue of jewellery. Later, Khushi’s family started alleging that Vikas and his family members were torturing her. On Sunday, Vikas reached Dhanapur police station and alleged that his in-laws with five-six other persons had thrashed him on Saturday, although he could not show any mark of injury. Police said, “Inspector Dhanapur asked Vikas and the woman accompanying him to take precautions as investigation in their dispute was in progress and both the groups should show patience till the issue was resolved.” As the woman accompanying Vikas was continuously terming his in-laws as “snake”, the inspector had asked them to avoid confrontation and try not to come face to face. However, a portion of the conversation was made viral on social media to give a false impression that the inspector suggested the woman to change her route in view of the threat, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/video-of-cop-telling-woman-to-changeroute-avoid-miscreants-to-be-probed/articleshow/85383705.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Challan scam reveals malaise in registration offices||AMARAVATI: The failure of sub-registrars and district registrars to reconcile data on revenue received from treasury banks is reported to have helped scamsters continue the fake challan practice. The document writers knowingly resorted to malpractices, aware that officials in the registrar office would not tally actual revenues. The nexus between document writers and staff in registration offices is believed to have encouraged them to go ahead with the tampering of challan forms. Senior officials suspect that the scandal goes much deeper than what had seen the light and have directed district registrars to verify all documents. Special teams have been constituted to conduct the audit of challans and treasury data in the last two years. As per rules, the district registrars and the deputy inspector general (DIGs) of the stamps and registrations department should also conduct periodical inspection of documents to prevent irregularities. However, the district registrars were reportedly carrying out the task superficially as many were also receiving sums from field officers and documents writers. Although sub-registrars depend on the physical challan produced by buyers through document writers, they are able to spot discrepancies, if any, during the reconciliation process. “The scam did not come to light immediately as the officials are not carrying out the reconciliation of the data on a regular basis,” confirmed a senior official. Sources said similar scandals were unearthed in Mangalagiri, Thullur region during the tenure of the TDP government, in which massive land deals took place but were hushed up. Senior officials had also relied on the realisation of revenues against their targets, without carrying out field inspections. Document writers with direct access to the computer rooms and record rooms in the registrar’s office also wielded influence over officials. The asset purchaser and seller remained mute spectators, with document writers calling the shots in government offices. Despite the raids carried out by the ACB at several registrar offices, business goes on as usual due the volume of amount involved in registrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/challan-scam-reveals-malaise-in-registration-offices/articleshow/85389886.cms||Samdani MN

Salur MLA Peedika Rajanna Dora and an ITDA project officer from Parvathipuram were scheduled to visit the two villages for laying the foundation stone for construction of community buildings and cashew plants distribution centre, but the programme had to be cancelled after officials informed them of Odisha’s move. AP officials planned to lay foundation stone for the community buildings to be built at an estimated cost of Rs 1 crore in the two villages. After coming to know of the move, Odisha set up barricades and closed the route. Five platoons of police force and 11 block development officer rank officials were also sent to the area to monitor the situation along with additional district magistrate Devan Kumar and probationary IAS officer Veda Bhushan. Dora told reporters in Vizianagaram that they were asked by the Koraput collector and SP not to visit the villages. “We respected their request and postponed our program. But they also need to clarify in what capacity they came to those villages. How can they close the routes when the matter is in the Supreme Court?” he asked. The 21 ‘disputed’ Kotia villages have been enjoying the benefits from both AP and Odisha governments for nearly six decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/odisha-sets-up-barricades-to-two-kotia-villages/articleshow/85380397.cms||Siva G

Speaking to the media, Lokesh asked the home minister to explain how the chief minister could save the lives of innocent girls when his own sister fears for her life. Lokesh said women were not safe in the state due to the misrule of the state government. Ramya’s murder on Independence Day has exposed the collapse of law and order in the state, he alleged. Meanwhile, tension prevailed during Lokesh’s visit to the city with YSRC and TDP cadre engaging in protests against each other. Police arrested TDP leaders, including Lokesh, soon after he met family members of Ramya in Paramayakunta. Police shifted Lokesh and former minister Kollu Ravindra to Prattipadu police station and senior leaders Alapati Rajendraprasad, Nakka Anand Babu, Tenali Sravan Kumar to Nallapadu police station. Earlier in the day, TDP activists staged a dharna near Government General Hospital when family members were trying to take the body of the victim to their residence. TDP leaders alleged the body was being hurriedly shifted from GGH only to prevent Lokesh visiting the hospital.

Dozens of Barodians turned up for the gathering and offered condolences. But not for any fellow human. In a first, wildlife activists organized a condolence meet for a 10-foot-long crocodile that was found dead in Vishwamitri River about a week ago. It was the fourth crocodile to have died in the river within two months “He was like a member of our family and stayed among us for so many years. We had spotted him many times during our visit to the river. His sudden death pained us and so we decided to pay tribute to the reptile. It was heartening to see many citizens attending the meet,” said Vishal Thakur, a wildlife activist who had organized the meet on Sunday along with Sanjay Soni. A photograph of the crocodile was placed at the venue and floral tributes were also offered by the attendees. Carcass of the reptile weighing about 150 kg was found floating in the river in Sayajigunj on August 10. Forest officials have launched an inquiry into the cause of the death of four crocodiles. “If any Asiatic lion dies in Gir forest, villagers express grief as they are attached to the big cats. Barodians have been co-existing with crocodiles for many decades but how many really care for these reptiles? In fact, many litter the river with garbage. We organized this meet to involve citizens in conserving the river and the reptiles,” Thakur told TOI. Parth Brahmbhatt, a citizen who attended the condolence meeting, “That Vishwamitri is home to hundreds of crocodiles was known to me but I felt that it is just another reptile living among us. During the meet, I learnt about how crocodiles are important for our eco-system and like us, they too have a family. I will participate in the campaigns to conserve these reptiles now on,” said Some wildlife lovers proposed that the dead crocodile be named after our freedom fighter Mangal Pandey. “Like Pandey’s death triggered a revolution across the country, this reptile’s death would shake up people and compel the authorities to act,” said Soni who stays by the river bank in Sayajigunj. He added that every year, dozens of crocodiles venture out of the river but none of them ever attacks humans as they have learnt to peacefully coexist with people.  Thakur and Soni will also launch a campaign to spread awareness about the reptiles in the schools and colleges in the coming months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tears-for-croc-condolence-meet-for-deceased-reptile/articleshow/85383660.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Business||In sudden step, Sebi bans futures contracts in chana||Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi late on Monday asked leading agro commodities trading bourse NCDEX to not launch any futures contracts on chana (gram/chickpea). What has raised eyebrows is that the directive, a three-liner, came on a Sebi holiday, without any explanation and when there hasn’t been much divergence in the prices of chana in the past few months. Commodity market players said it is likely the directive came from the government and Sebi only issued the circular. “No new chana contract shall be launched till further orders,” the directive from Sebi said. “In respect of running contracts, no new position will be allowed to be taken. Only squaring up of position will be allowed. These directions will be implemented with immediate effect,” it said. Commodity market players said, in the past few weeks, futures contracts on chana have been trading around the government-directed minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,100 per quintal for 2020-21. It’s yet to announce the MSP for chana (gram) for 2021-22, the government portal for farmers showed. “It may be that the government will soon announce the MSP for chana and, hence, moved ahead of time to keep speculation under control...Therefore, the ban on its trading (in the futures market),” said a leading commodities trader. If the futures price of a commodity is too low compared to the MSP, farmers stand to lose out due to lower price. On the other hand, if the futures price is much above the MSP, that raises the possibility of inflation. Hence, the government as well as futures market players try to keep the prices of all agro-commodities around their respective MSPs. Late Monday evening, chana futures for delivery on August 20 was trading at Rs 4,960 per quintal, with the day’s average trading price at Rs 4,987, data on NCDEX showed. In terms of trading volume too, of late there has not been any major change, commodity traders said. The daily average volume in chana has been hovering around 50,000 metric tonnes per day, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-sudden-step-sebi-bans-futures-contracts-in-chana/articleshow/85383809.cms||---

All JD(U) leaders work under the leadership of Nitish.” “As per the party’s name, we all are ‘united’. There are no differences between Lalan Babu (party president Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh) and me. I have a very cordial relation with Lalan Babu,” RCP said while addressing party workers at the JD(U) state office here. The meeting was organized to welcome RCP on his maiden visit to the state capital after becoming the Union minister. Lalan replaced RCP as the JD(U) national president on July 31 this year.

---||Business||Tyre industry lobbies govt for relaxing import restrictions on natural rubber||Chennai: The tyre industry is lobbying the government to remove restrictions on import of natural rubber (NR) as a crunch in domestic supply of this key raw material is threatening tyre production in India. Domestic NR catered to less than half (42%) of the demand in Q1, said the Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association (ATMA). "With economic recovery back on track and the automobile industry witnessing increased traction, there is a surge in demand for tyres but a squeeze in domestic availability of NR has become a major deterrent," said ATMA in a communication to the Rubber Board. Tyre Industry accounts for over 70% of NR consumed in the country. “The tyre Industry has been experiencing tightness in domestic availability of NR during the ongoing fiscal. However in the second quarter a severe crunch is being witnessed while the NR prices are shooting up. The paucity of NR needs to be addressed at the earliest so that tyre production processes are not disrupted”, said Rajiv Budhraja, Director General, ATMA.According to ATMA the Rubber Board had projected much higher production figures for the ongoing fiscal but ground realities are not in line with this guidance. "According to provisional figures, as against NR consumption of 3.01 lakh tonne, NR production stood at 1.27 lakh tonne in the Q1 of FY22," said the ATMA statement. Going forward, NR consumption is expected to inch up further and the tyre industry expects the annual demand to cross 13 lakh tonne this fiscal. With the production of 790000 tonne projected (in normal scenario) by Rubber Board, NR imports to the tune of at least 5 lakh tonne are a must, say tyre companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tyre-industry-lobbies-govt-for-relaxing-import-restrictions-on-natural-rubber/articleshow/85381962.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Challan scam reveals malaise in registration offices||AMARAVATI: The failure of sub-registrars and district registrars to reconcile data on revenue received from treasury banks is reported to have helped scamsters continue the fake challan practice. The document writers knowingly resorted to malpractices, aware that officials in the registrar office would not tally actual revenues. The nexus between document writers and staff in registration offices is believed to have encouraged them to go ahead with the tampering of challan forms. Senior officials suspect that the scandal goes much deeper than what had seen the light and have directed district registrars to verify all documents. Special teams have been constituted to conduct the audit of challans and treasury data in the last two years. As per rules, the district registrars and the deputy inspector general (DIGs) of the stamps and registrations department should also conduct periodical inspection of documents to prevent irregularities. However, the district registrars were reportedly carrying out the task superficially as many were also receiving sums from field officers and documents writers. Although sub-registrars depend on the physical challan produced by buyers through document writers, they are able to spot discrepancies, if any, during the reconciliation process. “The scam did not come to light immediately as the officials are not carrying out the reconciliation of the data on a regular basis,” confirmed a senior official. Sources said similar scandals were unearthed in Mangalagiri, Thullur region during the tenure of the TDP government, in which massive land deals took place but were hushed up. Senior officials had also relied on the realisation of revenues against their targets, without carrying out field inspections. Document writers with direct access to the computer rooms and record rooms in the registrar’s office also wielded influence over officials. The asset purchaser and seller remained mute spectators, with document writers calling the shots in government offices. Despite the raids carried out by the ACB at several registrar offices, business goes on as usual due the volume of amount involved in registrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/challan-scam-reveals-malaise-in-registration-offices/articleshow/85380212.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kanpur||3 women rescued from Oman recount their tale of horror||Kanpur: The city police crime branch recently rescued three women — two belonging to Unnao and one to Kanpur — from Oman. After their rescue from the clutches of human traffickers, they arrived at Lucknow’s Chaudhary Charan Singh International airport on Sunday. The rescue came after the intervention of Kanpur Commissionerate Police, who approached the higher-ups in Delhi and the matter was pursued with the Indian embassy in Muscat. The police will now record their statement. “I went there to support my family, but didn’t even dream that I would have to undergo so much trouble. I was tortured by a woman operator, who snatched all our money and left us to starve. It’s my appeal to everyone not to fall prey to fake agents. Get the agents verified properly. It would be better to adjust with some job or business here in India,” the 45-year-old rescued Kanpur woman told reporters in the city on Monday. A 45-year-old woman hailing from Safipur, Unnao was also duped by an Indian agent and sent to Oman. “They (agents) took several lakhs before sending me to Oman. My family members were innocent and did whatever they said. When I reached Oman, I realised that I was duped,” she told reporters. Similarly, 44-year-old woman of Kanshiram Colony, Unnao told reporters, “I don’t know what kind of human being they were. Whenever I fell ill, they didn’t even provide me medical treatment. I used to beg them, but they didn’t pay any heed,” she added. DCP Salman Taj Patil said, “The entire gang of human trafficking was active. The kingpin used to pay a commission of Rs 25,000-30,000 per woman to the agent. Investigations are continuing based on the inputs provided by the three victims, who reached Lucknow from Muscat on Sunday morning.” To recall, the Commissionerate Police had in the month of April arrested two members of a human trafficking gang identified as Atiqur and Muzammil in the city. The arrests were made following a complaint filed at the Colonelganj police station on April 9 by a local of Unnao who accused Atiqur and Muzammil of duping him. The duo had sent his 40-year-old wife to Oman with a promise of a well-paid job. However, his wife instead landed at the house of one ‘kafeel’ (guarantor), who forced her to do household work for a menial salary. Since then she had been calling her husband to get her back to their country (India). The Crime branch police till date had rescued four women, including one from UP’s Unnao, one from Karnataka and two from Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/3-women-rescued-from-oman-recount-their-tale-of-horror/articleshow/85385283.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Builder cannot sell garage, flat owner to return it to housing society||MUMBAI: Ruling in favour of a housing society in south Mumbai, a civil court recently ordered flat owners to hand over a garage they had claimed to have “purchased” from the earlier owners. The court held that the previous owners had no right to sell it when it was just allotted to them at the time they purchased the flat in 1972. “...Parking space or garage comes within the purview of common areas and facilities. Builder or developer has no right to sell parking space or garage. The promoter or builder has no right to sell any portion of such building which is not ‘flat’...” the court said. It held that the only right that remains with the promoter is to sell unsold flats. Asiatic Co-operative Housing Society Ltd moved court in 2013 after it found that the new flat owners Sanjay and Samprati Doshi had “taken possession” of the garage and encroached upon the 95-sq-ft common passage between the ground floor flat and the garage by erecting a brick wall. “..The defendants [Doshis] encroached on the suit premises on the basis of illegal deed of transfer... Hence, possession of defendants in the suit garage is unlawful. Plaintiff [housing society] is legally entitled for possession of the suit garage and its allotment...,” the court said. The Doshis claimed the society was issuing separate maintenance receipts to the original owner, The court referred to the original allotment letter which said that the garage shall only be used for personal use and parking car and shall not be sub-let without written permission of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-builder-cannot-sell-garage-flat-owner-to-return-it-to-hsg-soc/articleshow/85384166.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The police had also recovered an iron rod, which was used to kill Sapan, from the spot. However, during probe Sarwan was changing his statement, therefore, the police suspected his involvement in the murder. “He spilled the beans during questioning. He said two years ago he was arrested for peddling drugs and lodged in a jail. Meanwhile, his nephew developed illicit relationship with his wife. In March, when he came out on bail, he heard a conversation between the two and learned about their relationship. Since then, Sarwan had been planning to kill Sapan,” the JCP added. In April, Sapan went to Bihar for his marriage and returned on July 27. Since then, Sarwan was waiting for the right time to kill him. On Saturday night, he broke open the window grille to enter Sapan’s room when he was sleeping. He then attacked him with an iron rod.

Singh accused SP of playing appeasement politics and said the poor law and order situation was very dangerous for women in SP regime. A day after SP president Akhilesh Yadav released an open letter, Singh highlighted massive corruption and poor law and order during his regime, saying, “There are six corruption cases pertaining to SP government which CBI is investigating. These include Gomti riverfront, JPNIC, recruitment in Lok Sewa Ayog and mining scam. The reality of SP is out before people, and nobody believes them. The ‘new SP’ is a memorial to its failures.” Calling the letter a ‘lollipop’, Singh said UP had gone back several decades during SP rule and was known as a BIMARU state. People migrated to other states for jobs, there were no investments in UP and industries were shifting out of the state, he said, adding Yadav is now talking about law and order when none existed during his tenure. He also hit out at Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for her tweet on women’s safety, saying she has no idea of the ground realities in UP where massive improvement has taken place under Yogi government. “She should get her facts right.

While the ICSE candidates wrote their English language papers, the ISC candidates had their maths exam on the first day. Candidates are free not to write all the papers but choose the papers they wish to improve their marks in. Arrangements for sanitization, social distancing, masking and staggered entry and exit had been done. Very few ICSE pass-outs wrote the exam. In case of ISC candidates, the numbers came down heavily from the original number of candidates who had approached the respective school principals for taking a re-exam. The exams were conducted in the schools of the respective zonal convenors of ICSE and ISC. The city is divided into zones and each zone has a convenor. Each convenor is responsible for either an ICSE or an ISC exam in the cluster of schools under him/her. The same administrative set up was used for the improvement exam, too. At St Thomas, Free School Street, only one boy from Don Bosco Park Circus wrote his ICSE exam, said principal Aniket Debroy, who is the ICSE Convenor for that zone. On Tuesday there will be a boy from Calcutta Boys writing the test. At Assembly of God Church School, where principal Lionel Chellapa is the covenor of Zone A schools that include St James School, Pratt Memorial, St Sebastian’s, Sri Sri Academy etc, nine students wrote the ISC maths exam on Monday. It was a three hour paper. One ISC pass-out, who was visibly nervous and was writing his test at Saifee Hall, had to be calmed down by the supervising examiner. Another turned up late at the exam venue here since he thought that the examination would happen in his own school. There were 14 students who wrote the exam at Saifee Hall, which is the school of the ISC convenor of the zone that has schools like La Martiniere, Don Bosco Park Circus, St Xavier’s Collegiate School etc. “From Saifee Hall we had one student, while from Xavier’s Don Bosco and La Martiniere we had three to four each,” said convenor, Saeda Sukiana, Question papers were sent to respective convenors, 45 minutes before the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/improvement-exams-start-for-icse-isc-kids/articleshow/85381780.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Till 2017, said a government spokesperson, the area under sugarcane cultivation in Purvanchal was 4.39 lakh hectare which went up to 5.73 lakh hectare. Data released by the department shows that farmers’ income also went up by Rs 22,000 per hectare during this period, while the total income of farmers in Purvanchal increased by Rs 1,290 crore. The spokesperson said that the increase in production was a result of ‘farmer-friendly schemes’ of the UP government. “The establishment of new sugar mills, reopening of closed ones and their operation during the novel coronavirus pandemic, timely payment of sugarcane dues to farmers and a campaign to connect farmers with technology have proved to be effective in this regard,” he said. He added that with an increase in the area under sugarcane cultivation and a corresponding increase in sugarcane yield, farmers’ income has also seen a rise. The average yield of sugarcane in Purvanchal has increased from 652.72 quintals per hectare to 722 quintals per hectare over the past four years. “The UP government has distributed 70 lakh quintals of seeds among farmers,” the spokesperson added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/purvanchal-catches-up-with-western-up-in-cane-farming/articleshow/85386023.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Setback for NCP as fugitive senior leader battles corruption charges||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court verdict is being viewed as a major setback both for former home minister Anil Deshmukh and his party, the NCP. A full bench of the Supreme Court led by Justice A M Khanvilkar declined to grant any interim relief though Deshmukh has been granted liberty to access remedies under the Criminal Procedure Code. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik reacted cautiously to the SC order. “It’s a fact that the Supreme Court has rejected his application for interim relief, but he has the option to examine remedial measures. Deshmukh will consult his lawyers and decide the future course of action,” Malik said. For the Sharad Pawar-led NCP, the SC order will raise more questions of corruption charges against its senior leaders. The NCP believes that the former home minister’s arrest is imminent and that securing bail may be a long drawn-out process. After Chhagan Bhujbal, Deshmukh was the second senior NCP leader to be booked by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Another senior, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, is also under scrutiny by the ED in a case concerning the acquisition of a Rs 65-crore sugar factory. Bhujbal was booked for his alleged role in the Maharashtra Sadan scam, while Deshmukh is being investigated following former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh had set a target of Rs 100 crore for dismissed inspector Sachin Waze to extort from restaurant and bar owners in Mumbai. “NCP’s image has already been tarnished. Now, the dent will be bigger,” a senior NCP leader said. Ever since the ED has registered a case against Deshmukh under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the fugitive ex-home minister has been dodging the agency; despite a summons issued to him on four occasions, he has failed to show up. He did allow himself to be questioned initially by the CBI once, but since then, he has cited the pandemic and his age as the reasons for staying away. Deshmukh’s contention is that instead of summoning him to the ED office, the agency should record his statement via video conferencing. But this plea has not been accepted. According to a top NCP leader, Deshmukh may now seek anticipatory bail. The ED has already arrested his private secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-setback-for-ncp-as-fugitive-senior-leader-battles-corruption-charges/articleshow/85386579.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Ours is a manpower-intensive production sector” said Mohamed Aftab, a leather goods manufacturer. IT sector employees welcome the decision as well. “We had become used to working from home for quite a long time. This will come as a relief. However, it would be up to the companies as to on which mode they will prefer,” said Kaustav De, a senior IT executive. “Now, many firms will follow the hybrid model.

Mann said, “The freedom of the dreams of martyrs has not reached the homes of common people. This freedom is confined to the houses and palaces and of the rulers. If independent India would have been like the dream created by the martyrs, the farmers and labourers of the country would not be struggling on the streets today, unemployed would not have climbed on the tanks and teachers, doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, pensioners and other employees struggling for their legitimate demands would not be harassed by the government.” He also said Shaheed Bhagat Singh along with many freedom fighters had sacrificed their lives to drive the British out of the country, but today due to the “incompetent governments” of the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which have been ruling Punjab and the country for 74 years, unemployed people of Punjab were forced to migrate to the country of those British by paying lakhs of rupees. The AAP leader said the farmers of the country had been sitting on the borders of Delhi for the last nine months and more than 600 farmers had been martyred, but “Modi’s dictatorial government” was not listening to the ‘annadatas’. Along with him, MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer, Kulwant Pandori and Amarjit Singh Sandoa were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-leaders-recall-martyrs-sacrifice-to-hit-out-at-govt/articleshow/85384164.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ludhiana||1.8% increase in number of fully vaccinated in district in 14 days||Ludhiana: With the threat of the third Covid wave looming, there has been a 1.8% increase in the number of fully vaccinated persons in Ludhiana in 14 days.As per the state government report of Thursday evening, Ludhiana has 10.6 per 100 persons of the entire population who are fully vaccinated. However, on July 30, 8.8 per 100 persons of the entire population in the district were fully vaccinated, which was 1.8% less than Thursday evening. With 10.6 per 100 persons of the entire population having received both the doses, Ludhiana is among the six districts of the state that have a better value. At 18.8 of 100 persons, SAS Nagar has the highest number of fully vaccinated residents, followed by Hoshiarpur (14.2), Pathankot (12.3), Jalandhar (12.3) and Gurdaspur (11). In Mansa, only 3.8 per 100 persons of the entire population have received both the doses.In Punjab, eight per 100 persons have received the first shot, as per the report. The health department officials said the number of persons vaccinated per 100 eligible ones has increased due to improvement in the vaccine supply. District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja said they have administered 13.67 lakh first doses to the eligible persons and 3.8 lakh persons have received both the doses. He added that there were around 26 lakh persons eligible for vaccination (above 18 years of age) in the district.The DIO suggested that vaccine supply improved in August, so vaccinations have also increased. He added that the number of inoculated persons per 100 eligible ones was the proper way to calculate the data. Epidemiologist and CMCH vice-principal Dr Clarence Samuel said, “It is important that more people get vaccinated before the possible third wave. It is good that over 10.6 of 100 persons of the entire population are fully vaccinated, but the percentage must increase. Earlier, there was a vaccine shortage and then there was some hesitancy too due to rumours.” Till July 15, seven per 100 persons in the district were fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/1-8-increase-in-number-of-fully-vaccinated-in-district-in-14-days/articleshow/85381766.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Kolkata||First day, second dose: Old rush missing in new schedule in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Nilanjan Dutta, a septuagenarian and a resident of Regent Estate, couldn’t believe his eyes when he reached a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC)-run vaccination centre in the neighbourhood on Monday morning to receive his Covishield second dose. The centre wore a deserted look at 10am with only five persons in a queue to register their names for the second dose. “At first, I thought something was wrong with the vaccination process and was preparing to return home when a KMC staff asked me to stand in queue and register for the jab. I was administered the shot in 30 minutes,” said Dutta, who had to return back twice in the past 10 days without getting the jab due to an acute shortage of vaccines. Dutta was among 30 people who had received the second dose from the centre. The scene was similar at a majority of KMC-run vaccination clinics and mega centres. At the end of the day, most of them were left with a surplus of Covishield vials as few turned up to take the second Covishiled or Covaxin dose. Monday marked the beginning of the alternate-vaccination schedule for recipients of first and second doses. While only recipients of second doses will be vaccinated at the KMC clinics and mega centres on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, first dose recipients will be entertained on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. According to a KMC health department official, the civic body had allocated 150 Covishield doses to each clinic and 250 second doses to each mega centre on Monday morning. However, less than 30% of the stock was used in clinics and mega centres, conceded a civic official associated with the vaccination drive. “Each Covishield vaccination clinic has sent back around 70% of the stock we had provided. Similarly, the Covishield mega centres couldn’t consume more than 30% of the stock. Now we are left with a buffer stock, which will be used in the coming days to clear the fresh backlog,” said a KMC health department official. According to a medical officer posted at a KMC vaccination clinic in Tollygunge, the initial response to the change in the civic body’s vaccination schedule was surprising. “Going by our own estimates, we need to clear a good second dose pendency. Now there is no dearth of vaccines. We anticipate a rush of recipients of the second dose from early next week. If the supply remains normal, we may be able to clear a major part of the backlog by early next month,” the civic medical officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1st-day-2nd-dose-old-rush-missing-in-new-schedule/articleshow/85381790.cms||Saikat Ray

He also went on to invite all to come together — promising them a ‘respectable position’ — to fulfil the idea of ‘22 mein bicycle’ – a slogan coined by the SP to showcase its election symbol for the 2022 assembly elections in UP. The letter starts with Akhilesh underlining the need for change in the basic concept of ‘government’, stating that it no longer be a ‘ruler’ but has to be a ‘service provider’. He said people are upset with the rising unemployment and inflation and reduced income. Now, they are looking for a change that could bring respite to the people. In the changing times, the concept of government must also change from a 'shasak' (ruler) to a ‘service provider’, the former UP CM said. “Independence Day this time is more special and significant as it marks 75 years of Independence. It is the beginning of a new chapter and we are committed to building a new Uttar Pradesh," he said. Attributing his sense of discipline that he got during his education at the military school, Akhilesh promised to use the same discipline in governance to tackle crime in the state (once the SP government is formed). "It was a sense of discipline that led to our resolve to improve the law and order situation and set up services like Dial 100 and 1090 for women's security," Akhilesh said in an obvious reference to the work done under the previous Samajwadi regime when he was the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/open-letter-sp-chief-urges-people-to-work-for-a-new-tomorrow/articleshow/85386053.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

In the coming days, work is all set to commence to revamp the facilities at the Civil Lines bus depot. UP-State Road Transport Corporation (Roadways) would be developing this depot based on public-private partnership (PPP model). To initiate the process for developing the bus terminal-cum-commercial complex at Civil Lines bus depot based on DBFOT (Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer), UPSRTC has floated a tender. Under it, the Civil Lines Bus depot area spread across 18,000 sq meters would be developed for Rs 114 crore to become not just a hub of inter-state and intra-state bus services but also a commercially booming centre for UPSRTC. After the process for allotment of work for developing the Civil Lines depot on the lines of Alambagh bus depot, this bus stand of the Sangam city would also be included in the list of premium bus stations cum commercial complex in the state. “The department has floated the tender to develop the Civil Lines bus depot following which the passengers would be offered a range of facilities of better waiting facilities, information about the timing of buses and routes etc.”, said regional manager UPSRTC, TK Bisen. Sources inform that the final execution of work, which would be allotted to an agency selected via the tender already floated by the department, Civil Lines bus stand is all set to be equipped with all modern facilities as the entire facility would be revamped in terms of design and facilities. A new station building will be constructed which would have an AC waiting hall, food courts, business centres, showrooms of branded and non-branded products, shopping malls, canteens, AC and non-AC rooms for passengers, many other world-class facilities based on pay and use. A luggage checking scanner, as is operated at railway stations and airports, will also be installed at the bus stand for security. Besides, there would be separate platforms for the buses going towards a given direction and systematic information about the same would be displayed at the electronic board which would be installed at several places in the entire complex. The haphazard parking of the buses, both operated by UPSRTC and those attached with it, would also be over. Presently, these buses are a major cause of the problem for the traffic jam in front of the bus stand as most of the private bus operators, who are attached to UPSRTC, park their buses on the road while inviting passengers to a given destination. Likewise, the buses, operated by UPSRTC are parked within the premises of the bus stand, but finding the bus for a given destination is a tedious task. Following the revamp of facilities, passengers can look forward to having better seating area, clean toilets, ease of travelling and better satisfaction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/civil-lines-depot-of-sangam-city-to-be-revamped-on-the-lines-alambagh-bus-stand/articleshow/85385158.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Handicraft villages, clusters, branding top govt agenda||Jaipur: In a bid to lend fresh impetus to its handicrafts sector, the state industries department is working on a new policy with focus ranging from capacity building, handholding, and infrastructure development to branding and marketing. Reviving languishing crafts, providing social security to artisans, creating handicraft villages and parks are also included as thrust areas in the draft policy circulated for stakeholder suggestions and inputs. “In handicrafts, we already have an edge in the country but there is huge scope for growth. Branding, promotion and finding new markets are as important as creating appropriate ecosystem in terms of empowering the artisans and giving them the right infrastructure. The objective of the policy is to give a comprehensive push to the sector that is not only highly labour intensive but also part of the state’s vibrant heritage,” said Ashutosh Pednekar, secretary, department of Industries and MD, RIICO. As part of the vision, the industries department is looking at setting up of a handicraft design centre in Jodhpur, model handicraft centre in Jaipur to promote the industry and encourage people for establishing parks at local level. Private sector will also be encouraged to set up design and craft centres to provide training and develop skills required for the sector. A cluster development approach will be undertaken so that these facilities can be targeted for developing skills in a structured way, and the products can be branded, promoted and marketed in the country and overseas markets, states the draft document. For setting up crafts villages, artisans will be identified and the products specific to the area will be encourage for development. The tourism department will also be kept in the loop to leverage tourism potential of villages. Also, the artisans will be allowed to avail interest subsidy of 7% for loans up to 1 lakh. For retail centres, the government will give grant of 50% for their establishment by cooperative sammitis. The draft has capped the loan amount at Rs 1 lakh for these retail centres. As per the market development assistance scheme of 2012, the artisans were reimbursed expenses made by them for buying stalls and transportation of goods and their travelling expenses. But now the new policy is likely to provide them daily allowance of up to Rs 600 per day. The department also plans to document the arts and artisans for better planning for development of the sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/handicraft-villages-clusters-branding-top-govt-agenda/articleshow/85384217.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

A structural audit done by Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) before the pandemic had recommended repairs. However, civic officials said they chose to undertake complete reconstruction as the condition of the skywalk has deteriorated. TimesViewThis raises serious questions about the construction quality of the Bandra skywalk. Otherwise why should it require such extensive repairs at huge cost barely 13 years after it was built? Sadly, there is little accountability because the contractors are allowed to get away with such inferior work.For now, only the portion between the station to the Bandra court is proposed to be razed and rebuilt. The last date to submit bids is September 13. The skywalk that passes over Western Express highway will be razed to make way for an arm of the 714-meter flyover that will land at Bandra-Kurla Complex and save motorists time of waiting at Kalanagar signal. The BMC has set a target of 18 months, including the monsoon months, for the demolition and reconstruction of the skywalk. Satish Thosar, chief engineer of BMC’s Bridges Department said the skywalk is currently out of bounds for the public. “The new skywalk will be more or less of the same alignment. For now, around 300 metres has been proposed to be demolished and reconstructed,” he said. The first 1.3-km elevated walkway, which was completed as a pilot project, was being used by over 1 lakh people daily. The 4-metre wide skywalk, which stand at a height of 20 feet, had been built at a cost of Rs 13.63 crore in the year 2008. Across the city, at least 20 skywalks are slated to undergo repair or demolition and reconstruction. Following the collapse of the Himalaya bridge right outside Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in March 2019, the BMC had appointed VJTI for a structural audit of all 24 skywalks, including the one at Bandra. Shiv Sena corporator from Behrampada locality in Bandra (east), Haji Mohammed Halim Khan, said that the congestion outside the railway station is very acute owing to which the skywalk may be of help to pedestrians. “The skywalk has been kept out of bounds all through the pandemic when it was said to have become dangerous for public use. For pedestrians moving in and out of the railway station especially, the skywalk was of use as they can cut through the entire traffic which they may have to navigate and walk through,” he said. MLA Zeeshan Siddique said that the skywalk has been shut for very long. “Almost immediately after I got elected from the area, the skywalk was shut. The area is congested. While another skywalk is needed, the BMC should ensure that the same is done in a cost-effective manner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bandra-e-skywalk-to-be-razed-and-rebuilt-at-rs-16cr-13-yrs-after-it-came-up/articleshow/85384219.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Chandigarh||City bizmen upbeat over introduction of vehicle scrappage policy by centre||Ludhiana: City businessmen are upbeat over the announcement of vehicle scrappage policy by the central government, under which the old and unfit vehicles will be scrapped and owners will be incentivised if they purchase new vehicles. The policy will give great push to the automotive sector and the auto parts and fasteners manufacturers based in the city will also largely be benefitted by implementation of this policy. Notably, several city business associations had been demanding the introduction of the vehicle scrappage policy from sometime now and they had taken up this issue with several Union ministers and even Prime Minister’s Office. Welcoming the move, Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “Central government has taken a wise decision by introducing the vehicle scrappage policy. This was a long-pending demand of the industry and the policy could not have come at any better time than this, as the commercial vehicle industry is passing through very tough time because of Covid-19 situation. Presently, the industry production and sales have dropped by almost 35% and the vehicle scrappage policy will trigger demand not only for the automobiles but also for the components and other supplies too.” According to Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners Manufacturers Association of India, “We are thankful to the central government for considering our demand of introduction of the vehicle scrappage policy. From almost two years, our association had been taking this issue up with different ministries and even PMO by giving representations and even meeting Union ministers. The overall business of fastener industry depends majorly on automobile sales and now when old vehicles will be scrapped there certainly is going to be demand for the new ones and as a result industries like fastener manufacturing, auto parts manufacturing will also see a boom.” According to Pankaj Sharma, general secretary of CICU, “It was a long-standing demand of industry to implement this policy and we are happy that finally centre government has taken the step in right direction. Steel industry is one of the prominent industries in Punjab and with this policy, availability of various types of scrap like steel, copper, aluminum will be better.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-bizmen-upbeat-over-introduction-of-vehicle-scrappage-policy-by-centre/articleshow/85384236.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||After Taliban return, fate of Afghan women worries Frontier Gandhi’s great granddaughter||KOLKATA: More than anything else, it is the fate of Afghan women that worries Yasmin Nigar Khan the most. She cringes in horror on recollecting memories of how the women there had been thrown into the dark ages by the Taliban when it had last over-run the country in 1996. It was barely months after she had taken over as president of the All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind following her father Lala Jan Khan’s death when the war-torn country had faced its cruellest fate. Former Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah was tortured, killed, dragged through the streets of Kabul and hung from a lamppost that year. Now, a quarter of a century later, she was again reminded of the horrors that she had hoped had ended forever when Americans invaded Afghanistan in 2003 and overthrew the oppressive Taliban regime. “They say history repeats itself. But I had earnestly hoped this dark chapter in Afghan history had closed two decades ago. In both instances, it was the withdrawal of superpowers from the theatre that precipitated the Taliban invasion. While the Taliban had taken over the capital around seven years after Soviets withdrew their troops in 1989, this time it happened within months of US withdrawing troops from the country. I am convinced there is political power play involved in what has happened to the country. Unfortunately, it is the women who will be pawns once again and bear the brunt of the oppressive regime that is taking over,” said Yasmin who is also the chairperson of the Badha Khan Memorial Women & Children Welfare Organisation. Recounting stories about brutalising women and treating them as tools to procreate, Yasmin said she did not think anything about the Taliban’s recent assurance that it had relaxed its stance on women’s rights. “They have again banned education of girls and employment of women. They are again demanding all widows between 15 and 45 be handed over to them so that they can teach them real Islam. In reality, they want to treat them as sex slaves. Yet, in Islam, it is women whose consent is first sought in a marriage. It is horrifying that such things continue to happen in this day and age and the world remains a mute spectator,” she said. Yasmim’s father Lala Jan had been adopted as a grandson by Abdul Ghaffar Khan, also known as Badshah Khan and Frontier Gandhi, to set up an organisation in India and carry on the fight for an independent Pashtoonistan. Yasmin now represents around 32 lakh Pathans from the region who are now settled in India. Born in Kolkata, Yasmin studied in the city and then took over the organisation that her father had nurtured. “There is absolute terror out there. We have just seen images of panic-stricken men at the airport as they try desperately to leave the country. The world will not get to see the fear that haunts women in homes there, the fear of being enslaved, tortured, maimed. Everyone is worried about the extended family back in Afghanistan and what will befall them. The Pathans living here still have their extended family members back in Afghanistan and are getting news of everyone living in dread,” she said. Yasmin blames Pakistan squarely for propping up Talibans to bring Afghanistan under its control. “All Taliban fighters are trained by Pakistan. They have been brainwashed in Pakistani madrassas. It wants to split the country up into smaller pieces that will be controlled by warlords,” said Yasmin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-taliban-return-fate-of-afghan-women-worries-frontier-gandhis-great-granddaughter/articleshow/85381839.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The Lok Sabha MP from Moradabad arrived at the tomb of Nawab Majju Khan and paid his respects, following which he hoisted the national flag at an event held at Gul Shaheed Park. Soon after unfurling the tricolor, and enthusiastically reciting the first verse of 'Jana Gana Mana' he forgot the following verse and so did others, which can also be seen in a video that went viral on social media. Taking strong offence for circulating the misleading video clip to "malign his image", Hasan said that he has been singing the national anthem since childhood and can never forget it. Later in another viral clip, the MP was seen singing the anthem, without any pause, all by himself. “Elections are round the corner and BJP’s IT cell is active. They are picking up such things and propagating it unnecessarily. The video they are forwarding shows just on half, that supports their narrative,” Hasan told TOI. BJP leader Sambit Patra also shared the video of the incident on Twitter and took a jibe at the SP workers for “forgetting the national anthem”. It is not the first time that political parties have used the national anthem to take on each other. During the Bengal polls earlier this year, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Abhishek Banerjee had shared a video of a rally and alleged that BJP leader and former IPS officer Bharati Ghosh had skipped a line while leading the singing of the anthem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sp-mp-fumbles-while-singing-national-anthem-says-bjp-it-cell-circulating-half-clip/articleshow/85379443.cms||Maria Khan

Shiv Sena activists were arrested while making bid to carry out procession for offering Jalabhishek at Shringar Gauri on last Monday. On the first, second and third Mondays of the current Shrawan month from 47,000 to 65,000 devotees had entered KVT for offering Jalabhishek. But, on the last Monday of the auspicious month the size of queues, which took place in barricaded areas towards Maidagin and Godowlia via Dashaswamedh from Chhattadwar entry point had stretched long since Sunday late night, did not reduce till late afternoon. According to KVT administration, around 1.25 lakh had reached the temple by Monday night. Though the Covid-19 protocol was effective, it was flouted at many places like at Dashaswamedh Ghat where people were thronging for taking dip in river Ganga and collecting water for offering Jalabhishek. Men in khaki could be found exercising hard to ensure social distancing by the devotees queued up for entering KVT. Kanwar Yatras were banned in this Shrawan month but large number of saffron clad devotees were evident chanting slogans. Maintaining their tradition of offering Jalabhishek at Shringar Gauri in Gyanvapi premises Shiv Sena activists led by Ajay Chaubey tried to take out their procession.

---||Chandigarh||Long way to go for a smooth ride on Ludh-Delhi highway||It’s not a smooth ride for commuters travelling on Ludhiana-Delhi national highway, thanks to pothole-ridden stretch between Ludhiana and Khanna. The highway officials indicate that rainy season and water logging on the road at some places have resulted in potholes and cracks and those are being rectified. The main road between Ludhiana and Khanna has witnessed many deadly accidents in the past. When the team from TOI visited the Ludhiana to Khanna stretch, it found that many potholes and cracks have emerged on either side of the busy road. Small- to medium-sized potholes and cracks, especially near Dhandari, Sahnewal, between Doraha and Khanna near Gurudwara Manji Sahib, near Kadoon village and Khanna city flyover could be seen. At some places, the potholes are so deep that it becomes difficult to control the vehicle if one driving fast. Also, water has accumulated on the side of the highway between Doraha and Khanna. Many residents did confirm having suffered while driving on such road. “I travel to Ludhiana often and it is hard to drive on such roads especially in rainy season as driving during rains with water on road is difficult and potholes and cracks makes it even difficult,” said Harsh Kumar Bhalla, a Khanna-based social activist. “We have witnessed that authorities don’t get road repaired till they are made to act after complaint. We pay road taxes and deserve better roads, especially the main highway,” added Bhalla. He also said there have been many accidents on Khanna Ludhiana road in the past and people have lost their lives in such accidents. The experts said driving along the road with cracks and potholes does contribute to 5% to 7% of accidents. “Though 5% to 7% accidents are being attributed to such roads, the percentage must be higher. The problem with potholed roads is that a driver tries to prevent a pothole and drives the vehicle through it’s side whereas in some cases another vehicle coming from behind hits him causing fatal accidents. Also water accumulation on the road is because of lack of proper drainage on the highway and it becomes a cause of accidents as water from road drops on the windscreen reducing the visibility of driver and making it difficult to drive,” said International road safety expert Dr Kamaljit Soi. “A study done by us on National highway between Panipat and Jalandhar, indicated that there are around 140 cracks, small or big potholes on either side of road in a kilometer and we covered this stretch in that study”. He indicated that roads needs to be of better material to ensure that it is not damaged for 10 years. National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials admitted that there are potholes on the road. But Varinder Sharma, poject director of NHAI, said potholes are being repaired periodically. 91 black spots As part of the accident black spot identification and rectification programme on various highways/roads in 2019, 91 black spots were identified by team of researchers in Ludhiana commissionareate. Traffic adviser Punjab Navdeep Asija, who heads the team that conducted the research, said of the 91 dark spots on Ludhiana roads, around half were on NH 44 from Sahnewal to Jalandhar bypass. He added that black spots which witnessed maximum fatalities in three years included Sahnewal Bridge (22), near Eastman caste and Forge limited Sahnewal (17), Dhandari Flyover (16), and Dhandari Kalan bus stop (14). Accidents between Ludhiana and Khanna January 16: Two persons died and many others injured after a heavy vehicle collided with a load carrier and later resulting in pile up of vehicles near Khanna on GT Road June 19: Three persons from the same family, including an elderly woman and a minor girl, died after the motorcycle they were riding on was allegedly hit by a canter (heavy vehicle), near Gurdwara Manji Sahib close to Doraha on Delhi-Ludhiana highway June 23: Two persons died, whereas atleast two suffered injuries after a tourist bus collided into a stationary canter on a flyover near Khanna on Delhi-Ludhiana highway in the wee hours||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/long-way-to-go-for-a-smooth-ride-on-ludh-delhi-highway/articleshow/85384261.cms||Shariq Majeed

The entire proceedings, from the arrest of Parshuram to his conviction, took 55 days, which as per the police is a record. The trial got over in just eight working days. The incident took place on June 22 when Prashuram raped the victim inside a school. He was arrested after an encounter in which he suffered a bullet injury on his leg. DG, Gorakhpur Zone, Akhil Kumar, said the conviction was ensured in record time because of meticulous evidence collection and filing of chargesheet by the Bahraich police. Superintendent of police, Bahraich, Sujata Singh, who led the investigation, said the accused was booked under sections pertaining to rape, murder and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. “We ensured that all the evidence was collected and the charge sheet was filed in 28 days,” she said. “While the samples were collected fast, the new FSL laboratory in Gorakhpur gave the DNA report in 37 days to make the case watertight,” said Singh. She further said that the DNA report showed that samples of accused matched with those found on the body of the toddler after her rape. The case went on trial from August 2 in the court of Additional Sessions Judge (Rape and POCSO Act I) Nitin Pandey. The court convicted Parshuram on August 12 in just eight working days due to the coordination of the prosecution. “The judgment in record time will give a strong message to offenders in the society,” said the officer. Additional chief secretary (home), Awanish Awasthi, gave a reward of Rs 1 lakh to Bahraich police, while UP DGP, Mukul Goel announced commendation disc to the investigation officer of the case and appreciation letter to the supervisory officers, along with FSL team and prosecution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/toddlers-rapist-gets-death-sentence-after-just-55-days/articleshow/85386115.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ex-minister can still seek pre-arrest bail or challenge ED charges in HC||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Though the Supreme Court has granted him no immediate interim protection against any coercive action in the alleged money laundering case being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate, former state home minister Anil Deshmukh can still apply for pre-arrest bail before the trial court. A special three-judge bench of the SC comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar, Krishna Murari and V Ramasubramanian on Monday said to Deshmukh’s counsel that he has alternate remedies under the criminal procedure code (CrPC) for relief. Under CrPC, a criminal law expert said, if a case is registered or being investigated against a person, he or she can seek anticipatory bail before the lower court. A legal expert said Deshmukh also has the option of challenging the ED proceedings before Bombay high court and seek interim protection. Advocate Kamlesh Ghumre, who is representing Deshmukh, said on Monday, “We will take an appropriate decision after studying the interim order.” On August 6, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) carried out raids at three premises in search of Deshmukh and to gather evidence. The raid continued till late night but Deshmukh was untraceable, the agency had said. Following the SC order, the Enforcement Directorate is hopeful the former home minister will surrender and join the money laundering investigation pending against him. An ED source said, “ED expects Deshmukh to appear before it to record his statement in the case, as he promised in a video he had released earlier. The ED established a money trail of Rs 4.7 crore bribe that was collected by Sachin Waze, in which Deshmukh is beneficiary. ED needs to question Deshmukh about those transactions.” Earlier an ED official had said action can be taken against Deshmukh for avoiding summons, as the court has not given him any interim protection in the case. According to the agency, the former home minister and senior NCP leader has exhausted all his options as he has not been cooperating with the probe, evading repeated summonses and has been absconding — all criteria fulfilling conditions for arrest. Meanwhile, in the case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing charges made by by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh that the latter had set a monthly target for senior police officers to collect Rs 100 crore of extortion money from dance bars in Mumbai, the Bombay high court has dismissed Deshmukh’s quashing petition against the case and his special leave petition seeking to challenge the HC dismissal is pending before the SC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-minister-can-still-seek-pre-arrest-bail-or-challenge-ed-charges-in-hc/articleshow/85386583.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Ghoti-Bangal face-off at London football match||KOLKATA: Kolkata Maidan may be missing its favourite sport, but the Ghoti-Bangal football battle cry resonated through London this Independence Day, when the Bengali diaspora had its fan football tournament at the Slough Town FC ground. IFA (Indian Fans Alliance) Shield UK, which took a Covid break last year, featured three games between Covid warriors and survivors, one for women, and the iconic East Bengal-Mohon Bagan derby. The day-long football extravaganza also sported a delectable spread of illish and chingri delicacies. “Kolkata Maidan’s century-old friendly enmity between the two giants of Calcutta Football League brings out the quintessential Bengaliness not only in the City of Joy but also the UK,” quipped Londoner Anirban Mukhopadhyay, a die-hard East-Bengal fan, who conceived the idea in 2018. “Yesterday’s match also celebrated 100 years of derby,” said Subhadeep Bose, member, organizing committee. Bhaskar Bhattacharyya, who helped get the FA accreditation, said, “It was heartening to see Bengalis from different walks of life united by the spirit of football, just when the game seems swept over by consumerism.” Along with the UK Bengalis, Subhojit Ghosh Choudhury of Belghoria, Debashis Ghosh from Jadavpur and Kumartuli artisan Kaushik Ghosh, who designed the shields, were involved in the event. The men’s final saw Mohun Bagan beat East Bengal 3-1 to bag the shield, a replica of Kolkata’s IFA Shield. Virendra Sharma, MP, Ealing Southall, and chairman, Indo-British Parliamentary Group, gave away the trophies. The eves’ trophy was christened after Lakshmi Chopra, mother of Kolkata-based businessman Pradip Chopra, director, Heritage Bengal Foundation, the non-profit organization which supported the event along with Pointers Business Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ghoti-bangal-face-off-at-london-football-match/articleshow/85381892.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Allahabad||Six-lane bridge to ease up Shringverpur dham path for pilgrims||Prayagraj: Visiting the noted pilgrimage site of Shringverpur Dham, located 30 km from Sangam city in the trans-Ganga area of Prayagraj district would now become easier. As part of the ambitious Ram Van Gaman Path project, a 1200-meter long six-lane bridge will be built here to ease the darshan for pilgrims. For Shringvepur Dham, a 30 km road will be built from Avtarpur in Pratapgarh to Muratganj in Kaushambi district which will be part of the Marg (route) which is believed to be the route taken by Lord Ram for exile. As part of this very initiative, a six-lane bridge has been approved on the Ganga. A total of Rs 1,785 crore will be spent on this entire project, said deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya during his visit to the city. The deputy CM also informed that a ramp for the elderly would also be built in the six-lane bridge to be built at Shringverpur. This phase of the project would be completed by October. Maurya said that the construction of the Ram Van Gagam path will be complete with the installation of the Kalash of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Starting from Mohanlalganj to Raipura in Chitrakoot, the work of Ram Van Gaman Marg will be done in four phases. The total length of the route will be 132 km for which an amount of Rs 3,300 crore would be incurred by the government. Maurya further informed that this is the dream project of the government and that the district magistrates (DMs) of all districts together should remove all the obstacles in this path. There are a total of 44 such religious spots on the Ram Van Gaman Marg, which is associated with Lord Ram. The development and construction of National Highway No 731A from Mohanganj to Jethwara - Shringverpur - Muratganj - Mahewaghat - Rajapur to Chitrakoot has been divided into four phases. In the first phase, the length of the route from Mohanganj to Autarpur is 35 km. In the second phase, the length of Autarpur to Muratganj is 29.682 km in which a six-lane 1200-meter long bridge is also proposed on the river Ganga at Shringverpur Dham. The third phase is of the total length of 48.068 km and is from Muratganj to Mahewaghat, it is proposed to be widened to four lanes. The route also includes Manjhanpur bypass and Rajapur bypass. The fourth phase is from Rajapur to Raipura, which has a total length of 19.25 km. The estimated cost of the route from Mohanganj to Raipura will be around Rs 3,300 crores. The construction work of this road will be completed in a phased manner in the coming three years. The deputy CM said that due to the preparation of this route, it would be convenient for the devotees to travel from Ayodhya to Chitrakoot. After the construction of Ram Van Gaman Marg, development work will be done at a faster pace, tourism will also be promoted, which will also provide employment opportunities. Maurya also informed that travelling from Kaushambi to Andawa will now be easy as the road as a 46-km- long four-lane will be ready in near future. The estimated cost for this will be Rs 800 crores. Along with the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the construction work of Ram Van Gaman Marg is also going on at a brisk pace. From Ayodhya to Markandeya Ashram Chitrakoot, 44 such places have been identified where Lord Ram stayed during his exile along with his wife Sita and brother Laxman, that are places of great significance for the pilgrims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/six-lane-bridge-to-ease-up-shringverpur-dham-path-for-pilgrims/articleshow/85385214.cms||---

Police said they would conduct a thorough probe before making an arrest. The actress has mainly worked in south Indian cinema. Police said the 35-year-old actress had given the accused a contract for interior decoration at her new apartment at Andheri’s Veera Desai Road. In the first week of July, she visited the apartment to check on the work but she did not like what she saw. When she confronted the designer about shoddy work an altercation broke out. He allegedly hurled expletives at her and threw her out of the apartment. The actress claimed the designer threatened her against going to police, so the complaint was delayed. “We registered a complaint under sections 354, 504, 509 of IPC based on the statement of the actress. Investigations are on,” said a police official. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-booked-as-actress-claims-molestation/articleshow/85386165.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Coaches arrive for ‘heritage train’ safari through Dudhwa tiger reserve||BAREILLY: A ‘heritage train’ — equipped with air conditioning and a glass ceiling — will soon take travellers on a 100km ride through the core area of the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and nearby forests which are teeming with tigers, rhinoceros and elephants. Six gleaming Vistadome coaches that featured wide windows and reclining seats arrived at Mailani railway station in Lakhimpur Kheri district on Saturday. The coaches were manufactured in Mhow (Madhya Pradesh) and sent on a freight train. Chief public relations officer North Eastern Railways, Pankaj Singh, told TOI, “The operating schedule of the train will be finalised soon. The heritage train will definitely boost tourism in Dudhwa Tiger reserve.” The heritage train is named so since it is meant to display the national heritage of the country, in this case, the tiger reserve. A local hotelier, Aniket Agarwal, expressed hope that the unique experience of a train safari would put Dudhwa on the international tourist map. “Tourists now look for comfort and ease of travel. Such a train would provide both while also taking them through scenic forests. This is likely to increase footfall.” The project, however, has had its share of controversies. In February this year, TOI had reported that a petition alleging contempt of court related to the proposed train was filed by Lucknow-based wildlife enthusiast Kaushlendra Singh. According to Singh, he had filed a plea against the project in the Allahabad high court in 2018 soon after the state forest authorities in consensus with the NE Railways had announced the train that would run on the Mailani-Nanpara railway track. The track is open to passenger trains. Singh said that during the hearing of his plea, the then principal secretary of forest in government of UP, Kalpana Awasthi, had filed an affidavit to the court in March 2019, asserting that no heritage train would be operated in Dudhwa national park in future. Singh said that affidavit of the principal secretary had convinced the division bench of justice Shabiul Hasnain and justice Chandra Dhari Singh over the rejection of plan to operate the heritage train in DNP following which it had said in its order that “since the statement has been made by a senior most officer, we don’t find that any further orders in this regard are necessary”. Singh’s latest plea argued that the fresh plan was “an open defiance of the HC order as well as the retraction of the forest department from its own commitment filed on oath to HC”. “The contempt petition had become inevitable to protect the wildlife from fatal accidents on the railway track,” he said. The tiger population in Dudhwa is estimated to be over 100. The case is ongoing. Field director of Dudhwa, Sanjay Pathak, told TOI that he hasn't yet received information on the functioning of the heritage train. "Other trains on the track already have the necessary permission to run at a prescribed speed limit," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/coaches-arrive-for-heritage-train-safari-through-dudhwa-tiger-reserve/articleshow/85379629.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Corporation vax vials ‘smuggled’ into private clinic, 1 dismissed||THANE: The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) on Sunday dismissed a medical professional hired to oversee the functioning of the Covid centre and vaccination process at Mumbra after a cache of vaccine vials under her custody was found ‘smuggled’ out to a private clinic, officials said. Mayor Naresh Mhaske said the professional, who was hired in June 2020 as a Covid contractual medical officer, was relieved of her term after a preliminary probe showed that Covid-19 vaccines meant for the civic vaccination centre were found at a private clinic owned by a political functionary. “We will probe if there has been any prior misuse of vaccine at the facility,” Mhaske added. A senior officer from TMC’s health department, on condition of anonymity, said, “After we were alerted of an illegal vaccination camp being conducted at a hair transplant clinic, we rushed to the spot. We found three filled and one used vial from the civic stock at the clinic.” The senior civic officer added: “Accordingly, we have relieved the professional from her responsibility at the facility till the investigation is completed. We have also written to the Mumbra police to investigate the matter further.” The issue came to the fore after one of the beneficiaries who was waiting at the vaccination centre tipped off the civic body about vaccine vials being smuggled out of the facility. While 300 doses were to be delivered, only 150 beneficiaries were allotted tokens on Saturday. Following the alert, a municipal team raided the clinic and were shocked to find it operating as a private Covid vaccination centre without any approval from the Thane civic corporation. The teams found three filled vaccine vials and an empty one. On being questioned, the staff at the clinic admitted to have procured the vials from the municipal corporation facility. The facility has been sealed till investigations are completed, said sources. The Mumbra police said that they have received a written application from the Thane Municipal Corporation informing them about the incident. However, the police added, no one has approached them so far to register a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-tmc-vax-vials-smuggled-into-pvt-clinic-1-dismissed/articleshow/85384290.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The incident came to light after a video clip of the incident went viral on social media. In the video, Auraiya district magistrate Sunil Kumar Verma could be seen hoisting the flag wrongly and people singing the national anthem at Kakor headquarters of the district. In the hoisted national flag, the upper band is green, the middle white and the lower strip saffron. After hoisting the flag upside down, the DM’s subordinates also raised their hands to salute it. However, they too could not identify the colours of the national flag properly. The DM, however, said, “We were practicing flag hoisting. At that time, the tri-colour was turned upside down by mistake. This happened at around 7:45 am. Later, the flag was straightened and hoisted officially at 8:00 am. The local media took out the photos and videos of the initial mistake and deliberately put them on social media.” To a question whether any such trials are held before hoisting the flag, the DM said, “My mistake was that I was doing the trial myself. Had someone else been doing this in my place, it would not have been such a big issue. This is a deliberate mischief wherein the tri-colour was turned upside down, and I have sought clarification from the staff in this regard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/auraiya-dm-hoists-national-flag-upside-down/articleshow/85385322.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Delhi||27 fresh Covid cases in Delhi, lowest since April 15 last year||NEW DELHI: The capital on Monday reported 27 Covid-19 cases — the lowest since April 15 last year. While the case positivity rate stood at 0.07%, no deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours. With the fresh cases, the overall infection tally in the city climbed to 14,37,118. Of this, over 14.11 lakh patients have recovered from the disease. The death toll due to the viral infection in Delhi stands at 25,069.A total of sixteen people have succumbed to the disease this month so far. Monday’s low daily tally could be due to reduced testing. In the past 24 hours, data shared by the government showed that only 39,587 tests were conducted — nearly half of the average number of tests carried out daily during weekdays. Of this, 34,708 were RT-PCR tests, while the rest were via the rapid antigen method officials said. Delhi battled a brutal second wave of the pandemic that has claimed a massive number of lives, with shortage of oxygen at hospitals across the city only adding to the woes. On April 20, Delhi had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in the city since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22, the case positivity rate was 36.2%, the highest so far. The highest number of deaths (448) was reported on May 3. The state government has been ramping up the health infrastructure of the capital to prevent a repeat of the crisis witnessed during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic in April-May. Steps have been taken to increase the number of hospital beds to accommodate up to 37,000 cases a day and to become self-reliant in terms of oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/27-fresh-covid-cases-in-delhi-lowest-since-april-15-last-yr/articleshow/85381957.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Why eateries in Khan Market, Hauz Khas Village are sitting ducks||NEW DELHI: Most eateries in the popular restaurant hub of Khan Market do not have fire clearance. In 2016, a court had ordered New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Fire Service to revisit the policy exempting eateries with seating area for fewer than 50 people from requiring the fire department’s no-objection certificate. The fire department said that the policy was subsequently changed to have only those establishments with an area of 90 square yards and above mandatorily requiring fire clearance. That may be the law, but the fact is many restaurants with the stipulated area do not have valid fire certificates yet. Atul Garg, director, DFS, disclosed, “Only three eateries out of 35 at Khan Market have a fire certificate. Since we are ourselves not a licensing authority, we wrote to NDMC in 2018 requesting non-renewal of licences of those restaurants not following the norms. In Khan Market, the staircases are narrow with a width of 1-1.5 metres only. Hauz Khas Village too has the same problem of single staircase for entry and exit.” Anshu Tandon, president, Khan Market Welfare Association, said, “While NDMC has rightly issued health licences for a majority of restaurants with less than 50 seats, the civic body officials also insisted in a few cases that fire clearance was mandatory even if the restaurant seated less than 50 guests.” Because of this, Tandon claimed, some member restaurants were compelled to approach Delhi High Court. “The court has granted stays and barred NDMC, Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service from taking any coercive steps,” he said. Tandon added that the fire department couldn’t amend the law. “This is mala fide, motivated and a misuse of power. It creates hurdles and defies the principle of rationality and ease of doing business,” he bristled. Fire officials countered that they couldn’t wait and watch for a tragedy to happen and then assess the situation when they could prevent it. A fire official pointed out that Khan Market was a high footfall area with inadequate parking that made movement of vehicles difficult in the commercial centre. He added, “A fire tender won’t be able to pass through the blocked lanes. But emergency situations can be averted and precautionary measures can be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-eateries-in-khan-mkt-hkv-are-sitting-ducks/articleshow/85382010.cms||---

The IMD Santacruz observatory has recorded that the city received 2218.2mm rain so far. With so much rain, Monday saw pleasant weather conditions in the city. This was because there was little difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures. The maximum recorded by IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatories stood at 27.8C and 28.1C, respectively. The minimum temperatures were 25C (Colaba) and 23.8C (Santacruz). August has not brought any extreme rain activity in the city. Normal rain is 546.2 mm for the month, and so far only 134.2 mm have been recorded. In the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Monday, Colaba recorded 8.2mm while Santacruz recorded 30.5mm of rain. This year, most of the heavy rains recorded were restricted to a few hours only: between July 16-17 IMD Santacruz recorded 253.3 mm rain while in the 24 hours between July 17-18 Santacruz had recorded 235 mm. Prior to it between June 9-10, rainfall of 231.3mm was recorded in a 24-hour period. The rains seem to be picking up pace again, and the IMD issued a yellow alert for Wednesday for Mumbai indicating heavy rains at isolated places being very likely. For places like Thane, Palghar and Raigad the IMD has issued a yellow alert for Tuesday as well, while Mumbai remains under a green alert (for Tuesday). IMD scientist Shubhangi Bhute said a low pressure is forming in the Bay of Bengal owing to which parts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and places in Madhya Maharashtra (like Nashik, Pune) could receive heavy rains and an alert has been issued. Water in the lakes has also crossed 12 lakh million litres and water stocks in the biggest lake Bhatsa has touched 80% of the requirement. The total water stocks in the seven lakes supplying water to the city currently stands at 83% of the required quantum. Last year on the same date the total water stocks stood at 76%. In the 24-hour between August 15-16, rainfall recorded in Upper Vaitarna was 13 mm, Modak Sagar 26 mm, Tansa 19 mm, Middle Vaitarna 30mm, Bhatsa 22mm, Vihar 43 mm and Tulsi 88 mm. The lakes need to have 14.47 lakh million litres of water in them till October 1 to suffice for the city’s needs for the remaining part of the year.

The last letter in this regard was written by B Block RWA on August 14, a day before the fire claimed two lives. While the Oyo hotel apparently was running without a health trade licence, the fire department said on Monday that it did not have fire clearance either. Ruing that many apartment buildings had been converted into small hotels, guesthouses, Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service, told TOI, “In most such facilities, the electricity meter board is located close to the staircase which is also often the only access point. In case of fire that spreads before people become aware of it, as happened in Dwarka hotel, people lose their lives because they get trapped on the staircase.” The hotel began operating around six months ago, informed B S Tripathi, secretary, RWA, Sector-8 B-Block, and the RWA had requested local DDA officials to check if its usage of residential property as a guesthouse was valid. “But we received no response,” said Tripathi. “There are more properties in the area being run as small hotels. In many cases, boards signifying them as such haven’t been put up.” Read AlsoDelhi: 15-year-old girl among 2 dead in Dwarka hotel fire, six injuredTwo people died, while at least six others were injured after a fire broke out at an Oyo facility in Dwarka on Sunday morning.

The letter was supported by applications on the matter from local residents. The RWA letter said (sic), “These unchecked unknown suspicions could be source of big problem.... You are requested to take necessary action to stop the above activities in the area for the betterment of residents." Police officers claimed to have issued a kalandra, a sort of notice of breach of legality, to the facility. “We are conducting an enquiry and also probing if the hotel had a fake fire clearance,” said an officer. “We are now cracking down on such guesthouses and hotels in Dwarka along with the civic authorities.” Read AlsoDelhi: Why eateries in Khan Market, Hauz Khas Village are sitting ducksMost eateries in the popular restaurant hub of Khan Market do not have fire clearance.

The Dwarka fire, 30 months later, has occurred in similar circumstances. A Najafgarh zone official of South Delhi Municipal Corporation maintained that a show-cause notice was issued on August 14 to the hotel because it did not have a health trade licence. Questions are now being asked why it was allowed to operate without the licence. While the spokesperson of the civic body did not respond to TOI queries, another official claimed that a probe had been ordered. After the Arpit Hotel fire, the fire department made changes to require all hotels to have an escape route unendangered by combustible material like carpets, wooden fixtures and combustible materials as well as the installation of fire-check doors and carbon monoxide detectors of high sensitivity in every room and floors. The Dwarka hotel had none of these. “We are deeply concerned by the fire incident at the property being operated as the hotel registered on our platform,” said an Oyo spokesperson. “The hotels on our platform are directly run and managed by operators or owners, but we insist that they always follow legal protocols while checking in any guest including verifying their identity proof.” The spokesperson added, “As per our preliminary checks, the deceased had not booked the hotel through our platform. We are extending all possible cooperation in the regulatory investigation. Safety is always our top priority. The property concerned is closed and sealed till further notice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dwarka-hotel-fire-officials-turned-a-blind-eye-to-rampant-violations/articleshow/85381978.cms||Sakshi Chand

It asked the state government to consider issuing directions to police throughout the state to ensure it does not happen again. A division bench pointed out that the photographs placed before the court from March last year shows schoolchildren (two boys and a girl) being interrogated by five police personnel — four of them in full uniform and at least two carrying firearms. The bench noted that deputy superintendent of police Basaveshwar had not dealt with the photos in his affidavit filed at the same time last year. “Prima facie this is a serious case of violation of rights of children and provisions of Juvenile Justice Act. We direct the state to respond by filing a response stating on record what action has been initiated against the police official,” the bench said. The court noted that only plain clothes police personnel can interact with kids, and where a girl is involved, women personnel should be brought in. It asked the DG and IGP to nominate a higher level officer to look into the violations and file a response by September 3, before the next hearing in the case.

The Rs 18-crore ladder will help firefighters reach up to 25 floors in an emergency. An expert from the Finnish manufacturer, Bronto Skylift, will train a batch of personnel how to operate the machine. An official said, “Maintenance will be done by the manufacturer for a period of 10 years. As the city’s skyline is getting taller, the new hydraulic ladder will help keep people safe at times of emergency.” Many believe the Rajasthan high court may now allow the state government to construct highrises. Increased population and land rates have forced the government to allow construction of multistoreys up to 32 metre and above. However, in absence of adequate equipment and fire tenders. the court had asked the state government not to allow construction of buildings that are 32-metre high (11 storeys). Coming down heavily on the state government for not being serious about fire safety measures in highrises and malls, the court asked the government to provide details of all existing buildings that have a height of 32 metres or more and given fire NOC prior to this order. The reason for capping the height limit was that none of the fire stations in the state has hydraulic ladders that are more than 32-metre high. A source said, “Now, we will approch the court to request to lift the ban.” Apart from this, fire hydrant system will also be installed in the city. A fire hydrant is a point through which firefighters can tap into water supply. These fire hydrants help fire officials get water supply on the spot instead ongoing back to the fire station for a refill. An officer at JMC-Heritage said, “This will be a 7km long system in which 30 fire hydrants will be installed at various points including Ghat Gate crossing, Sanjay Market, Indira Market, Badi Chaupar, Choti Chaupar and will finally end at Kishanpole Market. This will be beneficial for fire officials in the crowded Walled City area .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-firefighters-get-rs-18cr-hi-tech-ladder-to-tame-blaze-in-highrises/articleshow/85384395.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Particulate pollution rose 118% in storm||AHMEDABAD: Each time there is a dust storm in Ahmedabad, local meteorologists and atmospheric scientists have strived to know, as to how it affects our local environment and the level of pollution including the microbes it brings along. Very recently, on April 27, a team of scientists from Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and Space Applications Centre (SAC), Isro measured a stark increase in dust pollution by 118.5%, which is referred as PM10 and a 44.5% increase in concentration of much smaller particles called PM2.5. Both these are harmful for the lungs. The scientists had measured these values for the first time during a dust event using hi-tech equipment and satellites. The dust storm also caused turbulent temperature variations. It was also reported for the first time in western region about the temporary disruption of the crucial Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) over Ahmedabad. This is the crucial region of the lower troposphere where Earth’s surface strongly influences temperature, moisture, and wind through the turbulent transfer of air mass. The study claims that the temperatures reduced to around 30 degrees celsius from around 40 degrees celsius during the dust event. The permissible limits of PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 microgram per cubic meter respectively. “During the April 27 dust storm event, transportation of coarse desert dust in addition to changes in ABL contributed to high values of PM10 which went up to 746.5 microgram per cubic metre while PM 2.5 levels went up to 273.8 microgram per cubic metre,” states the study by Professors Som K Sharma and Shyam Lal from PRL, senior scientists Abha Chhabra and Prashant Kumar from SAC and K Niranjan Kumar from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting. “Studies in the past have reported adverse health issues such as premature mortality, exacerbate bronchitis, asthma attacks, other respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular attacks, etc., if humans are exposed to the sudden increase of particulate matter,” added the preprint of the study published in Research Square. The scientists also noticed an unstable ABL which further encouraged dust higher in the air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/particulate-pollution-rose-118-in-storm/articleshow/85382108.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds dismissal of govt staffer who violated ‘small family’ rule||MUMBAI: Bombay high court recently upheld dismissal from government service of a man who never disclosed that he was the father of three children, when eligibility criteria allowed only two. He was found ineligible under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Declaration of Small Family) Rules, 2005. A ‘small family’ means husband, wife and two children. “It is well known that fraud vitiates even the most solemn proceedings in any civilized system of jurisprudence,’’ said the Bombay high court bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni adding, “Generally speaking, in a democratic polity governed by the rule of law, perpetration of fraud by a party has to be viewed with utmost seriousness and concern and should never be condoned.’’ The rules are for recruitment for posts in groups ‘A to D’. The man had applied under group ‘C’ for post of technical laboratory assistant in 2013. The advertisement for the job required aspirants to submit a ‘small family’ certificate, under the rules and were warned of consequences should they conceal information or give false declaration. “The candour that was required of the petitioner while applying for public employment was sadly missing since, being the father of three children, he was aware that a true and proper disclosure would have dented his chance for consideration of his candidature for such appointment. Once it was found that on the date of his appointment he had three children but had suppressed relevant information while applying for the post, the very foundation vanished, rendering his appointment ‘illegal’. The conduct of the petitioner is such that it renders him unfit to be continued in service and necessarily deserved termination of service,’’ said the HC. The state terminated his service in 2016 after issuing him a notice of ineligibility. In June 2021, the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal upheld his dismissal. He challenged the order in HC. The 2005 rules said if a child/children are born in a single delivery within a year from commencement, till March 27, 2016, the couple would still be eligible. But the petitioner, had withheld information of his youngest child who was born in May 2006, after the cut-off date, the high court noted. In June 2014, when joining service, he declared he was a father of three children. To a notice from the state, he said he had “inadvertently’’ mentioned two children when submitting his application online. Government lawyer Bhupesh Samant informed the high court that such explanation was considered unsatisfactory and led to termination of his service, effective March 2016. “It is preposterous that an educated individual like the petitioner, who claims to have been associated with the private sector for 16 long years as an employee, would commit an inadvertent error while applying for public employment,” the HC said, adding, “Regrettably, thereby, he disowned his third child with the sole view to gain an entry into the zone of consideration by means of deceit.” His counsel, V M Thorat, contended that no rule was violated and said the cut-off date should have been 2007, due to an amendment. He cited a constitutional safeguard and argued the government could not have dismissed the employee without an inquiry. The HCnoted no amendment, as claimed, was produced by Thorat. The HC said, having applied in terms of the advertisement, he has to be held bound by its terms. “ The basic facts being undisputed, the petitioner cannot succeed on such specious plea, as raised,’’ held the HC, dismissing the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-servant-who-secretly-had-more-than-2-kids-loses-job/articleshow/85384431.cms||Swati Deshpande

There were no traditional gatherings at fire temples for prayers, no breakfast meets and no mass dinner at the Olpadvala Hall. The century-old Calcutta Parsi Amateur Dramatic Club staged its play for Navroz for the 114th year, though the old charm of watching it live was missing. The play was streamed on the social media as the community members either watched from home or at the Parsee Club. The play, Bolti Bandh, was a Gujarati comedy, revolving around a worried mother trying to get a suitor for her over-aged daughter. The play has been directed by Cyrus Madan. Tehnaz Punwani, Pervez Kaikobad, Indrani Anklesaria, Darius Pathanki and Malcolm Tarapore have acted in it. It was uploaded on social media at 7pm. “We rehearsed partly online and four times physically and finally filmed it on Saturday,” said director Madan. A short English recital on Two Ronnies based on the TV series was performed by Madan and Yezdi Karai. A song was also sung by professional singer of the community, Kaizad Gherda.  “We looked forward to the programme, especially the play, which happened despite all odds,” said president of Parsee Club and author Prochy Mehta. About 50 members watched the play on the big screen at the club. “The traditional morning breakfast of aleti-paleti and akuri breakfast was missed by all,” said Dinyar Mucadum, president of the CC&FC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/parsis-celebrate-restricted-navroz-for-2nd-year-running/articleshow/85382022.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||Respite from Covid, but seasonal flu has Delhiites rushing to hospitals||NEW DELHI: Viral illnesses caused by seasonal influenza viruses continue to soar in Delhi even as there is a drop in Covid-19 cases. Doctors say OPDs are flooded with patients suffering from fever, cough and sore throat — common symptoms caused by the commonly found influenza viruses — leading to panic among people as Covid-19 also has similar symptoms. Many patients also have very high fever — 103 degrees Fahrenheit and above — despite medications which, in some cases, necessitates hospitalisation. “We are getting very few cases of Covid now. But there is a significant rise in cases of upper respiratory tract infections caused by seasonal influenza viruses,” Dr Suresh Kumar of Lok Nayak claimed. According to Dr Neeraj Nischal, additional professor in the department of medicine at AIIMS, seasonal influenza is self-limiting. “People need not panic. High fever for two-three days is one of the defining features of any viral illness. It usually subsides without any active medical intervention.” Swine flu, typhoid and malaria are also commonly found in the current weather condition and, therefore, medical supervision is advised for elderly and those with history of chronic illnesses, he added. “The treatment of these illnesses is mostly symptomatic. However, if a person has malaria or typhoid, specific medications may help in better management.” Last year, due to the lockdown and heightened precautions such as wearing masks and washing hands regularly, the incidence of such illnesses was less, doctors say. Apollo, Max, Manipal and Sir Ganga Ram are also witnessing a high influx of such patients. “Every day, we are seeing 10-15 patients suffering from flu. Most of them have a Covid-negative report but high fever for two days. People don’t want to take chances, so they come to hospital. Some patients genuinely require admission due to severe symptoms or comorbidities,” a senior doctor explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/respite-from-covid-but-seasonal-flu-has-delhiites-rushing-to-hosps/articleshow/85382040.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The state education department is planning to cut 30% syllabus for about 9-lakh Class 10 and about 7-lakh Class 12 students due to the Covid-19 pandemic, said sources close to the development. The decision is on the lines of the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) which announced reduction in syllabus by 30% last month, according to sources. A committee has been formed by GSHSEB to look into the matter and submit its findings to the state education department. “The committee will recommend 30% cut in syllabus after taking into consideration various aspects, especially the continuity factor in further studies. The government will take a final call on the extent to which the syllabus is to be truncated,” said an official. The syllabus will be revised only for the academic year 2021-22. In Class 10 and Class 12 the GSHSEB conducted board examination, questions will not be asked from the chapters that have been excluded from the syllabus. Similarly, the committee will ensure that chapters that are important for competitive exams are not excluded, said sources. Apart from deciding to continue the shortened syllabuses for the second year in a row, the GSHSEB will also release the term-wise syllabus for Class 10 and Class 12 to all schools. State education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama did not respond to calls to his mobile phone. In September 2020, the state education department had announced to reduce the syllabus by 30% for Class 9 to Class 12 students amid Covid-19 situation for the academic year 2020-21 as students were learning through online mode. This year also the pandemic situation has forced schools to remain closed in the first quarter of the academic year and schools are teaching students online. The government has allowed re-opening of schools for in-person classroom studies for Class 9 to Class 12 students from the month of July with only 50% of the total student strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gshseb-may-cut-30-syllabus-for-classes-10-12/articleshow/85382100.cms||Bharat Yagnik

To start with, four such underground waste depots will be constructed at a cost of Rs 10 lakh each. If the plan is successful, then trash depots in all the wards of Walled City can go underground. The civic body has prepared this plan keeping in mind the Swachha Survekshan drive.JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar said, “We are coming up with new options for cleanliness of Jaipur city. We cannot eliminate the garbage depots completely, but to make the system smart, we have made underground dustbins. Four places have been identified under the pilot project. If the plan is successful, then overground garbage depots along the roads will be removed”. Shalimar Bagh on Ajmer Road, Civil Lines Park and Ganpati Enclave have identified for the construction of the underground bins. Above the bins, there will be a beautiful platform where benches will be set up. The site of the garbage depot will be completely beautified.Once the underground waste depots are filled, the waste bin will be taken out using an earthmover and dumped into a dumper and then transported to the dumping yard.

The civic body has identified the owners whose land will be acquired for construction and widening work. An official said, “The cost of the project and land acquisition will cost approximately Rs 200 crore. The nod for the work was received in the recent executive committee meeting.” Once the exercise is completed, more than 100 colonies will get direct connectivity including Privthi Raj Nagar scheme. As per the proposal, one 200-feet wide road has been named as Vande Mataram Marg which will be constructed between Gopalpura Bypass and Diggi Malpura Road. “The total length of the road is 8km, out of which the JDA has already carried out construction in 6km. In the remaining 2km, the exercise to acquire land from farmers will be initiated. As a decision has been taken to give prompt compensation, it is believed that farmers will come forward to surrender their land.” Once Vande Mataram road is operational, residents of approximately 50 to 60 colonies will get direct connectivity to Kalyanpura railway overbridge. The civic body will construct the second road parallel to the Vande Mataram Marg. It will start from JDA’s West Way Height scheme on Ajmer Road and will pass through Gate No. 3 of Muhana Mandi to Diggi Malpura Road. The total length of this road is 10 kilometres. This road will ease the way for the people of about 40 colonies. The third sector road of 200 feet will connect the first and second roads. This road, about 7km long, will directly connect Ring Road from Golayawas Circle via Journalist Colony. Similarly, fourth and fifth sector roads of 200-200 feet will also connect the first and second roads at different points. An official said, “Residents of three dozen colonies will get direct connectivity with the construction of a road going from Goliawas Circle to the Ring Road via Patrakar Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/wider-roads-to-ease-traffic-connectivity/articleshow/85384439.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: House help killed by electrician & aide after theft bid goes awry||NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old domestic help was allegedly murdered by an electrician and his associate — all working in the same house in central Delhi’s Patel Nagar on Sunday evening. Cops have formed multiple teams to arrest the suspects. According to police, the victim’s employers were out for lunch and had left their help behind as the house was undergoing renovation work. The electrician was known to the family and would often visit their place in case of any issues. On Sunday, he along with his associates, tried to steal cash and jewellery, following which the woman raised an alarm and was subsequently murdered. The crime came to fore after the victim’s employer called up her husband and asked him to check the house as the help did not respond. Meanwhile, the PCR received a call from the house owner around 5.30pm informing them about the burglary and the murder. “It was revealed that the help, Sarita (35), was working in the kitchen while some labourers were working in the flat for renovation. While the owners left for lunch in the afternoon, Sarita was expected to leave after the labourers finished their job in 15-20 minutes,” a senior police officer said. However, when the owner of flat asked the security guard to check on his flat since Sarita was not picking her call, he found the woman lying on the floor. She was rushed to hospital, where doctors declared her dead on arrival. Cops later found that jewellery and cash were missing from the house. A case of murder and violent robbery has been registered and forensic teams have inspected the spot. Cops are waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain whether there was any sexual assault. Footage from CCTV cameras near the house has been collected and technical surveillance is being used to identify and nab the suspects. Raids are also being conducted at the possible hideouts with cops expecting a breakthrough soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/house-help-killed-by-electrician-aide-after-theft-bid-goes-awry/articleshow/85382060.cms||---
---||Delhi||No HC relief for pvt schools on TC rule||New Delhi: An association of private schools on Monday failed to get relief from Delhi High Court in a case in which they had challenged the Delhi government’s decision to admit children without insisting on transfer certificates from private schools.While refusing to entertain the association’s plea, Justice Prateek Jalan declined to issue notice on the petition and pointed out that prima facie there is no law barring a government school from admitting a student without a TC. The court also wondered “why a school association is opposing admission of students in government schools by parents who can’t afford to send their wards to a private one.”The court maintained that the school association had not been able to show any law that created a right in their favour against the decision of government schools to admit children without transfer certificates. It was hearing a plea by National Independent Schools Alliance, an association of 146 budget private schools, which claimed that the directorate of education’s move violated provisions of Delhi School Education Rules, 1973.Developing arguments on the notice, the plea argued that the government is encouraging unscrupulous parents to admit the students in the government schools without getting the pre-condition of getting the School Leaving Certificate (SLC)/ Transfer Certificate from the previous school by the outgoing student.“The respondents have posted the tweets, as well as, news items were published inviting the students to get the admission in the private unaided schools without getting the SLC/TC from the previous school,” the plea said. It added that “fee and funds to be received by the school authorities are their only source of earning from which they are running the schools as most of the member schools of the petitioner society are the budget schools which are charging very meager fee from the students. Even if the parents will not pay the fee, it will create the issue of survivability for the member schools.”The association had earlier sent a legal notice to deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia in this regard. Sisodia had announced that if any parent wanted to shift their children to government schools, they could get provisional admission without TC. The directorate of education will be getting the transfer certificate from the private schools that the children will be leaving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-hc-relief-for-pvt-schools-on-tc-rule/articleshow/85382089.cms||---

The report titled `Telangana – A bright spot in India’s industrial & warehousing future’ said that an additional 5 msft is expected to this over the next three years. According to the report, while the warehouse space take-up in Hyderabad during 2018-H1 2021 was about 11 msft with leasing predominantly concentrated in semi-investment grade properties, warehouse leasing during H1 2021 was mainly driven by retail players (43%), followed by 3PL (19%) and e-commerce companies (15%). Also, the average deal size has been increasing at a steady pace over the past three years, CBRE said attributing it to the growing preference for larger spaces with a view to develop fulfilment centres. The report pointed out that the key contributors during H1 2021 were retail players with an average deal size of 130,000 sq ft followed by e-commerce with 92,000 sq ft and 3PL at 40,000 sq ft. The launch of better-quality warehouses along with demand from occupiers to lease large-sized spaces also led to an increase in rental values of about 5-14% during H1 2021 across micro-markets in Hyderabad, CBRE said. A rapidly expanding industrial base coupled with rising demand from e-commerce and 3PL (third party logistics) players drove warehousing activity in Hyderabad and led to a visible shift in terms of quality of supply, said the report. According to CBRE, the fillip provided by infrastructural intervention and the policies introduced by the Telangana government, including TS-iPASS have supported the growth of the state’s industrial & warehousing (I&W) sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hyd-to-add-5m-sq-ft-of-warehousing-space-by-2024-to-cross-25m-sq-ft/articleshow/85382167.cms||---

Fed up, Hari Om decided to abduct her and bring her back. He assumed his friend, Param Singh , would help him in executing the plan. Therefore, he invited Param for drinks at his farmhouse so that they could chalk out the plan on August 13. Both were high when Hari Om broached the matter. But Param Singh was not willing to participate in the abduction. Dharamveer Singh, superintendent of police, said during questioning, Param revealed that Hari Om lost his temper when he refused. Both got into a heated argument and Hari Om turned violent. Param retaliated by striking him on the head with a rod. He fled thereafter. Hari Om was found dead the next morning. The SSP said a police team had been formed to crack the case. Param Singh was arrested through a surveillance system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-attacks-friend-for-refusing-to-abduct-wife-killed/articleshow/85379818.cms||Harveer Dabas

The department, in its recent order, has relaxed this criteria. In various orders on “expenditure management and rationalisation of expenditure” since the Covid-19 outbreak, different directions have been given on any expenditure of Rs 1 crore and above. In an office memorandum issued on June 17 this year, the finance department’s budget division had directed that all the administrative secretaries and heads of departments to obtain relaxation from the finance department for incurring expenditure of Rs 1 crore or more. In a recent office memorandum, however, the finance department has allowed seeking relaxation through letters instead of files. In the memorandum, the finance department has stated that it was observed that several proposals were being sent to the department for relaxation, which was required only in cases where the expenditure was of Rs 1 crore and above. “These proposals are in turn examined in the finance department, which takes time and delays the process,” it stated. In a partial modification of the instructions issued on June 17, the office memorandum issued on August 10 stated that it has now been decided that the administrative departments were not required to send files to the finance department for relaxation. Instead, they would approve the proposals at their level and “send a letter on a weekly basis” to the finance department in a tabulated format. The orders on expenditure management, however, exclude certain expenditures from the necessary approvals, such as expenditure related to salaries and allowances, medical reimbursement, pension of senior citizens and widows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/finance-dept-relaxes-norms-for-depts-on-expenses-above-rs-1cr/articleshow/85384557.cms||---

The officials stated that the results of the initial phase in Jaipur during the two weeks of the campaign were not fruitful. Due to this, the panel has now drafted and issued Special Operating Procedure (SOP) according to which roles of all the departments concerned have been outlined. “The first phase of the campaign was to speak to the children’s parents and convince them not to force the minors to beg. Talking to them did not produce the desired results. Hence, we have now issued SOP so that all departments including police and labour are aware of their respective roles and there is no lack of coordination,” said a child panel official. Besides this, to make the cities beggar-free, employment would be provided by surveying the beggars and linking them with skill training programmes to solve their economic woes. The work of identification and survey of beggars is being done jointly by the police and administration. According to a national NGO, over 1,500 children were reported missing in Rajasthan between January-July 2020. In 85% cases missing children were girls. In absolute numbers 1,323 girls went missing in Rajasthan in first 6 months of 2020. Experts lamented that a lot of these children at times end up either begging on the streets or are forced into other forms of labour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-drafts-sop-to-make-raj-cities-free-from-child-begging/articleshow/85384539.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Hundreds of students gathered in front of the office to protest during which they clashed with the police. Students complained that they had to foot hostel fee despite not staying since 2020. They even demanded fee waiver for students of BPL category. NSUI spokesperson Ramesh Bhati said, “Last year students paid Rs 10,000 yearly fees for hostels although nobody stayed for more than a month. Some students couldn’t shift to hostels despite paying the fees because of lockdown. Hence, students have been demanding to reduce hostel fee or adjust it with something else. And if that was not possible, return it to students.” Students also demanded free admissions for those belonging to BPL categories and not to increase fees for any subject in the near future no physical classes were going on. Chief proctor HS Palsaniya said, “Last year, a committee was set up which decided to adjust the hostel fee next year. Now, for the current year we will again put it in front of our administration and take necessary decision. VC had a chat with students and assured to look into the demands. The university administration hadn’t increased fees in the last two years and it was unlikely this year too.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-students-protest-want-hostel-fees-to-be-refunded/articleshow/85384571.cms||---

The news of his resignation caught lawyers by surprise. Once an HC judge puts in his papers to the President, no acceptance is required. Justice Naidu’s is the third resignation of an HC judge in three years. Last year, the senior-most judge of Bombay HC, Justice S C Dharmadhikari, resigned with effect from February 15, citing “purely personal’’ reasons. He said he wanted to be in Maharashtra for his family. Prior to him, Chief Justice V K Tahilramani of the Madras high court, earlier the acting Chief Justice of Bombay HC, resigned on September 6, 2019. She quit after the Supreme Court collegium declined her request for reconsideration of her transfer to Meghalaya as CJ. Justice Naidu was first appointed judge of the Andhra Pradesh HC in 2013 before being moved to the Kerala HC in 2014. He came to Bombay HC five years later. Authoring a judgment for a full bench of three judges last May, he had directed the state govt to refund education and examination fees to “few downtrodden students’’ saying, “We have travelled far, but not far enough. Still access to education depends, among other things, on the student’s economic strength.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-naidu-third-high-court-judge-to-quit-in-3-years/articleshow/85386292.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Scientists confirm India’s first case of pufferfish poisoning||RAJKOT: Scientists have confirmed the first case of poisoning in humans due to pufferfish consumption in India, the victim being a 23-year-old man from Veraval who had unknowingly eaten this poisonous species last year. A recently published paper by scientists of Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), Cochin, the man developed symptoms 15 minutes of eating pufferfish in May 2020. He was rushed to an ICU of a private hospital after he complained of giddiness, vertigo, aphasia and others. He was fortunate to be saved.  The paper published in an international journal states: “This is the first confirmed case of pufferfish poisoning in India with the exact species identified.” The man had consumed Stellate Puffer, also known as Arothron stellatus, which contains tetrodotoxin (TTX), which is said to be about 1,500 times more lethal than cyanide. CIFT scientists Toms C Joseph, MA Pradeep, TK Anupama, Ejaz Parmar, V Renuka, S Remya and C N Ravishankar, DB Goswami of the Veraval hospital studied all clinical reports of the man. The DNA of cooked fish was also taken in order to prove how it poisoned his body. Scientists say there are several suspicious cases of hospitalization and deaths due to consumption of this fish, but there was no scientific study to prove this. As a result, there is no data of death by consumption of this fish unlike many foreign countries like Japan (1980), Australia (2002), Singapore (2004) and the US (2019). According to the study, fishermen, fish vendors and fish eaters in India don’t recognize the toxic potential of pufferfish which is available very cheap in the market. As many as 11 species of pufferfish are found along India’s vast coastline, but their toxigenic potential is still unknown to a large population. Their consumption can cause death within minutes.  TTX is mostly concentrated in the liver and ovaries of the pufferfish. A mouse bioassay study proved that these organs of four species of pufferfish found during monsoon and post-monsoon season from India were lethal. Milk-spotted puffer and chelenodon patoca were identified as the most toxic of the 11 species. Due to its heat stability, this toxin is not destroyed by cooking processes. “The lack of knowledge along with under-reporting may be the reason for the dearth of official data on pufferfish poisoning in India. Milder cases go undiagnosed or unreported because of under-recognition. Educating the fisherfolk across the coasts in India is a must to avoid occurrence of puffer fish poisoning in the future,” the paper suggests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/scientists-confirm-indias-1st-case-of-pufferfish-poisoning/articleshow/85379967.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Goa||Goa: ‘Highly unusual to see a body washed up ashore at Calangute’||CALANGUTE: For the first time since the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Calangute beach is flush with tourists. On the surface, it may seem like business as usual. It appears that the body of the 19-year-old that washed ashore on the beach last week is on nobody’s mind. Any mention of it is treated almost as a taboo. But, in hushed voices, no one can resist speculating. Deep down, those operating in and around the belt are shaken by the incident of the semi-nude body washing ashore their beach. After all, none of the locals recollect such an incident on the stretch in living memory. “We have heard of bodies washing up on Arambol or Vagator beach. In Calangute, we see a lot of drownings of those attempting to swim being pulled in by the currents. But having a dead body wash ashore here is quite unusual,” said a local store owner. Boys employed in the private shacks on the beach recollect the night before the August 12 incident being a very busy one. “There were lot of tourists that night on the beach, and we wound up operations later than usual. It must have been 3am by the time we went to sleep inside the shacks. The girl’s body was discovered at 5.30am. So it must have washed up during this small window of time,” said a shack worker. They find it surprising that the body turned up in inexplicable conditions in a prime spot, not even 400-500m from the lifeguard towers and shacks, on a busy beach stretch like Calangute. The condition in which it was found is the biggest subject of speculation. “The girl’s body was intact, like the death occurred only a few hours ago. It wasn’t bloated, or the soles of the feet had not turned white, or the body was not nibbled on by crabs or fish, which is what happens when a body has been churning around in the sea for a few days,” said a local who had seen the body. As drowning deaths and circumstances in which such bodies are found are not new to those along the stretch, they state with confidence that finding one without clothing is also rare in the case of drowning deaths. “Only if someone is wearing a button-down shirt or a flowy dress is a body found without clothes. But a pair of jeans coming off is not heard of from all the drownings we have seen,” said the owner of a clothing stall near the beach. The common belief is that the incident could have taken place at the Baga creek, leading to the body only washing up at Calangute. “The Calangute beach is patrolled by police nearly round-the-clock. Any signs of unusual activity or struggle would have been visible. Stretches of the Baga creek are unlit and lonely at night, and it is the only place from where a body could wash ashore here looking intact, as it would be transported here in no time,” said a local woman. To make matters more difficult to investigate, some of the CCTV systems on the stretch went out of order due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae in May, and are yet to be repaired. “Too many such incidents are being reported along Goa’s beaches. Life goes on as usual for the tourists and outsiders running stores here. But as locals, we care that the life of a young Goan girl was lost. The government must see that they get to the root of it,” said a woman running an eating joint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/highly-unusual-to-see-a-body-washed-up-ashore-at-calangute/articleshow/85384707.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Delhi||Bail to teen as ‘state could not ensure enabling environment’||NEW DELHI: A welfare state can’t withdraw its maternal embrace because a child, having just crossed to the wrong side of 18, has become definitionally non-suited to be treated as a child, a court said while granting bail in an attempted theft case. Additional sessions judge Vishal Gogne said it would not be a case of conjecture and surmises for the court to prima facie express that the want of one parent, a low family income, early dropout from school, drug use among peer group and the possible drug use by the accused himself might have together propelled him to allegedly have committed the house break and attempted theft. “Having noted earlier that the court is inclined to release the applicant on bail, it may now also be appended to this order that his liberty was lost in the first place due to societal and economic factors,” the court said. “To that extent, it is also reflective of a failure of the state to provide the enabling environment for his lawful conduct as a young citizen who has just turned 19. The remedy to some degree must, therefore, also come from the state,” it pointed out. This court, being a vital part of the state, thus intends to advance the accused towards drug de-addiction and meaningful counselling, training and employment, the judge said, adding that such an opportunity should be afforded to any willing accused, “especially a young offender/neo-adult”. He pointed out, “Since de-addiction itself follows the approach of peer-to-peer influence, such reformed drug users do also become new foot soldiers in the fight against drugs and drug-driven crime.” The court said, “His reasons for allegedly being involved in an offence... may not really be dissimilar to a child in conflict with law who may be just a touch under 18 years of age.” The accused was granted bail on furnishing a bond of Rs 5,000 with one surety of like amount. He will also enrol himself into Project Avsar, a programme launched by Central District Legal Services Authority of Tis Hazari Court to offer counselling, training and employment opportunities to undertrial prisoners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-to-teen-as-state-could-not-ensure-enabling-environment/articleshow/85384666.cms||Usha Das

Residents have demanded that another hearing be scheduled in Mussoorie. "The ropeway is for Mussoorie and the public hearing should have been kept here. This seems a deliberate attempt by the administration to keep the Mussoorie stakeholders out of the hearing," said Hugh Gantzer, member of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee constituted by the SC for monitoring the environment issues of Doon Valley and Mussoorie. Gantzer alleged that Purkul residents who attended this meeting in large numbers had everything to gain from this ropeway while he said that a large section of the citizenry of Mussoorie was opposed to this ropeway for various reasons and it would seem that they were kept out. In fact, sources said only four stakeholders from Mussoorie could participate in the hearing on Monday while the rest of the attendees were all landowners and villagers from Purkul. Residents also alleged that they were not even informed. “There were no newspaper advertisements, no public announcement or no other method employed by the administration for timely informing the residents of Mussoorie,” alleged a resident. The administrative officials who conducted the meeting were unavailable for any comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoorie-residents-unhappy-after-ropeway-hearing-held-only-in-doon/articleshow/85379999.cms||Anmol Jain

---||Goa||Goa: As Covid cases drop, tourism ind sees green shoots ahead||PANAJI: After long the state has begun witnessing an increased momentum in tourist footfalls despite a curfew continuing to be in place. However, not all hotels have opened for business and the 1,200 to 1,300 that have commenced operations have so far seen an occupancy of 50% to 70%. Bars and clubs see crowds over the weekend with a mix of locals and tourists. With curfew norms yet to be relaxed for tourist-related entertainment activities, the increased inflow of tourists has been surprising. A hotelier in North Goa, who did not wish to be named, said that pubs and restaurants operate till late into the night with tacit understanding with the authorities. “You can’t help it. We need to survive while tourists want a place to unwind. Besides visiting beaches, there is nothing much for them to do,” the hotelier said. President of the trade body, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), Nilesh Shah said that hotels are witnessing a healthy occupancy now as compared to the below 10% seen in the previous two months. “We will see a further rise in footfalls this month as there are several holidays. Most starred hotels have begun their operations, but there is no chance that small and medium scale hotels will open until charters start,” Shah told TOI. He said that with the pace of vaccination expanding, not just in Goa, but in other states as well, more people will now feel confident to travel. Vincent Ramos, area director for the Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), Goa, and general manager at the Taj Resort and Convention Centre, Goa, said their hotels have been performing phenomenally well. “The overwhelming response in bookings received from our patrons has been very encouraging with the highest inventory of over 1,500 rooms in the state offered across a spectrum of brands. This has helped us to stay ahead of the race,” Ramos told TOI. Their recently launched ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ campaign on India’s 75th Independence Day, he said, is aimed at further boosting business across their hotels. Shah said that though currently all activities are closed in Goa, tourists are still coming as everybody wants a break from staying at home and working from home. “People want a change of environment and scenery. They are also visiting Goa because it offers a better safety net than other states. They are coming here to just relax and chill. Our cases are dropping.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Fake Covid-19 vaccine certificates scam busted||RAJKOT: Acting on a tip-off, the Special Operations Group (SOG) of Devbhoomi Dwarka district busted a fake Covid-19 vaccination certificate scam and arrested three persons, including a data operator at the government health centre in Khambhalia town. Police officials said that they have arrested Alataf Jusab Leru (26), a resident of Salaya town of Devbhoomi Dwarka district, Akram Bloch (22) and Vipul Chauhan (24). Bloch used to work as a broker and contact those who needed Covid-19 vaccination certificates without getting a jab. Chauhan worked as a data entry operator at the government health centre at Khambhalia town. “We received specific information that these three persons were involved in issuing fake Covid-19 vaccination certificates. We carried out a raid at Leru’s office in Salaya town on August 10 and seized seven fake Covid-19 certificates. Further investigations revealed that Bloch used to search for customers and later approached Leru for fake vaccine certificates. Chauhan used to supply the fake certificates to Leru,” a police official said. “Chauhan used to enter health workers’ ID and password to generate fake vaccination certificates. Primary probe suggests that the trio might have generated around 150 fake certificates,” he added. The accused used to charge between Rs 1000-Rs 2500 for the fake certificates. Taluka health officer Mehul Jethwa lodged a complaint against three at Salaya police station on Saturday night. Police arrested three accused on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fake-covid-19-vaccine-certificates-scam-busted/articleshow/85380058.cms||---

Besides, those below 18 years of age can now enter malls by showing proof of their age as vaccination for this group has not started yet. However, there is no relief for 18-plus visitors and staff at malls—they should complete 14 days after their second dose to gain entry. Students in classes V-VII in rural areas free of Covid for a month will get back to schools on Tuesday. About 12,725 schools in rural areas were opened for classes VIII-XII from July 15, and these institutions will now open their gates to classes V-VII. In urban areas, including Mumbai, schools will open for classes IX-XII only after clearances from the respective civic chiefs. City principals said they had not received any order on resuming studies offline. Mumbaikars hail garden timing change, but say caution a mustA new BMC order on gardens, grounds and beaches opening all day long was welcomed by residents and activists. However, they called for steep penalties for those not following Covid norms. Mumbai has 860 gardens, 318 grounds and beach fronts at Girgaum, Dadar, Versova, Juhu, Aksa and Gorai. Zahida Banatwala from the Juhu Citizens’ Welfare Group, which manages the 65,000 sq ft Gandhigram garden, said many senior citizens had wanted the garden to be open for longer hours. “Our hands were tied as civic rules did not permit it. We are happy with the new order,” she said. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria called it a catch-22 situation, saying while there were requests for such spaces to be kept open for longer hours, bigger crowds would be difficult to control. “Citizens must be cautious as no one wants another lockdown. It’s of utmost importance that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed by visitors to these open spaces,” he said. Juhu corporator Renu Hansraj said such places were open to people from all strata of society. “These being free, no one hesitates to visit them for walks or recreation, so people wanted them to be opened,” she said. The state government, which is still to decide on Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan and Zoo (Byculla zoo), has cleared the reopening of most sectors from Sunday, but only with fully vaccinated workforce. Business owners have appealed to the government to reverse this rule. As for the zoo, which was shut a second time on April 4, officials said crowd control would be difficult with over 10,000 visitors during weekends. City principals said at their meetings with education officials, it was indicated that reopening schools may not be possible before November. Principals, teachers and academicians say schools should reopen at least for Stds X and XII. “Students taking boards should be allowed to come to schools for practicals. A beginning has to be made,” educationist Francis Joseph said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/citys-gardens-beaches-to-stay-open-6am-10pm/articleshow/85386306.cms||Richa Pinto

The victim Narendra Rawat, a resident of Nehru Gram, told cops at Raipur police station that he was trying to order a T-shirt through an online shopping website. While making the payment, he faced some trouble and decided to contact the customer care service. In his search for finding the number online, he ended up calling a fake customer care agent who took the credentials from the victim and siphoned off Rs 90,000 from his account. Upon receiving a message from the bank, the victim realized that he had contacted a fake customer care. The number on which he had contacted, too, went unreachable after the amount was deducted. Meanwhile, the cops have lodged a case under 420 (fraud) of IPC and also under sections of IT Act.

According to the FIR filed with Sabarmati riverfront (west) police, the woman, a final-semester BA student of a college on Ashram Road, was riding home on Saturday evening when the accused, Sahil Vaghela, the complainant’s ex-boyfriend, chased her on a scooter . “Vaghela, with his friend Aniket Jaiswal riding pillion, spotted us near Udaseen Ashram on the riverfront. He was yelling at me to stop my vehicle,” she said in the FIR. She said that as she was scared, she continued to ride on, but he pulled out the key while her vehicle was moving. “Due to the jolt, I lost control of my scooter and fell on road due to which I suffered injuries.

---||Goa||Goa: College heads asked to plan return of students||PANAJI: A day after the state lifted restrictions on colleges and allowed them to have classes on campus, the directorate of higher education (DHE) has asked principals to devise methods to begin classes in the physical mode. The new academic year 2021-22 begins on September 1 for the general streams. “The heads of educational institutions under the purview of the DHE may take appropriate decision(s) to conduct classes in physical mode for the new academic year 2021-22 based on the ground realities and the infrastructure availability, after following proper SOPs pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic,” director of higher education Prasad Lolayekar said in the circular. All non-vaccinated college staffers, will have to produce RT-PCR test reports every week, Lolayekar said. This will not apply to those who cannot be vaccinated because they were or are Covid positive. “The ground situation varies from college to college, and therefore, it is not feasible to issue a common SOP or plan to conduct physical classes across colleges. Some have upto 3,000 undergraduate students, while others have only a couple of hundred students. Each college principal will have to take a call accordingly,” said an official. While the instructions apply to general stream colleges offering BA, BSc, BCom, BBA, BCA and other such programmes, plans are also afoot to similarly hold offline classes for students of professional programmes like engineering. “Colleges with smaller enrolment will find it easier to hold physical classes sooner. The directives related to offline classes are applicable to final year students as well as first and second year students,” said the official. Meanwhile, the academic year 2021-22 began on Monday for postgraduate students at Goa University, and classes in the physical mode are expected to begin for these students even earlier than for their undergraduate counterparts. A meeting of all heads of departments was held recently to discuss the prospect of students returning to campus. “There was a consensus that emphasis should be on conducting practicals in the physical mode. With regards to classroom teaching, one plan is to call students in batches of one-third of the strength at a time. But the modalities are yet to be finalised. Classes for masters programme students will begin in physical mode before the undergraduate level students,” said a university official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/college-heads-asked-to-plan-return-of-students/articleshow/85384741.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat gets notice over cop brutality||AHMEDABAD: The National Human Rights Commission, in an order issued on Monday, asked the state government why it should not recommend a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to eight dalits who were subjected to police brutality in a case of lockdown violation in March 2020. The NHRC has also asked the Director General of Police to send a compliance report of departmental action against four policemen who have been charged in the case. Both the state government and the DGP have been given six weeks to comply with NHRC directions. The Botad district magistrate has been asked to submit a compliance report with respect to the payment to the victims within four weeks. The case dates back to March 2020 when the police is said to have assaulted eight dalit youths in police custody for lockdown violation. The eight were identified as Ankit Vaniya, Bhavesh Vaniya, Sanjay Vaniya, Himmat Vaniya, Jitu Vaniya, Suraj Vaniya, Dhaji Vaniya and Vijay Vaniya. “During investigation, the allegations of assault were found to be true based on CCTV footage of Dhasa police station, statements of witnesses and medical treatment record. This is a case of gross violation of human rights of all eight victims and the state is, therefore, liable to compensate victims for the damages suffered by them,” the NHRC notice said. Dalit rights activist Kantilal Parmar filed a complaint with NHRC regarding the police brutality, which issued a summons to Botad SP this March. The police, in its report before the NHRC, said that a complaint has been filed against erring cops and a chargesheet has been filed against four policemen in the case. “It is the duty of the government to protect the rights of citizens. Why should a private citizen be forced to lodge complaints of state government inaction? I have so far filed over 3,500 complaints of atrocities and have secured compensation orders for about 400 victims,” Parmar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-gets-notice-over-cop-brutality/articleshow/85382559.cms||---

Air India will operate a flight on the London (Heathrow)-Goa sector as part of the air bubble arrangement with the UK. According to Air India, the flight schedule till August 31 has been released, but further flights could be scheduled in the months to come. At present, passengers have to fly to Mumbai or Delhi to catch an international flight to London. “The flights can be booked through the Air India website, offices and travel agents,” Air India said. Given the extraordinary situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schedules are subject to change,” Air India said. Air India will also commence direct flights to London from Kolkata and Chennai. Last December, India enforced a ban on flights from the UK. According to officials at Goa International Airport, Air India used to operate one UK-bound flight every week, which was cancelled when the Union ministry of civil aviation and the Union home ministry decided to restrict UK flights after a steep rise in Covid-19 cases. Officials said that with cases declining in India as well as in Goa, a calibrated resumption of international flights is being tested out. In mid-January, the Centre permitted a one-off Air India flight from Goa to Heathrow, with 217 passengers on board. Since then, fliers have had to take international flights from either Mumbai or Delhi. Repatriation flights continue to operate from Goa International Airport, largely to the middle-east region while domestic flight operations have seen a rise. Daily passenger footfalls have crossed 11,000 with close to 100 flights operating on a daily basis from the terminal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/air-india-to-fly-goa-london-from-aug-26/articleshow/85384758.cms||---

Once ready, the flyover will bring down travel time between VIP Road and Howrah from almost an hour now to barely 15 minutes. The state government is reviving several other flyover proposals, including one on Syed Amir Ali Avenue and another on Prince Anwar Shah Road, which had been put on the back burner. The proposed Posta flyover, the cost of which has been estimated at Rs 1,000 crore, will start at Ultadanga on one end, and will run over CIT Road, Kankurgachi, Maniktala and Vivekananda Road before terminating at Posta market on Strand Road. An arm is also being planned that will branch off at Kankurgachi and head towards Bengal Chemicals off EM Bypass. “There are many challenges in implementing the project but if they are addressed through proper planning, this structure will ease traffic flow in north Kolkata the same way the Maa and AJC Bose Road flyovers have done in south and central Kolkata,” an official said. KMDA has engaged RITES to prepare a detailed project report. The state’s decision to revive the flyover proposals was taken after a meeting between chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari last month, when issues related to road and infrastructure projects were discussed. The state had last year announced a budgetary allocation of about Rs 2,475 crore for flyovers for the next financial year. Among the revived projects are flyovers from Park Circus to Gurusaday Datta Road in Ballygunge, Jadavpur police station to Lords Bakery; EM Bypass to New Town, Garia to Jadavpur and Jadavpur to Majerhat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-plans-6km-flyover-from-posta-to-ultadanga/articleshow/85382597.cms||Suman Chakraborti

This has paved the way for the first US bank to set up a branch at the Gujarat Finance Tec-City (GIFT City). “We issued a licence to Citibank on Monday to set up its IFSC banking unit at GIFT,” confirmed Dipesh Shah, development head, International Financial Services Centres Authority, the unified regulator for development and regulation of financial products, financial services and financial institutions at IFSCs. Citibank will service both Indian and global customers from its IFSC branch. The new IFSC unit aims to undertake credit business such as execution of foreign currency loans and external commercial borrowings, working capital loans including trade finance facilities, payment/remittance as well as treasury business including borrowing and deposits, said sources. Last year, Citibank received in-principle nod from the Reserve Bank of India for the banking unit after which it was awaiting the final nod from IFSCA to start operations. Recently, Deutsche Bank, a global bank with presence in over 70 countries, became the first German bank to set up its IFSC banking unit at GIFT IFSC. “Global banks are finding the IFSC a great strategic opportunity to serve international clients at a very competitive cost. The IFSC is fast emerging as the preferred gateway for international financial services and is enabling many new business opportunities for global investors,” said Shah. Leading Indian and foreign banks such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, Barclays, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC, among others are already operating from GIFT IFSC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citibank-granted-ifsca-licence-to-set-up-banking-unit-at-gift-city/articleshow/85382615.cms||---

Sources said these allotments were made last week. The bungalow at 12, Janpath was the address of late Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan for nearly three decades and this was also the office address of LJP in the national capital, which he had founded. Last month, the Directorate of Estate under the housing and urban affairs ministry had issued an eviction order for 12, Janpath. Though the government had earlier offered this bungalow to Paras, Paswan’s younger brother, he had declined to take it citing this would send a wrong political message. Currently, Paswan’s wife and his son Chirag are occupying the bungalow. Officials said while many allotments of bungalows have been lined up since the last expansion of the council of ministers, these are subject to vacation by the current occupants. The government is avoiding slapping eviction notices on those who have been dropped from the council of ministers considering that they are from the treasury bench. Meanwhile, some of the junior ministers are still waiting to get their offices in different bhawans even more than a month after they were inducted. The Central Public Works Department is carrying out construction of offices and toilets for accommodating them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/railway-minister-vaishnaw-gets-janpath-bungalow-which-housed-late-ram-vilas-paswan/articleshow/85387740.cms||Dipak K Dash

He had recorded the video of an earlier sexual attack and had threatened to make it viral if she complained against him. The girl’s torment came to light when the youth abused the girl’s uncle. The uncle lodged a complaint against the youth for abusing him and when the mobile phone of the accused was checked, cops found incriminating clips. Eventually, the girl related her ordeal to the investigators. A complaint of rape was registered by police on Sunday. The Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act has also been invoked. In his complaint, the girl’s uncle said that his brother informed him of abusive messages from an unidentified number. Soon thereafter, the youth called and let loose a torrent of abuse. The youth also sent to the girl’s father the videos of the girl talking to him. The family informed the police control room and a complaint was registered. The complainant said the girl told the family that she had met the youth on a social media platform and they had exchanged phone numbers. Later, she received a video recording of their call, which the youth threatened to make viral unless she agreed to his demands. Then in November, the youth took the girl to a hotel in Narol and raped her. The girl said that when she had resisted, the youth had threatened to kill her parents. She said that in February and March, she was taken to a guest house where she was raped again. The youth threatened to make her intimate videos viral if she ever complained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/call-clips-used-to-blackmail-rape-minor-girl/articleshow/85382608.cms||---

From last week, the district administration declared a street as a containment zone even when a Covid-19 case is reported from there. The containment zones have increased in Madukkarai, Karamadai and Thudiyalur areas. Of the 85 containment zones, 34 are in Coimbatore city. While Thudiyalur, Karamadai and Madukkarai blocks have 7 containment zones each, Anamalai, Pollachi and Sulur blocks have six containment zones each. In June, there were 288 containment zones in the district, of which 162 were in the city. However, the number came down below 100 by mid-July and it fell further to 45 in the last week of July. It increased to 77 in the first week of August and jumped to 85 as on Sunday. A senior health official from Thudiyalur said only three cases were reported in the block on Sunday. But those three areas were declared as containment zones as per the district administration’s instruction. “The district collector has instructed to declare an area even with one Covid case as containment area to curb further spread of infection. This has resulted in the increase in containment areas in the district,” the official said. Meanwhile, 217 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported on Monday, a slight decline from 225 on Sunday. The district reported one death due to Covid, taking the toll to 2,219 deaths. As many as 215 patients were discharged on the day.

Nath climbed the Elbrus peak (5,642 metres), situated in the western part of the Caucasus mountains in Russia, amidst adverse weather conditions, Lalita Negi, spokesperson SDRF, said. The SDRF constable was part of the expedition conducted by 360 Explorer Maharashtra between August 9 and 17 on Mountain Elbrus. “The purpose of the expedition was to hoist the national flag atop the peak on the country’s 75th Independence Day,” said Rajendra Nath.

After managing to get the flight tickets booked, Rasooli was sure about getting his family out of Afghanistan. But his hopes of uniting with his family were shattered as flight operations were discontinued in Kabul after Taliban took over the Afghan capital. “I should have brought them here a little early. But things happened so fast that I got no time to bring them back early. I don’t know when I will see my family again,” a distraught Rasooli told TOI.After doing MBA from Bangalore University, Rasooli is now pursuing doctorate in economics. His wife and two daughters were living with him here in the city. “In May, along with my family I went to Afghanistan for some important work and I returned early. I did not bring them with me hoping that the situation will remain normal,” Rasooli sighed. Unlike Rasooli, another Afghan student, Ostad Andish was lucky. He brought his family to the city just 10 days back. “I am fortunate to be with my wife and children. But I’m worried about my relatives and friends who are stuck in Afghanistan,” said Andish, a PhD student, who has five children. Total seven students — four women and three men — from Afghanistan are studying in the Diamond City. They are having sleepless nights ever since the Taliban forces started capturing important cities across Afghanistan. “I worry not only for my family but for young girls and jobless people. Taliban had warned that they will get all the young girls married, even against their wishes. A girl should have the freedom to decide if she wants to marry or not,” said Fatma Karim, a student of Master of Public Administration in VNSGU. Karim’s thoughts are echoed by Hameeda Nasir, who is pursuing her MSc in mathematics. “I talked with my sister last night and they were scared. Taliban forces have been marrying young unmarried girls in other parts of the country and now they will do it in the newly captured regions as well,” Nasir said. “I don’t know what to do to help my family. I can’t do anything, we are helpless,” added Nasir resigning to her fate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/afghan-students-in-surat-worried-for-their-families-back-home/articleshow/85380262.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Battle of backward classes likely in the Huzurabad by-election||HYDERABAD: The by-election to Huzurabad Assembly constituency may witness a contest between candidates of backward classes community from the three main parties—TRS, BJP and Congress. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has already announced Gellu Srinivas Yadav, a BC youth leader, as its candidate for the by-poll. Though the BJP has not announced its candidate, Eatala Rajender—a BC from Mudiraj community—is most likely to enter the by-poll fray. With over 1.20 lakh voters from the BC community in the constituency, the Congress too is scouting for a strong BC candidate for Huzurabad by-poll. The party’s election strategy committee chairman Damodar Rajanarasimha is in touch with former minister Konda Surekha—a Padmashali from the BC community. The Congress is keen on fielding her from Huzurabad as her husband Konda Murali is a Munnuru Kapu, also from BC community. The party is hoping that a large chunk of both Padmashali and Munnuru Kapu community votes would be polled to the Congress, if she contested the bypoll. Also, being a woman candidate, she will have an advantage as there are over one lakh women voters in Huzurabad constituency. After the ruling TRS snatched away P Kaushik Reddy who had polled over 61,000 votes on Congress ticket in 2018-polls, the party is looking at Surekha as a formidable candidate. Senior leaders from the party are trying to persuade her to contest from Huzurabad. She had contested the bypoll to Hanamkonda Lok Sabha seat in 2008 when Kamalapur Assembly constituency was part of this parliamentary constituency. The Congress is likely to announce its candidate soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/battle-of-bcs-likely-in-the-huzurabad-by-election/articleshow/85384838.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Agra||Agra University: Teacher caught on camera dictating answers to students during exam||AGRA: A video, shot in a college affiliated to Agra’s Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar university, purportedly showing a teacher dictating answers to the students during an exam has prompted the varsity to launch a probe. The video is said to have been shot on Saturday during BSc second year Zoology exam at the Agra university-affiliated self-financed college in Mathura. In the video, the teacher can be heard telling students correct answers to the multiple-choice questions according to the serial number. Meanwhile, the university administration has ordered a probe into the entire matter. Public relations officer of Agra University, Pradeep Shridhar, said, “We have taken cognizance of the video. The examination controller has ordered a probe in the entire matter. A response has been sought from the college management. Suitable action will be taken.” To ensure cheating free exams, the state government had made it mandatory for all the exam centres to install CCTV cameras. However, several colleges allegedly switch off the cameras or change their settings to prevent live telecast. University officials are not able to see footage of exam centers from the control room. On August 3, students appearing for an exam at a private college affiliated to Agra university in Kasganj district were beaten up and their answer sheets were snatched by the exam centre staff for “not paying Rs 5,000 for cheating”. A video of the purported attack had also gone viral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-university-teacher-caught-on-camera-dictating-answers-to-students-during-exam/articleshow/85380190.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Rains stutter, 50% crop loss feared||AHMEDABAD: Erratic rains have saddled the farmers in the state with the prospect of 50% crop loss. Farmers in northern and central parts of Gujarat and in swathes of Saurashtra have suffered the hardest hit. The ground water level has gone down drastically in many parts of the state, causing further hardships to farmers. Hirjibhai Rathod, a farmer with substantial land in Jethakuba in Lodhika taluka of Rajkot, said: “We depend on rains. The water level has gone down now.” He added: “Farmers grew crops where water was available. Now with the rains being delayed, crops such as groundnut are likely to fail.” According to agriculture department officials, the sowing of groundnut in the last week of June was done across 9.99 lakh hectares. They said that cotton was sown over 11.46 lakh hectares. Farmers who had opted to sow early are those who are anticipating crop failure. The groundnut crops that have started growing will be too small to fetch good value. K L Dobariya, a former researcher with Junagadh Agriculture University, said: “Looking at the early trend of sowing, it was expected that groundnut sowing will be at a record high, crossing 21 lakh hectares.” Dobariya added: “But as of now it appears that the quality will definitely take a beating.” Bharat Chaudhary of Chappia village in Banaskantha said that he has sown cotton and groundnut but fears crop loss because only one spell of rain has been received. “We need rain desperately, otherwise the crops will get affected,” he said. “With not much water in the local wells, the crops have started dying. Even Narmada water is not available.” The officials said that usually the overall sowing takes places across 85.54 lakh hectares in the state, but this year the figure is only 75.73 lakh hectares. So far, castor sowing has covered only 2.3 lakh hectares but the number could touch 8 lakh hectares in the coming days as farmers who have recorded crop loss turn to castor to offset losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rains-stutter-50-crop-loss-feared/articleshow/85382733.cms||---

However, as per the status of the project presented in the Lok Sabha, the work has been completed. As per the reply given by Union minister of state for housing and urban affairs Kaushal Kishore in response to a question by Janardan Mishra MP on August 5 on ‘Kerala slum redevelopment in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram’, the status of Kochi is stated as detailed project report under preparation and of Thiruvananthapuram as work completed. TOI has recently reported on how around 128 dengue deaths and nearly 2,000 cases recorded in 2017 were missing from the list of Kerala presented in the ongoing Lok Sabha session. Officials with the city corporation said that they were unaware about how such an error happened in the document presented in Parliament. The work commencement at Rajaji Nagar was inaugurated in October 2020 by former LSG minister A C Moideen. The project was awarded to a firm in September 2020 and the work was expected to be completed in 24 months. As per the latest status, the site could not be handed over to the firm due to a slew of issues. The beneficiaries had reportedly asked for enhanced monthly remuneration during the transit period. Besides, they have demanded dwelling units for every single family who presently reside together in a house. There have been demands about transit accommodation like the beneficiaries have asked for a location of their choice. All these factors have presently stalled the project. Recently, the opposition had slammed the ruling council over inaccuracies in vehicle data shown in the annual administration report. The ruling council had to admit that they would look into the circumstances which led to staff furnishing contradictory data in administration report and in the reply to the Right to Information application. Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd (SCML) has prepared a master plan considering the entire 12.6acres at Rajaji Nagar settlement addressing all the prevailing issues. The greenfield development is intended to be implemented in three phases. Phase-one of this project is development of 2.81 acres of land accommodating 248 dwelling units in eight number of G+3 buildings, eight livelihood centres, one community hall and green open spaces for recreation. All these eight blocks shall be connected to the main road by access roads with proper street lighting and stormwater drainage facilities. Each dwelling unit will have a hall (living-cum dining area), two bedrooms (one bedroom with attached toilet), kitchen, two toilets and a balcony area. The area of each dwelling unit will be 586 sq ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/slum-project-over-as-per-ls-records/articleshow/85380268.cms||Aswin J Kumar

They even presented the budget. But there was no announcement about the promise. Similarly, they said education loans would be waived,” the BJP leader said. “It means that they gave false promises, which are not feasible to implement, for votes. After getting the votes, they are duping the people.”Murugan, who was flanked by state BJP chief K Annamalai at the press conference, said that on the other hand, BJP is implementing several welfare projects.Continuing his tirade against DMK and opposition parties, Murugan said that opposition parties could not digest the fact that BJP has made a member of arunthathiyar community a Union minister. “This is perhaps the first time that a person from scheduled caste, who is not member of any house, has been made a Union minister. This was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Also, for the for the first time, 12 people from SC, eight from tribal community and 28 OBCs have been made Union ministers,” he said.Makkal Aasi Yatra would pass through Coimbatore, Tirupur, Nilgiris and culminate in Namakkal August 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-failed-to-keep-poll-promises-bjp/articleshow/85382699.cms||---

The ‘assault’ came to light after the child’s mother taught her about “good and bad touch” after watching a crime show on TV. The court said, “Prosecution failed to prove circumstantial evidence by proving the situation of the spot of incident. Prosecution evidence on the point of incident as to day, date and time of incident is vague. Prosecution evidence... falls short to prove offences with which accused has been charged.” The accused was out on bail. The son of the accused said he had operated the victim’s DJ set for 11 days during Navratri and was promised payment but as he was not paid, for New Year he refused to play it again. He said when he asked for his money, there was a quarrel and the child’s father beat the accused. He claimed his father was falsely implicated. The child’s mother told court on January 9, 2016, she watched an episode of the crime show, where a man had sexually abused his grandchild. She said at the end of the show, the host advised viewers to educate their children about four body parts that nobody should be allowed to touch. The mother said she explained that to her child. The child then told her about the accused. The child told court the accused took her to the terrace and sexually abused her. She said he did these acts “long time ago”. She said when she told her mother about it, she filed a police complaint. The court said the child did not give details about the place, time and date. The court said there was an unexplained delay in lodging an FIR too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-55-yr-old-acquitted-5-yrs-after-arrest-for-sexual-assault/articleshow/85386376.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kochi||English Indian Clays Ltd warns of closure of its unit||Thiruvananthapuram: The management of the English Indian Clays Ltd (EICL) has signalled about the possible closure of its operations in the district. An official statement from the company has stated that “the company fears that the operations at its Thonnakkal factory might also go down along the lines of what was witnessed at its unit at Veli.” “The future of the company here has become bleak due to lack of permission to mine needed raw materials. This has led to a loss both in terms of financial and market share and substantially drained its confidence in committing further investments,” said the statement. The company has claimed that it has suffered a substantial drop in market share and sales inflicting upon a huge financial loss. The company also remains apprehensive of its potential for future investments in the state. The investments have been directed to Gujarat where operations have already started. “Clay mined from Thonnakkal has been found wanting both in terms of quality and quantity for sustained operations, thanks to the restricted permit for mining activities. The drop in market has had a cascading effect worsening the situation further,” the statement said. Unfortunately, the above position is proving to be highly stressful to the workers. The company had already taken up the case at various levels of the government. But the situation still remains fluid and sub-optimal with the shortage of raw material continuing to be a serious challenge. If there is no positive development in the near future, the Thonnakkal unit is likely to go the way of the one at Veli, it added. The company operations were already on a downturn for the last couple of years on account of the continuing shortage of raw material. This has eventually led to the closure of the factories at Thonnakkal and Kochu Veli in August 2020. However, under pressure, the company chose to resume partial operations on the intervention of the government at Thonnakkal for protecting the interests of workers following discussions held with the government and trade unions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/english-indian-clays-ltd-warns-of-closure-of-its-unit/articleshow/85380330.cms||---

The overall state is deficient by 48% if one compares the figures with the normal rainfall till August 15. In absolute terms, the state has so far received only 31% of its average annual rainfall of 831mm. Saurashtra and Kutch are hit hard with only 50% of the average rainfall till August 15. The month generally gives two to three good spells that last for three to four days, but this year so far August has not yielded any good rainfall. The experts said that they are not hoping for heavy rainfall for next few days. Manorama Mohanty, head of the IMD Gujarat, told TOI that in next five days, the forecast points at good rainfall for some of the southern states. “In other parts, the rainfall could be scant. Lack of a good system is cause of the scant rains,” she said. IMD officials said that Gujarat generally has a good rainfall till September 15. The rainfall after that is often scant. However, the state has even recorded rainfall till mid-October in some years, they added. But effectively the next 15-20 days would decide how the year would be for the state – both in terms of water availability for drinking and irrigation. In extreme cases, the farms may not get the adequate water, pointed experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/delayed-rains-cause-48-deficit/articleshow/85382757.cms||---

According to top sources, tripartite agreement is expected to be signed soon between the state education department, Gujarat State Aviation Infrastructure company Limited (Gujsail) and Blu Ray Aviation Limited, to impart both academic as well as remote pilot training using drones. Sources confirmed that the academic course will be a diploma or a certificate course. “A meeting was recently held between senior officials of state education department, Gujsail and Blu Ray Aviation. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) is being prepared and is expected to be finalized and inked soon. While state education department will launch a course to provide academic training to operate drones, Blu Ray Aviation will be responsible for field training of pilots who will operate drones,” said a well-placed source. Gujsail is the nodal agency to bring in Blu Ray Aviation to impart flying training to candidates. In fact, on Monday itself, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) granted conditional exemption from Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Rules, 2021 to 10 organizations across India, which includes Blu Ray Aviation Limited. These exemptions are valid for a period of one year from the date of approval or until further orders — whichever is earlier. The exemptions have been granted in line with a standard operating procedure issued by aviation regulator, DGCA. Captain Ajay Chauhan, director of state’s civil aviation department, said, “Gujsail’s efforts to establish a drone-training centre in Gujarat is now closer to reality as Blu Ray Aviation is on the first list of approved organisations for drone training.” The training is expected to give a boost to young drone entrepreneurs focusing on mining, agriculture and infrastructure applications among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/skill-guidance-soon-guj-govt-to-train-drone-pilots/articleshow/85382793.cms||Niyati Parikh

The official launch and logo release of the royal handloom edition ‘Mudhra’ was also organized as part of the campaign, which was done by Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi. The handloom-made saree designed with the ‘Mudhra’ of the Travancore Royal Family made by weavers of Kuthampully in Thrissur was gifted to the Kowdiar Palace through the royal handloom edition. “The campaign aims to buy about a thousand garments from the weavers of Kuthampully to provide a helping hand to them during the Onam season,” said designer Anjali Varma, who is leading this campaign. The campaign is also expected to help the revival of the handloom tourism sector of the state and take the weavers’ industry to an international level. While we adopt modernization, we have to ensure that our traditional industry is also protected. The campaign that looks forward to awaken the handloom industry would also create opportunities for the new generation of weavers as well, said Gouri Parvathi Bayi. Gouri Lakshmi Bayi appreciated the weavers of Kuthampully in finding a living through the traditional handloom industry of the state. The health workers who played a crucial role in fighting the pandemic would be gifted handloom dresses as a token for their selfless efforts, said Varma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/campaign-to-revive-handloom-sector/articleshow/85380375.cms||---

We have spent Rs 2.5 crore paying the market’s electricity bill and another Rs 50 lakh on water bills. The CCP is not getting any revenue from these vendors. Basically they are using taxpayers’ money to benefit themselves, which cannot be allowed to happen. We have lost out on crores of rupees worth of rent,” Monserrate told reporters, adding that the same vendors are asking for their shops to be repaired. CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes said the corporation will begin issuing eviction notices to those who are refusing to sign leave and licence agreements. Monserrate said the CCP doesn’t have sealing powers or powers to evict. “We can only issue memos and ask them to leave and keep increasing penalties and fines, but as fines grow they are less likely to pay them and that is the issue we are actually facing,” he said. When asked how much outstanding dues are owed to the corporation, Monserrate said “crores of rupees”. “This is money we have taken out for development work, which we cannot use to fund these people. We are spending Rs 3.5 crore to do development work in 16 wards and you can imagine the amount of work left out in the city because these people are not paying their dues. It is a huge cost that the city has to pay,” he said, adding that taxpayers are suffering as a result. Fernandes said the CCP is maintaining the building, clearing it, removing paan stains, addressing the water accumulation issue, carrying out minor repairs and fixing new light fixtures in the whole market all at its own cost. The corporation will ask GSUDA to prepare a comprehensive plan for a drainage system so that there is no flooding for the next 20 years. It will then try and get funding for the work to be carried out. CCP will also look for a solution to the flooding in Camrabhat. Monserrate said the CCP will issue one parking pass to each house number in Panaji for those who don’t have their own parking spaces. Shopkeepers and those staying on rent will not get this benefit, he said. All the streetlight fixtures in Panaji will be replaced under the Smart City mission. Monserrate also appealed to people to settle outstanding dues and at least pay their principal amount, which can be used by the corporation for development work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-rent-not-paid-cant-maintain-ccp-market-mayor/articleshow/85382887.cms||---

According to police sources, two youths in their late 20s have been booked for murder and “efforts are on to arrest the culprits”. The crime was committed on Monday in the agricultural fields of Bhura village in Shamli’s Kairana town. According to father of the deceased, who witnessed the murder, “I was going to the field with my son when all of a sudden, Sunny Singh and Shubham Kumar emerged from the bushes and told my son, 'you are too eager to testify against us in court. Now, we will kill you in front of your father.’ Soon afterwards, they dragged my son into the field. I cried and pleaded with them to spare him. Another farmer Kuldeep also joined me as we tried to reason with them, but they shot him dead in front of us. My son was a witness in a rape case, in which both killers were accused.” Before fleeing the spot, the accused also threatened to kill the father of the deceased if he spoke against the two in court. Additional superintendent of police OP Singh said, “The accused have been booked under IPC’s section 302 (murder) and efforts are on to arrest the culprits.” According to sources, the two youths had raped a 30-year-old woman of the same village two years ago, for which they had gone to jail but came out on bail a year ago.

Neighbouring Uttar Pradesh had stopped the practice around 15 years ago. The Bengali community in Uttarakhand had been strongly raising the demand for this. According to the proposal of the social welfare department, now the words “East Pakistan” would be removed from their caste certificates. Lakhs of Bengali families had migrated to Uttarakhand between 1956 and 1970, many of them from the border areas of Khulna, Jessore and Faridpur. A majority of them settled in Sitarganj, Gadarpur and Rudrapur areas of Udham Singh Nagar district. Over the past decades, they have staged frequent protests to get the stamp removed from their caste certificates, which is required to avail of government schemes and benefits. A source in the government said, “On August 6, the members of the Bengali community led by Sitarganj MLA Saurabh Bahuguna met CM Pushkar Singh Dhami. The CM had assured them that the ‘East Pakistan’ stamp on their caste certificate would be removed. The CM had also promised to bring the matter up in the next cabinet meeting. The proposal was brought up in the cabinet meeting by the department of social welfare on Monday and was passed.” Hundreds of Bengali community members, who were waiting inside the secretariat premises, raised slogans in favour of the ruling party MLAs and the CM. Sitarganj MLA Saurabh Bahuguna told TOI, “It was highly insulting for all those who had migrated from East Pakistan, especially for those who were born and brought up in the then Uttar Pradesh and later Uttarakhand.” He did not fail to mention that the issue was raised during the tenure of Trivendra Singh Rawat as chief minister in 2018. “At that time, the social welfare department had raised some queries and soon afterwards Covid-19 spread in the country and the matter got delayed.” Sanjay Bachar, Bengali Kalyan Samiti vice-president who was born in Rudrapur, said, “This is a major respite for us and also for our future generations. It was a blot for our community and it is highly satisfying that a decision has been taken in our favour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-gives-nod-to-proposal-to-liberate-3-5-lakh-migrant-bengalis-from-east-pak-stamp/articleshow/85380395.cms||Kautilya Singh

Besides, it is also vital for the government to meet its target of covering all the adult population by December. At present, nearly 48% of the estimated 90 crore adult population has received at least one dose of vaccines, whereas 13.5% has got both shots. Coverage with the first dose is imperative as it indicates initiation of vaccination and such people are most likely to come back for the second dose too.

The owner of the Rolls Royce, which is worth Rs 11 crore, had been delaying the payment of life tax amounting to over Rs 1 crore. The remaining cars, including Maserati, Lamborghini and Ferrari, that were seized on Sunday, were found to have been registered in Puducherry, New Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Enforcement officials of the transport department had seized 11 cars on Sunday for tax evasion in surprise checks.Authorities said that owners of luxury cars have to pay double or more in life tax in Telangana as compared to other states and that it could be as high as Rs 50 lakh here. “The difference in the amount of life tax that one has to shell out in the state is the reason why even the super-rich evade the tax,” said authorities. They said that five out of 11 cars were registered in Puducherry where the life tax amount for a luxury car is almost negligible, around Rs 14,000 for one year, while Maharashtra has an upper limit of Rs 20 lakh. “In Telangana, 13% of invoice value has to be paid as luxury tax and for a Rs 4 crore luxury car, it could come to Rs 50 lakh. Therefore, many of these cars have been registered elsewhere and were plying here,” said Papa Rao, enforcement officer, transport department, Telangana, adding that the owners of all the 11 cars will have to pay the tax. All the cars seized near Shamshabad by RTA authorities were released after the authorities received affidavits from the owners. Interestingly, a few owners had pleaded that they did not know how the taxes were to be paid. The cars were returned to the owners after they agreed to pay the taxes and affidavits to this effect were obtained. “Two luxury car owners turned up at our office today to pay the dues. We have handed over the vehicles to the owners after obtaining the documents and a commitment as they had requested us to allow them to keep the vehicles in their custody,” said the official, adding that many of these owners were knowingly evading the tax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rich-dodge-hefty-life-tax-on-high-end-cars-in-t/articleshow/85382930.cms||Amrita Didyala

He, however, said priority would be given to families belonging to poorest of the poor and downtrodden sections in the first phase. Launching the Dalit Bandhu scheme officially at Shalapally village in Huzurabad assembly constituency on Monday, the CM said the Dalit empowerment movement (scheme) would soon spread like a wildfire to other states with demands to implement it there. “The scheme will get global attention.” Raising ‘Jai Bhim’ slogan before starting his speech, KCR said Dalits, especially students, should make the scheme a big success. He handed over Rs 10 lakh cheques to 15 Dalit families on the occasion. For Dalit Bandhu, he said, Rs 1.70 lakh crore would be required to cover all the Rs 17 lakh Dalit families in the state. “If Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 40,000 is spent, the scheme can be covered in the entire state in next four years,” he said. Rythu Bandhu scheme was launched by the CM in Huzurabad three years ago. The CM took everybody by surprise by unveiling Dalit Bandhu from his adopted village of Vasalamarri recently, before Monday’s official launch. Attacking both Congress and the BJP, KCR alleged that the parties which did not spend even a rupee for the downtrodden were now talking about the scheme. Congress and BJP prime ministers did not even think about such schemes, he said. When Mission Bhagiratha was launched, the parties expressed doubts but several states are now following the scheme, he claimed. For Dalit Bandhu, he said, Rs 1.70 lakh crore would be required to cover all the 17 lakh Dalit families in the state. “If Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 40,000 is spent, the scheme can be covered in the entire state in next four years,” he said. He said the scheme was supposed to be launched last year, but due to the pandemic it was delayed. The CM said he had launched Telangana movement and introduced several schemes from Karimnagar and chose to kick off the scheme from the district again. The CM said with Rs 10 lakh at their disposal, Dalits can start a business of their choice and could earn double the amount within a year. KCR advised the beneficiaries not to take up similar businesses. He asked a woman beneficiary as to what would she do with the money. When she said she would like to set up a dairy unit, KCR had everyone in splits with his repartee, “Will you serve tea when I come to your unit?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-rolls-out-dalit-bandhu-govt-staff-to-get-the-benefit/articleshow/85386381.cms||Koride Mahesh

Referring to ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ Sena stated that the ‘symbolism’ may not provide any relief to the pains of partition but a ‘tangible action’ will,” said Sena, questioning further, “will the current rulers do the same?” “The wounds of Kashimiri Pandits are disturbing the country as much as the ‘pain of partition’. The pain of partition will not go away by mere ‘symbolism’ but tangible ‘action’ needs to be taken. Will the current ruler do it?

The 14-inch telescope with an optical mirror of 355 mm and focal length of 1,650 mm would not only allow amateur astronomical observations, but will also provide research quality images for potential discoveries. It is the second-largest telescope in IITs dedicated to outreach after IIT-Kanpur. An advanced digital camera would be used to record images and transient astronomical phenomena like meteor showers. Although the telescope would primarily be used for outreach and night sky observational training programmes, it has capabilities to deliver research-level performance, which would be explored subsequently by the institute. “With this large telescope, we will provide young students an opportunity to study celestial objects in greater detail than other small telescopes conventionally used for outreach programmes. Activities such as stargazing training programmes, observing astronomical transients, working with celestial images will enhance their knowledge, add to their sense of human connection with space,” said IITHyderabad director Professor BS Murty, who funded the project. Due to its superior quality images, data from the observatory is also likely to serve national and international researchers. Such collaborations can help IIT-Hyderabad become part of major astronomical discoveries and a recognised centre for astronomy in India. “Unlike other observatories designed for the outreach programme, our facility will provide a chance to work with high-quality astronomical images from deep sky objects as well as transient events so that school/college students may have opportunities to contribute to the astronomical research,” said department of physics assistant professor, Mayukh Pahari, who would be managing the facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-hyd-launches-its-first-observatory-on-i-day/articleshow/85382714.cms||---

While ‘Jashan’ (thanksgiving prayer ceremony) was organised in all the fire temples across the city while following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, the Parsi community skipped its annual gathering and sit-down dinner at the Zoroastrian Club. Instead, families celebrated the new year with traditional meals that included Dhandar (yellow lentil), white steamed rice, and fried fish or prawn Patia (sweet and spicy curry). They savoured the meal with sweets made out of Sewai, Rawa and yogurt. “Every year, we all come together to celebrate this day with much fervour. However, this year too, we had to restrict our celebrations at home due to the pandemic. People wore new clothes and visited the fire temple for the Jashan,” said Beynaiz Edulji, member of the community. Prior to the new year, the community observed Muktad in which they mourn for the departed souls and thank their ancestors. “During this time, one would find all Parsi households would decorate flowers in Silver vases that are dedicated to the departed souls,” said Edulji. The community’s dwindling population continues to be a concern as the number of Parsis in the city have come down from 1,200 to 1,000 in last few years. Elders from the community point out that the ‘Jiyo Parsi scheme encourages people from their community to have three children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/low-key-navroz-celebrations-for-parsi-families-in-twin-cities/articleshow/85382611.cms||Preeti Biswas

A majority of students told TOI that they were greatly concerned about the turmoil in their homeland and worried over safety of their families. Visas of some of the students had expired. A student of EFLU is stuck in Kabul and is not sure about his fate. Vice-president of Afghan Students Association, Hyderabad, Younus Shafee said around 250 students from Afghanistan were currently studying in Hyderabad and Andhra Pradesh. Around 40-50 students have just completed their studies and their visas have expired. We are not ready to go back to Afghanistan. I have been receiving calls from students seeking visa extensions. We seek the help of the Indian government to extend the visas. Apart from Hyderabad, Pune, Manguluru and Delhi have a large number of students from Afghanistan,” he said. Younus himself has recently completed his master’s degree in psychology. A PhD student of EFLU, stranded in Kabul, said: “I have booked by return tickets to Hyderabad. When things get normal and flights are restored, I want to come back. In Kabul, the situation is not violent. We are able to roam around. I saw a few women on the roads.” He began his PhD in English in 2017. He said his daughter studies at a school in Hyderabad and wants to come back with his wife and kids. Another student of EFLU Ammar Roushani said: “We are concerned about the situation in our country. My family is in EFLU.” Roushani, who has two more years to finish the course, said eight Afghan students were pursuing their studies in EFLU. Another student Zabiullah Alimyar said he was in touch with his family. “I hail from Parwan province, which is 50 km from Kabul. In my province, shops are closed and the streets are empty. People are scared to come out.” A majority of Afghan students pursue undergraduate, PG courses and PhD studies in EFLU, JNTU, UoH and OU. Many of them are funded by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarships, while a few of them are self-financed. Regional director of ICCR Ashok Jajoria said: “We have given scholarships to around 300 students in Hyderabad, Warangal, Viskhapatnam and Vijayawada.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/afghan-students-seek-visa-extension-as-kabul-erupts/articleshow/85382565.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Will stay Kokapet land auction over GO 111 concerns, warns Telangana high court||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday warned that it would stay the Rs 2,000 crore Kokapet land auction process after hearing contradictory arguments from the state government on GO 111 on the one hand and Kokapet land on the other. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing an implead plea by Agni Agritech company asking for removal of its land at Vattinagulapalli village from the purview of GO 111. The company argued that the land was outside the catchment limits of the twin reservoirs, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar. The bench took serious note of the state government’s counter stating that if highrise buildings are allowed in over 600 acres of Vattinagulapalli then pollutants and stormwater would pollute Kokapet lake and Himayat Sagar. The judges said that if that was the case then it would stay the auction at Kokapet because the state did not disclose this information when a PIL questioning the auction was filed. “We will now revive that PIL in view of the new facts that are coming to the fore,” the bench said. “It is not too long ago, the state auctioned 50 acres of land at Kokapet adjoining Kokapet lake where construction of highrise buildings is permitted.” The implead petition was filed in the main writ petition by environmentalist Jeevanand Reddy who is seeking complete protection of the twin lakes and their catchment area of 10 km radius as envisaged in GO 111. Appearing for the company, senior counsel K Vivek Reddy argued that they did not want any dilution in GO 111. “But our land falls outside the purview of catchment area...Since GO 111 speaks only about protection of catchment areas, we want our land to be removed from GO’s purview,” he said. He cited a decade-old report by state experts which favoured removal of such areas from GO’s regime. As many as 80 villages, including Vattinagulapalli fall under GO-111. But the government is now apprehending that exemption to one village would result in huge problems because it may result in emergence of high-rises in Vattinagulapalli alone with several other villages also seeking such an exemption. The government roped in ex-attorney general of India Mukul Rohatgi to present its case. Though Rohatgi argued against deletion of Vattinagulapalli from GO 111, the bench asked him why the state-appointed panel did not file its report in five years. “Though we summoned details of minutes of its meetings, the state failed to furnish them,” the bench said. Rohatgi said he is not aware of these issues and sought time. The bench reminded him the state itself filed an application before this court conveying its intent to review GO-111. Rohatgi said the state is now proposing to withdraw that application. The case will come up again on August 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-stay-kokapet-auction-over-go-111-concerns-warns-hc/articleshow/85386399.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Aurangabad||Residents move court, want land to be declared govt asset||Aurangabad: Some residents of Harsul area — including the members of the Bamane family who were given 123-acre land to cultivate by the district administration in the early 1950s — have moved the court of civil judge, senior division, Aurangabad, seeking the declaration of a prime 40-acre land, which has a market value of Rs 120 crore, as government land.In 1919, after the owner of the 123-acre inam land in the Harsul area died without a successor, it was taken over by the government. In certain areas of the land, there were temples and benefits of the land were being used to maintain the temples. In 1936, the land, along with the temples, was registered under the Hyderabad Endowment Regulation Act.In the early 1950s, the district administration gave the land for cultivation to one Tanaji Bamane, a person from the backward community. Cultivation was carried out on the land from 1952 to 1989.Meanwhile, the Shriram Devasthan Temple trust was registered by the government on December 4, 1962. The state government became a trustee as it was registered as a government trust. However, saying that the government had failed to maintain this trust, a group of citizens applied for a scheme before the joint charity commissioner and as per an order dated June 17, 1989, they were allowed to act as trust members. Soon after taking charge of the trust, the new members began the process to sell off 40 acre of the total 123-acre area. On October 20, 1994, the joint charity commissioner, Aurangabad, granted permission to sell 40 acres of the land at the rate of Rs 10 lakh per acre.The Bamane family challenged the order of the joint charity commissioner’s ‘permission to sell’ before the HC. In 1994, the HC granted a status quo and it has continued since. Around the same time, the bidders interested in purchasing the land, moved the HC and filed an independent writ petition seeking directions to reduce the offered price and demanded that the base price be reduced to Rs 3 lakh per acre — down from Rs 10 lakh per acre. Later, the bidders, citing appreciation of land price over two decades, offered to buy the land for Rs 3 crores per acre. Accordingly, on January 30, 2020, HC disposed of the petition, while allowing the bidders to buy the land for Rs 3 crore per acre.Representing the Bamane family, senior lawyer Prashant Katneshwarkar and lawyer Ganesh Gadhe filed a review petition before the HC. They pointed out that the bidders had suppressed the facts that a petition filed by the Bamane family was pending before the HC and there is already a status quo in respect of the sale transaction of trust property. The lawyers also moved a local court here for declaring the 40-acre land as government land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/residents-move-court-want-land-to-be-declared-govt-asset/articleshow/85378299.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Meerut||Two arrested for murder of Delhi woman & her friend in Meerut||MEERUT: Two days after the bodies of two women -- one from Delhi and the other her relative from Meerut -- were fished out of a drain near Meerut, police on Monday claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of two men. Afsana, a Meerut resident, and Hina from Delhi’s Seemapuri were killed and their bodies were dumped in a drain in Sardhana region of Meerut. Police claimed that the women, both in their 20s, were most likely killed on Tuesday by accused Gaurav Tyagi, 28 and Akash Sharma, 30. Their decomposed bodies were found on Friday. Meerut’s superintendent of police (rural) Keshav Kumar claimed that Gaurav, owner of a mobile phone repair shop, was in a relationship with Afsana. “Both of them belonged to Nanu village in Sardhana, Meerut. Off late, Afsana and her relative Hina started blackmailing Gaurav for money. A few months ago, they had publically thrashed Gaurav in Noida. The alleged incident's video clip was in their possession. The women were regularly extorting money from Gaurav. It prompted him to hatch the conspiracy with the help of his friend.” Police also claimed to have recovered a country-made firearm used in the crime along with four bullets -- two of them used and rest unused. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut, Prabhakar Chaudhary, said, “Gaurav and his friend Akash borrowed a vehicle from a friend. Then they went to Mamura region of Noida where the two women lived on rent. They asked the women to accompany them for shopping, to which they agreed. But they drove to Meerut. On the way, Gaurav shot Hina in the head as Akash drove the vehicle.” “Once they reached near Nanu village, Gaurav shot Afsana too. Then they dumped the bodies in the drain and fled. Later, Gaurav dropped Akash, washed the car with the water of the Upper Ganga canal and returned it to its owner.” Both the accused have been booked for murder and kidnapping and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-held-for-murder-of-delhi-woman-her-friend-cops-say-they-were-blackmailing-accused/articleshow/85380556.cms||Sandeep Rai

The mother had been accused of facilitating the crime. The verdict against three boys who were minor at the time of crime, including the twins’ elder brother, is pending in a juvenile court. The sordid saga had come to light after the children complained to an elder in the family. According to the police, the mother had many partners and she used to send the two children to sleep in an acquaintance’s room. The mother’s suitors as well as their friends ended up exploiting the twins over a long period, police said. In all there were eight accused, five major and three minors. The culprits included a father and his minor son, who were their neighbours, police said. A case was registered in November 2016 and chargesheet filed in 2017 under the supervision of then Cyberabad police commissioner Sandeep Shandilya. “A total of 33 witnesses, including the investigating officer, were examined in the case,” Mailardevpally inspector K Narasimha confirmed to TOI.

The directions came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma as the court was hearing a PIL filed by Doon-based social activist, Ajay Narain Sharma. The court had previously asked for an in-depth report with specific details. On Monday, the district administration failed to provide specific details regarding the encroachment on the riverbed after which the court asked them to come up with another one on September 23 when the next hearing for the case is to be held. The PIL is related to the illegal construction taking place in the rivulet Aanwala Ki Rao. Sharma has alleged in his PIL that the encroachment has been made in the upper region of the Sahastradhara road on a rivulet named Aanwala-Ki-Rao which is now facing an existential crisis as the illegal construction and plotting have led to a change in the course of the rivulet. “Even in such jal magna bhoomis (water holdings), revenue records are being systematically converted into banjar bhoomi (barren land) and construction has been allowed… This is changing the very character of the said rivulets in the pristine area of Doon Valley, which has been a notified Eco-Sensitive Area since 1989,” reads the plea. Last month, Sharma was given police protection after he was attacked by four unidentified men in his house who allegedly wanted him to back out from this particular case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-directs-dm-for-survey-to-ensure-no-construction-in-sahastradhara-riverbeds/articleshow/85380499.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: TRS-BJP clashes spill over to second day; 3 hurt, cars damaged||HYDERABAD: TRS-BJP face-off continued on Monday with rival groups coming face to face right in front of the Neredmet police station on Monday. Despite a posse of policemen, the groups pelted stones at each other, resulting in injuries to three persons. Some cars, including the vehicle of a BJP corporator, parked on the road were allegedly damaged by TRS activists. A day earlier, BJP corporator Sravan had suffered an injury during a clash between rival parties at an Independence Day event. After the incident on Monday, Neredmet police registered a criminal case against Malkajgiri MLA M Hanumantha Rao (TRS) and his supporters. It is the second criminal case in as many days against the TRS MLA. BJP on Sunday gave a bandh call in Malkajgiri to protest against the assault of its Malkajgiri corporator Sravan allegedly by TRS activists led by Hanumantha Rao. On Monday, BJP activists led by its corporator G Sunitha Yadav staged a protest at Santoshimaa Nagar. The activists were taken to the Neredmet police station, where BJP leaders yet again started to protest near the gate. Meanwhile, TRS activists led by Hanumantha Rao and a few corporators entered the Neredmet police station lane as a rally. The MLA and others were supposed to go to Huzurabad, where Dalita Bandhu scheme was scheduled to be launched by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. After the rival party leaders came face to face, the situation went out of control as a large number of TRS activists tried to surge towards BJP cadre. Though policemen tried to stop and control the activists, some TRS cadre allegedly indulged in vandalism by damaging parked cars, including the vehicle of Sunitha. “The whole road was clear when we went to Neredmet. Suddenly from where did the stone come? It is obvious that TRS cadres brought stones and then damaged our cars and resorted to pelting. TRS activists deliberately entered the police station lane with forehand information that BJP activists were there. Who gave this information?,’‘ Sunitha, on whose complaint a case was registered by Neredmet police against Hanumantha Rao, said Rachakonda assistant commissioner of police (Kushaiguda) Shiva Kumar dismissed the claim that police had leaked information to TRS about the presence of BJP leaders at Neredmet police station. “TRS activists changed their actual route course from Malkajgiri and we did not have the communication about it. As a result, TRS activists entered the police station lane. I myself was there at the police station and brought the situation under control without anyone getting injured. There was only one car which got damaged,” the ACP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-clashes-spill-over-to-2nd-day-3-hurt-cars-damaged/articleshow/85382983.cms||---

The distribution of Vidya Kanuka kits, comprising three pairs of uniforms, shoes, bilingual textbooks, notebooks, school bag, and other stationery, dominated first day activities across the state. People’s representatives participated in the kit distribution programme and the launching of the first phase of Nadu Nedu-Mana Badi programme in their respective constituencies. The first phase of the Nadu-Nedu programme covered 15,175 schools spending Rs 3,699 crore. About 40 per cent of students attended the schools on day 1. Participating in the programme in Vizianagaram, deputy chief minister P Pushpa Sreevani said that nearly six lakh students have migrated to government schools from private institutions. “The children of this generation are lucky to have all the facilities. During our schooldays, we had no option other than sitting on the floor and walking miles to reach the school,” said Sreevani. Speaking to ToI, state council of educational research and training director Prathap Reddy said Vidya Kanuka kits were distributed across the state on Monday. “The focus on the first day was to welcome the students to the refurbished schools and distribution of the kits,” said Prathap Reddy. During the first wave of the Covid-19 last year, nearly one crore students of Andhra Pradesh were confined to their homes for about seven months from March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/study-kits-welcome-students-on-reopening-day/articleshow/85380679.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Desai’s convoy stopped, Jaleel & supporters booked||Aurangabad: The city police have booked Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel and his supporters for stopping the convoy of district guardian minister Subhash Desai — who is also the industries minister — during his visit to the city for an Independence Day flag-hoisting ceremony on Sunday. The protestors waved black flags at the minister and jumped in front of the convoy while shouting slogans and blaming the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for shifting the sports university from Aurangabad to Pune. One person was injured in the head during the incident. Based on a complaint lodged by assistant inspector Syed Mohsin, Jaleel and over two dozen identified supporters have been booked on the charges of violating the Covid norms, including not wearing masks and holding an agitation in violation of social distancing norms. City Chowk inspector Sambhaji Pawar said: “The offence is bailable. The suspects were taken into detention and let go after notices were issued.” “Due to lack of political will, Aurangabad and the Marathwada region have been made to suffer. People here are deprived of their rights, infrastructure, and development works,” said Jaleel. He also questioned the silence of the region’s Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena leaders on the sports university shifting issue. He said land had already been identified for the university, but the MVA, especially deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, got it shifted to Pune. Jaleel also protested against the guardian minister raking up the issue of renaming Aurangabad. “Whenever Shiv Sena is exposed, the party tries to divide people along communal lines. They also cannot justify the shifting of the university, so the guardian minister has raked up the issue of renaming Aurangabad. This is nothing but cheap, communal politics.” The BJP too has appreciated the AIMIM for protesting against the MVA that, they said, is allegedly obstructing the region’s development. BJP city district president Sanjay Kenekar said, “Though it may be a stunt by the AIMIM, we appreciate them for showing the mirror to the MVA.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/desais-convoy-stopped-jaleel-supporters-booked/articleshow/85378357.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Most came home by the first available flights as part of Centre’s ‘Vande Bharat’ mission. Some even pooled in money to return on chartered flights. “Since they had to leave the country, their companies did not give the end-of-service benefit. This amounts to wage theft by the employers,” Bheem Reddy Mandha of Emigrants Welfare Forum (EWF) said. The Migrants Forum in Asia (MFA) has also taken up the issue on behalf of workers in different countries. Many who could not return and lost jobs have now approached authorities for help. For instance, Pettem Kishan of Luxettipet in Mancherial, who worked as a labourer/electrician for 16 years from 2004-20 in a transport company in Abu Dhabi, wrote to the collector in April for help. “I lost my job due to the pandemic. I came to India but could not return as there were no flights. In the meanwhile, my employer got my visa cancelled,” Kishan said, urging the collector to take up his case with ministry of external affairs so he could get his bonus, PF and gratuity. A letter has also been sent by the EWF to the company and also to the Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi to pursue Kishan’s case. The embassy has said that the company had not responded and the matter was being ‘closely followed up’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gulf-workers-fight-for-wage-dues-continues/articleshow/85383017.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

In a series of tweets and later speaking to reporters, Owaisi said that back in 2013, he had advised the government to open diplomatic channels with the Taliban to secure our strategic interests but he was scoffed at and criticised. “In 2019, I reiterated my concerns regarding the unavoidable truth about Afghanistan. While Pakistan, US and Taliban were holding talks in Moscow, @PMOIndia was counting the number of times he hugged Trump. We still don’t know what government’s Afghanistan policy is,” tweeted Owaisi.

What is he talking about when the Chinese army is sitting in Gogra, Hot Springs, Demchok and Depsang which is Indian territory. Prime Minister Narendra Modi who ideologically belongs to the RSS is afraid even to use the word China. If Mohan Bhagwat is a true nationalist, let him say that the Chinese army is sitting in Indian territory. Our Indian army is not able to control those areas which are Indian territory.

With no centralised admission process (CAP) beginning from this academic year and students receiving high SSC scores, the junior colleges are likely to witness unprecedented competition, especially in the science and commerce streams, said the authorities concerned. Anil Sable, the deputy director of education for Aurangabad division, said on Monday that the admission process was expected to get over within about a week. “As the admissions are taking place at a college-level this year due to the absence of CAP, we expect speedy conduct of the entire admission process. All junior colleges will be asked to follow a somewhat uniform schedule of admissions so that the 2021-22 academic year can be planned in an effective manner,” he said. Stating that junior colleges have been asked to follow different state policies of reservation without fail, the authorities said the admission process should be transparent and accountable. Rajanikant Garud, the vice-principal of the Devigiri College here, who was earlier a part of the official panel for CAP, said: “The admission process will be unique this year given the high scores of SSC students this year. Key subjects for the respective streams will be considered in case there is a tie in scores,” he said. The CAP, which was introduced in the 2017-18 academic year, used to witness participation of junior colleges from the municipal limits of Aurangabad with a combined intake capacity of over 29,000 seats. A total of 1,85,140 candidates had appeared for the last SSC examination from the Aurangabad division. Of them, 1,83,395 have been declared pass based on the internal evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/class-xi-admissions-set-to-begin-today-in-aurangabad/articleshow/85378421.cms||---

The MAU had not processed these dues despite a March 5, 2016 ruling by a civil court in favour of the woman, Babanbai Ghorpade claiming that she needed to complete certain documentation and that she had not vacated the official quarter that was allotted to her husband, Dadarao. Her lawyer Ganesh Gadhe brought to the HC's notice that Babanbai was not occupying the quarter and that the university was free to evacuate those occupying the facility. The bench of Justice S V Gangapurwala and Justice R N Laddha observed in an order on August 10, "The respondent No1 (MAU) can take steps for evacuating the persons occupying official quarter after the death of Dadarao, in accordance with law and for the said purpose the respondent No1 cannot withhold the statutory benefits entitled to by the petitioner (Babanbai) in accordance with the provisions of the statute, rules and the judgment of the Civil Court, more particularly when petitioner is not occupying the official quarter."The bench went on to direct MAU to "process the papers of the petitioner for family pension on its own merits and take decision with regard to the grant of family pension to the petitioner, expeditiously and preferably within a period of three (03) months from today." Babanbai, who married Dadarao after the death of his first wife, has been struggling to get these dues since July 17, 2007 when Dadarao passed away. Initially, Dadarao's dependents from his first wife filed a civil suit challenging Babanbai's status as a legally wedded wife of their father. On March 5, 2016, the civil court settled the issue in favour of Babanbai by ruling that she was a legally wedded wife of Dadarao. It also ordered apportionment of gratuity and provident fund. The MAU, which was a party to this dispute, was bound by the civil court's ruling. However, the agriculture university did little to process Babanbai's family pension dues, prompting her to move the high court by filing a petition through lawyer Gadhe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-to-parbhani-agri-varsity-settle-pension-claim-of-deceased-drivers-wife-in-3-months/articleshow/85378444.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Scam in scrap! BJP says BMC selling junk metal at low rates||MUMBAI: The BJP has alleged a scam in the BMC’s contract for scrap metals. The BJP has said that the BMC is selling its metal scrap from its decommissioned water pipelines at prices far lower than the real market value which is causing a loss to the BMC. The BMC had in 2020 floated tenders to sell scrap that the various BMC departments generated. The contractor is supposed to collect the scrap and then pay fixed rates per kilo of metal. However, BJP corporator Vinod Mishra has in a written complaint to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said that the BMC was selling scrap from its British era pipelines at a rate that is much lower than the market price. The BMC is selling scrap pipelines for around Rs 32 crore. TimesViewThe BMC is facing a cash crunch due to falling revenues. It is time the BMC comes clean on allegations of a scam in selling of scrap metals. The BMC must ensure that it updates the prices of scrap metals more frequently given the steep fluctuation in prices of metals in the market. Instead of a fixed price for two years, the civic body must have annual rate revision and all public procurement norms must be followed.“The BMC has given an additional contract of Rs 32 crore as the rates from 2020. In 2021 the rates of metal are at an all-time high. Despite this, the BMC is choosing to sell its metal scrap at 2020 rates. This will result in a loss of Rs 5 crore to the BMC. There are vendors in the market who are ready to pay much more than the price the current contractor is offering. So the contract given to M/s Asifo Technologies must be put on hold and no work order must be issued,” Mishra said in his letter. The scrap includes two unused aqueducts of 1,800 mm, weighing 70.68 lakh kilos. Officials said that the decommissioned aqueducts on the Tansa east and west sides from Bhandup to Powai were replaced as well, and the scrap weighs 29.50 lakh kg. Mishra said the BMC can’t give out an additional contract for such a high value without floating fresh tenders. “It is a violation of public procurement norms. I have asked for variation committee minutes of meetings. This kind of award of contract is illegal and arbitrary. It is daylight robbery of taxpayers money,” Mishra said. Officials said they had fixed the rates for metal scrap for two years. “We had fixed rates for two years. So this contract was given according to rates fixed. The contractor has been given a contract to dispose of all scrap from all BMC departments. So there was no need to float fresh tenders for this scrap. If any contract gives a higher rate after a contract is awarded, it has no meaning,” said an official. The scrap metal contract was awarded by BMC’s Mechanical and Electrical department. Officials said in 2020, BMC expected Rs 18 per kilo for scrap metal but current contract and bid around Rs 32 per kilo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/scam-in-scrap-bjp-says-bmc-selling-junk-metal-at-low-rates-in-mumbai/articleshow/85386416.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: SIT probing Kumbh Covid-19 test scam reshuffled||HARIDWAR: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the Kumbh Covid test scam, in which over 1 lakh “fake” Covid tests surfaced, was reshuffled after the three-member committee set up by the Haridwar district administration submitted its report. Rakesh Rawat, who was supervising the probe, has been asked to leave and will be replaced by Haridwar (city) circle officer Abhay Singh. Investigation officer Rajesh Shah has been transferred to Dehradun. Haridwar (city) SHO Amarjeet Singh will take his place as the main investigation officer. Inspector Yogesh Deo has also been inducted into the SIT. Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S said the reshuffle was “only done because the investigation officer was up for a transfer.” The SIT had earlier told TOI that the scam was a “well-planned conspiracy” thought of even before Max Corporate Services got the contract to conduct tests during the Kumbh Mela. The probe report, meanwhile, said that Max Corporate Services had forged papers to get its contract, the Mela health department allegedly knew but did nothing about it. “Max filed an expression of interest with Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Labs to the Mela health department on January 11. However, the affidavits were made four months later in April, not in January,” a source told TOI. “The Mela health department knew but no action was taken.” Because Max was not an ICMR-recognised testing agency, it had passed on the testing work on Nalwa and Lalchandani labs. “The CMO’s office, which was supervising the tests, caught the irregularities (it was Nalwa and Lalchandani, and not Max uploading test data) but officials did not take it seriously, the committee found,” the source said. Those from the health department in charge of checking the tests being conducted on-ground also “just collected the data and did not perform their duties, the report said.” In fact, the testing numbers never added up. “While Max showed it was conducting 18,000 tests a day on major bathing festivals of the Kumbh Mela, it was not possible. It had three teams, each of which could only do 250 tests,” the source said. Another senior official told TOI that the report says the scam “could have been stopped had every responsible person performed their duty.” Max filed an expression of interest with Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Labs to the Mela health department on January 11. However, the affidavits were made four months later in April, not in January,” a source told TOI. “The Mela health department knew but no action was taken.” Because Max was not an ICMR-recognised testing agency, it had passed on the testing work on Nalwa and Lalchandani labs. “The CMO’s office, which was supervising the tests, caught the irregularities (it was Nalwa and Lalchandani, and not Max uploading test data) but officials did not take it seriously, the committee found,” the source said.

---||Chandigarh||Give update on plea in SC: Outgoing DGP to IGP seeking retirement||Ambala: Haryana outgoing director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava has asked Ambala inspector general of police (IGP) Bharti Arora, who has sought voluntary retirement from service (VRS), to submit information on whether a petition filed by her in the Supreme Court of India would have any bearing on her request for leaving service. Yadava sought the information in an August 13 letter to Bharti. Yadava’s letter to Arora reads: “It has been brought to my notice that an SLP (special leave petition) (criminal) No. 8738/2010 has been filed by you before the Supreme Court of India. Vide this SLP, you have challenged an order dated October 14, 2010, of the Punjab and Haryana high court issued in the matter of Criminal Revision Petition No. 2194/2008 in the matter of Bharti Arora vs State of Haryana.” “You are requested to inform the background of this case within three days with particular reference to whether it has any bearing on your request dated July 25, 2021, for voluntary retirement from the Indian Police Services,” according to the former DGP’s communication to IGP. As per the information, the case is related to vexatious entry in a case registered under Section 18 of the NDPS Act when Arora was posted as superintendent of police (SP) in Kurukshetra. In that case, police seized 8.7kg opium from na person in Shahabad, Kurukshetra. The court had found a vexatious entry had been made allegedly by police in this case in an attempt to save the actual culprits and some police officials, including Arora, were roped in by the court. The special court of Kurukshetra of presiding officer Sarita Gupta had on May 30, 2008, completed the trial and placed her order in a sealed cover to be pronounced by the successive presiding officer as she was transferred. The court of Sarita Gupta had given many chances to Arora to appear before it, so her version could be heard, but she never presented herself before the court. Because of this, the district court could not deliver the order as it was then challenged in the high court by Arora. When the court dismissed her application, Arora approached the Supreme Court. Kurukshetra district court has scheduled the case in question for hearing on September 6, 2021. Sources in the police department say Arora has applied for the VRS to avail the pension benefits of her service. If she gets convicted by the Kurukshetra court after the order is pronounced, she may not get the same. On the same day on August 13, Haryana additional chief secretary (ACS) of the home department also wrote to IGP Bharti Arora and requested her: “Reconsider the decision regarding voluntary retirement as you are a good officer and the pride of the Police Department.” On July 24, 2021, IGP Bharti Arora had requested for the VRS by writing a letter to the Haryana chief secretary (CS) through Haryana director-general of police (DGP), seeking retirement from service with effect from August 1, 2021. Before this, on August 6, Haryana home and health minister Anil Vij had also asked IGP Bharati to reconsider her request for VRS. Anil Vij had said, “She is a noble officer and we are proud to have such officers in our state. I received her file on Thursday (August 5) and have asked her to reconsider.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/give-update-on-plea-in-sc-outgoing-dgp-to-igp-seeking-retirement/articleshow/85383090.cms||---

The cart, which was earlier used to sell biryani, was taken on rent by a Muslim man to sell shikanji for the Sunday’s event outside Trilok Teerth Dham Jain Temple in Badagaon village. A fight erupted after people from the Jain community -- who practise vegetarianism -- noticed the biryani banner and objected to the stall’s presence. People in the congregation alleged that the seller called his friends from the locality and attacked the pilgrims as they were leaving in a bus. Heavy police force and a PAC contingent were deployed in the village on Monday to maintain peace. Police later booked 70 people -- six named and rest unnamed-- and arrested eight of them. All the accused were booked for attempt to murder, rioting and for hurting the religious sentiments. A member of the Jain community and social activist Lalit Jain said, “I condemn this incident. The vendor was fooling people by putting a label of a ‘shikanji’ on a cart which used to sell biryani. And then he resorted to violence against pilgrims. We demand strict action against the culprits.” NS Sirohi, station house officer of Khekhra police station, said, “We have arrested eight persons so far and efforts are on to nab the rest. A few mild injuries were sustained by a couple of persons. PAC has been deployed in the region to avoid any untoward incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/clash-erupts-after-jain-shikanji-paper-banner-on-cart-gets-torn-revealing-chicken-biryani-underneath/articleshow/85380737.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Ahmedabad||Tryst with bullish destiny: Guj firms ride ipo boom||With corporate companies making a beeline to launch their initial public offerings (IPO) amid the current stock market bull run, Gujarat Inc, too, is leaving no stone unturned to tap the buoyant primary market. Cashing in on retail investor euphoria, Gujarat-based companies have mobilized around Rs 8,736 crore via seven main-board IPOs so far in 2021. Switching to 2020, only one offering was launched from the state, by which Chemcon Speciality Chemicals raised Rs 318 crore. Gujarat-based companies that raised money from the primary market this year include Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem Ltd, Heranba Industries Ltd, Anupan Rasayan India Ltd, Rolex Rings Ltd, GR Infraprojects Ltd, Exxaro Tiles Ltd and Nuvoco Vistas Corporation. Not just from Gujarat, but companies across India have mopped up a staggering Rs 60,093 crores with 36 main-board IPO launches, by August 12. Against this, Rs 26,612 crores were collected from 15 IPOs in 2020, shows data compiled by Prime Database. Liquidity, soaring equity markets fuelling rush Soaring equity markets and strong investor sentiment have drawn fund-seekers to the primary market, said market players. "Globally, the current IPO momentum is the most active in the last 20 years. For example, in US, we witnessed unprecedented IPO activity led by tech unicorns, SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) and sectors that proved resilient during the Covid-19 pandemic," said Mahavir Lunawat, Founder, Pantomath Group, which recently lead-managed the IPO of Exxaro Tiles. Agrees Parth Parekh, a research analyst at a city-based wealth management company. He said the excess liquidity due to central banks printing more money, buoyant stock market and lack of alternative investment opportunities are some of the factors powering the primary market. Good returns are drawing investors Good returns delivered by the previous IPOs have further bolstered the investor sentiment, riding which companies are also getting higher valuations. Of IPOs launched this year till August 12, only four have delivered negative returns. The average return of the remaining IPOs stood at a healthy 67%. "The likes of Barbeque Nation, Laxmi Organics, Easy Trip Planners, MTAR Tech and Nureca Ltd have delivered triple digit returns," said a market expert. Retail ownership at all-time high The holding of retail investors — individuals with up to Rs 2 lakh shareholding — in NSE listed companies reached an all-time high of 7.18% as on June 30, 2021, rising from 6.96% as on March 31, 2021, according to primeinfobase.com, an initiative of PRIME Database Group. In value terms, retail holding touched a record high Rs 16.18 lakh crore from Rs 13.94 lakh crore in the said period. According to Pranav Haldea, managing director, Prime Database Group, a buoyant secondary market and a flurry of new listings have helped in channelizing retail savings into the capital market. Holdings of high net-worth individuals (HNIs) — with more than Rs 2 lakh shareholding in NSE listed firms rose to 2.10% from 1.98% in the first quarter this fiscal, taking the combined retail and HNI holding to an all-time high of 9.28%. Market velocity will hold With more and more companies filing papers for their issues, the rush for IPOs is set to continue for the rest of the year. Industry players expect another 30 IPOs to hit the market in the remaining months of 2021. The list includes popular names such as Adani Wilmar, Paytm, Policy Bazaar, Nykaa, Delhivery, Mobikwik and Aditya Birla Sun Life. "We expect the IPO party to continue, though, uncertainty looms over the possible third wave and consequential implications cannot be ruled out," remarked Mahavir Lunawat, MD, Pantomath Group. Analysts say most of the IPOs listed this year are trading at high valuations based on price to earnings and price to sales ratio. Investors can take advantage of the buoyant markets. Smaller firms tap SME-based platforms While the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) IPO space witnessed less traction as compared to the main-board IPOs, Gujarat-based smaller firms also raised money by launching their offerings on SME platforms. As on August 10, about six companies from the state cumulatively raised Rs 35 crore via SME IPOs. Meanwhile, Aashka Hospitals Ltd’s Rs 101 crore SME IPO closed for subscription on August 13. In 2020, only five SME IPOs, aggregating Rs 35 crore, were launched from Gujarat. Nationally, 27 SME public offerings were in 2020, and 26 already in 2021. Gujarat companies mobilized about Rs 8,736 crore WITH seven IPOs in 2021 ALREADY; HAD LAUNCHED only one IN 2020||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tryst-with-bullish-destiny-guj-firms-ride-ipo-boom/articleshow/85370671.cms||---

We will submit all the applications to the chief minister on October 2.” He demanded that the state government roll out ‘BC Bandhu’ and ‘tribal bandhu’ schemes by allocating Rs 10 lakh to each family. Sanjay said the BJP will fight for implementation of all the electoral promises made by the TRS government. Listing out various promises of the TRS government, he said that even after three years unemployment allowance is yet to be given to youth. “There are many such unfulfilled promises like three acres of land to each Dalit family, double bedroom houses for the poor, etc,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-to-collect-applications-for-dalit-bandhu/articleshow/85385200.cms||---

The consumers quickly take their phone, swipe the screens to show an online copy, and are let in after that. “If they don’t have vaccination certificate, we insist to show the SMS at least. If they don’t have even the text message then entry is denied,” said the guard. After the timings were relaxed from August 13, major malls in the city have finally decided to remain open till 10pm, said the respective management. The management at the malls have also raised concerns claiming that it may be difficult to ensure that each one coming down has a vaccination certificate. This would ultimately hamper sales at the outlets at a time when business is already down. TOI visited four malls to witness the scene. Signs offering discounts were put up to beckon customers. Not many were seen though. At Trillium Mall, near Rambagh, the NMC also runs a drive through vaccination centre. Announcements were made for consumers to get vaccinated. It was, however, learnt that the doses were not available at all the times. The NMC team remains there till 4pm. By the time TOI visited the mall, the staff had wound up. At most malls there was no insistence on showing the vaccination certificate. Crowds were moderate as enough empty space was seen in the outlets. “There were crowds on Independence Day because of the holiday. The order says that we have to limit the entry which has to be not more than 50% of the mall’s capacity. We can take in 20,000 persons at any given time but due to the curbs, over 5,000 were only allowed,” said an in-charge of one of the malls who did not wish to be named. “The footfalls had come down again on Monday. The crowds are expected to increase on public holidays like Rakhsha Bandhan which is round the corner. It may be difficult to control the crowds and insist on the vaccination certificate. It would have a direct impact on the sales. There is no rental income since more than a year. Some of outlets have done online business during lockdown but have not paid the rent. We have sent them reminders. Legal action will only complicate the matter,” the source said. Restrictions on movie halls is another reason to keep footfalls down, the source said. The corridors of Empress Mall, the oldest mall in the city, were empty. Some of the shops did not have a single customer. “We are confused whether the order says that the staffers of the mall have to be vaccinated or it’s the visitors. It may not be practically possible to ensure that every person coming in is vaccinated,” said a management official. The management in the malls claimed that they have ensured that all their staffers have got the jab. As TOI made a random inquiry, one of the staffers manning a life said he was not vaccinated yet. Technically, Nagpur Central is not a mall, but given its scale, it’s no different from one. The curbs on malls do not apply to us, said the store general manager Padma Kumar. Nagpur Central is not a mall because there are no individual outlets. All the sales happens under one head. Nagpur Central had planned to remain open till 10pm from Monday. The sales are down to a quarter, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccine-certificate-rule-hits-footfall-business-in-malls/articleshow/85383180.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants pre-arrest bail to woman in MCOCA case||MUMBAI: Finding that a grocery shop owner, Shabana Shaikh, could not be booked under the provisions of the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) invoked in a murder case only because her relative, an alleged history-sheeter, was the key accused, the Bombay high court recently granted her anticipatory bail.The court held that prima facie, there is next to no material to establish the nexus between Shaikh (42) and the organized crime syndicate. “In the light of the nature of occurrence and the role attributed to the petitioner [Shaikh] therein, her custodial interrogation is not warranted,” the high court said. The incident took place on November 17, 2020. Shaikh was accused of allegedly kicking and hitting the victim, Wasim, over an alleged feud between the two families, while others, including her relative Rashid, were accused of assaulting him with an iron rod and sword. An FIR was lodged in the murder case based on the statement of his aunt, a purported eyewitness. Shaikh’s lawyer, Misbaah Solkar, sought the relief after a trial court rejected her anticipatory bail plea. Solkar pointed out that the eyewitness had named Shaikh only in a subsequent statement. Solkar submitted that had Shaikh been actually present, the woman would not have missed naming her in the first instance. “...The only reason for which the petitioner has been implicated is the fact that Rashid happens to be her relative,” Solkar argued. The HC allowed the plea, but clarified that the observations in the order are made for the limited purpose of determining the justifiability of invocation of the MCOCA provisions against Shaikh and her entitlement to the relief of pre- arrest bail. “...they may not be construed as expression of opinion on the merits of the matter and the trial court shall not be influenced by any of the observations hereinabove while determining the guilt or otherwise of the petitioner and co-accused,” the court said. The HC further said that if Shaikh is arrested by Trombay police, she is to be released on bail on furnishing a bond of Rs 25,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-woman-in-mcoca-case/articleshow/85386426.cms||Rebecca Samervel

In the past, city police had not been able to detect most such cases. In the first case, crime branch team of assistant PI Mayur Chourasiya under DCP Gajanan Rajmane and addl CP Sunil Phulari managed to intercept a gang of seven persons from Tamil Nadu at Mehkar in Buldhana. They were picked up from a travels bus with the help of local police. The gang was brought to Nagpur. Crime branch recovered around cash Rs 4.88 lakh. Police said the gang had stolen cash and valuables worth more than Rs eight lakh from parked cars by either smashing windows or distracting driver. Two cases were detected after their arrests. The gang had reached Nagpur on August 13 by train. Crime branch tracked the gang members movement after they were spotted taking an auto-rickshaw to reach Manas Chowk from where they had taken a bus to reach Aurangabad. The cyber cell tracked the gang members with the help of cell phone number provided by them to purchase bus ticket. In another case, Mankapur police team under API Kailash Magar and senior inspector Vaijayanti Mandodhawre picked up two tricksters from New Mumbai after they were spotted on a bike in various CCTV cameras installed at different locations. Checking their call details also helped. The two tricksters, Sanjay Das (Roy) and S Palanikumar Subramani, used a stolen bike to drive from Mumbai to Madhya Pradesh and later sneaked into Maharashtra. The two stayed at a lodge in Saoner and smashed windows of cars parked at desolate places. On August 3 and 4, the two committed a series of thefts in the city, including at Mankapur, Koradi, Sadar and Sitabuldi. They later went to Navi Mumbai via Aurangabad, Nashik and other places. Police managed to procure their mobile phone number and reached one of their relatives in Mumbai. The clues picked up there helped cope to zero in the tricksters. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, zonal DCP Vinita S and addl CP Navinchandra Reddy and Phulari are trying to alert cops across various states where these two gangs could have been active.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cctvs-help-cops-bust-2-inter-state-gangs/articleshow/85385205.cms||Soumitra Bose

The PM is the chairman of the Shree Somnath Trust (SST) which manages the affairs of the world-famous temple located in Prabhas Patan town in the Gir-Somnath district.  “PM Modi will inaugurate three projects and also perform a virtual ground-breaking ceremony for the Parvati Temple coming up near the main temple for Rs 30 crore,” SST trustee cum secretary P K Laheri told reporters.  He said the event will be organised in the Ram Mandir auditorium of the temple on August 20.  “While the PM would inaugurate as well as perform ground-breaking for the four projects virtually, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is a trustee, would also join via video conferencing,” Laheri said.  Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and other dignitaries would attend the programme at the auditorium.  The three projects to be inaugurated include a one-km long “Samudra Darshan” walkway built at a cost of Rs 49 crore on the seashore behind the temple, a newly-built museum housing ancient artefacts constructed near the temple at Rs 75 lakh, and the renovated “Ahilyabai Holkar Temple” or the old Somnath temple situated opposite to the main temple, he said.

---||Aurangabad||Pankaja Munde rebukes supporters for demeaning other BJP leaders||Aurangabad: BJP leader Pankaja Munde on Monday came down heavily on a group of supporters who had raised a slogan that could be considered a veiled attack on other party members. The incident took place at Parli in Beed district, where newly-appointed Union minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad was holding his public outreach rall. Munde and Karad had just paid tribute to her father — Gopinath Munde — at a memorial. Munde’s supporters, who had gathered in large numbers there, raised a slogan: “Pankaja Munde Angar Hai, Baki Sab Bhangar Hai”, followed by “Amar Rahe, Amar Rahe, Gopinath Munde Amar Rahe”. Pankaja objected to the first slogan. Rebuking her supporters for behaving in a “childish manner”, Munde said such behaviour had hurt her a lot. “Is this a programme of another political party? Keep your stature as high as mine. Otherwise, don’t come to meet me,” Munde told them. The incident has put curtains on speculations that Pankaja has developed serious differences with Karad, her father’s contemporary, and was exploring other political options. There is a sentiment among the supporters that Pankaja Munde and her sister and Beed MP Pritam Munde were deliberated being sidelined in the BJP.Pankaja, who lost in the 2019 assembly elections from Parli, was hopeful of getting berth in the Upper House of the state legislature. But that di not happen. While Pritam’s name was doing the rounds during the recent expansion of the Modi cabinet, Karad, who was picked for Rajya Sabha by BJP hardly a few months ago, was made MoS for finance. Meanwhile, Pankaja, who has been given the responsibility as BJP national secretary, flagged off Karad’s public outreach rally. Called ‘Jan Aashirvad Yatra’, the six-day rally is scheduled to visit different parts of Marathwada and involve the party’s local cadres before culminating in Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pankaja-munde-rebukes-supporters-for-demeaning-other-bjp-leaders/articleshow/85378520.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Rainfall in Marathwada after a gap of almost 3 weeks||AURANGABAD: After almost three weeks, rainfall marked its return in Marathwada with many parts of the region receiving occasional spells of light to medium showers in the 24-hour period ending on Monday morning. However, the farming community is awaiting a strong revival of the monsoon to give a new lease of life to the kharif crops, which are said to be under stress at several places across eight districts of Marathwada. While the region registered an average 10 mm rainfall in the past 24 hours by Monday morning, Parbhani district recorded the highest 20 mm rainfall, followed by Nanded (14 mm), Hingoli (13 mm), Latur (11 mm), Jalna (9 mm), Beed (5 mm), Aurangabad (4 mm) and Osmanabad (1 mm). The rainfall count for Marathwada in August has inched to 21 mm so far, which is barely over 20% of the normal rainfall. The region, since June, has received 487 mm showers, accounting for 116% normal rainfall, show official data. Ravi Kale, a farmer from Ohur hamlet near Jatwada of Aurangabad taluka, said artificial irrigation measures were of little help in protecting kharif crops during the extended dry spell. “Even if we source water from well and irrigate crops, the hot weather conditions shunt growth of crops. The irrigation alone cannot produce conducive conditions for kharif crops,” said the farmer. The maximum temperature in Aurangabad and many parts of the region was hovering above 30 degree celsius in the past days, which was above normal by two to three units, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). As per the IMD, Aurangabad is likely to get heavy rainfall activity for the next 48 hours, followed by chances of moderate showers during subsequent one or two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rainfall-in-marathwada-after-a-gap-of-almost-3-weeks/articleshow/85378536.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Residents unite, rename Gond Mohalla after Birsa Munda||Nagpur: As the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) missed the deadline to rename several localities having caste-based names, residents of Gond Mohalla in West Nagpur assembly constituency themselves declared to have renamed the locality after tribal freedom-fighter Bhagwan Birsa Munda. At a function on the Independence Day, the residents, led by NGO Janhit, unanimously announced the new name. Abhijit Jha, founder of the organization, said Janhit carried out a detailed interaction with the citizens of the area. He persuaded the people about the government’s order and the need to change the name based on a specific castes. In the end, it was unanimously decided to name the settlement after Bhagwan Birsa Munda. After the state government’s decision to retitle residential areas having caste-based names, the divisional commissioner’s office had set a deadline of August 15 for the purpose. However, the civic body renamed only four localities, mostly in central Nagpur, — Telangipura as Santajipura, Telipura as Snehdip Nagar, Marathipura as Sahu Nagar and Bhoipura as Maharishi Nathudham. Deputy engineer (slum department) Avinash Barahate admitted the delay and blamed zonal offices for this. So far, the NMC headquarters has received caste-based names of areas from only two zones — Dhantoli and Gandhibagh. These two zones comprise around 43 localities named after castes, he said. The NMC is yet to receive names of such localities to be renamed from the remaining 8 zones. “The civic body is always in favour of renaming localities having caste-based names,” said deputy mayor Manisha Dhawde, who is also chairperson of the NMC’s renaming committee. Before the government order, the NMC had already renamed Chambar Nullah with North Canal, she said. The deputy mayor said there are many residential localities in the city which have names referring to castes or communities. The move will bring about a change in the mindset of people and it is a part to abolish the caste system gradually. According to her, everyone has an equal right to live with dignity. No one should be discriminated over one’s caste and religious affiliations, she pointed out. She also said that all 10 zonal offices have already started a survey to identify localities or areas having caste-based names. Once the survey is over, the civic body without any further delay will rename the areas by taking residents into confidence, said Dhawde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-unite-rename-gond-mohalla-after-birsa-munda/articleshow/85385235.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh cop who cracked ‘blind’ rape & murder case gets MHA award||BIJNOR: A few strands of hair on the body of a six-year-old girl, a motorcycle hooter and presence of mind helped a UP policeman crack a “blind” case of rape and murder of a minor and win the home ministry's medal for excellence in investigation. Eight cops in the state have received the ‘Union Home Minister’s Medal for Excellence in Investigation 2020’, an award that recognises excellence in investigation and is meant to “promote high professional standards of investigation of crime”. Overall, 152 medals have been given across the country to officers from the CBI and police forces of different states. Radhey Shyam, currently posted as crime branch inspector in Bijnor, was presented with the award on Sunday on the occasion of Independence Day. After receiving the medal, Shyam said, “I was doing my duty, but I’m happy that the bereaved family got justice. I want to continue doing service to the country and uphold the faith that people have on the police force.” The crime that the police officer investigated occurred in 2019. On a May afternoon, a six-year-old girl went missing in Rampur district. “The girl’s father told us that she had left home to buy curd and never returned. We filed a case against unidentified persons under section 363 of IPC (kidnapping),” said Shyam, who was then posted as a station house officer (SHO) in Rampur’s Civil Lines. The investigation was a dead end — there was no body, no witnesses and no suspects. “After initial interrogation, we narrowed down on a 24-year-old man in the neighbourhood who was acting in a suspicious manner. But when we picked him up for questioning, the girl’s family vouched for his character and we had to let him go. We were back to square one.” While the victim’s family was sure of the youth’s innocence, something in his behaviour didn’t seem right to the trained eyes of a cop. Shyam decided to keep a close eye on the man, Nazil Ahmed. “I appointed informers to keep track of his activities. I kept visiting the victim’s neighbourhood with a motorcycle hooter. Whenever I used the hooter, my informants would observe Nazil. As expected, he showed unusual interest in the arrival of the cops and progress of the case. My suspicions grew, but I had no proof,” he said. But in June, more than a month after the crime was committed, some children who were flying kites ended up discovering the girl’s body in a secluded building, 50 metres from her house. “The body was decomposed, but the family members were able to identify it as that of the girl. While all the neighbours were gathering at the building where the body was found, Nazil was planning his escape. By the time we rushed to his house, he was gone,” said Shyam. After a chase that lasted several hours, Nazil was apprehended from a nearby locality. “He opened fire at us and suffered a bullet injury in his leg in retaliatory firing. He later confessed that he had lured the girl to the building with chocolates and raped and strangled her. Some strands of hair found clutched in the hands of the victim matched Nazil’s in forensic tests,” said Shyam. A case was lodged against Nazil Ahmed under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Pocso Act. In December 2019, the court found him guilty of the crime and sentenced him to death. Meanwhile, the other UP police officers to win the Centre’s medal for excellence in investigation include additional superintendent of police (Gorakhpur) Ashok Kumar, inspector (Agra) Ajay Kaushal, inspector (Aligarh) Vanshidhar Pandey, inspector (Kasganj) Ripudman Singh, inspector (Bareilly) Sunil Kumar, sub inspector (Pilibhit) Tejpal Singh and sub inspector (Raibareilly) Ravindra Sonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cop-who-cracked-blind-rape-murder-case-gets-mha-award/articleshow/85380845.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||700 guesthouses, hotels in Paharganj and Karol Bagh told to shut over borewell use||NEW DELHI: Over 700 guesthouses and small hotels in Paharganj and Karol Bagh have been issued closure notices by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for illegal extraction of groundwater using borewells. DPCC in its notice has asked the guesthouses to take corrective measures within 15 days, failing which would result in disconnection of electricity and water, along with the cancellation of licence. “According to Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), Paharganj in New Delhi has been declared as an overexploited area, and illegal extraction of groundwater by the hotels/guesthouses without having any valid NOC from CGWA are thereby violating the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,” said one such notice issued by DPCC to a guesthouse in Paharganj, a copy of which is with TOI. Guesthouse owners, however, said borewell water was being used only for bathing purposes, with no commercial activities, kitchens or laundries functioning at any of these smaller units. “The need to use borewells arose as the Delhi Jal Board water only comes for around four hours each day – two in the morning and two in the afternoon. A number of hotels and guesthouses took permission from CGWA to use borewells prior to 2014, but what will the new ones do that came up after 2014?” asked Sourabh Chhabra, secretary, Paharganj Guesthouse Owner’s Association, adding that until Monday, at least 700 notices had been issued in the area. Ashwini Arora, general secretary of the association and another guesthouse owner in Paharganj, said sewer charges of Rs 2,000 for extraction purposes were already being paid by guesthouses, as was stated on Delhi Jal Board (DJB) website, however, they were still being targeted by the authorities. “Community borewells have been created by DJB nearby, but guesthouses that are doing no commercial activity are now being penalised. The industry has already suffered a lot,” Arora said. A senior DPCC official told TOI that the notices were issued based on a list provided by DJB, following an NGT order over illegal extraction using borewells in Delhi. “A number of guesthouses were found using illegal borewells to extract water. These hotels and guesthouses also don’t have any consent to establish or operate under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, which are mandatory to run guesthouses and hotels,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/700-guesthouses-hotels-told-to-shut-over-borewell-use/articleshow/85383219.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The district and sessions judge (no.1) SS Adkar, on Monday, fined Bhuyar Rs15,000 and simple imprisonment of one month in default of the fine. The court also ordered the MLA to pay Rs10,000 to the tehsildar as compensation. The incident had taken place on February 27, 2013 at Warud tehsil office. According to the charge sheet, Warud tehsildar Ram Arun Lanke had organised a programme to mark the golden jubilee celebration of the revenue department at his office around 2pm on February 27 when Bhuyar reached there along with his supporters. The MLA questioned Lanke about the closure of government jowar purchase centre on APMC premises. He also asked the tehsildar why did he disconnect his phone and in a fit of rage hurled abuses and a mike at him. Lanke reported the matter to police who registered a case, carried out the investigation and filed charge sheet on April 15, 2013. Believing the witnesses and holding arguments of the government pleader, the court found Bhuyar guilty. APP Sunit D Ghodeswar had pleaded for the government. Reacting to the judgment, Bhuyar said the revenue department officials hatched this controversy to put pressure on him and cases were registered against him. “I respect the court verdict, but will appeal against it in the high court. I shall keep agitating for farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/morshi-mla-bhuyar-gets-3-month-jail-in-tehsildar-assault-case/articleshow/85383236.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Second marriage not cruelty against divorced 1st wife, says Bombay HC||NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has held that a husband entering into wedlock for the second time cannot be a case of domestic violence against the divorced first wife. “Merely because the husband performs a second marriage, it cannot come within the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (DV) Act’s, 2005, definition,” justice Manish Pitale held. While allowing the petition by the Jalgaon-based husband, his parents and sister, the judge said the first wife could have claimed that there had been a domestic relationship between her and husband at a point in time. “But the said fact in itself would not be enough for her to initiate proceedings under the DV Act, much after the divorce proceedings had attained finality and findings had been rendered against her,” stated the judge. Censuring the Akola-based wife for filing cases against her in-laws to harass them, justice Pitale said the way proceedings were initiated under the DV Act was nothing but an “abuse of the process of law”. “The wife could not be permitted to keep the husband and in-laws engaged in litigation in this form, when the DV Act’s requirements did not appear to be satisfied. The chronology of events indicates that she sought to invoke provisions after her divorce case attained finality up to the Supreme Court. It was not as if she initiated a proceeding during the matrimonial discord between the parties,” said Pitale. While quashing the Akola magistrate’s notice of May 17, 2016, which rejected the petitioners’ application for quashing of the DV Act proceedings filed by the wife, the judge pointed out that it was only after she suffered adverse orders in the divorce, and for restitution of conjugal rights cases, which stood confirmed right up to the apex court, she sought to invoke the DV Act. “She appeared to be interested in initiating and continuing such proceedings as a tool of harassment against the in-laws. The prayers pertaining to monthly maintenance, compensation and other benefits have all been made in the backdrop of such allegations, which are nothing but a repetition of the contentions raised in the earlier round of litigation,” the judge stated. The couple entered wedlock on March 13, 2011, but soon matrimonial discord developed between them. The husband filed a divorce case against wife on the grounds of cruelty, which was allowed by the Akola Family Court on September 16, 2014, while dismissing her application for restitution of conjugal rights. The wife challenged it in HC, but it was rejected on August 10, 2015, and then by the top court on February 15, 2016. The husband, in the meanwhile, performed a second marriage. Subsequently, she filed a case under the DV Act against him and in-laws in the Akola court contending that his second marriage attracts provisions of the DV Act. The Akola magistrate while issuing notice to the petitioners also rejected their application for quashing those. “As far as the husband’s second marriage after divorce is concerned, the wife’s contention that it amounted to domestic violence cannot be accepted. Section 3 of the DV Act defines ‘domestic violence’ in an elaborate manner and it refers to physical, sexual, verbal, emotional and economic abuses,” justice Pitale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/husbands-second-marriage-cant-be-domestic-violence-against-1st-wife-hc/articleshow/85385270.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Surat||Fake GIA certificates seized||SURAT: A racket of providing Gemological Institute of America’s (GIA) original certificate for inferior quality diamonds has been busted by the city police. Police detained Dharmesh Patel, a diamond trader and filed an informal complaint to initiate investigation. Police seized the valuables worth Rs 11 lakh from Patel under criminal procedure code section 102 that authorises police to seize product for investigation.  Police recovered a total 24 GIA certificates from Patel that he had arranged from other diamond businessmen. Police also found five inferior quality diamonds which had numbers inscribed on it that matched with five certificates. A laser machine that he used for inscribing the numbers on the diamonds to prove that it is the same diamond mentioned in the certificate was also seized.  “Patel targeted comparatively less experienced businessmen and provided inferior quality diamonds with a certificate that had description of a high-value diamond. We have approached GIA to verify if the certificates are original and for which product they issued it,” said R K Dhuliya, police inspector, Mahidharpura police station.  Investigation revealed that Patel had arranged the certificates from those diamond businessmen who did not provide it with sold diamonds. “He collected certificates of only high-value diamonds from his known businessmen and then used it with inferior quality diamonds,” said Dhuliya.  Pravin Nanavati, a veteran diamond and jewellery businessman, said, “If this has actually happened, it is unfortunate and damaging to the city’s diamond business. I strongly believe that it is difficult to do any mischief since GIA’s certifications are accurate and using it with some inferior diamond is tough.” Dinesh Navadiya, regional chairman, gems and jewellery export promotion council (GJEPC), added, “Similar thing was detected by GIA in Mumbai but if this has happened in Surat, it is shocking. GJEPC is creating awareness on various issues like these to prevent wrong practices in the market,” said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gia-certificates-provided-for-poor-quality-diamonds/articleshow/85380863.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Kolhapur||‘Krishna basin water to be diverted to dry areas’||Kolhapur: Excess water from the Krishna river basin will be diverted to the drought-prone regions of south Maharashtra, state irrigation minister Jayant Patil said on the occasion of Independence Day.Over the past few years, the Krishna basin area has been receiving heavy rainfall. This has been causing floods in the Krishna river and its tributaries. Last month, within just five days, around 17 thousand million cubic (TMC) feet water was released from the Koyna dam into Krishna river. Currently, though major discharge from the dams has stopped, small amount of water is being released through the powerhouse spillways of the dam.“We have decided to lift around 3.5 TMC water from Krishna river basin with the help of existing Tembu and Mhaisal lift irrigation schemes. We will fill the wells, lakes in these talukas so that there is no scarcity of water for drinking and irrigation purposes and for the purpose of growing fodder crops for the cattle,” said Patil. The Jat, Kavthemahankal, Miraj, Tasgaon talukas of the Sangli district, and Sangola and Mangalwedha talukas of the Solapur district will benefit from the move. The water will be lifted this year and the decision to lift 3 TMC additional water for next year will be taken later depending on the rainfall and water stock in the dams.Moreover, there are plans to address the drought in 65 villages in the Jat taluka, which remain perennially dry. The decision to lift 6 TMC water through the Mhaisal lift irrigation project from the Warna dam reserved for non-irrigation purpose to these villages.As per Krishna Water Tribunal, Maharashtra can use 594 TMC water from dams from Krishna river basin in any given year. The tribunal has, however, not mandated to use particular amount of water from particular dam. Taking the advantage of the freedom, the state irrigation department has written to Krishna Valley Development Corporation to allow use of 6 TMC to be used for 65 villages. The water lifted thus will be used for drinking purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/krishna-basin-water-to-be-diverted-to-dry-areas/articleshow/85378589.cms||---

Environmentalists are alarmed and have flagged it as a move that could have disastrous consequences — the land could cave in any time and because most of these sites are in forest and riverbed areas, they would be in the direct line of impact if a landslide or flood hit. There are about 350 muck disposal sites along the 900-km project. On Saturday, state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj asked officials to come up with an action plan to develop 54 of these sites as "tourism spaces". Of the 54 dumping zones being considered for this, a source told TOI, 30 are between Tanakpur and Pithoragarh, 10 between Dharasu and Yamunotri, six between Rishikesh and Mana, five between Rudraprayag and Gaurikund, three between Rishikesh and Dharasu, and one from Dharasu to Gangotri. “The move is also meant to generate employment,” a government official told TOI. Former senior geologist with ISRO’s Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad and a member of the high-powered committee on the Char Dham project that the Supreme Court set up, Dr Navin Juyal, said, “In most places, dry seasonal streams are where muck is being disposed. Saknidhar in Tehri, for instance. If a permanent structure is built in the natural flow path of a water channel, it will be washed away in case there is a cloudburst or even in the Monsoon.” That, he added, was what happened in 2013. “In the Srinagar area, the flood washed away roads and a part of the university stadium because we interfered with the natural course of the river.” Many of these sites are also in ecologically sensitive forest areas or near river beds. “Concretising them would damage forests and alter the course of rivers … If a flood or landslide hit, these areas would be directly affected,” said local environmentalist Reenu Paul. “Because a muck disposal site is essentially a landfill, it can cave in any time,” added another environmentalist Mallika Bhanot. Geologist SP Sati added, “The intensity of natural disasters in the Himalayas is increasing. Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh are emerging as the most susceptible to climate change in the present scenario … What we need to do is conserve what we have, not exploit what remains.” TOI had earlier reported that 56,000 trees would be cut for the project. It is why norms are in place to avoid land use change in this manner. Savesh C Katiyar, a former member of the Char Dham high-powered committee, told TOI, “Forest land transfer rules say that a muck disposal site has to be restored (by the project developer) and handed to the forest department if forest land is diverted. Otherwise, it will be in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. For any other work on the land, a fresh set of permissions and clearances is required from the Union ministry of forest and environment.” State forest department additional secretary Vijay Kumar Yadav said any new activity would be taken up “after proper clearances from the Centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-plans-hotels-on-char-dham-road-muck-sites/articleshow/85375129.cms||Shivani Azad

Police said that the two accused Shailesh alias Akki Parmar and Chandu Parmar attacked Pratik Patel (28) after he left from his work on August 14 evening. A day before the murder, Patel was called by the accused duo for doing some labour work which he had refused to. Following Patel’s denial, the trio had a verbal altercation and Patel had resorted to violence. The next day, the Parmar brothers decided to teach Patel a lesson. “They admitted that they knew the victim’s working hours and were waiting for him at Bajwa. As soon as Patel reached Bajwa, they attacked him and left him to die in a pool of blood,” said a police official. Locals called an ambulance and took Patel to SSG Hospital where he succumbed during treatment. An eye-witness lodged a police complaint against Shailesh and Akki and a murder case was registered at Jawahagarnagar police station on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/brothers-kill-friend-over-past-rift/articleshow/85380879.cms||---

He also distributed school kits and books to students under Jagananna Vidya Kanuka for the second consecutive year. The CM, who inspected the renovated and upgraded zilla parishad high school in the town, interacted with students on the first day of the reopening of schools across the state for academic year 2021-22. Wishing the students by writing “all the very best” on the green board of the decked-up school, he told the teachers to restrict the number of students to 20 in each class room. “If the class strength is above 20, have classes on alternate days limiting the students 20 in each session,” he said, adding that all teachers and non-teaching staff have been vaccinated for Covid-19. He also cautioned students to take precautions and follow Covid guidelines. The chief minister took a close look at the contents of the school bag, which were distributed to students under Vidya Kanuka scheme, and also interacted with students. He reviewed each and every work done under the Nadu-Nedu initiative, checked the freshly-painted walls, drank water from the water filter, checked the tap connections in toilets, and seating arrangements for midday meals. He interacted with differently-abled children. Mentioning that 15,715 government schools were modernised at a cost of Rs 3,669 crore under Nadu-Nedu, he launched the second phase of the programme in 16,368 schools at a cost of Rs 4,535 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/15715-govt-schools-undergo-makeover-in-nadu-nedu-1st-phase/articleshow/85380904.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Mumbai||‘Delta, lineages can’t fully escape immunity, make vax a priority’||Almost 25% of the genome sequencing samples in the country came from Maharashtra, where the SARS-CoV-2’s Delta variant was first found around six months ago. Data from the Indian Covid Genome Surveillance shows Maharashtra has so far provided 11,968 samples — twice the number studied from other high incidence states such as Kerala and Delhi. CSIR’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology’s (IGIB) team of Dr Sridhar Sivasubbu and Dr Vinod Scaria, who work closely with the Maharashtra public health department on the genome surveillance project, tell Malathy Iyer that the state should be the role model for others because samples were chosen in a scientific manner to ensure every district was covered.Q: Your team has been studying samples from the two most affected states, Maharashtra and Kerala. Please share your observations about Maharashtra.A: The programmes in Maharashtra and Kerala were developed as a collaborative initiative between CSIR and the state governments. They are designed for surveillance, to provide early warning and aid public health policy. A key observation about Maharashtra is the systematic and uniform genome sequencing across each district. This helped identification of emerging variants and the state government promptly applied public health measures. Maharashtra should be the role model for other states. Q: The Delta-plus cases in Maharashtra have increased from 21 to 76 in a few days. Can we now say Delta-plus is the variant to watch out for?A: While Delta (B.1.617.2) has become the predominant lineage in India and many parts of the world, the virus will continue to evolve by accumulating more genetic mutations. The Delta sub-lineages are popularly called Delta-plus lineages as they have additional mutations in the genomic background of Delta. These sub-lineages are increasing, but the number of cases is not yet significantly large. Q: Considering Delta has already affected crores of Indians and wreaked havoc across the country during the second wave, can it still cause another wave?A: Waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection have occurred across the world as people loosen their vigil and public health measures, and also because the antibody levels from pre-existing infection or vaccines wane over time. While nobody can definitely predict which variant would emerge and cause the next wave, examples from the past from across the globe suggest the same variant could indeed cause multiple waves in a country. As a larger proportion of the population becomes immune through vaccination and/or previous infection, the infections resulting in severe disease and deaths would significantly come down and the infection would become endemic. Q: What about Delta’s sub-lineages (in terms of their ability to cause a wave)?A: There are 13 sub-lineages of Delta as of date (AY.1 to AY.12 and AY.3.1). Different sub-linages are prevalent in different regions: AY.3 and AY.3.1 in the US, AY.3, AY.4 and others in the UK, and AY.12 in Israel. At this moment, it is not possible to predict which one would cause a wave as it also depends on the susceptible population in the region. However, as none of these emergent sub-lineages so far can fully escape the immunity due to previous infections or vaccines, it is our urgent priority to vaccinate the entire population. Q: Genome sequencing has become a well-recognised term in India in the last six months, and your institute has been in the forefront. Comment. A: Being a premier genomics institute, CSIR-IGIB was invested in cutting edge research and technology development in genomics and informatics. The pandemic provided us with the opportunity to apply our skills for the benefit of the public. One of our major achievements has been the real-life application of the COVIDseq approach for high-throughput sequencing. Globally, this was the first field trial for the COVIDSeq assay. Today, this is one of the default sequencing assays. Q: In terms of whole genome sequencing, India still lags way behind the global yardstick of testing at least 5% of all positive samples. What can be done to change this?A: It would be improper to directly compare… The number of genomes required would typically be decided by a number of factors, including the population size, mixing of the population, testing infrastructure and the modalities to act upon the evidence. Currently the SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance strategy in India is very diverse, with some parts over-represented and others highly underrepresented. For the surveillance to be informative and effective, it is important we have a uniform and long-term surveillance strategy for India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/delta-lineages-cant-fully-escape-immunity-make-vax-a-priority/articleshow/85383289.cms||Malathy Iyer

The convict Gajanand Patil was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years and fined Rs 10,000 while the girl was awarded compensation of Rs 50,000 district legal services authority. According to case details, Patil, a native of Akola in Maharashtra, had started living with the girl’s mother in Sayajigunj area. The girl’s mother had divorced her husband in 2014. On June 30, 2018, Patil, in an alleged drunk condition, reached home and took the girl inside the house when nobody was present and molested her. Horrified by the sexual assault, the girl ran out of the house crying and informed the neighbours. The neighbours thrashed Patil and the girl’s mother approached police. It was, however, only after NGO Shrotosvini Trust, that educates children living in the area, intervened that an offence was registered and Patil was arrested. Following the incident, the girl had to be counselled by a psychologist and was also examined by an ENT surgeon since Patil had also slapped her. During the trial of the case, the girl, her mother, their neighbours as well as members of the NGO deposed against Patil. The report of the psychologist to whom the girl had narrated about Patil’s crime was also submitted before the court by additional public prosecutor Atul Vyas. The court of additional sessions judge PT Patel upheld the oral and documentary evidence for convicting Patil. It also mentioned that the compensation that will be kept in fixed deposit until the girl becomes 18 years of age be taken care of by either the president or the secretary of the Shrotosvini Trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-gets-three-years-in-jail-for-molesting-lovers-daughter/articleshow/85380914.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: BJP pitches for political ‘alternative’ with Jan Aashirwad Yatra||CHANDIGARH: With Jan Aashirwad Yatra of Union minister Bhupender Yadav, BJP high command has started pitching him in southern Haryana. Yadav’s yatra, which evoked huge response in Gurgaon on the first day, suggests that he may pose a major challenge for current Gurgaon MP and Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh, a four-time MP. In his early 50s, Yadav is a Rajya Sabha MP with roots in Jamalpur village, a few kilometers from Pataudi, which is part of Gurgaon parliamentary constituency. The first leg of the yatra was from Gurgaon to Jamalpur. The second leg, to be held on Tuesday, will end with a public rally organised by local MLAs Rao Abhay Singh and Rewari BJP president Arvind Yadav, who is also chairman of Harco Bank. “This is the first time that the son of the soil has got such an important portfolio in Modi ji’s team. This is the foundation of a new and strong southern Haryana. All our party MLAs are enthusiastic,’’ said Arvind Yadav, who is also the party’s Rewari district president. “Bhupender ji has successfully handled his responsibilities in Rajasthan and Bihar. Now, he has been asked to strengthen Haryana, especially southern Haryana,” he added. Repeated attempts to reach Rao Inderjit Singh, whose men stayed away from the yatra, for comment remained futile. However, an official close to Rao said he had spoken to Yadav over the phone and complimented him. “Rao sahib is already 71 (age) and may be above 74 by the next election. Bhupender ji is in his early 50s. Secondly, he has roots in BJP itself, hence he has a long innings to play,” said a senior BJP leader. Rao Inderjit joined BJP just ahead of the 2014 general elections. He successfully contested the 2014 and 2018 elections on the BJP ticket. However, his political sway was curtailed after the 2019 assembly elections. The BJP high command not only denied a party ticket to his daughter but did not pick many of his supporters in the organisational expansion of Haryana BJP either. “Change is an ongoing process... Every new member is welcomed in the family. But it doesn’t mean that he can take the place of older ones in an overnight. Rao Inderjit Singh is our very senior leader. Nobody can take his space overnight,” said CM Manohar Lal Khattar, who had attended the programme organised by villagers to greet Bhupender in Jamalpur, in Gurugram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-pitches-for-political-alternative-with-jan-aashirwad-yatra/articleshow/85383281.cms||Manvir Saini

The government medical college and hospital (GMCH) is likely to host the trials, said sources. The GMCH is yet to receive the formal confirmation, but it fulfils the necessary criteria. The first phase of the nasal Covaxine was held at Gillurkar Multispecialty Hospital in Nagpur where volunteers were mostly from the city. Results of this phase was positive enough to get approval for the second and third phase trials for the company. However, now the volunteers from unexplored and less-infected region of Vidarbha are set to be included in the trials. The sample size which was 50 in the first phase, is set to increase to 550 in the second and third phase. To serve this purpose, the GMCH, a tertiary care hospital where patients come from the periphery, is being preferred as the site. A senior official who coordinated the trials of Covaxin in Nagpur told TOI that Bharat Biotech is now willing to have people from remote areas where sero positivity is low. “As far as Nagpur is concerned, sero positivity is very high and we experienced it during the trials of the pediatric population too. So, it’s a strategic decision to have volunteers from remote areas. GMCH may be the centre, but initially, no person from Nagpur will be given the nasal vaccine,” said the official. Doctors at GMCH also confirmed that they have completed all the necessary formalities but refused to comment. Bharat Biotech is already planning to launch the nasal vaccine as a booster dose for those who have received both the doses of Covaxin. Dr Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech, said the company is working on a combination of Covaxin followed by a nasal vaccine. “Those who have taken both doses of Covaxin and completed six months may get the nasal vaccine dose as an additional protection. But this will happen only after the third phase of the trials get positive results,” said a senior doctor associated with the trials in GMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nasal-covaxin-phase-ii-iii-trials-to-focus-on-remote-areas/articleshow/85383338.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jabs at private hospitals double that given at public centres in August||MUMBAI: Private hospitals in the city have administered double the number of Covid vaccine doses compared to public centres in August. The spurt in demand for paid vaccination was likely driven by the acute shortage at the public centres, where the drive was not held on six days so far in the month. Data from the BMC shows private centres have administered 5.7 lakh doses between August 1 and 15. In comparison, the free vaccine centres run by the BMC and state government have administered merely 2.9 lakh doses. The public centres didn’t hold drives on August 4, 12 and 13 due to unavailability of vaccines. The remaining days were Sundays when the drive is on hold. The demand for paid vaccination had witnessed 41% drop in doses administered in July. Public health researcher Dr Ravi Duggal said there is every possibility that the private sector was seeing a rush again because of the frequent stockouts in the public centres. Also, with local train travel linked to complete vaccination, people may have little choice but to opt for paid vaccination. “People who are spending hours travelling by buses can finally take trains, but there is the caveat of vaccination. So even if out of reach, many may stretch themselves to get vaccinated,” he said. The cost of complete vaccination is anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,600. Private hospitals said this increase in footfall was expected as people from the 18-44 age group, who had taken the first dose in May, are now becoming eligible for the second dose. “These are people who had taken their first shots with us,” said Joy Chakraborty, COO of P D Hinduja Hospital. At least 9 lakh people will become eligible for a second shot in Mumbai through August. Dr Santosh Shetty, executive director of Kokilaben Hospital, said housing societies have started enquiries for the second dose. “I wouldn’t say there is a big rise in demand, but some increase is there. There is still scepticism and fear because of the scams,” he said. Of the 80.5 lakh doses administered in Mumbai, 43% has been in the private sector. “The shortages are completely out of our control. But one way we are trying to bridge the gap is through CSR initiatives,” said a civic official. Ironically, the official added while they are struggling for supplies every few days, private orders are now fulfilled within 3-5 days of being placed on CoWin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jabs-at-pvt-hosps-double-that-given-at-public-centres-in-aug/articleshow/85383373.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Mathematics and English used to be the major stumbling blocks for students to cross their first barrier before entering college education. The small fraction of students, who scored 60% or above, was considered an elite group. But in the last two decades, the pass percentage saw an almost two-fold increase, now inching towards near cent percent. The final exams could not be conducted in the last two years, in March 2020 and 2021, due to Covid-19 and grades were accorded based on internal exams. However, pass percentage is now touching at least the 95% mark, including in the 2019 results. There has also been a manifold increase in number of students securing a 10 GPA (grade point average) compared to earlier years. Analysing the factors that might have led to the increased pass percentage over the years, professor in education and vice-chancellor, Dr BR Ambedkar University, Prof Nimma Venkata Rao, said parents have understood the importance of education. “The student is now monitored and evaluated on a continuous basis after the introduction of the continuous and comprehensive evaluation process. The educational requirements of the students, be it books, transportation, library or other resources, are now fulfilled by either parents or the government. The content development is happening in a systematic way. All these factors might have helped in improving the pass percent,” said Prof Rao. RTE Forum southern states steering committee member Narava Prakasa Rao said the thrust on education and grades has increased over the decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/x-factor-pass-percentage-witnesses-2-fold-increase-in-last-two-decades/articleshow/85381002.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

No deaths were reported in any of the 11 districts of Vidarbha in the last four days. The test positivity rate (TPR) is constantly under 0.30% and in many districts, it’s zero. The number of new cases is also down significantly. The recovery rate is constantly higher than the new cases which means patients under treatment are reducing daily. While 14 new cases were reported on Independence Day, 24 were recorded on August 16. The number of tests drastically reduced as it was a I-Day holiday on Sunday. Only 6,392 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours in Vidarbha, which is lowest in the second wave. The number is likely to improve on working days.

---||Meerut||Ahead of polls, BJP evokes memories of 1994 killings of statehood activists||Muzaffarnagar: The BJP on Monday launched the 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra' to seek the blessings of the people ahead of the 2022 polls in UP and Uttarakhand. The yatra began from the village where statehood activists who were enroute to Delhi to accomplish their demand for a separate hill state in 1994 had died in alleged police firing. There were allegations of unprovoked police firing on the night of October 1, 1994, which led to the death of several activists. There were also allegations of rape in Muzaffarnagar. And BJP's yatra took off from Rampur Tiraha where the incident had taken place. While flagging off the yatra, Union minister Ajay Bhatt said, "It is because of the supreme sacrifice of these activists that we have Uttarakhand state today. So, we came here to pay our tributes and cannot move ahead without taking their blessings." The minister added, "We are travelling to Haridwar today and then to Dehradun in the evening and from there to other districts."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ahead-of-polls-bjp-evokes-memories-of-1994-killings-of-statehood-activists/articleshow/85380951.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Kolhapur||Homes still under debris, villagers rue lack of govt aid||Kolhapur: The heavy downpour last month washed away everything that Gangubai Baburao Sorte (72) and her family had built over a lifetime. Now, 25 days later, they are still counting their losses. On July 23, the Kolhapur district had received 232.8 mm rainfall — almost 10 times the normal rainfall for the day. The downpour caused unprecedented flooding in many parts of the district and triggered landslides. Gangubai’s home is at the foothills of the Panhala fort in the Mangalwar Peth area next to Nebapur village. A massive landslide crushed three houses in the area, but thankfully, there were no casualties. The government had announced relief package for the affected villages. Many villagers told TOI on Monday that they had still not received any help from the administration and were living with help from their neighbours. Gangubai recalled that she, her husband and son were asleep, when around 1.30am, noise of stones falling on their roof woke them up. The youths from the village rushed to their house and pulled them out. “All night long, we sat on the road. In the morning, the landslide and slush buried our home. Even the paddy farm and the well were damaged. We are still scared that the hill will come crashing down,” she told TOI. The village has a long history. Veer Shiva Kashid, who disguised himself as Shivaji Maharaj to help the king escape, lived in this village. Srikant Jamsandekar (52), who has lived in his 250-year-old ancestral stone home since birth, is still in distress. He lives with his family of six. “The landslide covered parts of our house. We have been receiving food from the villagers, but the administration should help us. We have to go to the farms or our neighbour’s homes to use the toilet,” he said. The state government has set up a panel to study the reasons for the landslides, many of which have taken place at spots not identified as landslide-prone zones. Panhala MLA Vinay Kore said, “We have removed the loose stones that could pose further threats. The state and central teams have visited these places for geological study. We have also asked private geologists to study the area in detail so that tragedy like Malin (in Pune) or Taliye (in Raigad) can be avoided.” He added that the primary study suggests that the landslide occurred as the water coming from the fort area couldn’t get drained properly and created pressure on the road embankment. Prasad Sankpal, head of district disaster management committee in Kolhapur, said, “The number of landslide-affected villages has increased this year. The villages nestled right below the hills face high risk of landslides and the villagers need to be alert during the monsoon season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/homes-still-under-debris-villagers-rue-lack-of-govt-aid/articleshow/85378711.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The two had cumulatively demanded Rs4.50 lakh from a contractor to release acceptance letter for some civil works. During a subsequent search, CBI team of inspector Niraj Kumar Gupta under the supervision of SP and head of branch MS Khan also recovered cash Rs15 lakh from the official residence of Gupta. It’s learnt Gupta and Rade were harassing contractor Deepak Chambhare Patil for 0.2% commission of the total work amount to release him the acceptance letter or work order. Chambhare Patil had been allotted two projects of repair and renovation of official quarters and offices of CR at Bhusawal, having budget of Rs1.34 crore, and another one of upgradation of coach care centre at a budget of Rs1.13 crore. Chambhare Patil had been asked by Gupta to approach Rade to get the direction from him regarding issuance of the acceptance letter. Gupta had also later asked Chambhare Patil to approach him on August 11 after preparations in the manner Rade asked him. Chambhare Patil had approached CBI, which registered an offence on August 15 and subsequently laid the trap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbi-arrests-sr-div-engg-officer-while-accepting-rs2-4l-bribe/articleshow/85385381.cms||---
---||India||After report submitted, Kumbh test SIT rejigged||HARIDWAR: The Special Investigation Team probing the Kumbh Covid test scam, in which over 1 lakh “fake” Covid tests surfaced, was reshuffled after the three-member panel set up by the Haridwar district administration submitted its report. Rakesh Rawat, who was supervising the probe, has been asked to leave and will be replaced by Haridwar (city) circle officer Abhay Singh. Investigation officer Rajesh Shah has been transferred to Dehradun. Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S said the reshuffle was “only done because the investigation officer was up for a transfer.” The SIT had earlier told TOI that the scam was a “well-planned conspiracy” thought of even before Max Corporate Services got the contract to conduct tests during the Kumbh Mela. The probe report, meanwhile, said that Max Corporate had forged papers to get its contract, the Mela health department allegedly knew but did nothing about it. “Max filed an expression of interest with Nalwa Labs and Dr Lalchandani Labs to the Mela health department on January 11.But, the affidavits were made four months later in April, not in January,” a source told TOI. “The Mela health department knew but no action was taken.” Because Max was not an ICMR-recognised testing agency, it had passed on the work on Nalwa and Lalchandani labs. “The CMO’s office, which was supervising the tests, caught the irregularities (it was Nalwa and Lalchandani, and not Max uploading test data) but officials did not take it seriously, the panel found,” the source said. Those from the health department in charge of checking the tests being conducted on-ground also “just collected the data and did not perform their duties, the report said.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-report-submitted-kumbh-test-sit-rejigged/articleshow/85388077.cms||MS Nawaz

The state government has taken the decision after minister of state and Shirol MLA Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar made a request to relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar. The state government has announced a financial relief package of Rs 11,500 crore for the districts ravaged by the floods, landslides caused due to torrential rains last month. There as many as 40 villages in both Kolhapur and Sangli districts that were completely surrounded by floodwaters and every person had to be evacuated and put in temporary shelters. Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said, “Earlier, only those people whose houses were inundated for 48 hours were eligible for the ex gratia. Now, the condition has been relaxed. Those who had to be evacuated due to the floodwaters surrounding their villages will be eligible for Rs 10,000 ex gratia.” The district administrations have started receiving the ex gratia amounts. Kolhapur district has received Rs 17.42 crore — to be paid directly in the accounts of those affected by the floods. Most farmers are awaiting the compensation for crop damage. Kolhapur district collector Rahul Rekhawar said, “As per primary estimates, the damages worth Rs 1,050 crore have taken place in Kolhapur district alone.” The farmers want the government release the compensation as soon as the assessment is done and not wait for district report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rs-10k-per-family-from-marooned-villages/articleshow/85378732.cms||---

When TOI pointed out the missing online slots, the civic health department late on Monday evening updated the sessions on Cowin system. However, even now, only five centres are offering online appointment for the Covaxin shot. As per the NMC press release issued in the afternoon, first and second dose of Covaxin would be available for 18-45 years group at GMCH, Ambedkar Hospital at Indora, AIIMS Nagpur, Imambada Isolation Hospital, Indira Gandhi Hospital at Gandhi Nagar, NMC Pachpaoli Maternity Home, Pragat Hall at Dighori, and Mahal Diagnotics Centre In the absence of online sessions, citizens preferring free of cost jab of the indigenous vaccine are forced to walk-in at centres and wait in queue for their turn. Earlier, NMC had started Covaxin centres at select locations with GMCH being the only centre for initial months. Later, the vaccine was offered at eight more centres. NMC officials said online slots mostly remain vacant while beneficiaries generally prefer walk-in. “Even if we make online slots available, very few book them. Hence, not much attention was paid to opening the online slots for Covaxin,” they said. GMCH officials said as there is no dearth of Covaxin shots, there has been no problem for walk-in registration. Officials admitted, though, that as Covaxin has shorter gap between two doses, chances of more number of beneficiaries turning up than available stock can’t be ruled out. “If supply is not as per demand, then these centres too may come to a halt,” they said. NMC has over 150 Covishield centres where the vaccination drive repeatedly comes to a halt due to lack of doses. The civic body has been able to continue Covaxin drive without any major glitch. Last month, TOI had reported how NMC restricted the online session to only one slot of two-hour from 11am to 1pm, which too is not finding many takers for Covishield. Compared to this, private vaccination centres have multiple online sessions of 100 to 200 doses from 9am to 9pm for all vaccine brands. Covaxin is the costliest among the three brands offered in private. Meanwhile, the district received doses of Covishield and Covaxin on Monday and they would be available for all eligible beneficiaries on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-begins-online-regn-for-covaxin-shots-at-5-centres/articleshow/85383403.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Chandigarh||Ambala City MC house meeting ends as councillors say it’s getting too long||Ambala: A second meeting of the Ambala City municipal corporation (MC) house, being held six months after the first one was organised in February this year, on Monday ended without a discussion on all agendas as councillors of the BJP had heated arguments with Congress councillor Mithun Verma. After Monday’s meeting, mayor Shakti Rani Sharma of Haryana Jan Chetna Party (HJCP) blamed BJP members for cutting the meeting short. She said they complained of the meeting getting too long. No party is in majority in the Ambala City MC house. In the 20-member house, BJP and HJCP have eight councilors each, and Congress and Haryana Democratic Front have two members each. Sharma is from the HJCP. The meeting started at 9 am and ended after repeated requests by BJP members at 2pm. Earlier, BJP members had arguments with Verma, after he had a spat with a woman member of BJP. Police guards were called due to a protest by BJP members. However, Sharma intervened and the house was set in order, again. “Of 34 points of the last meeting, we had merely crossed 25 of them when they (BJP members) started making continuous excuses that they are hungry or the meeting is getting too long. This is not the way. Parliament sessions go on till night,” Sharma said during her media address. BJP member Hitesh Jain complained of low sugar levels due to a long meeting, a concern endorsed by his fellow counciklors and the meeting was called off. The meeting started with zero hour and every member of the hosue asked two questions each fro municipal commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata and other officials. Drainage and cleanliness issues dominated most of the questions raised during zero hour. Most of the members also objected to an action taken report (ATR) on agendas of the first meeting, presented by Ambala City MC executive officer (EO) Karnail Singh. Members of HJCP also demanded action against executive engineer Raman for no progress on proposals passed by the house in the previous house meeting held in February 2021. The commissioner gave them a warning and an ultimatum of two weeks for clearing pending proposals. Officials from several departments — including public health department, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN), forest and others — were absent from the meeting. Sharma said they will ask higher-ups of the officials about the reason for the absence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ambala-city-mc-house-meeting-ends-as-councillors-say-its-getting-too-long/articleshow/85383364.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||East Delhi civic body adopts a resolution on sealing moratorium till March||NEW DELHI: The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) standing committee has adopted a resolution stating that there should be a moratorium on sealing of houses built till March 2021. The resolution aims to provide relief from demolition or sealing activity to such properties. Officials would also be directed to provide NOC to such properties for water and electricity connections. The resolution was moved by Leader of the House Satyapal Singh arguing that east Delhi was a densely populated area with a large number of people living below the poverty line. Once a property was booked by the corporation due to lack of an approved building plan, it was ineligible for a water connection. The resolution would now be kept in the House meeting. With municipal elections barely a few months away, the issue of sealing of properties is going to be a major issue. The other two civic bodies are likely to follow in EDMC’s footsteps. Data submitted to a special task force showed that 9,250 properties were sealed by the three corporations and other agencies till July 31, 2021. Out of these, 4,357 properties were sealed due to unauthorised construction, while 4,895 were shut due to misuse according to the master plan provisions. In all, 2,708 applications were received for de-sealing, out of which 1,609 were approved for unauthorised construction and 985 for misuse of properties. A large number of properties were also de-sealed after the Supreme Court order clarifying the limit of the monitoring committee. Data showed that 3,660 units had been de-sealed so far. The applications remained pending since the second wave of the pandemic. The three-member monitoring committee has so far approved 712 desealing cases in north corporation areas, 187 properties under South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), 44 under EDMC and 17 in New Delhi Municipal Council areas. The largest proportion of sealed properties lie under SDMC where 2,214 units were sealed and 581 de-sealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-adopts-a-resolution-on-sealing-moratorium-till-march/articleshow/85383440.cms||---

The genome sequencing report of the swab samples sent in July was received on Sunday. All the patients have recovered. District health officer Yogesh Sale said, “Three patients were from Kolhapur city and remaining three were from rural parts of the district. Since March, we were sending 100 randomly-selected samples for genome sequencing every month. We have done contact tracing, testing, isolation and treatment for these patients.” Sale said that five of the six patients had got their first dose of vaccination and one was not vaccinated. One patient had to be hospitalised and needed oxygen. Kolhapur civic authorities said that the patient who had to be put on oxygen support was 62 years old and had co-morbidities. He too has recovered. “There is no difference in the symptoms or treatment. There is no need to panic. We have observed that the new variant seems to spread rapidly but has less mortality rate,” said Sale. With the six new cases, the total Delta+ cases in Kolhapur has gone up to seven. One patient had recovered in April. So far, 76 Delta+ cases have been detected in Maharashtra. Health authorities said that 80% of the samples sent for genome sequencing were reporting the Delta variant still.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/6-more-delta-cases-found-in-kolhapur-all-recovered/articleshow/85378758.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Scarred road surfaces belie NMC claims of repairing 5,465 potholes||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) hotmix department claims to have repaired 5,465 potholes in eight months in the city. But a casual drive across the city will show up the department’s claim as false. One comes across deplorable condition of roads, riddled with potholes and craters, top layer ripped off tar roads, and harried motorists at every corner. The bad condition of roads apparently amounts to contempt of high court by various government agencies including NMC, NHAI, state PWD and NIT, for failing to ensure city roads remain free of potholes. Scarred roads are visible across the city, including many important junctions like Mohammed Rafi Square (in front of the high court), Law College Square, and Ladies Club Square among others. TOI had recently reported that of 2313.65km roads, some 1,491.19km tar roads have either developed potholes or their surface has completely worn off due to non-maintenance. NMC’s hotmix department officials claimed that the condition of tar roads owned by NMC wasn’t as bad as claimed. The roads owned and maintained by other agencies like state PWD, NHAI and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) are in bad shape, they say. “Due to their negligent attitude, the civic body is facing criticism,” the officials claimed. The highest number of complaints attended to by NMC were in Ashi Nagar zone, where the hotmix department claims to have repaired 908 potholes, followed by Laxmi Nagar zone (900), Mangalwari zone (796), and Dharampeth zone (773). Even though NMC is claiming to have been attending to complaints pertaining to potholes by repairing them within 48 hours, motorists from across the city say that pothole repairing mechanism adopted by the civic body is very shoddy. Chandrapal Thakur, a resident of Zingabai Takli, pointed out that recently NMC repaired potholes in their locality. “Due to shoddy work it failed to withstand even moderate vehicular movement, and the road is again marred by potholes of bigger size,” he said. Similar is the grievance of residents of other localities in the city. Senior Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe criticised NMC for the deplorable condition of tar roads across the city. “If roads under Laxmi Nagar zone are in bad shape, which gave two mayors and standing panel chairmen, then one can gauge what might be the condition of other roads across the city,” Gudadhe said. Automobile workshop owners too claimed that maintenance bills of vehicles due to potholed roads in the city have increased. “There is a rise in the number of vehicles needing repairs after being damaged due to bad roads,” said Ravi Parate, workshop manager of an automobile firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/scarred-road-surfaces-belie-nmc-claims-of-repairing-5465-potholes/articleshow/85383384.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Tobacco crop size hiked to 130 million kg for 2021-2022||GUNTUR: The tobacco board has fixed crop size for Andhra Pradesh at 130 million kg for the 2021-22 crop season. The decision was taken at the special board meeting held in virtual mode on Monday. The reasonably decent prices offered by traders for the stock during the current auction season seem to have prompted the board to increase the crop size for the next season, which is nearly 15 million kg increase over last year’s crop size of 115 million kg. Board chairman Yadlapati Raghunatha Babu, who presided over the session, consulted the representatives of growers, traders and exporters before taking the final call on the crop size. Interestingly, the board had increased the crop size for Karnataka in April, upping the crop size to 97 million kg from previous year’s 88 million kg. The board had trimmed the crop size for both AP and Karnataka for 2020-21 crop season following the outbreak of Covid-19. But with entire stock produced by growers consumed by the trade in the last two years, the board has decided to revive the crop size in both states. Meanwhile, the board elected K Vasudeva Rao as vice-chairman for a one-year term at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tobacco-crop-size-hiked-to-130-million-kg-for-2021-22/articleshow/85381107.cms||Samdani MN

The entire ward in the basement of the five-storey building has been given a facelift with walls being painted in bright colours and posters of cartoon characters. A projector will also be set up in the paediatric ward so that the admitted children can watch cartoon movies, etc. A separate space within the ward has been earmarked, where toys would be kept for them. The hospital authorities said a proper ambience is needed to treat the children.Bhujbal expressed satisfaction on seeing the paediatric ward and said the ward has all the needed facilities to provide good treatment to the Covid affected children during the third wave. Jeetendra Dhaneshwar, the nodal officer of the Bytco Hospital, said the painting, toys and all other articles of entertainment for the children have been givent o the hospital by an organisation under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CRS) funds.The 800-bed hospital is now relatively empty with only 35 Covid patients admitted there.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra takes up major challenge to construct bridge, roads in Abujhmadh||NAGPUR: The government is planning to build a major bridge on the Gundenur nullah near Beenagunda, which is part of the Maoist stronghold Abujhmadh, where a pregnant woman had died last year, unable to cross the overflowing rivulet in monsoon. There is also a proposal to construct a 20km road beyond Gundenur nullah till Maharashtra border, to connect Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh in future. The proposed bridge and the road, for which surveys are underway, would bring development to the remotest part of the inhospitable region. More than a half-a-dozen tribal hamlets here get cut off from the rest of the district during monsoon, leading to many deaths without medical assistance and crisis of essential commodities too. This project is part of the four major bridges and 14 smaller ones in Maoist-affected south Gadchiroli sanctioned for development with the initiative of Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari. Public works department’s (PWD) highway division is aiming to complete the major bridge projects on rivers Perimili, Bandeya and Parlakota, costing around Rs175 crore, by next monsoon, along with the 14 smaller bridges at various locations costing around Rs70 crore. The proposed major bridges at Chodampalli and the one on Dena river between Ashti and Alapalli would help to maintain connectivity between Ashti and Alapalli round the year unlike now when it gets cut off during several days in the monsoon. A road and the two bridges in the 45km stretch between Ashti and Alapalli would be constructed with budget of around Rs500 crore. The construction work beyond Beenagunda, which is considered the gateway to Abujhmadh, the location of maximum top Maoists, their arms training camps and manufacturing units, is likely to be a challenge for government agencies. Sources said the survey team under a senior official has already been sternly asked by Maoist representatives to drop the survey and leave the place. Gadchiroli district collector Deepak Singla said the bridge at Gundenur would bring much respite to the tribals staying in the stretch, who are helplessly cut off during monsoon and also remain bereft of development. “We are in the process of constructing major bridges at Chodampalli and also on the Dena River, which will help connectivity and respite during monsoon,” he said. “The detailed project reports are being prepared, which would be followed by tendering process,” he said. Executive engineer Vivek Mishra, who is overseeing the project in south Gadchiroli, said these bridges and roads would boost economic activities just like the development in Sironcha after the construction of the Kaleshwaram bridge. SP Ankit Goyal said government agencies like PWD and police department would coordinate on the security issues as is done in any development work. “The Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) would be followed and it shall be ensured the work is completed as soon as possible,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-takes-up-major-challenge-to-construct-bridge-roads-in-abujhmadh/articleshow/85385478.cms||Soumitra Bose

Every year, on Navroz, a large number of Parsis visit the fire temple at Deolali in the morning, offer prayers and greet one another. However, as the state government is yet to allow reopening of religious places, the Parsi community members could not visit the fire temple this year. Nozer Mehenti, the head priest of the fire temple at Deolali, said, “The Navroz prayers were offered by me and my son — who is the assistant priest — without allowing anyone else inside the temple. We offered prayers to free the country of Covid-19 and solve the problem of unemployment. Every year, Parsis in the Deolali Camp, Nashik Road and Nashik city areas come to the temple. This year, due to the pandemic, all religious places are shit as per government guidelines. Therefore, the celebrations were quiet at the fire temple.” A few community members did come to meet the head priest and the assistant priest to wish them on Navroz. There are about 300 Parsis in Nashik city, Deolali Camp and Nashik Road. Many of them said that Navroz festivities were limited to household celebrations without inviting anyone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashiks-parsi-community-members-celebrate-navroz/articleshow/85378807.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Stating that roads in a few areas were repeatedly laid and renovated, the residents urged the civic body to focus on the peripheral wards as well.The residents of JK Nagar near Khajamalai said that even a minor rainfall can inundate the approach roads to their houses. The swampy roads force the local people to park their cars on the main roads. The residents said that the civic body is shunning new roads as a UGD network is planned in the area. “If not a proper BT road, we at least need a makeshift road to access our houses. Autorickshaws and cabs are refusing to come to the area during the rainy season,” Shabeer Hussain, a resident of Khajamalai, said. The same is the case of roads at Thiruverumbur in ward number 63. The residents said that the civic body fails to consider even a makeshift road. Besides the residential roads, even the arterial roads such as Dharbarmedu Road near the fish market at Gandhi market is in a bad shape with numerous potholes. Those roads were also missed in the development proposal.“In a phased manner, we will repair the damaged roads and proposals for new roads will be made after the UGD work is finished,” a senior corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bad-roads-in-peripheral-wards-omitted/articleshow/85385462.cms||---

A firefighter in the unit said they torched his fire tunic by applying a solution. As he was demonstrating the methods of dousing the fire by rolling on the ground, the fire did not extinguish but it spread to his uniform also. Nagaimugan acted swiftly and took off the fire tunic. His colleagues jumped into action and doused the using a cloth.The mock drill was conducted in the presence of 30 member team led by district fire officer S Karunakaran to show their preparedness for disaster management ahead of the southwest monsoon, to collector S Sivarasu. “Though it was a mock drill, the excess fire made it real. The firefighter sustained no injury as he took all precautionary measures. He is perfectly fit. He even attended another rescue operation,” additional district fire officer Karunakaran told TOI.He added that the incident happened when they were teaching people the ‘stop drop and roll principle’ during the fire accident. The mock drill also covered the precautionary measures to be taken for saving people during flood, electric fire and safety measures to protect people from lightning strike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mock-drill-turns-real-as-fire-spreads-during-demo/articleshow/85385443.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Test positivity drops further, but ‘continue with precautions, get jab to check 3rd wave’||NAGPUR: The test positivity rate (TPR) in August so far has further dropped to 0.12% from 0.34% during the corresponding period of July. Though over 28,000 fewer Covid tests were performed, only 79 people have tested positive while only two deaths have been recorded this month as compared to 310 cases and 13 deaths in first two weeks of July. Interestingly, the four public labs also did not report a single Covid case despite processing a large number of samples on most occasions in the last two weeks. One of them — Nagpur University lab — has also temporarily shut down this month. The promising figures are in no way indicator that a possible third wave may not strike, experts cautioned. In fact, they said, if the district continues to follow precautions beside preferring vaccination, the impact of a possible third wave could be less severe than expected. Some of them also suggested that the administration must place high risk close contacts in institutional quarantine to ensure Covid cases do not spurt. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, who is a member of district Covid task force, said understanding of the pathogen is crucial. “Now there is hardly anyone who doesn’t know about Covid-19. It is utmost important that one should ensure he or she doesn’t get infected. A person should also ensure no one else gets infected because of him or her. There is no upper limit on how many days we need to follow the precautions,” he said. Dr Sarnaik added, “The risk of spurt in cases is till October-end. No one must overlook the projection of third wave. We can subdue the third wave by mitigating the infection. Public education, masking and vaccination hold key now.” Consultant pulmonologist Dr Vikram Rathi said the third wave is expected although not in the scale of second one. “It may be much milder. Since it is one and a half years that we have known Covid, most of us know the basic precautionary measures. Any symptom should be reported to a doctor and patient must isolate quickly unless proven it is not Covid,” he said. Dr Rathi added that since numbers are low, it is easier to compulsorily quarantine Covid patients to curb further spread. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said the nSarsCov-2 is a notorious virus. “Giving up preventive measures of mask, hand hygiene and distancing can prove harmful. It is important to unlock from economic point of view, but safety must remain priority,” he said. Regarding mitigation measures, Dr Gawande said compulsory testing of previous and latest close contacts and investigation are needed in addition to vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/test-positivity-drops-further-but-continue-with-precautions-get-jab-to-check-3rd-wave/articleshow/85383487.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Trichy||Trichy sanctions Rs 42.50cr for developing road network||Trichy: Trichy Corporation, which often draws criticism for its poor road network, has sanctioned Rs 42.50 crore to form and redevelop 49km of road network in the city. The civic body has identified 89 stretches to be developed under eight separate packages.Citing underground drainage (UGD) work, the civic body had delayed and postponed several road development proposals in recent years. A proposal to develop smart roads with duct systems under the smart cities mission was also stated as the reason for the delay. Though the smart road proposal was dropped, the corporation identified road development and relaying work in 25 wards across the four zones. The work includes construction of stormwater drains, cement concrete roads and minor culverts. “We have chosen maximum areas that would not overlap with UGD and water projects that are underway. The civil work for the road development proposal will be executed within six months,” a senior official with the engineering department said. Trichy Corporation has floated a tender for the road proposal.The selection of Thillai Nagar cross streets under the proposal has surprised many since the locality is set to witness UGD replacement work. Corporation officials justified that at such places, the road project will be put on hold until the pipe installation work concludes. The proposal includes 25 new road development works, 21 restorations and improvement works, 19 stormwater drain construction and eight cement concrete roads.Residential localities such as Sanjeevi Nagar, Viswas Nagar, Lingam Nagar and Shanmuga Nagar were given preference in the proposal. A separate package at a cost of Rs 5 crore was allotted to develop and widen roads in Panjappur where the integrated bus terminus is planned. Welcoming the proposal, residents pitched for milling the old road before laying the new road. “Increasing the heights of existing roads will cause inundation,” Vignesh K, a resident of Karumandapam, said.Total project cost: Rs 42.50 croreNumber of packages: 8Duration: 6 monthsWards covered: 25Length of road network covered: 49.26 kmWidth of the road network: 3.85 metres to 10 metresAreas coveredThillai NagarShanmuga NagarPanjappurViswas NagarSrirangam||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-sanctions-rs-42-50cr-for-developing-road-network/articleshow/85385465.cms||Deepak Karthik

The department has asked the Trichy Corporation to prevent the littering of plastic waste into the tank and to change the water periodically.The test report submitted to the civic body has stated that plastic bottles, plastic covers and food waste wrapped in plastic sheets have contaminated the Teppakulam water quality. Thin film of layers in the surface of the water due to the dumping of waste, have affected the oxygen availability to the fish. While the tank has an inlet provision connected with Cauvery water, there is no proper outlet for the tank, sources said. The department instructed the civic body to replace 50% of the water as foul smell is emanating from the tank. “Density of fish was also high. We have suggested reducing the number of fish reared. Preventing plastic pollution and periodically changing the water will prevent such incidents,” a fisheries department official said. “We will clean the tank once a week. We are considering changing the water in a phased manner as per the direction from the fisheries department,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plastic-pollution-caused-fish-deaths-in-teppakulam/articleshow/85385485.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Mumbai||Non-IIT engineering placement: 2021 batch student picked for Rs 58 lakh||MUMBAI: The city’s sought-after non-IIT engineering institutes saw their highest packages going up to Rs 58 lakh in the pandemic year. While an IT student from VJTI, Matunga, was picked for the Rs 58-lakh annual package by Google, institutes like Sardar Patel Institute of Technology and KJ Somaiya College of Engineering saw one student each drawing packages worth Rs 40-42 lakh in 2020-21. While 90-100% IT and computer science (CS) students were placed last year in these colleges, the pandemic may have worsened the scenario for students in civil and production engineering. At VJTI, five students—three from CS and two from IT—bagged offers of over Rs 25 lakh pa. Of these Google and Microsoft picked one student each for Rs 58 and Rs 43 lakh pa, respectively, from the graduating batch of 2021. “The new season for the 2022 batch—who will be graduating in the second year of the pandemic—too kicked off on a good note for us,” said Nitin Gulhane, dean, training and placement, VJTI. The number of students bagging an annual package of Rs 25+ lakh is at 27 so far, and is likely to go up with the recruitment process of firms like Apple, Google and Microsoft in the pipeline, said Gulhane. The highest package so far of Rs 32 lakh was offered by Amazon, but it is likely to touch Rs 60 lakh in the coming months, he added. At Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (SPIT), Andheri, the pandemic seemed to have had no impact. While their highest pay in 2019-20 was Rs 42 lakh, it remained the same even in 2020-21. In fact, the average pay went up from Rs 10.4 lakh to Rs 11 lakh in 2020-21. And the institute is expecting the numbers to only improve this year, said Vinod Sikka, training and plac-ement head, SPIT. “The highest offer so far is at Rs 30.5 lakh from PhonePe, and is expected to go up in anticipation of recruitment process by companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook.” SPIT offers courses in circuit branches of engineering. Other sought-after institutes, including DJ Sanghvi (Vile Parle), KJ Somaiya (Vidyavihar) and Thadomal Shahani College of Engineering (Bandra), are also expecting this placement season to be better than the first year of the pandemic. At DJ Sanghvi, three students were picked for the highest pay of Rs 26 lakh by Morgan Stanley from the graduating batch of 2021, and the same numbers are picked even from the 2022 batch for the same pay, said principal, Hari Vasudevan. Around 144 of the 426 students from the 2022 batch are already placed. Principal of Thadomal Shahani College of Engineering, GT Thampi, said many IT and consulting firms have already announced their hiring plans and opportunities seem promising for the current batch too. Infosys and TCS have already announced their plans to hire over 35,000 freshers from Indian ca-mpuses, he added. The highest package received at the institute is currently at Rs 19.6 lakh fr-om Deutsche Bank. Mahesh Patil, training and placement officer at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering, said the average pay offered at the institute went up marginally in the pandemic year. This year, 106 students were placed in just three weeks, a record for the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/non-iit-engg-placement-21-batch-student-picked-for-rs-58l-in-mumbai/articleshow/85386550.cms||Yogita Rao

The deceased woman, identified as Bharati Gaund, has suffered 90% burns, said investigating officer API S B Chopade. Gaund had been rushed to the Nashik Civil Hospital, but she did not respond to the treatment and died at 7.20 pm on Sunday, added Chopade.

Both had suffered moderate burn injuries during the incident. Chopade said that the accused autorickshaw driver would now be booked for murder. Earlier, he had been booked for an attempt to murder. As per the complaint registered with the Panchavati police station by Sushila, Bharati had come to her flat at 12 noon on Tuesday when the accused autorickshaw driver accosted her and started an argument. The autorickshaw driver slapped Bharati and told her to step outside with him. When Bharati refused, he poured a kerosene-like substance on her and set her on fire. He then fled. Sushila managed to douse the fire and Bharati was taken to the Civil hospital. Later in the day, the Panchavati police tracked down the autorickshaw driver to his relative’s residence. However, since he too had suffered burns, he was also hospitalized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-woman-set-ablaze-succumbs/articleshow/85378824.cms||---

On Monday, the state reported 4,145 cases and 100 deaths and Mumbai reported only 195 cases and three deaths were registered, but health officials admitted that the low numbers could be the result of fewer-than-usual tests conducted on Sunday. While the city has been managing 35,000 tests a day, only 26,484 tests were done on Sunday due to lower availability of health staff. The total cases in state stood at 63.96 lakh and deaths rose to 1,35,139. While the total cases in Mumbai touched 7.39 lakh, 15,984 deaths have been recorded so far. “There is no doubt that the second wave has died down, but the trickle of cases continues and that is a cause for worry,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state government’s Covid task force. If people don’t follow Covid-appropriate rules, the third wave could begin sooner than expected. “With the beginning of unlocking, we have to be cautious. The trend over the next few three weeks will be crucial,” he said. Thane saw the daily positivity rate overshoot 2% on Monday, a first since the last one week, government statistics revealed. As per data, the city saw 42 people infected of the 2,062 tested on Monday, taking the daily positivity rate to 2%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lowest-single-day-tally-of-covid-cases-in-city/articleshow/85383476.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Coaching institutes meet with guardian minister, push for reopening||NAGPUR: Coaching institutes in the district met guardian minister Nitin Raut a few days ago to push for reopening of their establishments. Institute owners say they feel ‘cheated’ after Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) granted them permission to reopen on August 9 and cancelled it within three days. Rajnikant Bondre, president of Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI) said, “We had a long discussion with the guardian minister who too agreed with our stand about reopening. The minister said that the situation of Mumbai and Nagpur cannot be treated at the same level as cases here are very less. We are maintaining Level 1 for so many weeks now, yet restrictions are similar to those cities where cases are coming out in double digits.” Senior academic and executive member of ACI Sameer Phale feels the government must give complete freedom to local authorities. “I fail to understand why the rules of Mumbai and Pune to Nagpur? The local officials are better informed and aware of the ground reality. They can anticipate and plan for all contingencies in a dynamic manner by keeping track of the number of cases or any other parameter set by the government. As of now, Nagpur is a fit case of reopening of coaching institutes and we hope the government hears our requests,” said Phale. Another coaching institute owner, who did not wish to be identified, said the state government’s functioning is ‘illogical’. “I wonder if the people in Mumbai have any connection whatsoever with ground reality. Anyone with even an iota of common sense will say that kids who have permission to enter a shopping mall, visit restaurants, attend marriages, check-in at a resort or attend schools, can also go to a coaching institute. This bizarre decision of these so-called policy makers, is simply exposing their illogical planning,” said the institute owner. Probably understanding the need of ‘strength in numbers’, a state level body of coaching institutes is all set to be formed within the next 10 days. Sources in the coaching field say that a national level body will register its Maharashtra affiliate, to which all small coaching associations will then get attached. A meeting related to this is scheduled in Pune this week itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coaching-institutes-meet-with-guardian-minister-push-for-reopening/articleshow/85385517.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Thiruvananthapuram||KSEB plans global tender for plant conversion||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has decided to explore the possibility of converting the almost-defunct diesel power plants —Brahmapuram and Kozhikode— to LNG stations or the like using the existing infrastructure facilities. A full-board meeting of the board on July 29 decided to invite a global tender to carry forward the proposal. Both the plants set up in the 1990s failed to meet the purpose owing to the exorbitant cost of power generation using low sulphur heavy stock (LSHS), a residue processed from crude oil. KDPP, a thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 128MW, operates in 26.8acre at Nallalam in Kozhikode district. The 106.6MW Brahmapuram diesel power plant is situated in Kunnathunadu taluk in Kochi in an area of 96.33acre and it consists of five generating units of 21.32MW each. At the review meeting on July 29, it was directed to explore the feasibility of converting both KDPP & BDPP into LNG-based plants to generate power within the state. “The global tenders to be invited for converting and operating both the plants with LNG as fuel or any mode of power generation and purchase of power through tariff-based competitive bidding is proposed. The existing assets and infrastructure of KSEBL at both KDPP and BDPP could be fully utilized for the above purpose. The tariff arrived at, if found reasonable, shall be utilized by KSEBL for power procurement. Since tenders are invited through expression of interest, no financial implication is involved,” stated an order issued by the board on August 10. KDPP project started its commercial operation in 1999. It has generated 4,629MU of power so far. A fuel supply agreement was executed with BPCL on January 30, 1999 that expired in 2016. Also two diesel generator sets were decommissioned in 2014. The last commercial operation at the plant was done during December 2020 to February 2021. Presently, a bare minimum stock of fuel is only available at KDPP as the production of LSHS has been completely stopped by the oil refineries in Kerala. Of the five generating units of Brahmapuram diesel power plant, four of them were commissioned in 1997 and the fifth unit in 1998. The plant uses diesel for engine start-and-stop functions and mainly the engine runs on LSHS. Among the five generating units, two were decommissioned in 2014 due to non-availability of critical spares, ageing of crank shaft and other mechanical complaints. The decommissioned machines were scrapped, and presently only three units are available at the station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kseb-plans-global-tender-for-plant-conversion/articleshow/85381227.cms||B S Anilkumar

They were also booked under Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act.In their petitions, they stated that based on the order of the Supreme Court, Sterlite plant was producing oxygen till July 31, for the benefit of the people during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. They stated that on July 20, several people gathered in huge numbers and went on a procession and submitted a representation to the collector urging the state government to take steps for early closure of the plant.The petitioners stated that on July 28 few people gathered with an intention to submit a representation to the authorities seeking to continue oxygen production at the plant. While the police had aided the protestors to submit representations to the authorities on July 20, they had strangely taken a contrary view that the gathering of the persons on July 28 was unlawful assembly and registered cases. Employees of the plant were also booked based on the alleged confessions of those who participated in the gathering.They stated that people gathering seeking to continue the oxygen production cannot be construed as unlawful assembly. Stating that they had not violated any law, the petitioners sought to quash the FIRs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/interim-stay-on-trials-in-firs-against-assemblers-at-sterlite/articleshow/85383507.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Wining & dining get a 2.5-hour, late pack-up boost||KOLKATA: Dinner was back on the table as restaurants and pubs were happy to serve patrons and guests till 10.30pm, for the first time in four months. At 8pm on Monday, Sumouli Datta, Chandana Bakshi and Parbati Ray — once school friends and now in their 40s — were at SKAI in Quest Mall, taking selfies and enjoying their favourite lamb taquitos, popcorn parfait, crispy avocado and pink peppercorn with garlic malai chicken without any rush to head back home. “It’s great to be back for dine-outs. Nothing makes a good friend get-together livelier than a good dinner. We generally meet after our day’s work and hence the 8pm deadline was hampering our meeting times as well. But nothing could stop us on Monday as we stayed back late at the restaurant, savouring good food and an evening full of adda,” said Datta, who works at a private firm. The state government had on Friday issued a relaxation order for restaurants and bars, retail shops and other retail establishments. According to the order, all shops and establishments, including restaurants and bars, which had been allowed to remain upto 8pm till Sunday, were asked to keep usual working hours till 10.30pm. The night restrictions will be in place from 11pm, which will allow diners to head home before the curbs set in. At Bombay Brasserie in Ballygunge, a family of 11 was having dinner at 9pm together for the first time since the pandemic had set in. “We celebrated my birthday and it was the first dine-out for my 77-year-old father since the pandemic. This time suits us as we can finish our work-from-home schedule and come for a good time for 4-5 hours. Further, with the night restrictions timing pushed back, we don’t even have the guilt of breaking the law as we drive back home after dinner,” said Manish Damani, a resident of central Kolkata. Another diner, Neha Tibrewal, said during the 8pm closure for restaurants, dining out was rather a compulsion and she preferred to order food at home during dinner. “But not anymore. I was out with my family on the first day of relaxation,” said Tibrewal. Restaurateurs and pub owners were happy with the initial response and said they were looking forward to the weekend. “Extending the closure time from 8pm to 10.30pm has come as a big relief to the food and beverage industry. The industry will survive and be up and going soon,” said Suresh Poddar, president of the Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India. While the rise in footfall excited hoteliers, sticking to Covid protocols topped their priorities, they said. “We have been working with 50% occupancy for dine-in at all our brand restaurants. All our staff are vaccinated and we are taking utmost sanitization measures. The new timing for dine-in till 10.30pm allows us a wider window to cater to our guests more comfortably and let them enjoy their meal in a relaxed manner,” said Gautam Singh, operations head at Global Kitchens Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wining-dining-get-a-2-5-hr-late-pack-up-boost/articleshow/85381206.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The malls' administration had deployed adequate staff to ensure the visitors understand the terms and conditions laid down by the government and cooperate to maintain safety for all. “The entry points are always marked by the security personnel. We have added the number to make sure the vaccination status of every visitor is checked and ensure they allow only the eligible ones, after thermal scanning,” said one of the officials of a mall, preferring anonymity. The officer of another mall said they had made meticulous planning to limit the number by reducing the parking space by 50% for four-wheelers and two-wheelers. “We have installed cameras that give us the count of people entering and leaving the premises. This gives us the exact number of people in the mall at a given time and helps us curb the entries,” the officer said. About the footfalls after the opening of malls, the authorities said it was encouraging. “We have a festive season ahead. We have stores offering attractive discounts. Also, the number of people vaccinated is increasing in the district. Besides, with the safety measures undertaken by us, we hope to see more customers soon,” the officer added. Restaurants start operating from SundayThe restaurants that began their operations on Sunday are also witnessing a good footfall of the Nashik residents.

The petitioner stated that 39 revenue villages come under the RS Mangalam taluk. He stated that there is only a UPHC at RS Mangalam with six doctors, two nurses and 20 beds.The petitioner stated that since there are several fishermen villages, there is a need for establishing a taluk hospital as the people are experiencing difficulties as they have to travel for nearly 35km to reach the Ramanathapuram district government headquarters hospital. There has also been a shortage of healthcare workers and equipment at the headquarters hospital and necessary steps should be taken to fill up the vacancies and to provide sufficient equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-upgrade-uphc-into-taluk-hosp/articleshow/85383521.cms||---

Now it is necessary to work on the three areas of noise, water and air pollution,” he said. According to Gadkari, NMC should prepare a plan to get rid of pollution in Nagpur city in the next five years. With the initiative of the corporators, about five lakh trees should be planted every year to make Nagpur the number one city in terms of greenery and being environment-friendly, he said. Gadkari said that NMC has set many records in terms of the environment. Already, the NMC is supplying 320MLD treated sewerage water to the power station and is generating Rs 60 crore per annum. The addition of 12 mini STPs in gardens is another achievement for the NMC, which will treat 105MLD sewage water per day, he pointed out. The minister also appreciated mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and executive engineer (public health engineering) Shweta Banerjee for this project. He also mentioned the Rs 2,400 crore Nag river pollution abatement project. In the future, most of the playgrounds and parks will be maintained through treated sewage water, he said. Leader of Opposition in the state legislature Devendra Fadnavis said that 90% of water pollution was due to discharge of sewage in the city’s water bodies and 10% was due to industrial waste. Gadkari successfully implemented the PM Narendra Modi-launched Namami Ganga programme due to which the Ganga looked clean for the first time after the Kumbh Mela this year, he said. Mayor Tiwari, deputy mayor Manisha Dhawde, MLC Pravin Datke, ruling party leader Avinash Thakre, water works committee chairman Sandip Gawai and Vijay Zalke were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/go-for-green-hydrogen-gadkari-tells-nmc/articleshow/85383577.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The state government is supposed to increase DA whenever the Union government does, according to an agreement between the TNGEA and Tamil Nadu government when M G Ramachandran was chief minister.State general secretary of Tamil Nadu revenue officials association, M P Murugaian said that the Union government that froze DA from January 2019 has announced revised DA at 28% from last month. But the state government has postponed it by eight months, due to which employees are losing around 10% of their salary for this period.TNGEA Trichy district vice-president V Mohan said that this agreement has not been honoured this time by delaying the increase of DA. “Our association will decide on our next move in the executive committee meeting to be held in Erode on August 21,” he added.The protesters also sought scrapping of the contributory pension scheme that is in effect from 2004 and introduce the old pension scheme. Their other demand included releasing the Rs 25 lakh compensation for the kin of frontline workers who died in the second wave of Covid-19.

---||Kolkata||Return of patrons, new release line-up rekindle hope at Kolkata cinema halls||KOLKATA: Devils and ghosts have managed to ward off the eerie silence at Kolkata cinemas. Exhibitors are happy that the viewers have slowly started returning to theatres despite the weather condition and the lure of OTT releases. According to regional director at INOX (East) Amitava Guha Thakurta, it was “encouraging to witness an increase in footfall during the I-Day weekend”. “This gives us strong hopes for the coming week. The good turnout for cinemas indicates that the appetite and passion is intact despite the pandemic. With ‘Bell Bottom’ scheduled to release on August 19, the occupancies are only going to get better,” he said. Navina’s owner Navin Choukhani, who had earlier told TOI that he is not keen on opening his theatre in August, is happy to have reversed his decision for his 821-seater. Currently, 410 seats are available for booking and is running three shows of ‘The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It’. “We had 31 people on Friday. The number increased to 50 on Saturday. On Sunday, it reached 125. People had lost the habit of going to cinemas. Under such circumstances, this is an encouraging figure in the opening week. I have agreed to the distributor’s terms and will be screening Akshay Kumar’s movie from Thursday,” he said. The buzz about movies has also prompted independent film-maker Amartya Bhattacharyya to go for a theatrical release of ‘Runanubandha’ on Monday at Cinepolis Lake Mall. “It is difficult to release independent movies that don’t have any backing. The response on I-Day weekend has prompted us to release our film now,” Bhattacharyya said. Director Atanu Ghosh, who was earlier unsure of a theatrical release of his new film starring Jaya Ahsan and Ritwik Chakraborty, is happy with the renewed interest. “The general interest has given us the boost to release ‘Binisutoy’ now and even host a premiere at Nandan on Friday,” Ghosh said. The availability of content means good news for exhibitors. Debjiban Basu of Basusree told TOI that the theatre which shut on April 22 and will be reopening on August 19. “We will reopen on Thursday with three shows of Akshay Kumar’s movie,” he said. Menoka’s owner Pranab Kumar Roy is pinning his hopes on that. “Considering that the weather conditions weren’t good, it’s a good sign that no shows were cancelled because of a lack of audience. Unlike the last time of reopening, we have content now,” Roy said. Exhibitor Satadeep Saha said, “The advance booking is good for ‘Bell Bottom’. We might be releasing it in over 100 halls in Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/return-of-patrons-new-release-line-up-rekindle-hope-at-city-cinema-halls/articleshow/85381253.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata mall business soars as end-of-season sale, Independence-Day weekend push up footfall||KOLKATA: Leading city malls have witnessed the best-ever weekend — that concluded with Independence Day — post the pandemic, both in terms of footfall and sales. The conversion rate of footfalls to sales was high as serious buyers thronged the malls. In case of some malls, sales over the last weekend were even comparable to the pre-pandemic level. The end-of-season sales have also helped the malls in pushing up the business. South City Mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree, the largest mall in the city, pointed out that it had the best footfall on August 15 since the reopening of malls on June 15. There has been a 40%-50% jump in sales. “The sales were almost 70% of the pre-Covid level. Considering that we could operate with up to 50% of the peak crowd capacity, it was very good. The conversion of footfall to sales was quite high,” he said. TimesViewThe easing of restrictions should help malls and the retail sector. But everyone should keep following all the Covid norms to keep the virus’s spread in check. According to Bagree, more than 10,000 cars were parked at South City during the weekend. On Sunday alone, the number was 4,200. Total footfall this weekend was more than 1.5 lakh at South City. “We are hoping for even a better weekend this week with extended hours of operations and opening of multiplexes,” he added. Acropolis Mall GM K Vijayan pointed out that the footfall and sales soared largely due to the end-of-season sales and Independence Day offers. The footfall was at its peak in Acropolis Mall on the 75th Independence Day as it touched the 25,000 mark . “This Sunday was the best since the restrictions were lifted and people went out to celebrate Independence Day with their families. Food court and gaming zone saw maximum guests. Children thronged the Timezone that has reopened. The reopening of multiplex also contributed to the uptick in the sales,” he said. According to Vijayan, foodies came in large numbers to their favourite fine-dining restaurants and bars. The apparel category clocked impressive sales as the brands doled out end-of-season sales and it was the last day of the offer. Quest vice-president Sanjiv Mehra is hoping the footfall to rise to 6 lakh in August to 4 lakh in July. “The footfall is rising every weekend,” he added. Ambuja Neotia Group director Ramesh Pandey said that the footfall in City Centre 1 & City Centre 2 was exceptionally good last weekend. The garments, cosmetics and lifestyle segments did extremely good business. Also, the fine-dinning business was so far the best post-2019. The sales during the last weekend was Rs 4 crore in City Centre 1 and Rs 3.4 crores in City Centre 2. While the footfall in City Centre 1 was 78,000, it was 607000 in City Centre 2.

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Mahatma Gandhi practised what he preached, says Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi||KOZHIKODE: Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi began his two-day tour of his constituency on Monday by unveiling a statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Gandhi Park in Mananthavady. He said that the powerful thing about Mahatma Gandhi was that he put into action whatever he had said. “If Gandhiji said India should be a tolerant country, he behaved in a tolerant way. If he said India should treat its women with respect, he treated women with respect. If he said India should be a secular country, he behaved in a secular manner,” Rahul said, after unveiling the statue. Drawing a contrast, Rahul, said that today one can hear of people who say that they want a country that is fair and then they treated others unfairly. “They say that they want an India that respects women and then they themselves disrespect women. Then they say they want a secular country and then inside themselves they view religions differently,” he said. The statue was built by sculptor KKR Vengara. Rahul had lunch with students from the tribal community who had cracked the Common Law Admission Test. During the day, Rahul inaugurated the dental unit at the family health centre at Noolpuzha and handed over physiotherapy equipment at the centre. He also inaugurated the drinking water project at Kattunayikka tibal colony at Ponkuzhi and at Padinjarathatra. He was received at Calicut International Airport by opposition leader V D Satheeshan, Kozhikode MP M K Raghavan among other leaders. Rahul will hold a meeting with Wayanad district collector Dr Adeela Abdulla on Tuesday and will inaugurate a farmers’ meet at North Karassery in Kozhikode district and will attend programmes at Wandoor and Edavanna.

Justice Rekha Palli issued notices to the central government, through the Union ministry of home affairs, the AAP government in Delhi and the New Delhi Municipal Council on a petition by two residents of NDMC area. The court asked the authorities to file their replies within four weeks and listed the matter for January 12. Petitioners Ganga Ram and Pawan Thapliyal said they were aggrieved due to the failure on the part of NDMC in discharging its obligatory and discretionary functions in terms of the provisions of the NDMC Act. Appearing for them, advocate Amit Sahni contended that even though the Act clearly mandates that the Council should consist of 13 members, NDMC is functioning with nine members as the central government is yet to nominate four members. The Centre opposed the plea, arguing that petitioners ought to have filed a PIL. To this, Sahni submitted that the petitioners are also aggrieved party as they are residents of NDMC area. The court, however, asked why should NDMC not have its full strength of the quorum and added that it needs to see what Section 4 of NDMC Act mandates about nomination of members by the central government. NDMC, on its part, maintained that it was functioning well and opposed the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-asks-centre-and-delhi-govt-to-respond-to-petition-over-quorum-in-ndmc/articleshow/85383624.cms||---

If there is no rain in the near future, then there will be no alternative other than reserving water for drinking only,” said Alkha Ahirrao, the superintendent engineer of WRD, Nashik. The WRD has sounded an alert about lowering the consumption of water. “During the last year, the water in the Gangapur Dam complex, which provides water to Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) was also on the lower side, though we have a better picture now. But overall storages are not encouraging,” she said. The water is reserved for drinking based on October 15 storage levels every year. This reservation is marked till July 31, the next year. “Now the period of the quota of water reserved for drinking purpose last year has ended. The current consumption is being measured for the usage in October 2021- July 2022 period and hence the water saved now would benefit everybody in the next summer,” Ahirrao said. She said the situation depended on the weather system and if the district gets rain, as it received last year post-August, the situation could be far better. “There are reports from the weather department states that the situation is likely to change a bit from August 21. Last year, the water storage was 59% across all dams. Good rain led to the increase in the level to 95% and more. We are hoping for the repeat of the event,” said another officer from the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/wrd-sounds-alert-for-irrigation-dept-in-nashik/articleshow/85378840.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Pune: Cooped up at home for long, citizens make most of weekend relaxations||PUNE: Tourist spots, malls and restaurants reclaimed a chunk of their lost footfalls on the first long weekend after the further easing of Covid restrictions, with several hotels in destinations like Mahabaleshwar and Lonavla reporting 100% bookings on Saturday and Sunday. Cab service providers said there was a considerable rise in their bookings too, with all available cars booked for the weekend to destinations around Pune, Goa and Shirdi. “Lonavla, Karjat, Mahabaleshwar, Goa and Alibaug, witnessed an increase in weekend rush with hotels in Mahabaleshwar and Lonavla recording full occupancy on the weekend. Many tourists also booked private villas and bungalows for the long-awaited outing,” Vikas Agarwal, director, VT Travel, told TOI. Poona Hoteliers’ Association (PHA) president Sharan Shetty said hotels in Pune have also started getting corporate enquiries for rooms, as well as queries for banquets for evening functions, as the deadline for such events now stands at 10pm, instead of 4pm earlier. “Wedding enquiries have also started coming in. However, room bookings in the city were low this weekend but we expect them to increase in the coming days,” he said. Girish Makhijani, owner of Hare Krishna Comfort Tours, Pune, said, “Cab bookings had touched almost pre-Covid levels at some firms during the weekend as demand for cabs was high and many service providers had closed down due to losses in the industry over the last one year and more. All cars were booked, top spots being Mahabaleshwar and Goa. Despite the RT-PCR requirement in Goa, and some points in Lonavla shut, tourists were visiting these destinations. In fact, I had to hire some cabs from outside my firm as the cars I owned were already booked from Friday till Monday.” Footfalls surged in malls, especially on August 15, despite the clause on allowing only fully vaccinated visitors inside. Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer, Amanora Mall and member, Shopping Centres Association of India, told TOI, “Instances of youngsters without double vaccination arguing with mall authorities for forced entry were also reported by some establishments on Sunday. There was also waiting outside some malls after the 50% capacity inside was filled up, and people were then told to wait their turns outside. Footfalls were especially high between 3-8pm on Sunday. Most who could enter were from 40-plus age group as many from this age bracket are now fully vaccinated.” Business in mall food courts also picked up immensely, said sources, especially with operational deadline for malls being extended to 10pm. Malls said that they had to turn down many people from entering on account of they being partially vaccinated. Restaurants too were filled to their capacity (50% seating allowed), with reports of some stopping their online food delivery orders to cope with the dine-in requests. The owner of an upscale restaurant in Koregaon Park said, “We did decent business on all days, including Monday, which was a holiday too due to Parsi New Year. We had waiting outside the restaurant as many were just walking in. It was more than what was expected in terms of footfalls. Certain restaurants had to stop food deliveries as they had to cope up with the incoming patrons first with very limited staff.” “Over the weekend, we had more crowd compared to weekdays but it was still less than 50% of pre-Covid time. All our staffers are fully vaccinated, and we are following all safety protocols of sanitisation and social distancing. We do not allow customers entry without masks, and tell them to wear it correctly because some of them pull it down to speak to the staff,” said Naresh Chautala, a garment shopowner.

The governor hoisted the flag at Raj Bhavan and the Speaker of the state assembly at Rewa while chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan joined the celebrations at the historic Lal Parade Grounds in Bhopal. Children were conspicuous by their absence from the Independence Day functions organised in schools as their participation in the Independence Day function had been prohibited due to the Corona pandemic.

Constructed with Rs 44 lakh from the MPLADs fund, the facility will help in bringing down the pollution in the tank.HR&CE had taken up working on the Saravanapoigai tank, spread over 5.5 acres and depth of 12 feet, to offer a clean ambience for devotees to perform rituals. The tank holds water throughout the year as run-off water from the Thiruparankundram hills fills it. However, as local people used it for bathing and washing clothes using soap and detergents, it got polluted, decreasing the dissolved oxygen in the water, affecting aquatic life in the tank.Water analysis done by TWAD and TNPCB showed that e-coli levels in the water were within the permissible levels. Scientists including J Daniel Chellappa, a nuclear scientist, suggested that the water could be purified if the pollution through bathing and washing was controlled.Following this, steps were taken to construct 14 bathrooms and four toilets each for men and women, and also washing and drying areas for clothes on 4,500 square feet area near the tank. Water and lighting facilities have also been provided. Chellappa said that the dissolved oxygen level in the tank can be increased by using a motor to pump in air at the bottom of the tank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/washing-bathing-yard-opened-near-water-tank/articleshow/85383620.cms||---

Schools’ administration have been asked to register their National Informatics Centre (NIC) ID in Shala Darpan as a routine process, but those students will not be made permanent. During the pandemic, many students found it difficult to pay private schools’ fees and private schools were said to have allegedly harassed them. Hence, government issued a rule to admit students without transfer certificates temporarily, in government schools. But government has made it clear that those students will not be enrolled in scholar register i.e. enrollment register. This has come as relief to private school owners who had complained earlier that giving admission to students without transfer certificates will impact them. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar, has also objected to this rule. “Anyway private schools have faced immense pressure during the pandemic due to the fee issue and now with this rule, parents can send their children to government school and when schools re-open, they will send them back to private schools. We would have faced losses, but with this clause of temporary admission, I hope things will be under control,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/admission-to-govt-schools-without-tc-not-final/articleshow/85383649.cms||---

The Pune railway division wrote to the district administration on Monday seeking clarity. Pune divisional railway manager Renu Sharma said train services can be restarted for the fully vaccinated, but the district administration must provide directions on travel passes. “It is only on the basis of passes that tickets can be provided,” said Sharma. “The Mumbai pattern can be followed easily and if required, we will provide district authorities space at stations to open counters. Our job is to run the trains and we are ready,” Sharma told TOI. The district administration said that the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies have been instructed to start issuing passes to fully vaccinated citizens. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar confirmed to TOI that help desks will be set up at railway stations. “People can apply for passes there,” he said. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that a decision will be taken by Tuesday.  “Various departments are just shifting responsibility or waiting for each other,” said regular train commuter Sudam Garve, who is now forced to take a bus from Pune to Khedgaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/local-trains-yet-to-begin-amid-travel-pass-delays-for-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85383616.cms||Joy Sengupta

However, they called for steep penalties for those not following Covid norms. Mumbai has 860 gardens, 318 grounds and beach fronts at Girgaum, Dadar, Versova, Juhu, Aksa and Gorai. Zahida Banatwala from the Juhu Citizens’ Welfare Group, which manages the 65,000 sq ft Gandhigram garden, said many senior citizens had wanted the garden to be open for longer hours. “Our hands were tied as civic rules did not permit it. We are happy with the new order,” she said. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria called it a catch-22 situation, saying while there were requests for such spaces to be kept open for longer hours, bigger crowds would be difficult to control. “Citizens must be cautious as no one wants another lockdown. It’s of utmost importance that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed by visitors to these open spaces,” he said. Juhu corporator Renu Hansraj said such places were open to people from all strata of society. “These being free, no one hesitates to visit them for walks or recreation, so people wanted them to be opened,” she said. The state government, which is still to decide on Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan and Zoo (Byculla zoo), has cleared the reopening of most sectors from Sunday, but only with fully vaccinated workforce. Business owners have appealed to the government to reverse this rule. As for the zoo, which was shut a second time on April 4, officials said crowd control would be difficult with over 10,000 visitors during weekends. City principals said at their meetings with education officials, it was indicated that reopening schools may not be possible before November. Principals, teachers and academicians say schools should reopen at least for Stds X and XII. “Students taking boards should be allowed to come to schools for practicals. A beginning has to be made,” educationist Francis Joseph said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-hail-garden-timing-change-but-say-caution-a-must/articleshow/85383663.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Vadodara||Politicians may be involved in the PMAY scam: Police||Vadodara: Investigations into the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) beneficiaries’ list scam has revealed that a senior Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) official had given instructions to the accused to change the names. Crime branch sleuths said that one of the accused Pramod Vasava, an executive engineer, had asked software expert Nishith Pithva to alter the list. Both were arrested last week after VMC filed a complaint against them. “During the questioning, it appeared that Vasava asked Pithva to change the names in the list of beneficiaries,” said a crime branch official. The police said that there are chances of involvement of politicians in the scam who may have asked the accused to alter the names. Both Vasava and Pithva were produced before a local court on Monday after their three-day remand ended. The cops had sought further remand of two days but it was rejected by the court and the duo was sent to judicial custody. VMC city engineer Shailesh Mistry had last week filed a complaint of criminal breach of trust by public servant and forgery against Vasava and Pithva after the civic body learnt that they had changed the list of beneficiaries of PMAY. The beneficiaries under PMAY were selected in a computer draw organized on August 7 as a part of the completion of five years of Vijay Rupani government. The draw was done to allot 382 housing units at an event held at Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh. The accused duo clandestinely changed the names of the beneficiaries and uploaded a fraudulent list on VMC’s website. Pithva blamed Vasava and said that the latter asked him to change the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/politicians-may-be-involved-in-the-pmay-scam-police/articleshow/85381349.cms||---

The station has recorded 63.2 mm rainfall in August so far as against the normal 142.4mm. However, the Met department says since moderate showers are expected this month, the situation in Safdarjung is likely to improve. The city is likely to receive rain from Thursday. The department has issued an ‘orange’ alert for Friday. India Meteorological Department’s data (IMD) shows that in August, the city has received 63.2mm rainfall in five days of rain. The normal rainfall for the entire month of August is 247.7 mm. No rain has been recorded in the observatory since August 10, while showers are unlikely over the next two days. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said, “There are chances of one or two spells of moderate rain in the month and it is expected that the condition of Safdarjung may improve by the month-end. Light rain may lash the city on some days too.” According to IMD, Safdarjung recorded excess rain in the month of July at 141%. It received 507.1mm rainfall as opposed to the normal of 210.6mm rainfall. However, June stared at a deficit of 47%. It was near normal in August last year as Safdarjung received 237 mm rainfall as opposed to the normal mark of 247.7 mm rainfall. The Met department said the rain activity was likely to resume in the capital from Thursday with the forecast of light rain. However, the rain activity is likely to intensify on Friday and an ‘orange’ alert has been sounded for the city. “Due to the cyclonic disturbance over south-west Uttar Pradesh and north-west Madhya Pradesh, moderate rain is forecast in Delhi on Friday. Besides, the wind direction on Friday may change to easterly, which brings moisture,” said Srivastava. However, light to moderate rain is predicted for Saturday and light rain or thundershowers for Sunday. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature rose to 37.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal, on Monday. The minimum temperature was recorded at 27.3 degrees Celsius, one notch above normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 77% and 45%.

---||Goa||Goa: Despite robust vax drive, many wary of second dose||PANAJI: Although the directorate of health services (DHS) had estimated that a majority of Goa’s population would be fully inoculated against Covid-19 by October-November, vaccine hesitancy — particularly among the elderly — has hindered several from taking their second dose despite having completed the mandatory 84 days since getting the first one. Mapusa resident Rita D’Souza, who is over 70 years old, is among these. “She is very scared. She had taken the first dose of the vaccine after much persuasion, and is just not willing to get her second shot now,” her daughter Victoria, said. Malini Naik, a senior citizen who got her first dose during the second half of March, took her second jab, albeit reluctantly, just last week. She said she lost interest in getting inoculated when her husband died of the coronavirus. After developing a severe reaction to the first shot of the vaccine and being indisposed for a week, Ramesh Salgaonkar, another senior citizen, said he was not sure if he would like to take the second dose despite over 10 weeks having lapsed since he took the first one. As per the current guidelines of the central government, the gap between the first and the second dose has to be 12-16 weeks. District immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said the department hasn’t yet compiled data of people experiencing vaccine hesitancy, although some cases have been noted. He said there would be clarity after more people are immunised. “We have come to know of such people and when questioned, they say they will take the second dose. But we can’t administer the vaccine to them forcefully,” he said. “So far, we haven’t received any guidelines from the Centre stating that the second dose should not be given to those reporting late. Whoever comes even after 100 days of taking the first jab are immunised. People should take their second dose within the given time frame. Else, if there is a third wave, they will be more susceptible to infection.” Goa reported over 65,000 cases of Covid-19 in May alone as the second wave of the pandemic touched a new high. Borkar, however, said a majority of recipients are yet to complete four months since they took their first dose and that the immunisation drive has been progressing at a satisfactory pace. “About 90% of the target population has been vaccinated with the first dose. Several people were infected in May, and consequently, their immunisation has been deferred,” he said. With regards to inoculation of foreigners, the state is yet to receive guidelines from the Centre, he said.

The last tourist season, government had offered a 50% reduction in licence fees to beach shacks due to the pandemic. Close to 350 beach shacks are set up along the 105-km-long coastline. The society has submitted a memorandum to chief minister Pramod Sawant as well as tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar that they are given relief for the season that is set to start in the next two months. A beach shack licence is issued for three years, renewable every season during the validity period. Allottees are able to set up shacks only after the licence is renewed, and space is marked in September-October, that’s the beginning of the season. “After the news of the pandemic broke out, and with lockdown, all were compelled to shut their businesses two months before the season could end. The second season was not any better as everybody struggled to deal with the pandemic. Many have not been able to recover even the cost of investments,” said Cruz Cardozo, president of SOWS. After a slow start to the 2020-2021 season, tourist activities were thrown open in October-November, and domestic flow peaked in December-January. But by February-end the second wave hit, bringing economic activities to a standstill. “In these dire circumstances, it will be difficult for shacks to sustain. As everybody has been affected by the pandemic, we are not making any economic demands, but request the government to waive various fees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/waive-fees-for-upcoming-tourism-season-shack-owners-tell-govt/articleshow/85383702.cms||---

By mid-1930s there were 300 students people from Afghanistan in Bhopal, then a princely state,” said Saeedullah Khan, now 70. He heads Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind Pathan Society, Tanzeen Khudie Khimadagar and is part of a large Afghan-Pashtun clan in the state capital. Some 200-years before Saeedullah’s father who came to Bhopal in 1937, an Afghan Sardar Dost Mohammed Khan, founded the Bhopal State. The princely state later ruled by four Begum Nawabs got the respect of 19-gun salute princely state. The state became known for its initiatives for women’s empowerment, education and upliftment. With the Taliban taking control of Afghanistan, after sweeping into its capital city, the Afghan-Pashtun residents of Bhopal expressed concern over the Taliban takeover. It might be time for Afghan rulers to take a cue from Bhopal and its glorious history, where women ruled for four generations. “Taliban will have to change their thinking. The incoming government should take people into confidence. Hardline attitude cannot be the way forward. Education and empowerment of women is key,” said Saeedullah, apprehensive over the fast-developing Afghanistan spinning out of control amid the Taliban offensive. About his life, he said he has seen the USSR withdraw from Afghanistan, the civil war and post 9/11 intervention in the war-torn country. Saeedullah’s last visit to Afghanistan was around 2014-15. He has been an invitee on previous occasions too. “Afghanistan owes a lot to India for its redevelopment. Post India’s assistance in electrification of Kabul and other places, I have seen women pray for the well-being for Hindustan,” he added. The connect between families, in way of marriages has faded away since India’s Independence. The social connect remains. Around 2015, a trade delegation from Afghanistan was in Bhopal part of investment summit. In the last decade, Afghan Ambassadors have visited Madhya Pradesh capital, cementing ties with Bhopal.

Zilla Parishad (ZP) CEO Ayush Prasad told TOI, “Some of these villages are in very remote areas and have taken adequate measures such as complete sealing of their borders and isolating residents who go out for work.” The ZP officials conducted Covid tests to check if there were any asymptomatic Covid cases in these villages, said a senior health department official. Dr BB Gadve, the tehsil health officer of Khed, said, “These villages are on the hills in the extreme end of the western part of the tehsil. Also, they have very limited contact with neighbouring villages. During the peak of pandemic, the sarpanchs of these villages restricted the movement of people. Most of them delivered necessary items at doorsteps of people.” Dr Bhagwan Pawar, the district health officer, said primary health centres in these areas had been directed to provide medicines to the residents of the villages through ASHA workers. “This would ensure that they do not mingle with people of other villages.,” Pawar said. The ZP conducted a special vaccination drive for remote villages last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/31-villages-still-covid-free-in-rural-pune-zp/articleshow/85383704.cms||Sandip Dighe

Imposing an environmental compensation of Rs 40,000 per day from November 9, 2019 onwards until compliance is met, DPCC in its notice asked DAMB to show cause why proceedings should not be initiated against them for failing to adhere to National Green Tribunal and high court orders. The committee said while closure directions were issued on November 9, 2019 for the egg and poultry market, DAMB on November 13, had requested for revocation of closure directions. On November 25, a letter was issued by DPCC asking DAMB to submit a bank guarantee of Rs 50 lakh, along with an undertaking valid for one year, under which corrective measures such as a bio-methanation plant, a modern poultry and egg market and an ready mix concrete plant for construction of the new egg and poultry market would be taken. “However, you have not submitted any reply so far,” said the DPCC in its notice on Monday. The notice also said that DAMB violated a Delhi High Court order by running a poultry market with slaughtering of chickens. “In view of the above, you are requested to look into the matter and take appropriate measures to comply with the directions of NGT as well as the high court,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/poultry-egg-market-at-ghazipur-not-shut-yet-dpcc-takes-strong-note/articleshow/85383765.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Task force fears districts slipping on contact tracing, asks them to step up||MUMBAI: Members of the state Covid task force have expressed concern about slackness in contact tracing, a crucial aspect of controlling the coronavirus. In several districts, they suspect the minimum ratio of 15 contacts per positive case is not being met. In one of the recent meetings held to review the impact of unlocking, contact tracing was discussed with district officials. “We believe some laxity has come in the contact tracing exercise. Officials at the district level must reinforce it if we want to delay the third wave,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the force. Dr Shubhash Salukhe, technical advisor to the state government, said he too was “worried and sceptical” about contact tracing in some districts. “Surveillance is a challenge, but it remains a crucial tool. Besides contact tracing, we also have to carry out genome sequencing routinely to pick up patterns swiftly,” he said. Around 13 districts are contributing the most new positive cases now. Leading them are Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Pune and Solapur. Admitting that some districts could better their numbers, Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said at times, several positive cases are from the same family and that pulls down the contact tracing ratio. In Mumbai, wards have been asked to increase the ratio from 15 to 20. Dr Mahendra Khandade, a medical officer of health, said effective contact tracing helped them detect six positive contacts of the 63-year-old woman who died of Delta-plus in July. One of the contacts was a house help, who too was found positive for Delta-plus. “But because of strict isolation, there were no cases in her family,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-task-force-fears-districts-slipping-on-contact-tracing-asks-them-to-step-up/articleshow/85383814.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Unable to comprehend his country’s quick descent into further chaos, he was not in a state of mind to describe the situation. He spoke briefly to TOI on his way to Pune. “I had booked a ticket to India one week ago, and I could board the flight and leave. There are over 100 Afghan students in Pune, and we are all worried about our families back home,” Rohani, a member of the Afghanistan Students’ Association in Pune, said. Other Afghan students studying in the universities and colleges in Pune have been trying to contact their families for a week. Fear about their safety has taken hold of them as the situation worsened in the last 10 days . Many had planned to visit their homes in the next two months, but now want to stay back in the city. Some have lost hope of ever going back. Aziza Sarwari from the International Study Centre of the Savitribai Phule Pune University, said she has been trying to get in touch with her parents for a week without any success. “My sister is a teacher there and I am not aware of what is happening with them, and how to contact them. I was to go to my family in a month after my exams were over. I have not been there for four years. But now, any return to my home country looks remote,” she said. Her room-mate from Kabul, Farhana Amiri, said, “We never thought something like this would happen and the stories from out friends are terrifying. We are very worried about our families there.” Shukrallah Ahamadi, a student from Kabul currently in his second year of MBA at Symbiosis International University, said he has been through the tragedy before. “I was just a year old when my father who worked for the government was killed by the Taliban. I remember the fear and horror my mother and others felt when they talked. We thought those days were gone, but we are heartbroken now. I have not been able to contact my mother or brothers for two days. Last I heard, they had shifted to our hometown in Logar, 50km away from Kabul. It is much more peaceful,” Ahamadi said. Ahamadi said his brothers had to drop out of school and take up odd jobs to support the family. “I was good in studies, so relatives put up a loan when I got the ICCR scholarship to study undergraduate courses in India. I planned to complete my MBA, go back home, get a good job and then give my mother and brothers a better life. My education was their hope for a better future. Now, all of that is shattered,” he said. Zaiqa Faiz, a PhD scholar in economics at SIU, took leave on Monday as she is struggling to come to terms with what is happening back home in Herat. “Notices in our area have forbidden women from stepping out without a male relative. I travelled to India alone, and have been studying here. I don’t know what will happen when I return. My passport has lost its validity and I cannot apply for a job to another country,” she added. Zaiqa said her brother-in-law who was in the Afghan army, is in hiding now. “We want the world to stand with us and help us save our beautiful country,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/afghan-pupils-worry-about-families-after-turn-of-events/articleshow/85383774.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Hotel occupancy in Jaipur, Udaipur, Mount Abu, Kumbhalgarh and Jodhpur rose to over 70% during weekend. Dhirendra Raghav, a hotelier in Jaipur said, “The volume of business has been on the upswing because of negligible new Covid infections.

However, the court imposed a condition that within six weeks, he will deposit Rs 4 lakh for the upbringing of their two daughters. Justice Mukta Gupta said the pre-arrest bail was also subject to the man joining the investigation and directed him to inform the court concerned in case of any change in his mobile phone number and/or address. “The petition is disposed of directing that in the event of arrest, the petitioner be released on bail on his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs 25,000 with one surety bond of the like amount subject to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/SHO concerned,” the court ordered. The accused had claimed that the allegations were fabricated as the woman was still his legally wedded wife who was habituated to create nuisance. To show his bonafide, he volunteered to deposit Rs 4 lakh with the court in the best interest of his daughters. The court directed that the money be placed in two fixed deposits of Rs 2 lakh each or in case the wife wishes, Rs 2 lakh be released for the daughters and the rest would be subject to the final outcome in the trial or any settlement. The FIR, registered under IPC 498A and Section 4 of Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Act 2019, alleged that the man also used to beat her up for money from her parental home and forced her parents to pay after the birth of each girl child.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow clocks second highest vax turnout||LUCKNOW: The state capital on Monday witnessed yet another record breaking turnout for Covid vaccination with more than 51,000 people taking the jab at 143 booths across the district. As many as 51,326 people, including 20,018 (39%) women, took the first or the second dose of the vaccine, the second highest after 80,400 recorded on August 7 since the mass immunisation drive began exactly seven months ago on January 16. Though there were complaints of overcrowding and violation of Covid safety protocols from some centres, no case of adverse effect after vaccination was reported from any centre till the reports last came in. Long queues were witnessed outside booths since morning with people in both the categories – those who had booked the slot in advance and those who came to avail walk-in registration facility – turning up to take the shot. Despite hot and humid conditions, people patiently waited for hours for their turn. District immunization officer Dr MK Singh said, "On the direction of state government, 143 booths were set up on Monday. In addition, 40 special centres were set up at various workplaces, places of worship and markets to cater to the local demand. While 38,604 (75%) people took the first dose of the vaccine, 12,722 (25%) completed the two-dose course by taking the second shot. With this, about 13 lakh people of the around 36 lakh adult population of Lucknow have now received a dose of the vaccine, while 5.6 lakh have been fully immunised with the two doses. Meanwhile, five Covid-19 cases were recorded in the city in the past 48 hours, while 14 patients recovered in the same period. The active cases as on Monday evening were 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-clocks-2nd-highest-vax-turnout/articleshow/85385734.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

There were a total of 1,277 speeding violations detected from January to March against 2,292 violations registered between April and June, according to figures shared by the directorate of transport. “Earlier, we did not have any functional speed radar guns since they were under repair. Later the department purchased more devices and allotted them to all the traffic cells with the help of which we are booking cases of speeding,” DySP traffic P B Shirvoikar said. There were a total of 46,476 helmetless riding violations from January to March compared to 60,050 violations from April to June. “Due to the curfew, the number of nakabandis and barricades by traffic personnel as well as the regular police increased. That resulted in greater enforcement across the state. The curfew therefore helped in detecting violations not just through the day, but even after 7pm. As a result the number of offences registered were higher than normal,” road safety activist Roland Martins said. Road safety advocacy groups are therefore of the opinion that the curfew is a lesson in what the enforcement can really do within a fixed time period. “Despite it being the curfew period, people were freely moving outside and not just for essentials. Police’s focus was on Covid curfew, but with so many common people moving out it became easy for the police to catch violators. Otherwise, violators, especially on two-wheelers, are able to sneak away from police,” road safety activist Pramod Sawant said. “People oppose stringent policing citing lack of proper infrastructure (like smooth roads), but simple acts like wearing a helmet or riding within speed limits can be observed irrespective of the infrastructure,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curfew-months-saw-more-traffic-violations-than-1st-quarter-of-year/articleshow/85383796.cms||---

Covid times did add caution to the Navroz celebrations in the city on Monday, but there was no stopping the Parsi community from making the most of this occasion with food, fun and frolic. There are very few Parsis in Bhopal, but each one is strongly connected to one another, said the president of Parsi Anujuman, Bhopal, Retd Col Firoze Allavali. “We don’t have an agyari and for special occasions, we have to call a priest from Indore or Mhow, but that doesn’t deter us,” said the president. He added, “With pandemic still lurking around, the community decided to make it a ‘family only’ celebration, but on social media platforms, all the members exchanged Navroz greetings and bonded virtually.” His wife Niloofer shared that all the family rituals were strictly adhered to. “After prayers in the morning, we all enjoyed a traditional breakfast of ‘rava’. Lunch was a simple affair with plain rice dal, which is considered to be very auspicious along with other dishes and vegetables.” Secretary of Parsi Anjuman, Dr Binaiffer Pithawalla Agrawal, was thrilled that she got an opportunity to celebrate the festive hues along with her husband, daughters and parents, who have come from Mumbai. “Married in an Agrawal family, each festival in my home has cross-cultural tints which are even more beautiful,” she said and added, “we gorged on traditional delicacies including ‘eenda chatni no cutlet’, sewai, curd and ‘marghi na farcha’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/parsis-ring-in-navroz-with-traditional-fervour-bhonu/articleshow/85381527.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh case: ‘No relief at drop of hat without making case on facts’||NEW DELHI: Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the three-judge Supreme Court bench hearing Anil Deshmukh’s petition that “It is submitted that admittedly, the petitioner seeks interim relief on the basis of some constitutional issues that the petitioner has raised. It is submitted that it is settled law that no interim relief can be granted merely on the drop of a hat by raising some or the other constitutional issue without making out a case on facts. Further, it is trite law that all statutory enactments are presumed to be constitutional until declared otherwise by the courts.” Apprehending arrest after he was summoned and his assistant was arrested in a money laundering case, Deshmukh moved directly SC challenging Section 45(1) of PMLA and also for interim relief. Responding to Deshmukh’s plea, ED in its affidavit alleged Deshmukh’s family and his close associates are involved in “laundering the money by creating a complex web of structure of companies and their transactions”. It said the former home minister received Rs 4.7 crore from various bar owners between months of December, 2020 to February, 2021. “During the course of investigation, it is further revealed that, in 2008, Zodiac Dealcom Private Limited, a company controlled by Deshmukh family raised bogus share capital from 18 Kolkata-based other shell companies. The said 18 shell companies belong to a known entry operator namely Manohar Lal Nangalia and his partner Babu Lal Banka. Total security premium of Rs.9.82 Crore was raised. In 2010, company was taken over by Deshmukh Group of Companies. Even the registered address of Zodiac Dealcom is of the Kolkata belongs to Nangalia,” the affidavit said. “Accordingly, search operations were conducted at Kolkata on June 2 at the premises belonging to Nangalia and his partner Banka and from their statements recorded, it is apparent that Zodiac Dealcom (Deshmukh company) has converted Rs 10 crore cash as share sale at premium and the company had no actual activity other than banking transactions,” it said. The agency said from analysis of bank account of various companies it appears that money/ fund have been rotated from M/s Zodiac Dealcom, (a paper company), to various companies directly controlled by Deshmukh family and the same has been utilised for expansion of business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-case-no-relief-at-drop-of-hat-without-making-case-on-facts/articleshow/85386553.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid restrictions lifted, boating comes back to life at Naini Lake||NEW DELHI: After a long wait, boating has finally been resumed at Naini Lake in Model Town by Delhi Tourism. The services were halted due to Covid-19 restrictions. The water level of the lake had also increased during monsoon, which made it difficult to start the service. The water even damaged the pavements, grilles and plants. “Boating was started due to the demand from residents and also because Covid-19 restrictions were lifted sometime ago. Once the water level recedes further, we will start cleaning the pond. We are taking measures to stop breeding of mosquitoes at the site. Boating hours remain the same,” said a Delhi Tourism official. North Delhi Municipal Corporation said renovation and cleaning work would begin from Tuesday. A senior official from the horticulture department said workers visited the site on Monday. “They will start the work of clearing the pavements and planting saplings or decorative plants. As water started overflowing during monsoon, the grilles got damaged in places. We will ask the engineering department to conduct repairs as soon as possible so that visitors get sufficient space to walk safely,” added the official. When the waterbody started overflowing in July-end and August, residents got scared. They complained about facing inconvenience and demanded that the water be pumped out. A tubewell was installed in July-end, but removed within hours. Initially, north corporation officials refused to pump out the excess water, stating that rainwater would automatically percolate and help in conserving groundwater. Mukesh Agarwal, general secretary of Lake Area Residents’ Association, said they then asked commissioner Sanjay Goel for help and he assured appropriate action. “An inspection was done and a pump was installed again to flow the excess water into a stormwater drain. Things have become better now. But the pavements are damaged or covered with filth. They need to be cleaned. So is the condition of the rest of the green area. The fountain at the centre has also become non-operational after flooding,” added Goel. Goel said starting the boating service after Independence Day and during the upcoming festive season would attract more visitors to Naini Lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-restrictions-lifted-boating-comes-back-to-life-at-naini-lake/articleshow/85383852.cms||Vibha Sharma

Police said that Haneefa Thoniyadath, 39, who returned from Qatar three months ago, sustained injuries in the attack. According to police, the gang came in a car and abducted him from near his house around 11pm on Sunday. He was released near his residence around 4am on Monday. An air pistol was found by a local resident from near the site of kidnapping. Koyilandy police said that gold smuggling racket was suspected to be involved in the incident. Haneefa is suspected to have acted as a carrier of smuggled gold and had not allegedly handed over the gold to the persons involved in the racket saying that it was seized by the Customs at the airport. The members of the racket refused to believe it and it is suspected to have led to the kidnapping. Police registered a case under sections 365 (kidnapping), 324 (causing hurt by dangerous weapons) 343 (wrongful confinement), among others. Koyilandy police inspector N Sunil Kumar is investigating the case. This is the second kidnapping of people with suspected links to gold smuggling rackets in Koyilandy. Ashraf, an expatriate, who had come home from Saudi Arabia recently, was kidnapped at gunpoint in Koyilandy on July 13 and later released at Kunnamangalam after being thrashed by a five-member gang. Though three people were arrested in connection with the case, the main accused behind the kidnapping are yet to be nabbed. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/gulf-returnee-abducted-released-after-assault/articleshow/85381538.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ex-MNS MLA gets pre-arrest bail in molestation case||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has granted pre-arrest bail to a former MNS MLA from Vikhroli charged with molesting a teenager in 2019. Justice Prakash Naik allowed Mangesh Sangle’s plea in respect of an FIR filed with Rabale police station under Indian Penal Code sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 354 A (sexual harassment) on March 16, 2019. Sangle’s application said the parents of the complainant (then 19) frequently quarrelled and he intervened on several occasions. The father, who he claimed is an active member of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), finally stayed separately with his daughter and filed the FIR through her with mala fide intentions. According to the FIR, around 3.10am on October 16, 2018, Sangle had been to the complainant’s house after her parents fought. He had insisted she come to another room to discuss the matter and tried to molest her. Thereafter he sent messages of apology and asked her not to inform anybody about the incident. As the complainant was busy with studies and college activities, she lodged the complaint on March 16, 2019. Pointing out that the FIR came five months after the incident, Sangle, now a BJP member, claimed it was an afterthought and a bid to implicate him and tarnish his image. Sangle’s advocates Rohan Hogle and Anshul Sontakke said he has cooperated with the investigation and chargesheet has been filed. In his August 12 order, Justice Naik took note that Sangle was granted interim protection by HC on May 6, 2019. “The cellphone of the applicant which was purportedly used in the offence is seized. Charge sheet is filed against the applicant. In these circumstances, custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary,’’ he added. If arrested, Sangle will be released on a personal bond of Rs 25,000 with one or more sureties.

State irrigation department officials said that they will initiate water release from the dam once the reservoir is filled, which is likely in the next couple of days. The department on Monday resumed release of water from Panshet to accommodate rainwater flowing into the reservoir following good spells of rain in its catchment areas. Water was released at the rate of 902 cusec and flowing into Khadakwasla, where the stock was reduced to 74% to make space for the inflow from Panshet. “We are monitoring water levels in all the reservoirs. There has been a steady rise in the levels. The catchments received good spells of rain in the past couple of days. Varasgaon’s stock is inching towards full capacity. The released water would go in Khadakwasla. However, we are still to release water from the dam. Water stock in Khadakwasla has been brought down to avoid sudden discharge of water into the Mutha, which can lead to flooding in low-lying areas,” an official said. Stock in Varasgaon stood at 12.63 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) on Monday evening, while the collective stock in all four reservoirs reached 28 TMC (96%). The irrigation department has already released over 5 TMC of water from Khadakwasla into the Mutha during the heavy spells of rain in July. More discharge of water is expected as water storage nears the maximum capacities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/varasgaon-more-than-98-full-discharge-starts-from-panshet/articleshow/85383832.cms||Sarang Dastane

Indeed, there is something so compelling in the national flag that people make even the supreme sacrifice for its sake, said Sadan Jha, the author among panelists at UP’s first Military Literature Festival, which began on Independence Day. The first session titled ‘Exploring the Tiranga: The Indian National Flag’ covered pieces of history of the flag and the first time it was presented to the constituent assembly in 1947. The panelists included Jha, Lt Gen Rameshwar Yadav, and vexillologist Sekhar Chakrabarti. The panelists mentioned that the flag underwent many changes since 1857. However, it was only on July 22, 1947, that the bill approving the flag was passed in the constituent assembly. “The introduction of the bill said ‘Resolved the national flag of India shall be horizontal tricolour of deep saffron (Kesariya), white and dark green in equal proportions. In the centre of the white band, there shall be a wheel in navy blue, to represent the charkha,” added Jha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/national-flag-draws-respect-even-spurs-supreme-sacrifice/articleshow/85385774.cms||---
---||Mumbai||If coronavirus can mutate, can the dengue virus be far behind?||Amid the incessant din surrounding Covid-19, one seems to have forgotten that the ubiquitous and omnipotent dengue virus keeps returning every season with a vengeance. Science is very clear if there is a virus, it’s going to mutate. Whether it’s Covid or dengue. Dengue-causing viruses have been mutating over the seasons, but have not gained the same importance as their new cousins. If Covid gets the lungs initially, dengue hits the entire body simultaneously. Classic dengue is fever with chills, with respiratory symptoms, severe body and backache (we call it bone-breaking fever). Usually, dengue is associated with rash and itching but every season we are seeing a deviation and alteration in its clinical presentation. This time with Covid having receded in the background, the syndrome of fever with chills, which is unrelenting, almost continuous and hardly responding, except for a short time to antipyretics, is the order of the day with dengue. Seldom do we get the diarrhoea that we used to see few years back, and the respiratory signs are usually soft and rarely pneumonia. There is hardly any rash and itching. Repeated tests for the antigen and the IgM antibody yield negative results. Even the tell-tale drop in WBC and platelet count comes later, making initial diagnosis in the first week clinical and a challenge. By this time the patient is exhausted with fever, dehydrated by nausea and vomiting, and poor intake, and admitted for intravenous medication. The liver enzymes and other parameters, in conjunction with prolonged high fever, also start showing abnormalities. This patient poses the conundrum. Relatives and insurance want to label, and everybody is ordering investigations galore. Finally, one may get a positive test. Dengue this season has displayed a plethora of presentations. We have had patients getting admitted and suffering with continuous fever without positivity. Some young patients come with acute hepatitis which can be so fulminating that last week we had a patient succumbing to liver cell failure in few days. Pandits ask – diagnosis? The term ‘viral’ is used, which is not wrong because dengue is truly a virus which involves all systems in the body in larger or smaller proportions as against its infamous cousin Covid. The motive of penning this article is to bring attention to the fact that patients and clinicians do not pursue a tedious, laborious and expensive investigation pathway but learn to decipher and clinically make a judgement and treat presumptively, while not sparing any life-saving modality of treatment. The other learning is that if masks and vaccines are anti-Covid, science must endeavor to pursue the already developed dengue vaccine and stress on mosquito containment. If there is no mosquito, there will be no dengue, and if there is a vaccine, even if you get dengue, it will be subdued. Our hospitals are inundated with dengue patients who have now learnt to seek help only when symptoms or platelets reach critical values. The community must ensure mosquito breeding sites are vanquished and anti-mosquito measures taken on a war-footing. We don’t have a Remdesevir against dengue, so we cannot dismiss it as a mild entity for every now and then we get a serious dengue which can take away a productive, healthy and non-comorbid life in the blink of an eye. Dengue has evolved with multiple ‘Chehre’ and needs attention. (Dr Hemant Thacker is a consultant physician & cardiometabolic specialist with South Mumbai hospitals and is affiliated to Times Group.

---||Pune||Weekly report on road repair status mandatory: Pune Municipal Corporation||PUNE: The road department of the civic body would have to mandatorily prepare a weekly report highlighting the status of road repairs. “The decision has been taken after complaints about road digging and potholes were received. The officials have been told to conduct checks at the ground and compile the report. The status of pothole repairs and the quality of material used for repairing them should be mentioned in it,” said Kunal Khemnar, the additional commissioner of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), after issuing an order in relation to this. Besides the road department, ward offices would give inputs for this report. The water supply and the drainage departments, allowed to dig up roads and repair them during monsoon, have also been told to provide inputs on restoration of roads. Khemnar said surprise visits were carried out to identify the areas where potholes were creating major problems. He said, “Only 100-metre stretch of a road can be dug up at a time. Until the previously dug up portion is restored, no new digging should be allowed.” The civic activists and elected members had raised objections to road-digging, claiming that they were causing a lot of hassles for commuters. Waterlogging and poor quality of roads were prompting traffic jams. Nearly 115-km stretch of different roads were dug up across the civic areas to lay pipelines for the 24x7 water supply project and replace the old drainage lines. As a special case, these works were allowed after the regular deadline of May 31 to dig up and repair roads. According to the data of the civic administration, the PMC has made provisions for road construction and maintenance in the municipal budget of 2021-22. A total of Rs925.93 crore would be spent on these.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weekly-report-on-road-repair-status-mandatory/articleshow/85383886.cms||---

Heavy rain at isolated places are expected on Tuesday in Palghar, Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Aurangabad, among others. On Wednesday, rain may pick up steam in the ghat areas of Pune, Kolhapur and Satara, as per an India Meteorological department (IMD) forecast. Only light rain has been forecast for Pune city till August 18 and very light to light rain thereafter. D S Pai, scientist and head, of climate research and services, IMD, told TOI, “Most parts in India have been reporting weak monsoon conditions in August. Since the last one week, most rainfall was concentrated along the Himalayas due to the monsoon trough shifting closer to that region. Even when there was a low pressure area recently, the rain belt was restricted only till Madhya Pradesh. Now, we expect another monsoon pulse with the advent of the low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal.” Pai said the latest system will cause a rain revival in parts of the country during the second half of August. “Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity is very likely over Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Vidarbha during the next five days. We expect the monsoon to revive for next few days, from normal to above normal,” he added. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD Pune said with the formation of the low pressure area, the monsoon trough will shift southwards, causing the monsoon to become active to vigorous (in some areas) in parts of Maharashtra for a few days. Despite flooding and heavy rain in parts of Maharashtra in July, as many as 19 districts have started recording negative rainfall departures because of the break-like conditions in the past few days, with eight districts now recording a monsoon rain deficit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-showers-in-ghats-as-monsoon-set-to-revive-light-rain-forecast-for-city/articleshow/85383862.cms||Neha Madaan

The MLA said that senior police officials had visited the TIC at Candolim last week to see the premises as some personnel of the new tourist security police may be stationed there. Built nearly five years ago under the Central government’s ‘Swadesh Darshan’ scheme, the Candolim premises, along with TICs at Calangute and Baga beaches have, however, been lying unutilised. The TICs were even inaugurated around two years ago by Union minister of state for tourism Prahlad Singh Patel, but remained non-functional due to differences between the Calangute MLA and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar. The TICs were supposed to function on the lines of TICs in other international tourist destinations such as Bali and Sri Lanka, providing information to tourists on places to visit for sightseeing, shopping and other assistance. Besides tourism information, the TICs were also supposed to contain an emergency medical unit and police personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/candolim-tourist-info-centre-to-begin-soon-lobo/articleshow/85383844.cms||---

Despite our protests, the Centre has not taken back the laws, so we will do whatever possible to ensure that they are not implemented in the state at least,” she said. She said that among other issues that BSP would raise in the assembly include the poor law and order situation in UP which the government is claiming in media has improved significantly but it is also known that law and order was actually the best under the BSP government. “We will also take up the issue of regular harassment of dalits, backwards and other marginalised communities. The media shows one or two events while the fact is that nobody, including women are safe in the state. Along with this, Covid victims and now even flood victims are being ignored by the state government,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wont-allow-passage-of-farm-laws-in-up-assembly-session-mayawati/articleshow/85385814.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The contractor has commenced work on the all weather road despite the rain. It also learnt that there is a proposal to construct a road from Collem to the Dudhsagar waterfalls. Stating that both the projects are illegal as they are not permitted under Section 29(1) and 35 (6) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, Goa Foundation has written to the chief wildlife warden Santosh Kumar asking for an inquiry into the matter. “Please inquire into this matter and take notice of the intention of the foundation to move the high court for an inquiry into how such projects have been sanctioned within the wildlife sanctuary and national park, despite numerous orders of the Supreme Court of India,” director Goa Foundation Alvares wrote in the letter. A government officer on condition of anonymity told TOI that the public works department (PWD) commenced the work as per the request of stakeholders. “The work order has been issued to the contractor. The work has been ordered as the existing road is muddy and uneven and vehicles plying on it face inconveniences,” the officer said. Goa Foundation has asked the chief wildlife warden to order the relevant authorities to stop work on these projects and to restore the area to its original condition. As the paver road passes through the National Park, a no-objection certificate was necessary, either from the Goa State Wildlife Board or the standing committee of National Board of Wildlife of India, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/paver-road-through-mollem-national-park-irks-activists/articleshow/85383878.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Dozens of Barodians turned up for the gathering and offered condolences. But not for any fellow human. In a first, wildlife activists organized a condolence meet for a 10-foot-long crocodile that was found dead in Vishwamitri River about a week ago. It was the fourth crocodile to have died in the river within two months “He was like a member of our family and stayed among us for so many years. We had spotted him many times during our visit to the river. His sudden death pained us and so we decided to pay tribute to the reptile. It was heartening to see many citizens attending the meet,” said Vishal Thakur, a wildlife activist who had organized the meet on Sunday along with Sanjay Soni. A photograph of the crocodile was placed at the venue and floral tributes were also offered by the attendees. Carcass of the reptile weighing about 150 kg was found floating in the river in Sayajigunj on August 10. Forest officials have launched an inquiry into the cause of the death of four crocodiles. “If any Asiatic lion dies in Gir forest, villagers express grief as they are attached to the big cats. Barodians have been co-existing with crocodiles for many decades but how many really care for these reptiles? In fact, many litter the river with garbage. We organized this meet to involve citizens in conserving the river and the reptiles,” Thakur told TOI. Parth Brahmbhatt, a citizen who attended the condolence meeting, “That Vishwamitri is home to hundreds of crocodiles was known to me but I felt that it is just another reptile living among us. During the meet, I learnt about how crocodiles are important for our eco-system and like us, they too have a family. I will participate in the campaigns to conserve these reptiles now on,” said Some wildlife lovers proposed that the dead crocodile be named after our freedom fighter Mangal Pandey. “Like Pandey’s death triggered a revolution across the country, this reptile’s death would shake up people and compel the authorities to act,” said Soni who stays by the river bank in Sayajigunj. He added that every year, dozens of crocodiles venture out of the river but none of them ever attacks humans as they have learnt to peacefully coexist with people.  Thakur and Soni will also launch a campaign to spread awareness about the reptiles in the schools and colleges in the coming months.

The division bench of Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice V K Shukla gave the interim order while hearing a petition filed by Jitendra Chaudhary in which he has challenged the legality of reservation policy adopted on July 2, 2019 and model roaster issued on December 24, 2019 under which 10% quota in state government jobs is being given to candidates of economically weaker sections (EWSs). He contended that quota for EWSs should not be given on total seats but only on seats remaining after taking away the seats reserved for the SCs and STs. Giving 10 percent quota on total vacancies advertised is against section 14, 15 (6) and 16 (6) of the constitution. After preliminary hearing on the petition, the court issued the interim order that appointments made through MPPSC, recruitment of teachers and staff in NHM will be subject to the court's final order on the petition in question.

Mane, explaining the modus operandi of the suspects , said, “Gilani assumes various names stays on rent in Pune and other cities. As per our initial probe, Gilani and Wasane convinced people that a Noida-based firm wanted a large fleet of cars on rent. They took the cars from the victims and disposed of the vehicles at various places in Maharashtra. Further, they struck a deal with Shaikh (the car dealer) to sell the vehicles.” “Police teams have fanned out to recover the vehicles that were sold in Latur, Hyderabad in Telangana, and other places for a quick buck. We hope to recover them soon,” Mane further . The fraud came to light after Gilani and Wasane failed to pay rent and disappeared with the 28 vehicles.

The protest will be held in line with party chief’s statement that BJP was keen to shift focus from issues related to welfare of people, and SP will ensure such topics are debated upon. The focus of protest will be growing unemployment, deteriorating law and order in the state, and the government’s failure to extend medical help to Covid-19 patients during the second wave. Apart from the protest, SP members will corner BJP on failure to meet the promises it had made in ‘Sankalp Patra’ on issues like jobs to 7 lakh youths, double farmers’ income, worsening crime scene and shying away from probes in scams related to purchase of medical equipment during pandemic and in Jal Jeevan Mission. Presiding over a meeting of the legislature party, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav said members should ensure all issues concerning well-being of the people are debated aggressively and constructively in the assembly during the session. “It is our duty to ensure that the government does not succeed in misleading people,” he said.

Attributing the revival of monsoon to low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal, weathermen said the fourth spell will bring good rainfall in many districts including Jalore, Sirohi, Rajsamand, Jaipur, Kota, Ajmer, Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Alwar and Bharatpur. Meanwhile, in the absence of rainfall, mercury continued to take an upward swing across the state. On Monday, humidity levels in various parts of the state were between 80% and 90%. “The moment humidity levels further increases and easterly winds revives, the state will see the revival of the monsoon,” the officer added. In this season so far, Jaipur had had a good third spell of monsoon. “Actually, the first two spells in the state were not that good. But the third spell brought bountiful rainfall in the state.

The Malad police have registered an FIR and are looking for the accused. The complainant told the police she created an account on an online classifieds portal for the sale of her furniture. Subsequently, she received a phone call from a man who identified himself as an armyman by the name of Dharam Singh. To gain the woman’s trust, he shared a copy of his Aadhaar card and ID card over WhatsApp. “He told her he would make an advance payment via a digital wallet,” said a police officer. The accused convinced her to use QR codes to send him money and receive double the amount from him. After several such transactions, amounting to Rs 2.4 lakh, she stopped receiving money. “The fraudster assured her that there was a technical error and if she continued depositing money, she would receive double the sum from his end. She paid up Rs 2.4 lakh in this manner before realising she had been duped,” said the officer. On August 9, she lodged a police complaint.  In a separate case, a deputy general manager with a real estate firm lost Rs 1.1 lakh to cyber fraud. An FIR was lodged by the Andheri police. The manager informed the police that he received 11 SMSes from his bank in a span of just four minutes, alerting him that money had been withdrawn from his bank account. He was taken aback as he had not shared his account or card details with anyone. His money was withdrawn from an ATM in Pune.

The screening is done to prevent vertical transmission of the infection from an infected mother to the foetus. In 2020-21, the state reported 15.3 lakh HIV tests in pregnant women, up from 14.2 lakh in 2018-19 and 15.2 lakh in 2019-20. “In 2020-21, we reported more HIV testing in pregnant women who come to hospitals for ante-natal care,” said Dr Ravi Prakash Sharma, director (AIDS). Whenever a pregnant woman comes for the first antenatal check to any hospital, doctors encourage her to get HIV testing done, which is voluntary. “HIV testing is done to detect HIV in early stage. If a pregnant woman is HIV positive, chances are that the infection is transmitted to the foetus. If she tests positive for HIV, treatment is available which reduces the chances of vertical transmission of HIV from the infected mother to the newborn,” said a health department official. The health department has provided access to HIV testing services to all pregnant women enrolled for antenatal care along with provision of ARV (Antiretroviral) prophylaxis with single dose of nevirapine at the time of delivery. Officials said mother to child transmission of HIV is the primary route of transmission for HIV among children. Such transmission is known to occur during pregnancy, delivery and breast-feeding period with equal frequency. It is estimated that without any intervention the risk of transmission of HIV from infected mother to her child is between 20% to 45%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/15-lakh-pregnant-women-got-hiv-tests-done-during-covid/articleshow/85383931.cms||---

It is a festival to cherish the sacred memory of countless anonymous Indians who sacrificed their lives for the country’s independence and will help us realise the vision of ‘Naya Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’.” During the event, the CM also highlighted that this was the centenary year of the Chauri Chaura incident and outlined the role played by UP in the freedom movement, starting with Ballia’s declaration of independence in 1942 and the Kakori train incident. Attributing India’s independence to collective struggle, from that of Rani Laxmibai to Mangal Pandey, the CM said that in 1916, it was from Lucknow that Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak gave his famous cry for Independence, ‘Swarajya is my birthright, we shall have it’ which later became mantra for the independence movement. Heroes like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Veer Savarkar, Dr Syama Prasad Mukherjee gave a new height to the fight and UP became a focal point of this decisive battle, he said. Talking about UP’s contribution to the progress of the country, he said that in the past four years the state had implemented extensive reforms to emerge as the growth engine of the country. He said that UP was marching rapidly towards becoming the fastest growing economy in the country. “UP, once known for chaos, anarchy and lawlessness, is the number one state in effective implementation of welfare schemes. The state’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been praised and acknowledged nationally and globally. The state has now become the favourite destination for all the investors and industrialists,” he said. He added that people of the country must work with sincerity to realize the dreams of those who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the country and said that it is our duty to celebrate the “extraordinary spirit of the freedom fighters, their supreme sacrifices and their lofty ideals”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-four-years-up-has-emerged-as-growth-engine-of-nation-says-cm/articleshow/85385871.cms||Neha Lalchandani

He has filed a first information report (FIR) with the Hinjewadi police.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mithibai’s BMS most sought-after among degree college aspirants||MUMBAI: Mithibai College’s BMS programme has received the largest count of applications—6,700—from degree college aspirants for admission to the 2021-22 batch. Jai Hind College is second with 5,513 candidates applying for 120 BMS seats and N M College a close third with 5,264 aspirants. Competition among the top city colleges is fierce. Famous names, big brands and now autonomy that come attached seem to be the flavour of the admission season. Among courses, after the BCom programme, BMS (bachelor of management studies) had the largest count of applicants and BCom (accounting and finance) is a distant third. “The BMS programme has evolved and become sharper. We have senior industry captains coming to take lectures. There are a plethora of activities embedded into the programme and an entrepreneurship cell and a start-up accelerator to encourage students to launch their ventures from college,” said Jai Hind College principal Ashok Wadia. Student selection for self-financing courses will be based on the 60:40 model, with 60% weightage being given to the college entrance test and 40% for class XII scores. For the first-year programme in arts, St Xavier’s College saw the maximum applications—4,109 for 450 seats, with about 360-odd being for in-house candidates, who must be given the first choice. An autonomous college, St Xavier’s also conducted entrance tests for its unaided programmes. A total of 3,866 applications have poured in for 60 BMS seats. “We saw thousands of students taking our tests from across the country. Apart from our BA programme, there is much clamour for our BMS and BMM programmes, apart from courses like microbiology under our science offerings,” said vice-principal Hasnain Naqvi. Starting a second division for BMM is on the cards. Here too, 60:40 will be the selection criteria for self-financing programmes, like at Jai Hind College. On the Mumbai University portal, 3.4 lakh students have registered to take degree college admissions. As varsity officials explained, one candidate could apply for one more than course, or to multiple colleges and hence the application count stands at 5.4 lakh. In-house students will be first admitted to the traditional programmes. “While commerce will alw-ays have highest number of applications, many students apply for a BCom programme as back -up. Most are keen on joining a self-finance course. So, as they get a seat in a course of their ch-oice, they relieve the BCom seat,” said Tukaram Shiware, ch-airman, Non-Government College Principals’ Association. In science, Ruia College has the maximum applications for BSc (computer science)—2,059 for 60 seats. “Our college is kn-own for its strong research culture and the quality of teaching and lab experience that students get is unparallelled. We also have a lot of applications for basic sciences as we have an MSc programme in all sciences, as also PhD,” said in-charge principal Anushree Lokur. But most colleges had a lower application count which shows that while students had filled MU forms, they had not submitted college-level forms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mithibais-bms-most-sought-after-among-degree-college-aspirants/articleshow/85383996.cms||Hemali Chhapia

---||Lucknow||New Union ministers from Uttar Pradesh launch Jan Aashirwad Yatra||LUCKNOW: Bharatiya Janata Party launched its Jan Aashirwad Yatra in Uttar Pradesh on Monday to seek blessings of people. Seven ministers from UP inducted in the Union cabinet in July would take out the ‘yatra’ in state. The ministers of state would be on ‘yatra’ between August 16 and August 18, and the cabinet ministers between August 19 and August 21. Union minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary, minister of state for housing and urban affairs Kaushal Kishore and minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ were welcomed by state BJP general secretary Govind Narayan Shukla, ministers Ashutosh Gopal Tandon, Brijesh Pathak, Swati Singh and others on their arrival in Lucknow on Monday. “We need blessings of people to complete the work for their welfare,” said Chaudhary, who was welcomed in Barabanki and Ayodhya where he visited Hanumangarhi temple and went for Ramlala’s darshan. He got a rousing welcome in Basti. “BJP is working to unite the society unlike opposition which divides. BJP will continue to work for the welfare of people,” he said. “The BJP governments have worked for the welfare of people and are fulfilling the mission of Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Dr BR Ambedkar,” said Kishore, who started his yatra from Mohan, Unnao. “BJP has support of the people. Congress never followed the principles of Gandhiji, SP did’nt follow the path of Dr Lohia and BSP did not follow the mission of Dr Ambedkar. People know only BJP works for poor, dalits, women and deprived. Congress, SP and BSP did not provide even basic amenities, but BJP gave electricity, toilets, pucca houses, gas cylinders, Kisan Samman Nidhi, and Ayushman Bharat Yojana,” he said. Union minister for cooperation BL Verma started his ‘yatra’ after darshan at Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan, Mathura. He said people are happy, but opposition is worried by BJP’s welfare schemes. “BJP will form the government again in UP with huge majority,” he said. Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni inspected the vaccination programme at Sandila health centre during his yatra. “The country could fight Covid-19 because of the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A new India is taking shape,” he said. Union minister of state for commerce and industry Anupriya Patel would start her ‘yatra’ from Handia on Tuesday and minister of state for micro, small and medium enterprises Bhanu Pratap Verma from Lalitpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/new-union-ministers-from-up-launch-jan-aashirwad-yatra/articleshow/85385921.cms||---

The mistake passed unnoticed via the desks of four officials, before it was corrected. While conductors and drivers, who are the face of MSRTC, are punished for misappropriation of even Rs5, the clerk who made the mistake was let off with minor punishment, said sources. Rajendra Bangale, who worked as line supervisor at Nagpur, retired on May 31, 2021. Bangale is temporarily living with his son working in Mumbai. Bangale was to be paid money for leave encashment of 44 days. The clerk concerned prepared a note and forwarded it to the depot manager at Saoner, where Bangale had worked for four months from March 2019. The note mentioned Bangale died on May 31, 2021 (which was actually his date of retirement), and his pending leave encashment dues of 44 days be paid to him. “It was a serious goof-up by the accountant concerned,” said Bangale. The note must have passed through four officials, including divisional controller Nilesh Belsare, who also signed it. Belsare told TOI, “The mistake occurred due to oversight. There are several cases, where names differ and the rest of the matter on the delivery order is cut-copy-paste. There were some similar cases of dead employees, and hence Bangale’s name too went with the same content. We have penalized the clerk concerned and acted against him. Corrections were made immediately.” “It is really embarrassing. Imagine what would have happened if my family members staying in Nagpur had learnt about it. My colleagues were shocked, and wondered whether the news was true or not. I’m well in Mumbai, and will return on August 30,” said Bangale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/msrtc-paper-work-declares-retired-staffer-dead/articleshow/85381662.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Jaipur||Transfer relaxation extended||Jaipur: The state government has extended the period of relaxation on the transfer ban of government officers and employees till September 15. According to an earlier order by the administrative reforms and coordination department, restrictions imposed on the transfer of employees were lifted from July 14 to August 14. Sources in the government said after the ban on transfers was lifted for a month, the state election commission announced the dates for panchayat elections in six districts. Since the code of conduct has come into force in these districts, transfers could not be carried out there. This is the reason why the government has extended the exemption of the ban on transfers by a month. There has been pressure on the government from local MLAs and other public representatives to extend the transfer period to oblige the party workers. Accepting the demand of public representatives, the chief minister has decided to extend the transfer period. The education department, meanwhile said, after the transfers of about 5,000 teachers of grade-II, it has been decided to transfer grade-III teachers. From August 18 to 25, transfer applications were invited at Shala Darpan portal for teachers seeking transfers, stated a tweet by the education minister Govind Singh Dotasra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transfer-relaxation-extended/articleshow/85384607.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Brahmin meets have rattled BJP, other BSP rivals, says Mayawati||LUCKNOW: BSP chief Mayawati has hit out at BJP for referring to her party’s ‘Prabuddha sammelan’ as ‘jatiwad’ or casteist, saying these meetings where the party is interacting with Brahmins have rattled the ruling party as well as the Opposition. Referring to a Twitter campaign by BJP questioningd the need for BSP to hold casteist ‘sammelans’ at this point instead of helping people affected by floods in the state, the BSP chief on Monday asked BJP why it had started ‘ashirwaad yatras’ in the state instead of providing relief to people. Terming BJP’s bid to play politics over flood situation as ‘despicable’, Mayawati said that instead of advising the BSP what it should be doing, BJP should focus on helping the flood-hit as aerial surveys by chief minister Yogi Adityanath would not help. She accused BJP of trying to derail the BSP’s meetings by detaining party workers and withdrawing permission due to alleged violation of Covid-19 protocols. “These people should know that BSP’s cadre was the first to come forward to help people during the pandemic. We are also helping flood affected people. The BJP is playing horrible politics in the name of floods. This is shameful,” she said. She said, “It is worth thinking why BJP was starting ‘jan ashirwad yatra’. It would have been better had BJP taken out a flood victims’ assistance ‘yatra.” The CM’s aerial reviews were good for visuals, but relief material was actually not reaching victims. “They take out their ‘yatra’ whenever they want, but when the BSP holds the ‘prabuddh sammelan’ or other programmes, they start quoting the flood situation. This is the double faced character of the BJP. It will also be worth seeing to what extent the government will be able to implement Covid appropriate behaviour during these ‘yatras’ as it is still trying to stall our programmes even though the BSP is careful about following all Covid rules,” she said. In a word of advice to BJP workers, she asked them to let the party leaders know that such tactics would be detrimental for the party and people would give a befitting reply to this during the 2022 assembly polls. “It is clear that the BSP’s ‘prabuddha sammelan’ has made the BJP nervous. But such actions will not benefit the BJP. BSP workers should prepare to give the BJP a befitting reply by strengthening the organisation and following Covid protocols and by making all our programmes a success,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/brahmin-meets-have-rattled-bjp-other-bsp-rivals-maya/articleshow/85385941.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: HSC students hit by delay in obtaining marksheets||MUMBAI: HSC students seeking admissions to degree courses in universities outside Maharashtra are in a limbo over a delay in getting marksheets and other documents. While Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary announced HSC results on August 3, they are yet to issue marksheets. The board usually issues marksheets in a week or 10 days after results, but there have been delays earlier too. The parent of a student who secured admission to a national law university in the South, said they were given a deadline to submit documents, and the delay may affect admissions. “For admissions within Maharashtra, institutes will consider using the online scorecard, but for central universities or institutions outside the state, we need migration certificates, for which we must submit board and college documents that we get along with marksheets. We are unable to process our migration certificates,” said the parent. Results this year were delayed due to the second Covid wave. Board exams were called off in May, but the decision to assess students based on previous performances came later. Other boards have released marksheets and leaving certificates, said a parent. A government official said marksheets will be issued soon. He said considering Covid, students should not be deprived of admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hsc-students-hit-by-delay-in-obtaining-marksheets/articleshow/85384086.cms||---
---||Kochi||Cochin International Airport Ltd records rise in passenger footfall||KOCHI: The air travel sector in Kerala is showing signs of revival after a dramatic drop of air passengers during the second wave of the pandemic as there is a significant increase in the number of passengers using Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial), which is the busiest airport in the state. Cial, which saw a huge decline in the number of passengers since May, started seeing a rise in footfalls with an average of 10,000 passengers a day since August 1. Even though the ban on international air travel continues, the increase in number of flights under bubble-agreements is optimistic. Cial sources said it is the first time after the second wave hit, the daily number of passengers crossed 10,000. Moreover, the number of flights too increased in August in both international and domestic sectors after nearly four months. With more airlines starting operations to UAE, which has eased its regulations for passengers from India, the numbers are expected to increase further in the coming days. In the pre-pandemic times, Cial reported a daily footfall of 30,000 passengers. However, with the national lockdown, which began in March 2020, the operations were restricted with exceptions to evacuation flights and repatriation flights. Later gradually the traffic started picking up since September 2020 but it again saw a decline since January 2021 with second wave being reported in various countries. The daily average footfall came down to 2,500 in May when Kerala announced another lockdown. The direct Kochi-London service of Air India will commence on Wednesday as the United Kingdom too relaxed the restrictions. The number of services per week will be increased from one to three soon. Cial managing director S Suhas IAS attributed the smooth and swift commencement of international departures to the operational efficiency of Cial and other stakeholders like airlines, customs, immigration and ground handling agencies. “We were able to start the rapid PCR-testing centre at the departure terminal in a week after Dubai Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management made it mandatory for the passengers from India. So UAE operations started without any delay. Cial is the only airport in the state which offers direct connectivity to London. We have waived parking and landing fees for the airline operating direct services to London,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cial-records-rise-in-passenger-footfall/articleshow/85381682.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

While every year, the students are advised to look at the previous merit list of each college and decide their preference, this year, officials say that the references may not help as they used to, because many students have got high marks in their Std X internal assessment and cut-off marks are expected to be much higher than last year. Meanwhile, quota admissions for in-house, management and minority will also start on Tuesday and continue till August 22. Students can view the seats available in each college in each department on the official admission website from Tuesday. “It is compulsory for students hoping to get admission via in-house quota to fill up parts I and II of the online form. The in-house quota merit list is prepared by us and sent to respective colleges. The colleges can also tell students to fill up their own forms for the in-house quota. All this will be displayed on the college website. The admissions to in-house quota will be conducted based on the merit list on August 23 and 24,” Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education Pune division, said. While it is not compulsory for students aiming to take admission in management quota and minority quota to fill up parts I and II of the online forms and can directly approach the college and follow their rules of admission, Shendkar said that it is advisable to fill up the two forms, just in case they do not make it in the final list in these two quotas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/part-ii-form-for-preferences-entry-through-quota-for-fyjc-start-today/articleshow/85384021.cms||Ardhra Nair

PM Narendra Modi reshuffled his cabinet and included some young faces and Devi is the second Lok Sabha member from Jharkhand to have joined the Union cabinet after tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda. The national leadership of BJP had decided to hold jan aashirwad yatra of all their newly-inducted ministers a week ago. In total, 39 ministers will cover around 20,000km in 19 states and 212 Lok Sabha constituencies. In Jharkhand, the yatra, which began from Koderma, will cover nine districts, including five parliamentary constituencies, some of which include Hazaribag, Barhi, Ramgarh, Bokaro, and will culminate in Ranchi. Speaking to reporters at her residence here, Devi, who is now the minister of state for education, thanked the PM for assigning her with the immense responsibility and assured everyone to work towards the overall betterment of the education system in the country. She also lauded the National Education Policy which was launched last year stating how it will lead to inclusivity in education. Upon her inclusion in the cabinet, she said for the first time the Koderma seat got representation in the central cabinet. “Modi-Ji has given representation to people belonging to different caste and religion in the cabinet,” she said. Attacking the Congress, she said that they once again emerged as a disruptive force by leading repeated stalling of the recently concluded parliamentary session. State Congress president Alok Dubey mocked the yatra and said, “BJP must organize a yatra to apologise to the country for the all-round mess which it has made in last seven years. Be it jobs, agriculture, education, etc., every sector is battling numerous problems and witnessing negative growth due to shoddy policies of the Modi government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-yatra-to-mark-annapurnas-first-month-in-modi-cabinet/articleshow/85380856.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He has also directed the representatives of various NGOs to establish a proper coordination with each other for better results and emphasised on the role of civil society to eradicate crimes against children. “With collective efforts, vulnerable children can be prevented from falling prey to different social menace and help them enjoy their childhood and succeed in life,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/deoghar-rolls-out-project-to-safeguard-child-rights-on-i-day/articleshow/85381134.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Complete assessment of Covid health infrastructure in districts, says health secretary||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government has directed all administrations of 24 districts to complete the assessment of Covid-19 beds by the end of this week. According to the department of health, medical education and family welfare, the move is in preparation for the predicted third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. In an order on August 14, health secretary Arun Kumar Singh had directed the deputy commissioners of the districts to assess the number of Covid-19 beds, inclusive of those government health facilities and private hospitals, and report it to the department by Monday. However, because of the holidays, the districts have been given time till the end of this week, officials said. State health mission’s managing director Uma Shankar Singh said: “We are expecting to get the requirement analysis reports from the districts in another three to four days. Based on those reports, a state-level review will be conducted under the chairmanship of the health secretary.” Singh’s directive said the districts will have to prepare their assessment reports based on a few parameters set by the Centre with the peak of the second wave as a reference point. They will also need to detail the requirements of adult and paediatric intensive care units (PICU) beds, oxygen-supported beds, ventilators, drugs and other consumables, Singh said. Anticipating that the third wave will affect children, each district hospital has also been directed to set up 20-bed PICUs. The state estimated that it will require 502 high-dependency units for paediatric Covid cases during the third wave. The district administrations were also directed to ensure procurement and stocking up of essential and critical drugs for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. For this purpose, the district health machinery is empowered to procure any critical drug (those recommended for use by the Centre only) for their stock and usage. Among consumables, the order said the district should raise requisitions for items like N95 masks, hand sanitisers, gloves and PPE kits for use by doctors and health workers. Singh also asked the districts to fill up necessary appointments in the state-run hospitals and medical facilities to ensure sufficient manpower to manage any fresh outbreak of the viral infection. “The state is ramping up its preparations to mitigate a predicted third wave of the pandemic amid the continuous unlocking of hospitality services and other sectors, including domestic travel across the states.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: On Independence Day, CM Hemant Soren announces new welfare scheme for farmers||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren announced a new agriculture scheme for the welfare of the state’s farmers during his Independence Day speech on Sunday. Addressing the function at the Morhabadi ground, Soren said, “This year, we are bringing in a new scheme titled Samekit Birsa Gram Vika Yojana cum Krishak Pathshala. In the first phase of the scheme, one agriculture farm in every district will be selected. These will be provided with various state-of-the-art technologies and tools of modern-day farming for horticulture, livestock rearing and pisciculture apart from new irrigation techniques. Through this scheme, the farmers will be provided training and will be empowered to increase their incomes.” Following his announcement, the state department of agriculture, animal husbandry and dairy development on Monday said finer details of the scheme are still being chalked out. An approximate budget of Rs 50 crore has been allotted for the scheme for the ongoing fiscal, the department said. Under the scheme, there is a proposal to utilize the farms owned by the state agriculture department or bring any unutilized cultivable land, which is owned by the state government, into use. “There will be classrooms for the farmers where they will be taught by experts who will be hired via a third party implementing agency. These centres will provide training and hand-holding in various disciplines to the farmers under one roof. This will in turn give the farmers the much-needed exposure,” agriculture secretary Abubacker Siddiqui told TOI. In his address, Soren also said two-lakh farmers of the state have been sanctioned loans worth Rs 587 crore under the Birsa Kisan scheme, which was launched on August 9 this year. “Our government aims to increase the contribution of agriculture-related activities in the state’s GDP to 20% from 12%,” he said, stressing that the government is aiming at providing grants of Rs 147 crore to over 62,000 farmers under the Pashu Dhan Yojana. He added, “Efforts are also underway to set up model cold storages having a net storage capacity of 5,000 metric tonnes in various districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/on-i-day-soren-announces-new-welfare-scheme-for-farmers/articleshow/85382421.cms||Dhritiman Ray

A notice to this effect was pasted on important locations of the coal capital on Sunday. “Any person having any kind of information related to this murder may kindly inform the CBI, special crime-I, New Delhi or its camp office at CSIR Satkar guest house, Dhanbad over phone numbers 7827728856, 011-24368640 and 24368641. Cash award of Rs 5 lakh will be given to persons furnishing worthwhile information relating to the crime,” the poster released on behalf of CBI SP Vijay Kumar Shukla read. Meanwhile, despite getting permission from a special CBI court here, the investigation agency is still preparing to take the two accused, Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma, to Gandhi Nagar for Narco test and brain mapping. Judge Uttam Anand succumbed to the injuries caused by an autorickshaw that hit him from behind while he was jogging by the roadside near Randhir Verma square on July 28. The CCTV footage, that went viral after the incident, clearly shows that the auto took a sudden turn and fled away after hitting the judge from behind, giving rise to the suspicion that the incident may be a case of planned murder. The auto driver arrested by the police confessed to have hit the judge in an inebriated condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cbi-announces-rs-5l-award-for-info-on-dhanbad-judge/articleshow/85381000.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Moreover, hopes for the renewal of the closed Surda mines in the same block brightened on Monday after the state government said it has taken an in-principal decision for the resumption of mining work. However, the mines can restart only after getting a nod from the Centre and environmental clearance. The Surda mines are owned by Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) and were closed since March 2020, which resulted in taking away the jobs of roughly 1,500 people. The development came after Ghatshila MLA Ramdas Soren met state mining secretary Pooja Singhal over the issue following consent from chief minister Hemant Soren. After their meeting, a statement of the IPR department issued in the evening said, “The MLA and the mining secretary held a discussion to restart the closed mines of Hindustan Copper Limited located at Surda in Ghatshila. They also discussed the auctioning of the panna mines. The state government will renew the mining lease of HCL and send it for clearance to the Centre. The mining process can be resumed after getting environmental clearance.” Talking to TOI over the phone, Ramdas said Hindustan Copper Limited is one of the major PSUs of the Kolhan division but was grounded since March last year. “After meeting the chief minister and the mining secretary, I am expecting that the mining lease of HCL will be renewed in a fortnight and a proposal will be sent to the Union government to seek stage II environmental clearance immediately. Without the clearance, mining work can’t start. The state government is committed to generating employment and is hopeful of its revival soon,” he said. The auction process of the panna mines, too, will be completed in two months, the IPR statement said. “The state government aims to complete the process of auctioning will generate employment for thousands of people. According to records, there is a stock of 11,000 kg of panna in Ghatshila,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-nod-to-auction-emerald-mines-in-e-singhbhum/articleshow/85382377.cms||ASRP Mukesh

He said the solar power systems will be connected to the electricity department grid so that the panchayat also earns money by supplying the excess energy, especially on weekends when the panchayat office is shut. “We want to set an example to villagers to go solar by following what the panchayat has done. It’s time people start using green energy by installing solar panels so that they don’t have to depend on the electricity department’s erratic supply,” Martins said.

According to official records, in most cases investigation is still pending while in some, charge sheets have either been filed or likely to be filed shortly. “The number of triple talaq cases in Hyderabad are still less. But it is quite possible that many victims are not coming forward due to social stigma and controversy around the Act,” a senior officer of Hyderabad police told TOI. Shabhana Begum (name changed) among those who approached the police. Married to Somalia-born Abdi Wali Ahmed in 2015, she was promised a comfortable life in the US – where the groom lived– post marriage. But just a few months after the wedding in Hyderabad, Wadi left for the US alone. Distraught, the 24-year-old lodged a complaint with the women's police station in December 2020. “My husband remained inaccessible for a very long time. Then one day he called my father, asked him to put the phone on speaker (after confirming I there) and pronounced triple talaq,” Shabana said. “Ever since, the resident of Chandrayangutta has been making the rounds of police station, trying to initiate action against her foreign-national husband. “While after much persuasion, he agreed to a formal divorce – acceptable in India – in April 2021 he just signed on a plain sheet of a paper, declaring he had divorced me, and sent it on WhatsApp. It is not even valid,” Shabana said, sharing how she cannot move on with her life, unless this is officially settled. As of now, her case is still under police investigation and chargesheet is yet to be filed. While in another case registered with the LB Nagar police in July 2020, local cops filed a chargesheet against accused Abdul Sami, following a thorough probe, the court is yet to take up the trial. “We have examined both the victim and accused and even gathered evidence to prove the offence,” LB Nagar police told TOI. Sami had pronounced triple talaq to his wife in 2020. Initially the victim filed a case of domestic violence against her husband. Later, she filed another case, after he allegedly pronounced triple talaq. But often, proving these cases is a tough task admit police officials. “That is because there is a possibility of witnesses turning hostile. The chances of scientific evidence in these cases is also less. If the accused is hiding abroad, it only complicates the matter further,” said an official dealing with these case. Given how long drawn the legal battles are, activists working with victims say that many shy away from filing an official complaint, because of this. Monetary constraints is said to be another reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/50-triple-talaq-cases-reported-in-hyderabad-since-passing-of-muslim-women-act-in-2019/articleshow/85388267.cms||Srinath Vudali

While 1,17,570 children in the state do not have access to digital devices, the number stands at 95,283 in Kerala. Having digital access has assumed a lot of significance in pandemic times as schools and colleges were forced to shift to the online mode of teaching. Surprisingly, IT hub Karnataka is third from the bottom according to the data released by the Centre from a survey conducted in the states on children without access to digital devices. In Karnataka, 31,31,098 children do not have access to digital devices, while Bihar has the highest number of children (1,43,36,007) without access to digital devices. The survey in West Bengal is still underway and country’s largest state Uttar Pradesh, does not have any data. In May, this year, the Union government released a detailed plan for conducting the survey. The app-based survey, identified schoolchildren, their main sources and resource sharing. However, experts opine that having access to the digital medium is different from having good access to digital content, particularly in the context of the Covid- 19 pandemic. “We don’t know how long this pandemic situation lasts, but there will be more emphasis on online education in the future as well. “Children not only in Telangana but across the country do not have access to high-quality, low-cost digital education content; a lot of work needs to be done in this area,” said M Kiran Kumar, chief executive officer of Five Mantra Learning Academy. Interestingly Niti Aayog had said that some aspects of teaching should shift to the online mode in future. On the flip side, Telangana has a concern as the dropout rate in the upper primary level (9-10th classes) among the boys is high, at 14 % in 2019-20. However, only 10% of girls dropped out of school the same year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-fares-better-in-providing-kids-access-to-digital-devices/articleshow/85388380.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The government would take all measures to ensure that the murderer of B.Tech student N Ramya faced toughest punishment as per the law, she said. “Government will not let culprits in crimes against women go scot-free,” she said. The minister consoled the family of the victim at government general hospital here on Monday and promised all support. She handed over the 10 lakh ex gratia cheque to the kin. Speaking to the media, Sucharitha said the murder of young girl has shaken the state. “We are all shocked because the victim is a young student. We have been ensuring safety of girls and women by initiating various measures. Still, unfortunate incidents are taking place as some criminals are on the prowl in our neighbourhood. Only capital punishment seems appropriate for such monsters,” she said. She criticised the opposition for politicising such gruesome incidents and also faulted its leaders for ‘undermining’ the Disha Act. She said 18 Disha police stations would be set up once the Act was cleared by the Parliament. The minister also said forensic science laboratories (FSL) would come up in Tirupati, Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada. Entire prosecution will be completed within 58 days once the new Act gets nod. Sucharitha said police arrested the accused within 24 hours of the incident. “We will ensure that he doesn’t escape the law,” she added. She said chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had directed the police not to spare anyone involved in offences against women. “The CM granted ex gratia only to share the pain of the family and extend moral support. We wanted to show that the government was with them,” said the home minister. She added the police had arrested the accused in the Tadepalle rape incident. She urged the girls and women not to go to secluded places alone and not to engage in discussions with strangers on social media.

---||Chennai||Those trained in patashalas can be priests too: Tamil Nadu govt||CHENNAI: Only those candidates who have formally completed training as ‘archakas’ have been appointed as priests of various temples across the state, Tamil Nadu government informed Madras high court on Monday. The prospective candidates should have completed the formal training either in a state-run centre to become priests or in other patashalas, the state said. The government made the submission on a plea moved by All India Adi Saiva Sivachariyargal Seva Sangam challenging the insistence of 38 temples in the state, that a person to be eligible to be appointed as a priest must have completed a certification course in ‘Agama Sastras’. When the plea came up for hearing on Monday, Tamil Nadu advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram submitted that similar pleas had already been pending before the first bench of the court and hence the present petition could be tagged along with those pleas. Recording the submission, the court directed the registry to forward the plea to the first bench. According to the petitioner, such a condition insisted by the 38 temples was only to eliminate ‘Sivachariyars’ who get trained by religious gurus from a young age from being appointed as priests. Noting that ‘Sivachariyars’ are an independent lot constituting a separate denomination, the petitioner said, “From time immemorial, Sivachariyar were believed to be slaves of Lord Shiva and their primary duty was to perform puja in Saivite temples as per the Agamas and Vedas. Sivachariyas, who are experienced in agamas, do not undergo any certificate course. Instead, they obtain diksha from the guru of their sect at a very early age and undergo rigorous vedic education for a minimum period of three years, the association said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/those-trained-in-patashalas-can-be-priests-too-tamil-nadu/articleshow/85388460.cms||---

All GOs issued henceforth would not be uploaded on the government’s official portal (goir.ap.gov.in). An order to this effect was issued by principal secretary Revu Mutyala Raju on Monday. The order, to be implemented with immediate effect, was taken in line with the “system prevailing in other states and Government of India with regard to government orders and office memoranda,” the principal secretary said in the order. Mutyala Raju further said that the system of generating GO numbers and display of government orders should be done as per the AP secretariat office manual and the AP government business rules. “The system of generating numbers from the GOIR website is hereby dispensed with,” the order added. The principal secretary asked all departments in the secretariat to take action and not post any government orders on the website and to keep the GOs issued on day-to-day basis on offline mode. The system of uploading GOs on the government’s official portal has been in place since 2008. Barring some confidential GOs, all other documents can be accessed at the click of a button by the public. While the reason behind the government’s move to keep the GOs offline is not known, sources say the decision was taken to keep away some ‘trouble makers’, who, the government feels, are filing pleas in the court leading to unnecessary delay in their implementation. In some cases, the courts have even cancelled the GOs, causing inconvenience to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/from-now-all-government-orders-to-go-offline-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/85388497.cms||Gopi Dara

Because of severed wings or extreme loss of blood, a number of bird deaths were also reported, said officials. Despite the glass-coated string being banned in 2017, it is still available in Delhi’s markets. TimesViewThe Chinese manjha is banned. But it keeps making an appearance during festive occasions. Authorities must enforce the ban more strictly to protect both human beings and birds.At Jain Bird Hospital in Chandni Chowk, over 150 injured birds were brought on Sunday, which had suffered injuries from manjha, while over 100 such cases had arrived on Monday. Dr Haravtar Singh Samra, a doctor at the hospital, says there appears to be no significant reduction in the usage of the manjha this year and 15 deaths have been reported within the last 48 hours. “A death may occur due to shock, or due to loss of blood. Some birds are never able to fly again. We have received pigeons, crows and kites,” said Samra, adding that “over 100 injured birds were brought to the hospital on August 13 and 14.” Wildlife Rescue, a bird hospital catering only to raptors, says the number of cases is expected to increase considerably in the next few days. The centre received 24 injured raptors on Independence Day. “Injury cases that occur on August 15 are generally not reported on the same day or the day after. As people start discovering injured birds, they bring them to us. We sometimes receive such cases even in the last week of August,” said Nadeem Shehzad, who handles the centre. Shehzad says injured birds, largely kites and eagles, had been arriving at the centre from the first week of August itself. “Kite flying starts early and we saw a lot of kites on Independence Day this year. Out of these, a number of people are still using glass-coated manjha, which is deadly for birds,” he said, adding that “more injuries are expected on Raksha Bandhan”. A PETA India spokesperson said that despite the ban, the manjha’s sale and distribution had continued in Delhi, with calls regarding birds getting injured due to glass-coated string still being received on their helpline numbers. PETA India had assisted Delhi Police in seizing hundreds of kilograms of banned manjha from Lal Kuan Bazaar recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/strings-attached-to-joy-banned-manjha-injures-hundreds-of-birds-cuts-short-lives/articleshow/85384455.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Rodrigues in a letter to the governor stated that all Raj Bhavans across the country and even the Rashtrapati Bhavan come under the purview of the act, which was enacted to ensure transparency and accountability in governance. For over a decade the Goa Raj Bhavan has not been submitting itself to this claiming that it is not a public authority in terms of the act. The last petition filed by Goa Raj Bhavan claiming that it is not a public authority is pending before the Supreme Court since 2019. When the issue was raised with the Goa State Information Commission, it held that the Goa governor’s office is a public authority under the act. This was challenged by the office in the high court of Bombay at Goa after which the office then approached the SC filing a transfer petition in 2018 stating that there is another matter of similar nature pertaining to the applicability of the RTI Act to the attorney general pending before the Apex Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/petition-to-bring-governors-office-under-rti-purview/articleshow/85384135.cms||---

A total of 15 lakh applications were received for various schemes at the camps, which will run for a month till September 15. This basic monthly income scheme for the woman head of the family is expected to be given to beneficiaries from September 1. According to it, female heads of general category families will be provided Rs 500 monthly and SC, ST and families of Other Backward Classes will be provided Rs 1,000 per month. The scheme would include every household from the SC and ST community. For general category, this income support would be given to all households except “those having at least one tax-paying member (42.3 lakh people) and those owning land more than two hectares (2.8 lakh people)”. This makes around female heads of 1.6 crore households eligible for the scheme. In the Duare Sarkar camps, the enthusiasm of women was spotted for enrolling for the ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’ scheme. There was chaos at Purbasthali in East Burdwan as a large number of women had gathered in one camp from early morning to get their names enrolled for ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’. Similarly, there was chaos at Canning’s Rai Baghini High School campus where a large number of women had turned up and Covid safety norms were not adhered to. Sumit Gupta, the district magistrate of North 24 Parganas, said that around 60,000 applications were received on Monday for ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’. Deepap Priya, the district magistrate of Hooghly, said there were around 50,000 applications. In West Midnapore, there were around 52,700 applications for ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’ in 21 blocks and seven municipalities out of total 87,000 applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/11-lakh-lakshmir-bhandar-applications-pour-in-on-day-1/articleshow/85384985.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘A horrible race against time’: Kolkatan recounts the great escape from Kabul||KOLKATA: When Air India flight AI-244 took off from Kabul’s Hamid Karzai airport for Delhi on Sunday, it was a surreal experience for Sohini Sarkar, a Kolkatan who now lives in the US and was working with an NGO in Afghanistan. Sarkar managed to reach the airport when the Taliban militia started entering Kabul and was lucky to board the last Air India flight which took off in the evening and landed in Delhi around 9pm on Sunday. “It was a horrible race against time,” Sarkar told TOI after reaching a friend’s place in Delhi. “On Saturday night, there were blackouts and massive power outages. I lived close to the airport where US troops are stationed and thought it was a safe place. But on Sunday everything changed. We got an urgent reminder from the US embassy to burn all sensitive documents related to staffers and beneficiaries and leave as soon as possible. It was a horrible situation. Some of my colleagues went to banks to withdraw money but the banks had crashed. We sent the Afghan nationals home from office even as some of us frantically tried to destroy all documents. It was just a matter of hours,” recounts Sarkar. “Usually it takes 15-20 minutes to reach the airport from where I lived in Kabul but on Sunday the stretch was packed with thousands of cars and it took over an hour. Thankfully, there were no attacks or checkpoints yet. But I have learnt the Taliban have set up a post just 100m from where I lived,” said Sarkar, who grew up in Naktala where her mother still lives, and studied at Presidency College. ‘Things changed drastically overnight’Sarkar initially had plans to leave Afghanistan on August 21 as the US had said its troops would leave the country by the end of August. “Nobody anticipated Afghanistan would be overrun so soon. Even when Jalalabad was captured we thought that with US troops still in the country the Taliban would not enter Kabul, but things changed drastically overnight,” said the Presidency College alumni, who had been working in Afghanistan since 2009. Personally, it was traumatic to leave knowing fully well that her national team would not be able to get out, she said. “I knew I couldn’t help them escape what I was myself escaping. I was leaving behind colleagues who have become friends and that was the toughest part. Our male colleagues were in tears and asked me to pray for them,” said Sarkar. She recalled how terrified her female colleagues were. “They were doing well for themselves, but their dreams are now shattered,” she said. Sarkar is now worried about the fate of her colleagues and their families, some of whom are already being targeted and threatened for working with American organisations. “It is they who had dreams of rebuilding their lives, create a modern nation. This is not what common Afghans deserve. It is their fate that needs to be told,” she said, adding that beyond all the politics and discussions on what went wrong, world leaders must address this humanitarian catastrophe as lives of journalists, civil rights activists, artists and common Afghans are at stake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-horrible-race-against-time-kolkatan-recounts-the-great-escape-from-kabul/articleshow/85384780.cms||Dipawali Mitra

---||Kolkata||Kolkata’s Kabuliwalas pray for family & friends back home||KOLKATA: As news of the Taliban entering Kabul and taking over the presidential palace came in on Sunday afternoon, Dildar Khan, a tall, strapping Afghan knelt down on the ground to offer namaz on the Maidan, thousands of miles away. Dressed in a voluminous Pathani, as he folded his hands and raised them in the air to pray, his eyes turned moist with the thought of his younger bother and his family in the provincial town of Mazar-i-Sharif, along with millions of other Afghans back in his country who have been hurled into uncertainty with the withdrawal of American forces and the subsequent Taliban takeover. Afghan people in Kolkata.“My watan (country) is going through another azmaish (test) but we are a resilient tribe who will fight these forces. I prayed today for the well-being of my younger brother and his family and millions of Afghans whose future might have become uncertain again,” said Dildar, a second-generation Afghan in Kolkata. Close to 50 Afghan men in their Pathanis, embroidered waistcoats and huge turbans with fantails joined Dildar in the prayers with a heavy heart on Sunday afternoon. They congregate on the Maidan every Sunday to play cricket and sing Pashto ballads. But their hearts were heavy this Sunday. “Two decades ago, with the defeat of the Taliban, we had hoped that there would be a new beginning for our motherland. Many youngsters had started to dream of a prosperous future in their own country. Now, everything seems uncertain again,” said Yahya Gul after offering namaz. The Afghan diaspora in Kolkata now is around 7,000 strong. Many buildings in Chandni Chowk, Madan Street, Bentinck Street and other parts of central Kolkata are still identified as Pathan kothis, where these men stay in commune-like arrangements. A very anxious week, say city AfghansEven now, for many Bengalis, the image of an Afghan conjures up Rahmat Khan, the fictional Kabuliwala from Tagore’s eponymous story, later made into a popular movie starring Chhabi Biswas in the titular role. Here, Rahmat, a dry-fruits seller from Kabul, befriends a little girl, Mini, who reminds him of the daughter he left behind in Afghanistan. Afghans have been coming to Kolkata for centuries selling dry fruits, asafoetida and carpets. But most men are now in the business of lending money on interest, becoming an integral part of a micro-economy of Kolkata’s working population. A file picture of Afghans enjoying a pleasant afternoon on the Maidan“This has been a very anxious week for us, watching the developments back home on television. We are trying to remain in touch with our families and relatives back home but very little information is coming in,” said Shadab Khan. Several senior Kabuliwalas recalled the fall of Kabul in the mid-1990s and said the sequence of events then made them more anxious. “Mohammed Najibullah Ahmedzai was the president of Afghanistan between 1987 and 1992. The Taliban, after capturing Kabul in 1996, executed him and brutalised his body under full international glare. We just hope the same brutalities are not repeated now,” said Amir Khan, who has been staying in Kolkata for over four decades. People from Bengal trapped in Kabul: ReportsSome people from Bengal could be trapped in Kabul and are still waiting to be evacuated, preliminary reports indicated on Monday. Darjeeling MP Raju Bista has also written a letter on this to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, naming two persons with their passport and phone numbers. The numbers remained unreachable. In Darjeeling, Bandana Rai Thapa complained that her husband Chandra Kumar was stuck in Kabul after he went to work as a security guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkatas-kabuliwalas-pray-for-family-friends-back-home/articleshow/85384747.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||TMC kicks off 1-person-1-post formula in massive org revamp||Kolkata: Cabinet ministers Jyotipriyo Mullick, Pulak Ray, Swapan Debnath and Soumen Mahapatra were replaced as district party presidents and minister Arup Ray was replaced as the district chairperson on Monday as Trinamool Congress brought in the one-person-one-post formula in its latest organisational rejig by replacing several old guards with new faces. The party also split up 16 district organisations in multiple zones, with North 24 Parganas being divided into four party organisational zones. After the August 5 party meeting, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee had first indicated that the one-person-one-post formula had been ratified by CM Mamata Banerjee. Since then, it wasn’t clear when the senior ministers, who had been helming the party in their districts as presidents for over a decade now, would be replaced. Mullick, the state forest minister, has been replaced by four district presidents who will take charge of the four organisational zones — Barackpore-DumDum, Barasat, Bashirhat and Bongaon. Partha Bhowmik, the Naihati MLA, will lead the key Dum Dum-Barrackpore zone which covers the district’s industrial zones and Ashani Mukherjee takes charge of Barasat, which will also cover Salt Lake and New Town. TMC Lok Sabha party leader Sudip Bandopadhyay was dropped as the North Kolkata district president and made chairman of the district committee. Baranagar MLA and former state minister Tapas Ray was appointed as the new district chief of North Kolkata. The Trinamool Youth Congress also underwent sweeping changes with all leaders above 40 years being axed from their posts and new chiefs appointed in several district units. Howrah, Nadia and Hooghly also witnessed largescale changes. Lagan Deo Singh takes charge as Howrah (urban) chairperson replacing Arup Ray while Kalyanendu Ghosh, who defeated Rajib Banerjee in Domjur, will be the district president. In Nadia, MP Mahua Moitra will be replaced by two district presidents — in Nadia North and Nadia South. Hooghly will have new district presidents in Arambagh zone and Hooghly-Srirampore zone. Dilip Yadav has been replaced. Interestingly East Midnapore will now have a Tamluk and a Contai organisational district. The party presidents of several districts, including Cooch Behar, Purulia, Paschim Medinipur, Bankura, Jhargram, Malda, Murshidabad and North and South Dinajpur were removed, and fresh faces given charge. Abhishek had proposed the one-person-one-post formula in the party to allow party leaders not to juggle with multiple roles. “We are pleased to announce the new organisational appointments at state & district level for West Bengal. We remain indebted to all outgoing members for their valuable contribution. Best wishes to all new appointees! #OnePersonOnePost,” the party’s official Twitter handle posted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-kicks-off-1-person-1-post-formula-in-massive-org-revamp/articleshow/85384777.cms||---

After meeting CM Banerjee, Sushmita said: “Clearly she has an excellent future vision for the party, and I hope to be helpful in this regard.” Sushmita added: “I arrived in Kolkata this morning. I was accompanied by MP Derek O’Brien. I had the opportunity to meet Abhishek Banerjee, who is the party general secretary. He has an excellent vision and clarity for the party.

On Sunday, Sushmita submitted her resignation from Congress’ primary membership in a letter to party interim president Sonia Gandhi. She thanked its leaders, members and workers and said she would cherish the three-decade-long association with the party. Sushmita also expressed gratitude to Sonia and wrote: “Madam, I thank you, personally, for your guidance and the opportunities you gave me. I value the enriching experience; I hope I have your good wishes as I begin a new chapter in my life of public service.” A party leader dismissed speculations in some quarters that Sushmita had been promised a Trinamool Rajya Sabha nomination. “No specifics or conditions were discussed,” the leader said.  Sushmita might have lost the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Silchar but had bagged over 4 lakh votes, a leader said. Silchar has been the epicentre of anti-CAA protests, which had prompted Trinamool to send an MPs’ delegation in August 2018 that was detained at Silchar airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/day-after-quitting-cong-sushmita-dev-joins-tmc/articleshow/85384832.cms||---
