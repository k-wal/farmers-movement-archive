---||Bengaluru||Amitabh Bachchan’s former Rolls-Royce released on payment of Rs 5.5k fine in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: One of the seven high-end cars that were seized for alleged lack of proper documentation in a high-profile operation by senior RTO officers at UB City on Sunday, was released on Friday. It may be recalled that the RTO officers had tom-tommed the seizure of the cars, including a Land Rover, Porsche, Jaguar and Rolls-Royce Phantom, claiming they were plying without taxes being paid, lacked proper documentation and insurance. All seized vehicles were parked at Yelahanka RTO. The Rolls-Royce Phantom (MH 02 BB 2), which was once owned by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, was released after its current owner paid a fine of Rs 5,500 for not having a pollution certificate and its insurance cover having lapsed. “Of the Rs 5,500, the owner paid Rs 3,000 for not having pollution certificate, Rs 500 for no registration certificate and Rs 2,000 for not having insurance,” said an official. However, top RTO officials were either unavailable or not aware of the Rolls-Royce Phantom being released. “We took risks and seized these cars without any documents, but senior officials released them due to pressure from the top. We are demoralised,” said an RTO official. “A vehicle is not permitted to ply with another state registration number beyond 11 months from the date of migration,” he said. Narendra Holkar, additional transport commissioner (enforcement), said, “We did our duty. The owners failed to produce documents so we seized the cars. I don’t have any information on the release of cars.” Transport commissioner N Shiva Kumar was not available for comments. Owner of another car seized on Sunday is believed to have paid around Rs 30 lakh motor vehicle tax and got it released. However, there is no information about the other vehicles. TOI checked the details of all seized vehicles through Vahan portal on Friday and found for most of them, insurance has still not been renewed. Officials said for each car, insurance of Rs 4-Rs 5 lakh per year and MV tax of around Rs 30 lakh was to be paid. Of the seven seized vehicles, five were registered in Puducherry, where road tax is less, and two in Maharashtra. Insurance cover had expired for most cars. Two cars of a Mangaluru-based businessman and legislative council member were reportedly among those seized. The white Rolls-Royce Phantom was gifted to the Bollywood star by filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra on the success of his film Eklavya in 2007. Bachchan reportedly sold it to Yusuf Shariff alias D Babu of Umrah Developers in 2019, but the car remains in the actor’s name, officials had said. When the Rolls-Royce Phantom was caught on Sunday, its driver identified himself as Salman Khan from Vasanthnagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bachchans-former-rolls-royce-released-on-payment-of-5-5k-fine/articleshow/85698386.cms||---

Discussing the recent developments in Afghanistan and its implications for the region and the world after the Taliban captured power there, they strongly condemned the horrific terror attack at the Kabul International Airport on Thursday and emphasised the need to ensure the safe repatriation of stranded people, an official statement said. It added, "They stressed upon the need for international cooperation, including at the level of the G20, in addressing the humanitarian crisis and long-term security concerns arising out of the developments in Afghanistan." In a telephonic conversation, the two leaders also discussed other important issues on the G20 agenda, such as climate change. In this context, they exchanged views on other forthcoming multilateral engagements too, such as COP-26. Modi tweeted, "Spoke with Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and discussed the need for a coordinated international response to recent developments in Afghanistan.

---||Goa||Ishan Pandita on his way to Jamshedpur FC||Panaji: FC Goa have agreed an undisclosed fee with Jamshedpur FC for the transfer of Ishan Pandita. The Goa striker grabbed attention last season after coming on as a late substitute. Despite playing only 131 minutes in 11 matches, he scored four goals and is now looking at a club where he will get more minutes on the field. “Goa have agreed a transfer fee with Jamshedpur FC,” a source told TOI late on Friday. “Now it’s only a matter of time before Jamshedpur agrees personal terms with the player. It’s likely to be a two-year contract.” Jamshedpur, however, were not the only club interested in Pandita’s services. According to sources, ATK Mohun Bagan also made an official offer to the club, while SC East Bengal’s interest is no secret. “Ishan needs game time, so Jamshedpur looks like the best option. The coach (Owen Coyle) has assured the player that there is place for him in the team,” said another source. Pandita will have to battle the likes of Nerijus Valskis and Jordan Murray for a spot in the Jamshedpur starting 11. At Goa, coach Juan Ferrando couldn’t guarantee him more time on the field. The departure of Pandita, 23, will disappoint Goa fans, but club officials believe they have enough reinforcements. The big hope is that Devendra Murgaonkar will step into his boots and do much more than the goal he scored against SC East Bengal last season. It’s no secret, though, that Goa will count heavily on Spanish striker Airam Cabrera to deliver the goods. Last season, particularly in the AFC Champions League, it was proved that the club can rely on Jorge Ortiz to play in that position, so many believe there’s adequate cover upfront. Pandita arrived in Goa after working his way through the youth system in Spain where he found a place for himself at Lorca FC in the third tier. The super sub’s impressive performances in ISL were enough to catch the eye of national coach Igor Stimac who summoned him for national duty and handed him his international debut against Oman in a 1-1 draw. Pandita scored for the national team in a 2-0 win against Mohammedan Sporting at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ishan-pandita-on-his-way-to-jamshedpur-fc/articleshow/85699349.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||Evacuations resume at Kabul airport||ISLAMABAD: The final stage of US-led evacuations from Kabul airport in Afghanistan resumed on Friday morning, a day after devastating suicide bombings left more than 100 people dead and over 200 injured. The evacuations and foreign troop withdrawals are planned to be completed by August 31, a deadline agreed with the Taliban. The halt in airlift operations following the explosion and the end in sight for air evacuations had forced many people to head towards the Torkham border crossing with Pakistan, in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province, in an attempt to flee Taliban rule in the country. At Torkham, Pakistani forces opened fire on Afghans when they rushed towards the crossing gate. Afghan media outlets reported that six Afghans were killed and several injured. Several thousand Afghans are said to have fled into Pakistan using the Spin Boldak crossing point in southern Afghanistan. Locals described the scene at Spin Boldak as chaotic, with many of those who had travelled to the border not being allowed to cross into Pakistan. In Kabul, hospitals have been overwhelmed with patients, with fewer staff available as many health experts had left the country after the Taliban grabbed power over a week ago. The condition of many patients was described as critical. A number of families were desperately searching for their loved ones, including children, after the explosion. Meanwhile, reports from Kabul suggest that Taliban leaders have been planning to form an inclusive caretaker government as soon as possible. The caretaker government, according to the Taliban, will have an "Amir-ul Momineen" (Commander of the Faithful) to lead the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They said a supreme leadership council has been convened to decide the form of the future government and to nominate ministers. The focus currently is on nominations to key ministries, including law, defence, foreign affairs, finance, information and national security. The insurgent group is considering the names of the sons of several non-Pashtun warlords and tribal chiefs to be part of the caretaker setup. The group has not clarified the duration of the interim government. There are also reports that the US has been insisting on bringing in some members of previous governments led by former presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani. The CIA chief, according to Taliban sources, had suggested to Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar (a co-founder of the Taliban movement) during his recent visit to Kabul that he include members from past governments in the interim setup.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/evacuations-resume-at-kabul-airport/articleshow/85699440.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||India's outreach in Afghanistan aimed to harm Pakistan: Pakistan Army||ISALAMABAD: Pakistan’s military said on Friday that India has "no love lost" for the Afghan population and alleged that its actions in Afghanistan were solely intended to harm Pakistan. Addressing a press conference on Afghanistan’s situation in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar, the Pakistan Army’s spokesperson, said India’s role in the war-torn country was "extremely negative". "We need to understand what has been India’s role in Afghanistan. I think whatever investment they made in Afghanistan and the kind of clout they developed, it was all done with one intention — to harm Pakistan," he alleged, adding that they (India) have no love lost for Afghan people. "India poisoned the minds of the Afghan leadership, its intelligence agencies, as well as the army, thus giving rise to negative statements against Pakistan," he claimed. The military spokesman alleged that India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), together with Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS), had extended help to terrorist organisations, like the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Daesh (Islamic State), among others, to conspire against Pakistan. "The entire goal was to hurt Pakistan. If they (Afghanistan’s spy agency) were doing their own job, they would have been much better prepared to take on what’s happening today," he claimed. The spokesman said that Pakistan had been reaching out to the Afghan government to formalise a border control mechanism, including intelligence-sharing, but "we" did not receive a positive response. "We offered it (army training) several times but only six cadets came. However, hundreds and thousands of Afghan Army soldiers went for training to India and several Indian Army training teams were placed in Afghanistan to train Afghan forces," he said, emphasising that peace in Pakistan was directly linked to peace in Afghanistan. The spokesperson, moreover, said that while the country’s armed forces were conducting security operations on the western border, there were "massive" ceasefire violations (CFVs) on its eastern border.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/indias-outreach-in-afghanistan-aimed-to-harm-pakistan-pakistan-army/articleshow/85699681.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Google corrects Maps after Kannada Development Authority nudge||By- S Bhuvaneshwari BENGALURU: Kannada Development Authority (KDA) chairman TS Nagabharana has written to Google India, Bengaluru, asking the technology major to correct the wrongly spelt names of cities, towns and villages of Karnataka in Kannada on its Google Maps application and web-mapping platform. The authority said it has noticed names of several cities, towns and villages of Karnataka wrongly spelt on Google Maps and that they need to be rectified. KDA has also offered Google assistance in this regard.  Nowadays, Google Maps has been effectively helping everyone, including tourists, and there is a danger that people will continue to use the misspelt names of places, assuming they are correct and that might become the norm, KDA officials said. “On August 21, we wrote to Google to correct the names of places in Karnataka and are waiting for their response,” Nagabharana said, adding: “Whenever we ask them about such mistakes, they cite some technical issues.” Nagabharana also expressed dissatisfaction over the fact that no contact number of Google India was available except their address. He cited several examples of wrongly spelt names on Google Maps: Whitefield becoming Whittyfyeld, Ripponpete as Ripponpeta, Harnahalli as Hanahalli, Tumakuru as Tumakura, Kuppalli as Kuppali, Honnali as Honnalli, Saundatti Yellamma as Soundatti Yellamma and Gurmitkal as Gumatkal. According to Nagabharana, Mangaluru is still written Mangalore in English on Google Maps. Nagabharana said he has also enclosed a list of the misspelt names with the letter and added that just terming every mistake a ‘technical issue’ is not correct. He said they should appoint somebody to look into such mistakes, or take the help of some organisation. “They may also claim that the mistakes occur as open sources contribute to it, but when they use content from open sources, it is their responsibility to correct the mistakes,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/google-corrects-maps-after-kda-nudge/articleshow/85700176.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: College management and teaching staff to be trained to guide students on National Education Policy||BENGALURU: The higher education department will train college managements and teachers on the new format of National Education Policy (NEP) and they can in turn counsel students. The NEP implementation plan was explained by the commissioner of collegiate education, P Pradeep, at a meet organised for the media by minister for higher education CN Ashwath Narayan. Answering queries on how the policy will be implemented, the commissioner said work- shops for affiliate-colleges have begun in several universities across the state. “Workshops have been held in Bengaluru North University, Dharwad, Mangaluru, and Tumakuru, among others,” he said. The government has come under criticism for rushing with NEP without a proper roadmap or groundwork. The allegation is that Karnataka government’s haste to be the first in India to implement the policy has resulted in several problems. However, denying the allegation, the minister said: “We are ready to roll out NEP. We did not intentionally launch it to be no. 1 in the country. We thought everyone was working on it, we did not realise we would be the first... NEP was launched in 2020. Since then, we have been planning to kickstart it from 2021. We began working on it, even though the pandemic delayed things a bit. The Centre has given 15 years to complete NEP implementation; we are hoping to finish it in 10.” Implementation phase“The model curriculum is almost ready and will be released in September first week. The board of studies of universities can tweak it according to their needs. We have been interacting with universities and teachers and inculcating confidence in them. There will be no problem in executing it from October 1,” said Thimme Gowda, vice-chairman, Karnataka State Higher Education Council. Special helplines will be set up at university and college levels; social media handles and websites will be created. Task forces will be formed under the leadership of VCs to clarify doubts. Electives from other streamsOn how single-discipline colleges will offer electives from other streams, officials said colleges can collaborate with neighbourhood institutions offering those streams. “Just like school clusters are mooted, colleges can collaborate with their neighbourhood institutions. However, this might take time and may not be possible this year. In case private colleges want to collaborate, they are free to do so,” said the commissioner. Language policyOn the language policy, the minister said: “In primary classes, we have a three-language policy and in higher education, two. Kannada is mandatory for four semesters in degrees. It will only be functional Kannada for non-native speakers like in VTU... Students are anyway studying in English medium, they needn’t take English as the second language, so they can opt for other languages,” he said. On budget constraintsAsked about budget constraints in rolling out NEP, the minister said: “It’s not dependent on funds, it is about maximum utilisation of existing resources in giving flexibility to the existing system. To bridge the digital divide, since 2019, we are giving devices. Digitalisation in education has been given utmost priority. Benchmarking should be done by government institutions.” The model curriculum will only be 10-15% different from the existing syllabus and teachers are already being trained in the new format, said department officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/college-mgmts-and-teaching-staff-to-be-trained-to-guide-students-on-nep/articleshow/85700311.cms||---

What’s worse is that this is the second time in two months that they are having to bear the brunt of flooding. After a downpour of about 30 minutes, water started gushing into S Meenakshi’s house. This is after the road was completely inundated around 8pm. “I was braving the rain to prevent debris from getting into my house. This is the least I could do, as the water comes in with such force that there is no stopping it. The fear is I have an 82-year-old mother-in-law, who will not be able to help herself if I’m out of town,” Meenakshi lamented. She further claimed: “This problem of flooding started only after Rhenius Street was taken up for civic work by Bengaluru Smart City Limited. We really want to know what went wrong and how it can be fixed.” “My son, who was at work, rushed home as soon as he heard what happened. I then called a contractor, who arrived with two men and all of us removed bucketsfull of water manually. This took us four hours,” Meenakshi added. Another resident, who lives on a lane off Rhenius Street, said, “I have been living in this house for over 60 years and until two months ago, we never faced such an issue. Water entered our homes two months ago after a spell of rain. We didn’t face a great deal of damage. However, things like our carpet got soiled. After this incident, the then chief engineer from Bengaluru Smart City Limited visited us and helped resolve the problem of flooding.” The chief engineer of Bengaluru Smart City Limited said t he was not informed about the situation on Rhenius Street and will look into the matter immediately and visit the place on Saturday. Friday showers hit trafficAfter the city received an early-evening shower on Friday, several streets reported waterlogging. Motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, had a tough time navigating flooded roads. The problem was acute on Ballari Road, Guttahalli Road and Annaswamy Mudaliar Road. The city received 9.8mm rainfall and HAL Airport 6.2 mm till 8.30pm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/rainwater-gushes-into-homes-locals-blame-civic-work/articleshow/85700356.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

Based on their complaint, cops registered an FIR against the unidentified men under different sections, including IPC’s 364A (kidnapping for ransom). Shanis Usman Kutty and Mohammed Shaheen Hamza, both aged 23, said they had come to Bengaluru in their SUV for personal work on August 23 night. “The miscreants first blocked our SUV near Anepalya and fought with us. Later, they stopped us again on Museum Road, off Church Street, and drove the SUV to a desolate place on Hosur Road. There they forced us to transfer Rs 10 lakh into their Google account and other bank accounts,” the complaint read. “Further, the men took us to some other place and forced us to smoke ganja.

---||World||Who are the IS-K, the terrorist group behind the Kabul blasts?||ISLAMABAD: The Islamic State of Khorasan (IS-K), which has claimed responsibility for recent bombings in Kabul, has been locked in bloody battles with the Taliban for some time in areas in Afghanistan that border Pakistan. What is IS-K?The terror organisation had originally emerged in Pakistan in 2015 as a group of young fighters belonging to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a conglomerate of several militant groups. The military offensives against the TTP in Pakistan’s northwest had forced them to cross into Afghanistan, where they had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) and its then chief, Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi, in 2014. Since then, the group had absorbed terrorists into their network and had announced expansion into Central Asia as IS-K. When the IS was at its height in Iraq and Syria, it was reportedly providing funds to its regional affiliate in Afghanistan. That support had dried up much earlier but the IS leadership in Syria and Iraq remains in contact with the IS-K. The name Khorasan translates to "The Land of the Sun." Khorasan refers to a historical region that includes parts of Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, NYT reports. Prior to Thursday’s explosions, there were reports that the Taliban had intercepted and gunned down several IS-K fighters at their checkpoints around Kabul airport. Hours later, at least 28 Taliban fighters were among more than 100 people injured in the blasts outside Kabul airport. How are IS-K and the Taliban different?The two militant groups are separated by ideological differences. The IS-K, considered to be the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan, follows the Salafist movement of Islam, while the Taliban adhere to the Deobandi school of thought. The Taliban, at least for now, want to establish an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan. The IS-K, however, is striving to establish a caliphate in South and Central Asia and then to take their holy war (jihad) against non-Muslims and their Muslim supporters to other parts of the world. Who are the IS-K’s enemies?The IS-K claims that the Taliban had betrayed the cause of jihad by entering into a peace agreement with the US and vows to continue their fight against them in Afghanistan. ISIS-K openly fought with other extremist Islamic organisations, like the Taliban. ISIS-K has been antagonistic mostly toward the Taliban, and the two groups have fought for turf, particularly in eastern Afghanistan, NYT reports. Since 2017, experts say, ISIS-K has been responsible for roughly 250 clashes with US, Afghan and Pakistani security forces. More recently, ISIS-K leaders have denounced the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, saying that the group’s version of Islamic rule was insufficiently hard line. How many men does IS-K have?There are different claims on the number of IS-K fighters in Afghanistan. Earlier, it was claimed that the group had less than 2,000 fighters in the country. Later, when the Taliban had started negotiations with the US in Doha, many hardcore Taliban and TTP fighters had joined its ranks. In 2016, a year after it was founded, ISIS-K was at its peak size, with about 3,000 to 4,000 fighters, according to analyst estimates. That figure was cut in half after the group was targeted by American airstrikes and Afghan commando raids, according to the NYT. The IS-K’s first fight against the Taliban had occurred in 2017, when they drove the Taliban out of Tora Bora, a mountainous region where Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden had taken refuge to escape American airstrikes following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US. The area, however, was soon recaptured by the Taliban, but the two sides have been bitter enemies since then. In May this year, Taliban militants had joined US and Afghan government forces in driving the IS-K out of parts of northeastern Afghanistan. What has IS-K been doing?Of late, the group has been busy on the terror front and has carried out dozens of deadly attacks in Afghanistan in recent years. In May the group had accepted responsibility for an attack on a Kabul school attended primarily by Shia girls that left 85 people dead and more than 300 injured. In June, IS-K militants had ambushed and killed 10 people working with an anti-landmine NGO in Baghlan province, northern Afghanistan. Last year, IS fighters had gunned down a number of pregnant women, nurses and babies at a maternity hospital in Kabul.

Banks, a former US Navy reservist who served in Afghanistan, was a foreign military sales officer who was on the front lines of acquiring equipment that the Americans provided and turned over to the Afghan army and police. "This is so painful to me and other Afghan veterans who served in helping the Afghans. We now know that due to the negligence of this US administration, the Taliban now has access to over $85 billion worth of American military equipment. That includes includes 75,000 vehicles, over 200 airplanes and helicopters, and over 600,000 small arms and light weapons. The Taliban now has more Black Hawk helicopters than 85% of the countries in the world. They don’t just have weapons. They also have night-vision goggles, body armour, medical supplies," he said in a speech in Washington. "Unbelievably and unfathomable to me and so many others, is that the Taliban now has biometric devices, which have the fingerprints, eye scans and the biographical information of the Afghans who helped us over the last 20 years," Banks said. "This administration still has no plan to get this military equipment back." As 1,000 British troops get ready to withdraw, it is understood Britain will also be leaving behind some low-grade military supplies. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said: "We have got to start taking the British military equipment out as we start to draw down. The Americans have a clear timetable and we will be out before the US. Obviously we have come with equipment. One of the challenges I had was that I needed as many hours as possible to get Afghans and British nationals out and the tradeoff is how much kit do we take out and leave on the ground, or abandon or destroy on the ground, so I can have more hours for the humanitarian as opposed to military."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-have-over-200-us-aircraft-choppers-more-than-600k-small-arms-light-weapons-republican-congressman-banks/articleshow/85700522.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||India||Govt notifies new 'BH' registration series for personal vehicles for seamless transfer across states||NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry notified a new regime of “Bharat series (BH)” for registration of personal vehicles owned by defence personnel, employees of Central and state governments, PSUs and private sector companies and organizations, which have their offices in four or more states and UTs. This scheme will be voluntary. Currently, a person is allowed to keep a vehicle for a maximum of 12 months in any state other than the state where it is registered. The owner has to get such vehicles re-registered before the expiry of 12 months. The pilot scheme of "BH" series was notified with the aim to make the transfer of such vehicles to other states seamless and hassle free. There is a high possibility of such persons getting transferred frequently and they need to take their personal vehicles to other states. The vehicles registered with this new series “BH”, which stands for Bharat won’t require re-registration when the owners are transferred to a new state. The vehicle owners will have the option to go for the “BH” series and in this case they have to pay the road tax for two years or in multiple of two. The entire process will be made online to ensure there is no need to go to the RTOs. TOI on April 28 had first reported this proposed move. Earlier the ministry had proposed an “IN” series. It had also proposed that employees of private firms that have offices in at least five states and UTs would be eligible. In the final notification, the “IN” series has been replaced with “BH”. Currently, while registering private vehicles, the owners need to pay the 15 years’ road tax upfront. If they transfer their vehicles to any other state and go for re-registration, they need to pay the road tax for the remaining years such as 10 or 12 years. Then they need to claim the already paid amount from the state where the vehicle was originally registered. The new regime aims to put an end to this problem. The Centre has not gone for a system where the road tax amount is automatically transferred among states considering that all states need to come on board for this and secondly the road tax slab is different from state to state. In the new “BH” series regime, the ministry has fixed the road tax of 8% for vehicles costing up to Rs 10 lakh, 10% for those costing between Rs 10-20 lakh and 12% for vehicles costing over Rs 20 lakh. There will be 2% extra charge for diesel vehicles and electric vehicles shall be charged 2% less tax.

---||World||Pak FM Qureshi discusses Afghan situation with UN chief, UK foreign minister||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday said that the country will continue to play its constructive role in support of the efforts to promote peace and stability in strife-torn Afghanistan. Qureshi on Friday held a telephonic conversation with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the two leaders exchanged views on the situation in Afghanistan, according to Foreign Office. He said that it was imperative for the international community to remain engaged with Afghanistan, including by supporting the Afghan people's socio-economic and humanitarian needs. The foreign minister appreciated the contribution of the United Nations in addressing the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. UN chief Guterres expressed gratitude for Pakistan's role in facilitating the work and humanitarian mission of UN entities in Afghanistan. He sought Pakistan's continued support in that regard. The Foreign Minister assured Guterres of all possible support to the UN in the fulfilment of its mandate. He highlighted the facilitation being provided by Pakistan to the international community in evacuation and relocation efforts. The Foreign Minister reaffirmed that Pakistan will continue to assist the UN in all possible ways. Separately, Qureshi received a telephone call from Dominic Raab, Secretary for Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Affairs and First Secretary of State of the United Kingdom. Views were exchanged on the latest developments in Afghanistan. Noting that Pakistan was closely following the evolving situation, the Foreign Minister strongly condemned the terrorist attack near the Kabul Airport in which so many precious lives were lost. Two suicide bombers and gunmen attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Thursday, killing more than 100 people, including 13 US troops. The Islamic State's Afghanistan affiliate, dubbed Islamic State Khorasan or ISIS-K, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Foreign Minister underscored that safety, security, stability and protection of the rights of all Afghans were critically important, adding that an inclusive political settlement was the best way forward. Reiterating Pakistan's commitment to regional peace, he said that Pakistan was in touch with regional and international partners. In this context, he emphasised the vital importance of peaceful and stable Afghanistan for Pakistan and the region. The Foreign Minister added that it was essential for the world community to stay engaged with Afghanistan to stabilise the situation and help the Afghan people economically and continue providing humanitarian assistance. He also highlighted Pakistan's efforts in facilitating the evacuation of diplomatic personnel and staff of international organisations and others, including British nationals, and assured Pakistan's continued support in this context. In the bilateral context, the Foreign Minister shared concerns over the retention of Pakistan on the ‘Red List' for the travel ban. He noted that the Covid-19 situation in Pakistan has improved and urged the UK government to reconsider its decision. The UK Foreign Secretary shared UK's perspective on the developments in Afghanistan and conveyed thanks for Pakistan's support and facilitation in the evacuation efforts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-fm-qureshi-discusses-afghan-situation-with-un-chief-uk-foreign-minister/articleshow/85701699.cms||---

---||World||Taliban success in Afghanistan seen as boost for extremists||BEIRUT: A few days after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, a convoy of militants drove through the city of Idlib in northwestern Syria in cars bearing the group's white-and-black flags, honking horns and firing their guns in the air.  The celebrations by an al-Qaida affiliate in a remote corner of war-torn Syria were an expression of the triumph felt by radical Islamic groups from the Gaza Strip to Pakistan and West Africa who see America's violence-marred exit from Afghanistan an opportunity to reassert their presence.  For such groups, the chaotic US departure following the collapse of security forces it had trained for two decades is a gift, underlining their message that Washington eventually abandons its allies, and that defeating powerful armies is possible with enough patience.  "The success of the Taliban opens the way for radical groups to step up their recruitment operations globally. It is much easier for them now, and there is more receptivity," said Hassan Abu Haniyeh, an expert on Islamic militants based in Amman, Jordan.  Despite the billions of dollars spent by the US and NATO over nearly 20 years to build up Afghan security forces, the Taliban seized nearly all of Afghanistan in just over a week amid the US troop pullout. The fundamentalist group swept into Kabul on August 15 after the government collapsed and embattled President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.  Since then, tens of thousands of people desperate to escape a country governed by the Taliban have been trying to flee or already have been evacuated in a mammoth Western airlift.  "The events unfolding in Afghanistan have given jihadi groups and the US adversaries reason to celebrate, and America's allies in the region reason to feel anxious," said Abu Haniyeh. "They now feel that America might drop them one day, same as it did the government of Ashraf Ghani."  There are concerns that Afghanistan will once again become a base for militants to plot against the West, much like the September 11, 2001, attacks that triggered the US invasion.  "This is the story that is going to impact and influence jihadi fighters around the globe for the next decade, the same way as the victory over the Soviets in Afghanistan in the '80s inspired the jihadis around the world during the whole 1990s and even afterwards," said Elie Tenenbaum, director of security studies center at the French Institute of International Relations.  In a twist, the Taliban victory also boosted the fortunes of their rivals in Afghanistan - a local branch of the Islamic State network. On Thursday, the affiliate claimed responsibility for the suicide attack that killed scores of people outside Kabul's airport, including 13 US service members.  The Taliban now must contend with an emboldened IS, which is challenging their rule with militants that are far more radical. The group's ranks have been bolstered after the Taliban freed prisoners during an advance through Afghanistan.  An editorial in the Islamic State group's newsletter last week derided the Taliban, accusing them of collaborating with the U.S.  "America actually did it. They finally raised a 'Mullah Bradley," the editorial said, using a name it has coined for the Taliban in an apparent reference to the US fighting vehicle. The group also promised a new phase in its "blessed jihad" against the West.  Analysts say the Taliban's success and the US withdrawal galvanises and gives a motivational boost to America's adversaries and jihadi groups around the world.  Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon's Shiite militant group Hezbollah, said in a speech Friday that what is unfolding in Afghanistan "is a portrayal of America's full defeat and the US demise and failure in the region."  In northern Syria, a statement by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the al-Qaida affiliate there, said the Taliban victory proved no occupation can last forever. The leader of the radical Palestinian Islamic Hamas movement, which rules the Gaza Strip, congratulated the Taliban's leader on the "demise of the US occupation."  In Pakistan, the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammad, Mohammad Azhur, used the group's publication to cheer the Taliban victory, saying it will inspire mujahedeen, or holy warriors, "the world over to continue their struggle for Islam." The group's fighters took credit for the 2019 attack in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers and brought the nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of war.  Amir Rana, executive director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, said the events in Afghanistan could inspire hard-line Sunni groups who are waging sectarian battles against Shiites. The anti-Shiite groups Lashkar-e-Janghvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan have championed the Taliban victory, raising fears they could restart their deadly activities.  Heni Nsaibia, a senior Sahel researcher at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, said the Taliban takeover would be a motivational boost for extremists in West Africa, showing that patience and perseverance can pay off.  The biggest danger, according to the analysts, is in unstable countries with a weak central government and a history of insurgency, such as Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya.  There are echoes of 2014, when the Islamic State group sprang from the chaos of conflicts in Iraq and Syria, seized a giant stretch of territory straddling both countries, and declared a "caliphate" after the US-trained Iraqi forces collapsed. Terrorist attacks in Europe and beyond followed before IS was defeated in 2017, but attempts to regroup have been seen in the past two years, with new attacks in Iraq and Syria.  A report to the United Nations Security Council last week said the threat to international security from the Islamic State group is rising, pointing to an "alarming" expansion of its affiliates in Africa and its focus on a comeback in Syria and Iraq.  The report said IS and other terrorist groups have taken advantage of "the disruption, grievances and development setbacks" caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Abu Haniyeh, the analyst in Amman, said the perceived defeat of the US forces in Afghanistan by a radical group is reverberating among frustrated individuals around the world and will have widespread ramifications in the coming years.  "It gives hope for extremist groups the world over," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/taliban-success-in-afghanistan-seen-as-boost-for-extremists/articleshow/85702217.cms||---
---||World||Day after Afghanistan's bombing, toll up to 170, evacuations resume||The final stage of US-led evacuations from Kabul airport resumed on Friday morning, a day after devastating suicide bombings left more than 170 people dead and over 200 injured. The evacuations and foreign troop withdrawals are planned to be completed by August 31, a deadline agreed with the Taliban. The halt in airlift operations following the explosion and the end in sight for air evacuations had forced many people to head towards the Torkham border crossing with Pakistan in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province in an attempt to flee Taliban rule in the country. At Torkham, Pakistani forces opened fire on Afghans when they rushed towards the crossing gate. Afghan media outlets reported that six Afghans were killed and several injured. Several thousand Afghans are said to have fled into Pakistan using the Spin Boldak crossing point in southern Afghanistan. Locals described the scene at Spin Boldak as chaotic, with many of those who had travelled to the border not being allowed to cross into Pakistan. In Kabul, hospitals have been overwhelmed with patients, with fewer staff available as many health experts had left the country after the Taliban grabbed power over a week ago. The condition of many patients was described as critical. A number of families were desperately searching for their loved ones, including children, after the explosion. Meanwhile, reports from Kabul suggest that Taliban leaders have been planning to form an inclusive caretaker government as soon as possible. The caretaker government, according to the Taliban, will have an "Amir-ul Momineen" (Commander of the Faithful) to lead the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They said a supreme leadership council has been convened to decide the form of the future government and to nominate ministers. The focus currently is on nominations to key ministries, including law, defence, foreign affairs, finance, information and national security. The insurgent group is considering the names of the sons of several non-Pashtun warlords and tribal chiefs to be part of the caretaker setup. The group has not clarified the duration of the interim government. There are also reports that the US has been insisting on bringing in some members of previous governments led by former presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani. The CIA chief, according to Taliban sources, had suggested to Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar (a co-founder of the Taliban movement) during his recent visit to Kabul that he include members from past governments in the interim setup.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/day-after-afghanistans-bombing-toll-up-to-170-evacuations-resume/articleshow/85702087.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The Sundar Pichai-led company is in “advanced stage of negotiations” with Airtel for the “past nearly one year”, and the deal size could be “substantially large”, top sources in the know of the developments told TOI. The contours of the partnership are being worked upon for months as top executives from both companies, and their internal and external legal and M&A teams are thrashing out the finer points of the arrangement. Queries sent to Google and Airtel remained unanswered at the time of going to press. Also, Google did not answer a question on whether its deal with Jio places any restrictions on the company from making a tie-up with a rival. Read AlsoGoogle pays Rs 33,737 crore for 7.73% stake in Jio PlatformsAlphabet Inc's Google has paid Rs 33,737 crore for a 7.73 per cent stake in Reliance Industries Ltd's (RIL) digital subsidiary, Jio Platforms Ltd, joining the list of global investors such as Facebook, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's firm said.If the Google-Airtel deal does go through, it could be a huge breather for Sunil Mittal, whose company faces stiff competition in the cash-guzzling telecom sector. Ambani had disrupted the long-held financial model of the industry, making voice – which gave 75% to the industry’s revenues then – completely free, while offering data at dirt-cheap costs, piling pressure on Airtel and the other private players such as Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. The financial stress mounted following the Supreme Court ruling on AGR. Airtel, whose board will meet on Sunday to consider fundraising plans, remains under stress. The company had a debt of nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore at the end of June and is unable to raise tariffs freely. Sources said that any deal with Google will be a mega confidence booster for the company. “The entry of Google adds strength to the balance sheet of Airtel. Also, it helps the company strategically as Google brings in innovation capabilities and strength on data analytics. Google’s data monetisation is far superior to any other company in the world, and it can help Airtel monetize its data much better to improve its realisations and profitability,” a top analyst, requesting anonymity, said. However, the analyst added that Google would require “very strong reasons” and very-comfortable valuations to make an entry into Airtel, which also poses “strong risks” for anyone coming into the company. “If anything goes wrong tomorrow, your (Google) credibility in the market goes out even though it will be a limited liability. To save its name, the company will have to settle its dues in case Airtel is not able to move ahead due to financial pressures and starts slipping down.” Watch Google now in talks to make large investments in Airtel||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-jio-google-now-in-talks-to-make-large-investments-in-airtel/articleshow/85702509.cms||Pankaj Doval

In Noida, there are 61 health and wellness centres, including 35 at the sub-centre level, and of these, 26 do not have CHOs. These sub-centres are the first healthcare points in villages and family planning drives, counselling sessions, routine immunisation programmes and ante-natal check-ups are planned at these facilities. Some centres also conduct procedures like insertion of copper IUDs, as part of the family planning drive. The government had planned to upgrade the sub-centres that focused on maternal and child healthcare to health and wellness centres and in Ghaziabad, the target was to increase the number of such facilities to 76 by 2020-21 fiscal. But only 42 are operational. Chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, said usually, one CHO is posted in each facility. In the first week of August, the CMO had written a letter to the director of the National Health Mission (NHM) seeking appointment of CHOs for the 34 centres. But a response is awaited. Officials in Noida also said that regular requests are made to the state officials about CHO postings. “We have 23 new health and wellness centres that need CHOs. Additionally, there are three centres where the CHO posts have been lying vacant since early last year,” said Manjeet Singh, district program manager, NMH, Gautam Budh Nagar. He added that there are also about 128 sub-centres that are being managed by local-level healthcare workers. Under the NHM, healthcare workers get a six-month bridge course following which they appear for exams before getting selected as CHOs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/village-health-centres-hit-by-lack-of-officers-to-run-them/articleshow/85702706.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Noida||Over 1 lakh vax jabs given in month’s third ‘mega drive’||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: During the third mega vax drive this month, both districts surpassed their targets set by the government. In Noida, about 41,000 doses were administered against the target of 40,000 at 195 centres, including 157 government ones, while over 66,000 people got jabs in Ghaziabad compared to the target of 57,600. Ghaziabad had set up 160 centres, including 147 government ones. Compared to the past two drives, the third seemed better executed. Unlike the previous big vaccination days, there were no major complaints of mismanagement at the centres, though crowds had to be managed at some places. However, the CoWIN portal worked quite slowly on Friday and the staff faced difficulties in filling in the details of the recipients. Ghaziabad officials said they would have vaccinated more people if the portal functioned properly. Maintaining Covid protocols, though, remained tough at almost all centres in Ghaziabad. Moreover, most of the recipients didn’t sit in the observation room for half an hour after getting the vaccine. Talking about Friday’s drive, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, Noida district immunisation officer, said, “We had decided to keep the online registration and walk-in centres separate. There were 33 centres where only those with online slots were allowed. At the other 107 centres, walk-ins were being allowed. This helped in crowd management this time. However, those who could not get the shot should not worry as regular vaccination is being done daily in the district.” Though the drive went smooth, fewer doses will now be available for the exclusive second dose vaccination on Saturday. With the next three days being public holidays, more people are expected to turn up for vaccination. However, more doses are expected to arrive by Saturday evening and government centres remain closed on Sunday. Following the mega drive, the pace of vaccination is expected to be stabilised by Monday now. Ghaziabad vaccination nodal officer Dr GP Mathuria said the emphasis was given on vaccinating everyone who reached the centre. Also, this time too the number of centres has been increased. So that the beneficiaries can be vaccinated in most of the areas. CMO Dr Bhavtosh Shankhadhar said efforts were made that the maximum number of vaccinations was given. During the first mega drive, more than 79000 shots were administered, whereas in the second drive, over 42000 people were vaccinated. An inspection team that had arrived from the Meerut division to oversee the mock drill of PICU ward at District Combined Hospital directed ti the hospital administration to add one more vaccination site at the centre after seeing the long queues of beneficiaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/over-1l-vax-jabs-given-in-months-3rd-mega-drive/articleshow/85702710.cms||Snehil Sinha

While the CT-scan facility at the hospital is being run on a public-private partnership model and the radiologist operates from Pune, the hospital has no surgeon for the past several months. Chief medical superintendent Dr Sanjay Teotia has written to the chief medical officer (CMO) requesting him to stop referrals of medico-legal work from community health centres and primary health centres. “CT-scans are often required in medico-legal cases. Our radiologist in Pune checks CT-scans done here online and then sends the reports. In cases where a patient’s fingerprint has to be certified by a radiologist, we cannot do much. In some cases, a radiologist has to be present during court hearings, which is not possible, because the person is in Pune. Moreover, our radiologist who works for a private firm does not want to get involved in this process,” Teotia said, adding that sometimes, such issues have led to problems between local police officers and the hospital staff as well. He said MMG hospital has the required facilities and the cases should be sent there. According to a source at the hospital, the CT-scan facility was set up about three years ago, but the number of medico-legal cases has increased in the past few months. “For the past one-and-a-half-years, the hospital was running as a Covid facility. Now that Covid patients are less, police cases are coming here almost daily,” the source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/combined-hospital-wants-medico-legal-cases-sent-to-mmg/articleshow/85702711.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Noida||Govt centres test paediatric care with Covid drill||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: To check the preparedness of all paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) wards, all districts in UP conducted a drill at government hospitals on Friday. The drill was held at four Community Health Centers (CHCs) in Bisrakh, Bhangel, Dadri and Jewar and the Covid Hospital in Sector 39 in Noida, and the District Combined Hospital (DCH) in Ghaziabad. According to officials, children were prepared as dummy patients who were brought in by ambulances and shifted to the emergency and further to PICU ward by the staff. Meanwhile, the nodal officers were appointed to monitor the situation in all districts. Nine-year-old Mayank Sharma played a patient at CHC Bhangel. Son of an ASHA worker, Mamta Sharma, Mayank, is well versed with health centres and said he is not scared of injections. “My mother and other doctors said that it was very important work and I had to act well. I was not scared as I was told that I will be given chocolates later,” he said. While three children – two siblings, aged 11 and 10 years, who had come with their mother to see a doctor, and the son of a health department staff – were brought by ambulances and taken to the PICU ward where oxygen through BiPAP machine and HFNC were provided. The senior officials also checked the medicine stock and other facilities. Eight-year-old Mayank Kumar, son of a health department staff, was the most confident one and didn’t get scared during the drill. The other two siblings were quite hesitant, the doctors said. “Doctors posted at government district hospitals will guide doctors at the community health centres and other smaller centres through video conferencing in handling patients admitted to PICU wards, in case the Covid third wave arrives and affects a large number of children,” said Dr Raj Kumar, additional director, health department, Meerut division, who oversaw the drill at the PICU facility located in District Combined Hospital, Ghaziabad. In Ghaziabad, only two paediatricians are posted at DCH, which serves as a 100-bed L2 Covid facility whenever the need arises. There are seven paediatricians at District Women Hospital and two at MMG District Hospital. The four CHCs do not have a single paediatrician. Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent, DCH, said, “The drill started at 10.15am and went for two hours. Another drill will be planned after some weeks. We have also made proper arrangements for the stay of children’s parents who will remain here as attendants. No major gap was found at the DCH, which has a 30-bed dedicated PICU ward, and the hospital administration was told to improve signage inside the medical facility.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/govt-centres-test-paediatric-care-with-covid-drill/articleshow/85702713.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||India||Will give a befitting reply if not allowed to take decisions: Sidhu||CHANDIGARH: Just over a month after being appointed as Punjab PCC chief with the blessings of the Gandhis, Navjot Singh Sidhu displayed his belligerent face on Friday by telling the Congress high command that he should be given freedom to take decisions or else “I will give a befitting reply (itt naal itt wi bajaun)”. Sidhu’s confrontational stand comes after Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh – who clearly appeared to be on the backfoot just a month ago – recovered lost ground in the state powerplay in the last few days, with Congress’s Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat declaring on Wednesday that the party would fight the assembly elections under the CM’s leadership. The former cricketer’s dare of sorts to the party high command amid his escalating feud with Amarinder comes after Rawat asked Sidhu to sack his advisers Pyare Lal Garg and Malwinder Singh Mali for their controversial statements on Kashmir and Pakistan or else he would do so. Speaking at a public meeting in Amritsar, Sidhu said, “I have told the (party) high command only one thing. If I fulfil the aspirations of the people and (implement) the Punjab model, I won’t let the Congress lose out in politics for the next 20 years. But if you don’t let me take decisions, ‘main itt naal itt wi bajaun’. Because there is no use being a darshani ghoda (showpiece).” Reacting to Sidhu’s remarks, Rawat told mediapersons that within the limits of the Congress traditions and the party’s constitution, Sidhu already has the freedom to take decisions. “I can’t question him on the basis of media speculation... I will see the context of the statement. He has his own style of saying things. He is the party chief, who other than him can take decisions?” Rawat, who met Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Friday over the infighting in the Punjab unit, told mediapersons after the meeting: “I have briefed her about the latest situation. I’ve told her that all parties will follow her instructions. There have been a few problems but we're trying to resolve them. Things are under control… There are two-three groups there and we expect that they will respect each other’s feelings and work together… It is expected that the chief minister, PPCC chief or the ministers will respect each other and work together.” “It is within the democratic right of MLAs and others to express their point of view. But it is for the Congress president to take a decision on the issues. Time and again, everyone in Punjab Congress has said that the decision of the Congress president will be acceptable to all. The MLAs who had come to meet me had also conveyed the same thing,” Rawat added. A group of Amarinder’s detractors, including cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, too, had landed in Delhi but could not meet Sonia. Earlier, a group of MLAs had gone to Dehradun to meet Rawat to express their grouses against the chief minister. In a show of strength, Amarinder had hosted a dinner on Thursday at the residence of his loyalist, Punjab minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, where it was claimed that 55 MLAs and eight MPs were present. This came two days after four cabinet ministers held a meeting with a group of MLAs to announce that they had lost faith in the CM.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-give-a-befitting-reply-if-not-allowed-to-take-decisions-sidhu/articleshow/85702774.cms||---

The duo had been in a relationship for five years but developed differences of late, leading to the tragedy, police said. A death note allegedly written by the man was found with the woman when the body was recovered. The matter came to light when 27-year-old Shivamurthy was admitted to hospital after consuming poison. He told his parents about the death of Kavitha, 21, on Wednesday, which caused him to take the extreme step. The family alerted cops and her body was found in Ripponpet forest on Thursday. Police said Kavita of Kaanuru village in Sagar met Shivamurthy of Talale village when she was studying in Ripponpet. They fell in love but of late, Shivamurthy began to feel that she was avoiding him, police said.  In the note that Shivamurthy wrote, he said Kavita liked a youth from Bhadravati and this made him angry. On Wednesday evening, the duo went to the dense forest to sort things out. But one thing led to another and hearing of his suffering, she hanged herself with a dupatta, he wrote. A dazed Shivamurthy returned to Shivamogga, some 30km from Ripponpet, but did not inform anybody about Kavitha’s death. He allegedly drank poison on returning home. As his condition began to deteriorate, he was taken to McGann Hospital. While investigation was on, Shivamurthy died in hospital. Shivamogga SP BM Laxmi Prasad said a complaint has been lodged in Tunga Nagar police station, Shivamogga city. He said probe is on but ruled out foul play.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/student-found-hanging-boyfriend-drinks-poison/articleshow/85702946.cms||---

All these educational institutions will have to follow strict Covid-19 norms and ensure a 50% cap on the number of students. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) took this decision on Friday but a government notification is awaited. Significantly, no student can be forced to attend school or college and parents who do not wish to send their children can opt for online classes. Henceforth, schools will adopt a blended approach i.e. have both online and physical teaching. DDMA on Friday approved the recommendation of an expert committee that schools for all classes must be opened in a phased manner in the wake of significant improvement in the Covid-19 situation. Classes 6 to 8 may be allowed to reopen from September 8, and after reviewing the situation, a decision about allowing primary classes to be resumed will be taken. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet that with coronavirus cases falling, schools are being gradually reopened in Delhi with full precautions so that the loss in education of children can be reduced. “We also have to bring life back on track and take care of both health and education of the children,” he said. “It was emphasised that adequate preparedness in school, strict enforcement of SOPs and daily monitoring should be undertaken to avoid any spread of infection,” said LG Anil Baijal, who is the DDMA chairman. The meeting was attended by Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev, Niti Aayog’s V K Paul and AIIMS director Randeep Guleria. It was decided at the meeting that not only teachers and other staff but the drivers and conductors of school buses must also be vaccinated, overcrowding in buses and vans must be avoided and markings must be made at the entry and exit points of the schools and other educational institutions to ensure there is no crowding at the entrance. An official said only one student will be allowed to sit on a bench or desk meant for two. Since students will remove their masks during lunch break, DDMA suggested that lunch should be organised in the open and the duration reduced to 15 minutes. It was suggested that the schools must increase the number of wash basins and all wash basins must have liquid soap. All educational institutions will have to follow the same norms. The students will be advised not to share their books, lunch and stationery items. Classrooms will be sanitised regularly and provision of thermal scanners made. The schools will also be asked to have a quarantine room and visits by guests will be discouraged. DDMA suggested that an extensive campaign must be carried out to make parents aware of the risks and the steps to be taken to ensure the safety of their children. The Delhi government will now put up a proposal before the LG for his final approval. Once that is received, an order will be issued by the chief secretary allowing educational institutions to reopen. A DDMA order will be issued before the end of the month along with SOPs. Announcing the reopening, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, said, “Experts believe that the learning which happens at school cannot take place at home and that too online. Everyone believes that due to Covid, education has suffered a lot. So, a decision has been taken that schools, colleges and coaching centres will reopen in Delhi with all precautions.” He added: “There has been a massive loss of learning in the last one and a half years.” “No child should be forced to come to school, which means that schools will function in a blended mode. In that case, the child will not be marked absent,” said Sisodia, addressing a digital press conference. He pointed out that there were very few states that are not in favour of reopening now. The Delhi government has in the past one month conducted several drives all over the city to vaccinate teachers. “About 98% of government school teachers and all school staff in Delhi have received their first dose and we are administering the second dose as well. Private schools have also reported that a large number of their staff have been vaccinated,” said Sisodia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-schools-colleges-to-reopen-on-september-1-with-curbs/articleshow/85702903.cms||Alok KN Mishra
---||India||India sets 1-day record, crosses 1 crore jabs on Friday||NEW DELHI: India on Friday hit a record one crore doses of anti-Covid jabs till 10pm, surpassing the previous high of 92 lakh shots on August 16 as vaccination picked up pace with improved supplies. Now almost 37% of India's 1.3 billion population is covered with at least one dose, whereas 10 % have received both doses. In terms of the 94 crore adult or 18-plus population currently eligible to receive shots, 51% have been covered with at least one dose. Of these, 15% have got both doses. Though in comparison to countries like the US and the UK, the numbers of those fully vaccinated are low, India is progressing in terms of shots per 100 population. In recent weeks, the graph has risen sharply to 43/100 population, according to ourworldindata.org. Though India's large population makes the task of vaccination challenging, barring China, it has delivered the most number of full vaccinations after the US. The US has 172 million people fully vaccinated and India has 136 million. In terms of the number of people who have received at least one dose, India is behind only China, which has delivered two billion shots overall as of August 26. Coronavirus live updatesThe government aims to cover all of the adult population by December this year, before it starts vaccination among children. Officials said achieving the goal will depend on the ability to scale up and a sustained pace, and equally on the eligible population "willing" to receive shots as well as those who might be difficult to access. The improved pace of vaccination is mainly driven by better supply of jabs in August coupled with the government’s initiatives to expand the coverage, particularly for the second dose.

There were 46,762 fresh cases reported in the country on Friday, with Jharkhand's data yet to come till close toWhile around 15 crore doses have already been given in August, the advance visibility given by the Centre on Friday morning showed over four crore unused doses available with states, whereas 17.64 lakh doses were in the pipeline. This is higher than the 13.45 crore doses given in July and 11.97 crore doses given in June. "We hope to achieve 17 crore plus inoculations in August. It could have been even more but the next few days may remain modest because of the weekend and Janmashtami. We are targeting to give 20-22 crore doses in September," a senior official said. In the current week of August 21-27, vaccination coverage has also improved significantly with over 4.58 crore doses given during the week, up by 15% from the previous week.

---||World||Biden to Israeli PM: US has options if Iran nuclear diplomacy fails||WASHINGTON: United States President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in White House talks on Friday that he was putting "diplomacy first" to try to rein in Iran's nuclear programme, but if negotiations fail he would be prepared to turn to other unspecified options.  After a one-day delay due to a deadly suicide bombing in Kabul during the chaotic US evacuation from Afghanistan, Biden and Bennett held their first meeting seeking to reset the US-Israeli relations and narrow differences over how to deal with Iran's nuclear developments.  Tensions complicated relations between Bennett's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was close to former President Donald Trump, and the last Democratic administration led by Barack Obama with Biden as his vice president.  But the meeting, the first since Biden and Bennett took office this year, was eclipsed by Thursday's attack outside Kabul airport that killed at least 92 people, including 13 US service members, confronting Biden with the worst crisis of his young presidency.  "The mission there... is dangerous and now it's come with a significant loss of American personnel, but it's a worthy mission," Biden told reporters after his one-on-one talks with Bennett. The US forces helping to evacuate Afghans desperate to flee new Taliban rule were on alert for more attacks.  In brief remarks before reporters were ushered out of the Oval Office, both leaders touched on Iran, one of the thorniest issues between the Biden administration and Israel, but mostly they papered over their disagreements.  Biden said he and Bennett discussed "the threat from Iran and our commitment to ensure Iran never develops a nuclear weapon".  "We're putting diplomacy first and we'll see where that takes us. But if diplomacy fails, we're ready to turn to other options," Biden added, without offering specifics.  Bennett, a far-right politician who ended Netanyahu's 12-year run as prime minister in June, was expected to press Biden to harden his approach to Iran and back out of negotiations aimed at reviving an international nuclear deal with Tehran that Trump abandoned. The US-Iran negotiations have stalled as Washington awaits the next move by Iran's new hardline president.  "I was happy to hear your clear words that Iran will never be able to acquire a nuclear weapon," Bennett told Biden. "You emphasised that you'll try the diplomatic route but there's other options if that doesn't work out," he added, also stopping short of identifying the possibilities. Moving on from Netanyahu Bennett has sought to move on from Netanyahu's combative public style and instead manage disagreements behind closed doors between Washington and its closest Middle-east ally.  But he has been just as adamant as Netanyahu was in pledging to do whatever is necessary to prevent Iran, which Israel views as an existential threat, from building a nuclear weapon. Iran consistently denies it is seeking a bomb.  Bennett told reporters at the White House that Israel has developed a "comprehensive strategy" to keep Iran away from nuclear breakout and stop its "regional aggression."  Alluding to Israel's threats of military action and the billions of dollars in the US military aid it receives, Bennett said: "We will never outsource our security. It's our responsibility to take care of our fate, but we do thank you for the tools... you've been giving us."  The visit gave Biden an opportunity to demonstrate business as usual with a key partner, while grappling with the aftermath of the Afghan attack. His handling of the wrapping-up of the US military presence there after 20 years of war has not only hurt his approval ratings at home but also raised questions about his credibility among both friends and foes abroad.  On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Biden and Bennett remain far apart. Biden has renewed backing for a two-state solution after Trump distanced himself from that longstanding tenet of the US policy. Bennett opposes Palestinian statehood.  Biden made a brief reference to the issue, saying he wanted to discuss "ways to advance peace and security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians."  Bennett did not mention the Palestinians in his remarks.  The consensus among Biden's aides is that now is not the time to push for a resumption of long-dormant peace talks or major Israeli concessions, which could destabilise Bennett's ideologically diverse coalition.  But Biden's aides have not ruled out asking Bennett for modest gestures to help avoid a recurrence of the fierce Israel-Hamas fighting in the Gaza Strip that caught the new US administration flat-footed earlier this year.  The US administration has also emphasised that it opposes further expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied land.  Bennett, 49, the son of American immigrants to Israel, has been a vocal proponent of settlement building.  The delay in the White House meeting means that Bennett, an Orthodox Jew who does not travel on the Sabbath, will remain in Washington until after sundown on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-to-israeli-pm-us-has-options-if-iran-nuclear-diplomacy-fails/articleshow/85703092.cms||---

The move is part of the government’s review of the draft consumer protection rules for e-commerce. Over the last few days, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, who is also in-charge of consumer affairs, and his officials have held multiple rounds of discussions with companies, both Indian and overseas, to understand the concerns with the draft guidelines that were released for public consultations. Government sources said that there were two-three key areas, which needed to be tweaked, and the guidelines would seek to address the concerns. Some of the issues flow from the way the sector has evolved with different set of rules for homegrown players who do not face restrictions in selling directly to consumers, while overseas players face curbs. The draft rules on consumer protection were uniform irrespective of the ownership of the venture, but they impacted domestic players such as the Tata Group from selling some of their products on a “super app”. Government officials, however, made it clear that there would be no compromise on protecting the interests of consumers, while ensuring that conflict of interest for the sellers is avoided. The details of the new norms will be worked out in the coming weeks, but from the discussions over the last few months it has emerged that there can be an effective solution that can offer a “win-win deal” to e-tailers such as Flipkart and Amazon as well as kirana stores. It could lead to various models such as one where local stores are used to deliver goods and also join the network of sellers on these platforms, government and corporate sources said. This also coincides with the dismantling of “non-compliant structures” like Cloudtail, a partnership between Amazon and Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran, which was the largest seller on the e-tailing platform. Earlier this week, Walmart, which controls Flipkart, had said that India had its own set of rules, which needed to the complied with. For long the government has focused on getting e-marketplaces to comply with the foreign direct investment guidelines, which do not allow them to sell directly to consumers. While the restrictions are unlikely to be eased, there is growing realisation within the government that a model should be worked out to the benefit everyone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-reviews-consumer-protection-rules-for-e-commerce/articleshow/85703130.cms||Sidhartha
---||India||Literature offers optimism and hope in difficult times: VP Naidu||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said that literature opens pathways to new experiences filled with hope and optimism in difficult times. “Literary texts recreate places, events and experiences providing a magical escape into a world in which we lose ourselves,” he said. Speaking at the inauguration of the ‘Times Literature Festival 2021’, Naidu said that in a crisis, it is literature that poses the most relevant questions and comes up with pertinent answers. Literary figures, through their work, appeal to our imagination in a number of ways—as creative writers, moralists, guides and philosophers, among other things. The Times Litfest has been introduced in a virtual avatar for the first time this year and will be held over a period of two months from August 27 to October 17 with sessions every Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. It will include more than 100 authors, including more than 15 international best-selling writers, close to 70 sessions, and 20 workshops. Among the speakers are Salman Rushdie, Jeffrey Archer, Booker Prize winner Douglas Stuart, Rutger Bregman, Tom Holland, Shashi Tharoor, Amish Tripathi, Devdutt Pattanaik and Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. Describing how great writing reaches out to us in ways that nothing else can, the Vice President said, “We lose ourselves in the world of words in an experience that transcends all limitations of time and space. There is no such thing as an appropriate time to immerse oneself in great writing.” Naidu said the silver lining of the last 16 months has been a rapid increase in the pace of digitalisation of activities. It has demolished barriers of access in a way that nothing else has and is without doubt, a manifestation of human creativity in the face of adversity. Not only is human imagination capable of finding ways to cope with extraordinary circumstances, but can also convert adversity into opportunity, he added. Lauding the Times of India for organising the event and creating a conducive environment for debate and discussion, he said, “I am told that the standout feature of the Times Litfest has often been the sparkling exchange between book lovers and authors.” He also expressed his happiness that the Litfest has no entry barriers and is thrown open to all for participation. “I am certain that this is one of the reasons behind its resounding success,” he added, expressing the hope that the festival would emerge as a platform for different ideas and views.

A delegation of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs led by Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema met the governor here and claimed that the Congress government was “in minority”. The group demanded that a special session of the state assembly be convened and the chief minister directed to prove his government’s majority in the house. According to a statement from AAP, the party leaders said if Amarinder Singh evades proving his government’s majority in next seven days, the assembly should be dissolved immediately. Congress has 80 MLAs in the 117-member Punjab Assembly. The opposition’s demand has come at a time when the Punjab Congress is facing a crisis due to the ongoing power struggle between Amarinder Singh and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Addressing a gathering in Bagha Purana in Moga, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal also asked the Amarinder Singh-led government to prove its majority. The chief minister should be ready to face a no-confidence motion in the forthcoming assembly session as he has “lost the confidence” of a majority of his ministers and legislators and “does not have any right to remain in his chair”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prove-majority-opposition-tells-captain-amid-crisis-in-punjab-congress/articleshow/85703241.cms||---

In a vote of confidence in Baghel, Rahul is likely to undertake a three-day trip to Naxal affected backward Bastar region in the coming days. The region recently witnessed police firing on tribals and deaths recently which resulted in criticism of the Baghel regime. Also, BJP is expected to hold a conclave on religious conversions in Jagdalpur next week. Baghel was summoned for a meeting with Rahul just a day after he returned to Raipur following another long discussion on Tuesday — which came in the wake of the claim made by state health Minister T S Singh Deo that he be given the CM’s post since the leadership had promised him a split term. Sources said the leadership issue was not “as big a matter”. On returning to Raipur, Baghel had made some comments suggesting that the debate on rotational leadership was creating instability. His presence in Delhi on Friday will be seen as the leadership having blessed his continuance as a loyal satrap. The CM landed in the Capital on Friday afternoon and headed straight into talks with Rahul which included AICC state incharge P L Punia and AICC general secretary, organisation, K C Venugopal, besides Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. After around four hours, Baghel addressed the press and brushed aside a query about split term. “This issue has already been clarified by Puniaji two days ago,“ he said, with AICC state incharge by his side. Punia Tuesday told reporters that leadership was not an issue in the meeting. With an air of confidence, when asked about who would be the CM, Baghel shot back, “I have invited Rahulji in my capacity as chief minister.“ As the CM prepared for what sounded like a deposition before the leadership, around 57 MLAs also rushed to the capital in a show of strength. After the discussions when doubts about his future had been dispelled, Baghel rushed to the AICC and met the MLAs along with Punia, while the legislators celebrated at the party headquarters. “It is all fine, we are going back now,” key Baghel backer Amarjeet Bhagat said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-continue-as-chhattisgarh-cm-baghel-after-talks-with-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/85703255.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The Taliban took control of Afghanistan on August 15. Their sudden victory, which comes as the United States withdraws from the country following a 20-year-war, has sparked chaos at Kabul's airport, from where America and allied nations are trying to safely evacuate thousands of citizens and allies. “Total 89 flights yesterday flew out of Kabul, totalling approximately 12,500 evacuees now safely out of Afghanistan in a 24-hour period,” Maj Gen Hank Taylor, tasked with the responsibility of airlifting American citizens out of Afghanistan during the Taliban crisis, told reporters at a Pentagon news conference. “Yesterday, 35 US military aircraft, 29 C-17s, and six C-130s departed with approximately 8,500 personnel. Combined with a 54-coalition aircraft departure, an additional 4,000 personnel left Kabul for various intermediate staging bases,” he said. In the past 24 hours, more than 300 American citizens were evacuated from Afghanistan, bringing an updated total to approximately 5,100. “We continue to maximize our efficiency and since US and coalition forces began the evacuation, approximately 111,000 evacuees have departed safely. The State Department consular officers continue to screen and process people arriving at the gate around Kabul,” Taylor said. Some gates have been closed as we reported, but American citizens, SIV applicants, and vulnerable Afghans, who have the designated and proper credentials, will continue to be processed for departure from the airfield. There are still approximately 5,400 individuals at the airport waiting for flights out of Afghanistan, he noted. The United States, he said, has the ability to include evacuees on the US military airlift out of Afghanistan until the very end. “The Department of Defence has the continued responsibility to support the State Department in the ongoing movement of evacuees through our intermediate staging bases and safe havens all the way to the United States in the coming days and weeks,” he added. As directed by President Joe Biden, Pentagon Spokesperson John Kirby said that the United States is still planning on ending this mission at the end of the month. “As we get closer, and we are getting closer, you're going to see us begin to make those muscle movements to pull out our troops and some of our equipment as appropriate with any retrograde. What we want to do is preserve as much capability for as long as we can, both in terms of the security footprint, but also in terms of the ability, as the general alluded in his opening statement, to moving out evacuees,” Kirby said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/approximately-111k-people-evacuated-from-afghanistan-says-pentagon/articleshow/85703274.cms||---

---||India||HC to govt: Spell out stand on Facebook, WhatsApp plea against IT rules||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday sought the Centre’s stand on petitions by Facebook and its instant messaging platform WhatsApp challenging the new IT rules for social media intermediaries on the ground that these require messaging services to “trace” the originator of a particular message. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the Centre, represented by its ministry of electronics and information technology, to file a reply by October 22 to the petition as well as application to stay the implementation of the rules. During the hearing, the counsel for the Centre tried to seek an adjournment, but advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for WhatsApp and Facebook respectively, urged the court to issue notice. WhatsApp, in its plea, said the requirement of intermediaries enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India upon government or court order puts end-to-end encryption and its benefits “at risk.” WhatsApp has urged HC to declare Rule 4(2) of the Intermediary Rules as unconstitutional, ultra vires to the IT Act unconstitutional as it requires to enable the identification of the first originator of information. “Requiring messaging apps to ‘trace’ chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent on WhatsApp, which would break end-to-end encryption and fundamentally undermine people’s right to privacy,” it had stated earlier. The traceability clause says a significant social media intermediary providing services shall enable the identification of the first originator of information on its computer resource as may be required by a judicial order passed by a court or order passed under IT Rules, 2009.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-to-govt-spell-out-stand-on-facebook-whatsapp-plea-against-it-rules/articleshow/85703292.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||World||America put in the worst position: Trump on Afghan crisis||WASHINGTON: Former United States President Donald Trump on Friday said that America has been put in the worst position it could possibly be in, slamming his successor Joe Biden on his Afghan policy. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, two weeks before the US was set to complete its troop withdrawal after a costly two-decade war. The insurgents stormed across the country, capturing all major cities in a matter of days, as Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the US and its allies melted away. “We have been put in the worst position we could possibly be put in, a position that nobody would have even thought possible, even two weeks ago... where the Taliban and others are dictating -- and they are the ones saying get out on the 31st,” Trump told Fox News in an interview. “I think Biden wanted to stay, but they said, we will not have you come and get out, there will be consequences. You heard that. That was said by the leader of the Taliban. We want you out by the 31st, there will be consequences. What kind of stuff is this,” he asked. Trump said that from the standpoint of military tactics and just embarrassment, this is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to the United States. “We look like fools all over the world. We are weak. We are pathetic,” he said. “We are being led by people that have no idea what they are doing. They take the military out, and then they say, now we will bring out the people. And, all of a sudden, the Taliban walks in,” Trump said. The former president said that under his administration, the Taliban were under control. "They wouldn't have moved without getting our approval. We had an incredible agreement. They weren't killing our soldiers. You know that. And it was part of their -- in fact, Biden actually said that (in a press conference). He said they weren't killing them because of the agreement that we had, that we did,” he added. “These (the Taliban) are the people that we had at bay to a level that you wouldn't believe.

---||World||America put in the worst position: Trump on Afghan crisis||WASHINGTON: Former United States President Donald Trump on Friday said that America has been put in the worst position it could possibly be in, slamming his successor Joe Biden on his Afghan policy. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, two weeks before the US was set to complete its troop withdrawal after a costly two-decade war. The insurgents stormed across the country, capturing all major cities in a matter of days, as Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the US and its allies melted away. “We have been put in the worst position we could possibly be put in, a position that nobody would have even thought possible, even two weeks ago... where the Taliban and others are dictating -- and they are the ones saying get out on the 31st,” Trump told Fox News in an interview. “I think Biden wanted to stay, but they said, we will not have you come and get out, there will be consequences. You heard that. That was said by the leader of the Taliban. We want you out by the 31st, there will be consequences. What kind of stuff is this,” he asked. Trump said that from the standpoint of military tactics and just embarrassment, this is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to the United States. “We look like fools all over the world. We are weak. We are pathetic,” he said. “We are being led by people that have no idea what they are doing. They take the military out, and then they say, now we will bring out the people. And, all of a sudden, the Taliban walks in,” Trump said. The former president said that under his administration, the Taliban were under control. "They wouldn't have moved without getting our approval. We had an incredible agreement. They weren't killing our soldiers. You know that. And it was part of their -- in fact, Biden actually said that (in a press conference). He said they weren't killing them because of the agreement that we had, that we did,” he added. “These (the Taliban) are the people that we had at bay to a level that you wouldn't believe. There was no way that -- they never even fired on our troops. They didn't -- again, we didn't lose any troops for and just, like long, extended period of time. Nobody was even fired, frankly, until today, when we had a tragedy take place, and that's because of this agreement,” he said. “Unfortunately, Biden didn't follow it because he took the military out first and left everybody open, and I feel very, very badly for the people.

Rawat warned that he would sack them otherwise. Speaking at a public meeting in Amritsar, Sidhu said, “I have told the (party) high command only one thing. If I fulfil the aspirations of the people and (implement) the Punjab model, I won’t let the Congress lose out in politics for the next 20 years. But if you don’t let me take decisions, ‘main itt naal itt wi bajaun’. Because there is no use being a darshani ghoda (showpiece).” Reacting to Sidhu’s remarks, Rawat told mediapersons that within the limits of Congress traditions and the party’s constitution, Sidhu already has the freedom to take decisions. “I can’t question him on the basis of media speculation... I will see the context of the statement. He has his own style of saying things. He is the party chief, who other than him can take decisions?” Rawat, who met Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Friday over the infighting in the Punjab unit, said, “I’ve told her that all parties will follow her instructions. There have been a few problems but we’re trying to resolve them. Things are under control...” A group of Amarinder’s detractors, including cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, too, had landed in Delhi but could not meet Sonia. Earlier, a group of MLAs had gone to Dehradun to meet Rawat to express their grouses against the chief minister. In a show of strength, Amarinder had hosted a dinner on Thursday at the residence of his loyalist, Punjab minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, where it was claimed that 55 MLAs and eight MPs were present. This came two days after four cabinet ministers held a meeting with a group of MLAs to announce that they had lost faith in the chief minister.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-be-show-horse-sidhu-warns-congress-high-command/articleshow/85703323.cms||---

The Speaker said democracy is the basis of socio economic development and empowerment of people. It should always be the endeavour to have regular discussions and dialogue among democratic institutions. Over 200 panchayat representatives from Leh-Ladakh and Kargil regions had an interaction with the Lok Sabha Speaker besides Union ministers Nityananda Rai and Bhagwant Khuba on Friday. Heads of the autonomous councils of Ladakh and Kargil shared their problems even as they hailed the Centre for granting UT status to the region. Birla said the outreach exercise is aimed at ensuring active participation of people from the remotest regions as growth should be initiated at the grass-root level and reach Parliament. He said democracy is reflected in the tradition of Ladakh. “The region traditionally has had a system of self-government in the villages. Gob and churp traditionally have been chief officers, who managed the distribution of water and other resources and looked after matters of agriculture and other works on the basis of mutual cooperation,” the Speaker said and added that Panchayati Raj institutions are directly connected with the people to take care of their problems and provide solutions. Local MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal said grass root democracy has been strengthened in Ladakh and Kargil regions after 2014 and the recent initiatives of the government have deepened democracy. He also hailed the massive infrastructure development initiatives being undertaken in the UT. Representatives from Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils, Kargil and Leh urged that the funds being given to the region should be categorised as “non-lapse” category as it was not possible to execute work for three-four months due to harsh weather conditions during winter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/participation-of-people-key-to-democracy-birla-in-ladakh/articleshow/85703428.cms||Akhilesh Singh

In a case of arbitration before a retired HC judge, the parties expressed their frustration over the retired judge repeatedly adjourning the proceedings on one pretext or the other but kept on raising fees for each sitting leaving the parties to foot hefty bills. "With folded hands we plead with the Supreme Court to stop this practice of certain retired judges dragging arbitration proceedings and fleecing parties with unreasonable fees running into lakhs of rupees for each sitting," lawyers told a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah. The bench appeared well aware of the maladies inserted into the otherwise efficacious alternative dispute resolution mechanism by certain unscrupulous retired judges while acting as arbitrators. Justice Chandrachud said that the Bombay High Court has devised an innovative way for speedy completion of arbitration proceedings by appointing young, competent and knowledgeable lawyers as arbitrators. "The Bombay HC has started appointing young lawyers as arbitrators, who take it as an honour to be chosen for the assignment by the HC. They conduct the arbitration proceedings smoothly and often charge meagre fees," the SC said. This assumes significance as for nearly two decade, the SC had been encouraging arbitration and had also taken steps towards making India an international arbitration hub. Last week, CJI N V Ramana opened the process for establishing an international arbitration centre at Hyderabad and had said that it would be both an answer and assurance for international investors who had apprehensions about India’s expensive and time-consuming litigation process. He added that this was the first step for the emergence of an alternate dispute resolution facility and expected it to be a reality in the next few months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-mulls-young-lawyers-as-arbitrators-to-cut-cost/articleshow/85703488.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Bar Council of India: Will frame rules to punish striking lawyers||NEW DELHI: As advocates keep resorting to strikes and bringing the justice delivery system to a halt in contravention to various judgments of the Supreme Court, the Bar Council of India has now decided to punish such lawyers and told the Supreme Court on Friday that rules in this regard would be framed. Appearing before a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah, chairman of the Bar Council of India, Manan Mishra, informed the court that a meeting of all state Bar Council has been convened on September 4 to discuss the issue and the rules would be finalised in the first week of next month. Echoing the sentiments of the court which have repeatedly held that lawyers going on strike/boycott courts could not be justified under the guise of the right to freedom of speech and expression as it affects the entire judicial system and violated litigants right to speedy justice guaranteed under the Constitution, Mishra told the bench that the rules would make provision to punish people for provoking lawyers on social media to go on strike. Bar Council of India, the apex statutory body to regulate lawyers, said that it would place before the court the draft rule for its approval. The BCI agreed to frame rules after being nudged by the apex court asking it not to remain a mute spectator when advocates behave in an unprofessional and unbecoming manner, "Taking a serious note of the fact that despite the aforesaid decisions of this Court, still the lawyers/Bar Associations go on strikes, we take suo moto cognisance and issue notices to the Bar Council of India and all the State Bar Councils to suggest the further course of action and to give concrete suggestions to deal with the problem of strikes/abstaining the work by the lawyers," the apex court has said while issuing notices. The court had said that judiciary as a institution ccould not afford to have lawyers frequently going on strikes and said "If the lawyers would have worked on those days, it would have been in the larger interest and it would have achieved the ultimate goal of speedy justice, which is now recognised as a fundamental right under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. It would have helped in early disposal of the criminal trials and therefore it would have been in the interest of those who are languishing in the jail and waiting for their trial to conclude".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bar-council-of-india-will-frame-rules-to-punish-striking-lawyers/articleshow/85703609.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Based on his observations, police have drawn up sketches of the accused. The six men who gang-raped an MBA student at Chamundi foothills were in their late 20s and demanded Rs 3 lakh not to make public videos of the assault, the survivor’s classmate told police in his statement on Friday. Based on his observations, cops have drawn up sketches of the accused and gathered crime scene details. Three days after the 22-year-old student from Mumbai was assaulted, police are yet to identify the perpetrators. Home minister Araga Jnanendra, who visited the crime spot on Friday, said five police teams have been formed to hunt for the suspects. No arrests have been made so far. As the rape survivor is still in a state of shock, police said they are seeking details from her friend who accompanied her to the secluded spot on the night of August 24. Police are looking at criminal elements in neighbouring states as well because the classmate said they were not conversing in the local language. “The liquor bottles we found also belong to a different state,” said an officer. The classmate, a local, reportedly told police: “Around 7.30pm, we went for a bike ride. We took a walk on the kuchcha road which I am familiar with since I jog there. Suddenly, six men started attacking us,” police sources quoted him as saying. He said they beat him with sticks and smashed his forehead with a small boulder, after which he fell unconscious. “When I woke up, I found four people surrounding me. I asked where my classmate was. Two of them dragged her out of the bush and laid her beside me. She seemed unconscious and was severely injured.” The assaulters made him call his father to arrange for Rs 3 lakh. He confirmed the rapists filmed the crime and threatened to post the videos online. His father arrived in a car and rushed the survivor to hospital, police said. The car was seized. Rapists should be shot, says Ex-CM HD KumaraswamyEx-CM HD Kumaraswamy said Karnataka police should take a cue from Telangana cops, referring to the killing of four rape accused in an encounter in Hyderabad in 2019. “Culprits in a sexual assault case usually get jail time and secure bail.

A circular issued on Thursday bars women students from venturing out within the campus, unaccompanied, after 6pm. This applies to Manasa Gangothri, the PG campus of the university, as well. It houses 85 PG departments, 3 women’s hostels and a men’s hostel. As for Kukkarahalli lake, which spans 250 acres and is right in front of the campus, students are not to enter the area — alone or accompanied — after 6.30pm. Order will be rectified, says VC Prof G Hemantha KumarThe circular, issued by registrar R Shivappa, said students’ movement would be restricted in view of the gang rape, to ensure their security. Varsity security staff have been asked to patrol the campus from 6pm to 9pm every day.As the order sparked outrage, vice-chancellor Prof G Hemantha Kumar said it would be rectified by Saturday. “It has been issued after police raised concerns over the safety of girl students on the campus which has lonely places. The intention of the order is to prevent the movement of girl students at such places. Kukkarahalli lake region almost resembles a forest due to thick vegetation. So entry is banned after late evening," he said.He added, “We wanted to convey to girl students that instead of going alone by themselves, they should go along with their friend.

It also tossed out a petition by the Ahmedabad Medical Association which said abrupt closure of non-compliant healthcare facilities would shut out nearly 30,000 beds, which could prove to be a disaster for the general public, especially when experts are predicting a third wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The bench said, “If the mushrooming clinics operating from residential areas without fire exit, fire safety and without complying with the urban town planning norms are closed, it would save the patients from risking their lives. We saw how several people were killed in the fires at hospitals in Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Mumbai.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-gujarat-notice-exempting-hospitals-from-building-norms/articleshow/85703759.cms||---
---||India||25k farmers to use stubble solution||NEW DELHI: The Pusa decomposer, a bio-enzyme developed by the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) to decompose crop residue, may get some traction this winter as over 25,000 farmers in Punjab and Haryana, covering more than 5,00,000 acres, have enrolled with a company to use it to manage their paddy stubble during the post-harvest period in October-November. Stubble burning episodes every year contribute to deterioration of air quality in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas. Such episodes are mostly reported from Punjab and Haryana where farmers resort to the method to quickly prepare their farms for sowing wheat. The company, nurture.farm - an integrated technology-led solutions provider for sustainable agriculture globally - has partnered with IARI and IIM Rohtak for developing and scaling the solution under Phase I of the initiative as a pilot project where farmers will get the solution free of cost. “We have planned to scale up the operations to end stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana in the next three years,” said Dhruv Sawhney, COO and business head, nurture.farm. Asked how can the company provide free of cost solution to all farmers covering 5.7 million acres of land under paddy in both the states, Sawhney told TOI on Friday that digitally onboarding farmers for this operation would help company offer different technology-led solutions to them for sustainable farming. “The efforts will generate carbon credits (from reducing emissions if farmers stop biomass burning and adopt other sustainable practices in farming) and enable market linkages. The entire value chain down the road would be a win-win situation for both farmers and service providers once this model is successful,” said Sawhney. The Pusa decomposer decomposes stubble within 20-25 days after spraying and turns it into manure, improving the soil quality. Since use of Happy Seeder (a tractor-operated machine for in-situ management of paddy stubble) continues to be an expensive method for majority of the farmers, the cost-effective decomposer can be a popular alternative. One packet of four capsules of Pusa decomposer, costing Rs 20, can be used to make 25 litres of solution that can be used in one hectare (2.5 acres) of land. The IARI has, so far, licensed its technology to 12 companies for mass multiplication and marketing of the Pusa Decomposer. In addition, the institute has produced about 20,000 packets of Pusa decomposer at its own facility for use by the farmers. Last year, Pusa decomposer was provided for use in 5,730 hectares of areas in different states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, West Bengal and Telangana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/25k-farmers-to-use-stubble-solution/articleshow/85703839.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Expressing their concerns over the EU’s move, these four countries along with India also put forward their formal objections to the proposal in the ‘New Delhi statement on environment’ as they pledged to cooperate with each other and take joint stands at multilateral forum. Under the world’s first such proposal on carbon border tax, 27 EU nations had recently decided to impose border tax on imports of carbon-intensive goods. The tax plan, yet to be legally formalised, will come into force from 2026. “We noted with grave concern the proposals for introducing trade barriers, such as unilateral carbon border adjustment, that are discriminatory,” said the New Delhi statement, adopted after day-long deliberations at the virtual BRICS environment ministerial meeting chaired by India. Besides cooperation on different contentious issues at global forum, the BRICS nations also decided to jointly work on abatement and control of air and water pollution. “The year 2021 is a crucial year not only for BRICS but also for the whole world as we have UN biodiversity conference (COP15) in October and UN climate change conference (COP26) in November where BRICS countries can play a very significant role in addressing the contemporary global challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, air pollution, marine plastic litter etc,” said environment minister Bhupender Yadav while addressing the meeting. He also underlined India’s position, on collective actions towards “climate justice, sustainable lifestyle, and responsible consumption and production”. India has been promoting these issues at every multilateral forum on environment and climate change while asking rich nations (historical polluters) to act in accordance with principles of ‘equity’ and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). Referring to the recent IPCC report on climate change, the minister said it has given enough indications that the world faces a “now or never” kind of situation where concrete “collective global actions” would be needed against environmental and climate challenges. On air pollution front, the BRICS nations during the meeting spoke on sharing of experiences of best practices and collaboration in areas of uniformity in methodology for air quality data generation, its quality control and assurance, cleaner technologies at process as well as in pollution control, abatement, and prevention, and strengthening of national air quality monitoring network.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brics-nations-join-india-in-opposing-eu-carbon-tax/articleshow/85704371.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The district administration has provided employment to the kin of 56 deceased government employees in a span of just six months, adhering to the instructions issued by Yadav. Previously, the kin of employees who had died in service would have to wait several years and in some cases, decades, to get relief, particularly for employment under compassionate grounds. Soon after taking reins of the district administration, Yadav directed that no applicant seeking employment under compassionate grounds should be kept waiting for a long time. He directed the joint collectors, RDOs and all heads of departments of district wings to process these applications on a war footing basis. “Losing a family member is always a devastating experience. It is not fair on our part to leave the families of our own colleagues in lurch and make them roam around offices to get relief,” Yadav said. Although it is not possible to compensate for the loss of a family member, providing relief by way of giving employment to those eligible in the family would help the deceased’s kin, Yadav had advised officials at review meetings. He had also referred to chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s instructions on the issue. The collector’s special focus on the issue set the ball rolling as the departments routed files for granting appointment to 56 members of deceased employees since last February. “Twenty-three candidates have been appointed as junior assistants, 19 posted as typists and 14 as office subordinates in revenue, commercial taxes, police, registration, audit, agriculture, survey and forest departments in the last six months,” said a senior official. Employment is also being provided to the kin of victims in SC, ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act cases. As many as 21 people were issued appointment orders on Thursday, said joint collector (welfare) K Sridhar Reddy. AP NGOs leader B Srinivasa Rao thanked Vivek Yadav for his humanitarian gesture.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/speedy-relief-for-kin-of-deceased-govt-staffers-after-collector-steps-in/articleshow/85696899.cms||Samdani MN

The threat calls were allegedly made on the personal cellphone of Paras three days after lubricants were thrown on him during a visit to his Lok Sabha constituency Hajipur. Though LJP leader Paras didn’t mention the name of anybody in the complaint submitted to Delhi police on Wednesday, he apprehended threat to his life from his political rivals in Bihar. He also demanded a Z-plus security for him. The minister’s cavalcade was shown black flags by a group of people during his visit to Hajipur on August 23. Chirag, in a statement, said he wanted a fair investigation into the incident. “The government should take the matter seriously and initiate action against the culprits on the basis of evidence. The truth must come out,” he said in Patna before setting out for his ‘ashirvad yatra’ in Aurangabad. Chirag added, “Pashupati Kumar Paras is my uncle and will always remain so. I used to consider him as my guardian after the death of my father and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan. But he chose a different way for him.” Accusing CM Nitish Kumar of plotting division in Paswan family, the Jamui MP said the LJP was not included in the 10-party delegation of state leaders that met PM Narendra Modi on the issue of caste-based census in the country. “I had earlier written to the CM in this regard,” he said. Chirag added the LJP founded by his father had bagged over 25 lakh votes in the state assembly election held last year. “Despite the fact that the LJP is a national party, it was not included in the delegation. It’s a matter of concern,” he said. Earlier, a police complaint was lodged against Chirag and his four functionaries by Keshav Singh, principal general secretary of LJP’s Paras faction, with the Shastri Nagar police station in Patna after the Hajipur incident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/chirag-seeks-probe-into-attack-on-paras/articleshow/85698810.cms||Ramashankar

He said it is now the responsibility of civil aviation ministry and Airports Authority of India (AAI) to start the development works. “State government has provided 108 acres of land to civil aviation ministry at Bihta for construction of a modern civil enclave and other utilities for commencing commercial flight operations from the airbase. The land was acquired after the state cabinet passed a proposal in this regard. Now, the work has to be carried out by civil aviation ministry and AAI,” Jha told TOI. The state cabinet headed by CM Nitish had on November, 2016, sanctioned Rs 260.74 crore for acquisition of 120 acres of land at Bihta airbase. Of the 120 acres of land, 108 acres is proposed to be utilised for development of civil enclave and the remaining 18 acres would be used by state government for development of amenities, including a VIP lounge, a hotel and a hangar. As per initial plans, AAI had planned to commence the construction of first block of the proposed civil enclave at Bihta airbase in 2019 with an expenditure of Rs 500 crore. However, no work has started yet. With regard to additional land sought for installation of new equipment at Patna airport, Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary of state cabinet secretariat department, said 16.5 acres of land has already been handed over to AAI and process is underway for transferring another 22 acres of land. “The state government has already transferred 4.5 acres of land for installation of doppler very high frequency omni range (DVOR) equipment and 12 acres for creating an isolation bay near the runway at Patna airport. The civil aviation ministry has sought another 22 acres of land for development of a parallel taxi track along the runway. The CM has already given in-principle approval for transfer of the required land to AAI,” Sanjay said. He added, “The land belongs to different government departments, including transport department and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). While the lease of a part of land given to ICAR will be cancelled, transport department has already been asked to issue no-objection certificate or the land under their jurisdiction.” According to a statement issued by Press Information Bureau (PIB) on August 25, Union minister Scindia had written to Nitish regarding requirement of 49.5 acres of land at Patna airport for runway extension, parallel taxi track, DVOR equipment, isolation bay and glide path. Patna airport apart, IPRD minister Sanjay Jha said state government has already provided 31 acres of land at Darbhanga for construction of civil enclave, following which flight operations commenced from last year. “With increased traffic, requirement of more flights and expansion of Darbhanga airport were felt. The CM recently held a meeting and issued instruction for allotment of more funds to the district administration for land acquisition and other works. Seventy-four acres of land is being made available to civil aviation ministry at Darbhanga airport,” Jha said. The minister added the state government has also given consent to the civil aviation ministry for commencing runway strengthening and other groundwork at the airbase in Purnia. “Process is underway for transferring the land required for construction of civil enclave at Purnia airbase, which has been selected for commencing commercial flights operation under Centre’s UDAN scheme,” Jha said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/land-not-an-issue-for-expansion-of-airports-in-bihar-minister/articleshow/85698760.cms||Piyush Tripathi

He said plantation on the banks of the Ganga would help in checking the windblown dust sediments reaching the state capital and adding to its pollution load. The study was conducted by The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI), centre for environment, energy and climate change, Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI), Patna and Bloomberg philanthropies. As the plantation along the Ganga was one of the suggestions made in the study, the minister said similar forestation would be made along other rivers passing through important towns of the state for checking pollution. “Global warming has now become an international issue. However, the state through various programmes like Ujjwala scheme for rural women to check pollution by burning woods in kitchens, and the massive Neem tree plantation drive in all government hospitals of Bihar are some of the environment-friendly measures launched by the government,” Neeraj said. Seven locations of Patna, including residential, commercial and industrial, were selected for study on the ambient air quality. Among the chemical constituents, ions of ammonia, calcium, chlorine, sulphur and nitrite were the most dominating elements found in the air samples. Dust from road, soil and construction works were others agents adding to the concentration of particulate matter in the city's air. The study suggested mechanical sweeping of roads and lanes and effective dust control around the construction sites. Principal secretary of EFCC department, Deepak Kumar Singh, was also present at the function. Others who addressed the study release function included Dr AK Ghosh, chairman of Bihar Pollution Control Board (BPCB), R Suresh of TERI, P Ghosh of ADRI and S Chandrashekhar, member secretary of BPCB.

---||Business||Kotak MF can’t offer fresh FMPs for 6 months: Sebi||MUMBAI: A default by some of the Essel Group companies is still affecting mutual funds more than two years later. Markets regulator Sebi on Friday penalised Kotak Mutual Fund for its delay in making full payment to some of its investors in mid-2019. The delay happened because two Essel Group companies — Edisons Utility Works and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures — had defaulted on non-convertible debentures (NCDs) held by six fixed maturity plans (FMPs) of Kotak MF. Sebi barred Kotak MF from launching new FMPs for six months and asked it to pay a fine of Rs 50 lakh. Further, it ordered the fund house to partially refund fees relating to fund management and advisory to investors in those six FMPs. In these FMPs, the full amount was not refunded to its investors after two of the Essel Group companies failed to refund money to these Kotak MF’s schemes during 2019. A spokesperson for the fund house, reacting to the Sebi order, said that all the investors were fully repaid along with applicable interest in September 2019. Kotak MF “is committed to protecting investor interest at all times”, the spokesperson added. The case relates to the fund house’s holding of zero-coupon NCDs of the two Essel Group companies in six FMPs on which the companies defaulted in April-May 2019. Although the NCDs were backed by shares of Zee Entertainment as collateral with the fund house, the share price had then fallen drastically. Hence, the fund house didn’t sell those shares to partially recover its loan to the two companies, sources in the MF had then told TOI. Since five other fund houses were also in a similar position, holding Zee Ent shares as collateral, any forced selling by Kotak MF would have prompted other fund houses to also sell the stock, leading to a crash in its price, the source had said then. At that time, HDFC MF, Aditya Birla MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Templeton MF and UTIMF were also hit by defaults by Essel Group companies. In its 84-page order, Sebi said that there were lapses on the part of Kotak MF in carrying out due diligence and in risk assessment while taking investment decisions relating to these NCDs. Sebi also said that the fund house had failed to disclose information about negative impact on the six FMPs to its investors on time. “Utter neglect of due diligence, inordinate delay in communicating with the investors, violation of the statutory sanctity of the maturity dates of the FMP schemes, permitting extension of the maturity of the NCDs of the issuers in contravention of extant regulations, etc...there remains no doubt in mind that the (fund house) has acted in gross violation of provisions of the Sebi … as well as various circulars issued by Sebi from time to time,” the order said. On its part, Kotak MF had relied on a Sebi circular relating to MFs issued on June 20, 2002 that had said that fund houses would make all effort to recover the full value of its investments that is illiquid till two years after closure of a scheme. Following the Sebi regulations, the fund house had made all efforts to recover full value of NCDs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kotak-mf-cant-offer-fresh-fmps-for-6-months-sebi/articleshow/85699966.cms||---

A direction in this regard was issued by additional chief secretary of health department Pratyaya Amrit at the meeting of the State Tobacco Control Coordination Committee here on Friday. Expressing serious concern over the issue, Amrit said schoolchildren and other youths were the worst victims of tobacco addiction and there was an urgent need to counsel them against the adverse health impact caused by it. “Tobacco is the main cause of oral cancer which counts 40% of all the cases of cancer. Again, 90% cases of oral cancer are due to use of tobacco,” Amrit added. He urged the people to initiate a united effort to keep the society away from this addiction, which is now taking even the schoolchildren in its grip. Amrit said all government departments needed to act in coordination for effective implementation of the law in this regard and also slap punishment on those violating the provisions. State programme officer of tobacco control programme, Sunil Kumar, said people’s representatives and government employees would also play an important role in creating awareness against tobacco addiction. Additional executive director of State Health Society Animesh Kumar Parashar and other officials were present at the function.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/make-all-govt-offices-hospitals-in-bihar-tobacco-free-premises/articleshow/85698180.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops prosecute 660 bikers in a day, to re-launch hands-on training sessions||KOLKATA: Police on Friday prosecuted 660 two-wheelers for plying illegally in the city. Two-wheelers have been responsible for 15 accidents leading to three deaths and 21 injuries in the past week in Kolkata. On Thursday alone, there were four accidents. Kolkata Police will relaunch some of its on-road training programmes from next week for two-wheeler riders. At the heart of this is a training module used successfully in the past two years — the entire focus is to make two-wheeler riders and pedestrians aware of the blind spots for heavier commercial vehicles like buses and trucks and ask them to stick to lanes. The target will mainly be owners of bikes and scooters but cyclists may be included in the list later on. Pedestrian First convenor Prashant Inamdar had recently said, “The focus should be on the enforcement system, and penalty collection system, which will yield good results in the future. We have to look for out-of-the-box solutions to enforce the helmet rule in the city. There is a need to take a re-look at the entire issue once again in the larger interests of citizens.” The police said that they are likely to get in touch with the transport department about plying of two-wheelers. “We cannot hold training sessions at traffic guards due to pandemic. We can, however, hold some basic classes with help of transport department. On Friday, a bike crashed into another two-wheeler at Phoolbagan, injuring a 23-year-old woman,” said a senior officer. In 2019, there had been 177 fatal accidents. In 2020, there were 112 due to prolonged lockdown phases. In 2021, total fatal accidents stand at 125 so far, in which 134 persons were killed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-prosecute-660-bikers-in-a-day-to-re-launch-hands-on-training-sessions/articleshow/85698457.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||Madras high court’s 5-yr motor cover order to hike car costs||CHENNAI/MUMBAI: The Madras high court verdict making 5-year ‘bumper-to-bumper’ motor insurance mandatory will increase the cost of vehicle acquisition by 8-10% of its current price. According to dealers and car marketers, this decision will make a car dearer by anywhere between Rs 50,000 and Rs 5 lakh. Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) president Vinkesh Gulati said, “This will be a major issue for an industry just about coming out of the pandemic. This will push up acquisition cost of motorcycles and scooters by Rs 5,000-6,000, entry-level cars like Alto or Kwid by Rs 50,000 and a mid-market SUV like Creta by more than Rs 2 lakh.” The catch in this is that pricing is controlled by the sector regulator Irdai, which in August 2020 withdrew mandatory long-term insurance for new vehicles. “The Irdai will have to agree to change the premium structure,” said JATO Dynamics president Ravi Bhatia. “Currently, the 1-year policy is around 3% of the car value. With this ruling, the dealer has to sell the vehicle with 5-year insurance, which is a huge upfront expense for the customer. Given that the insurance industry globally is moving towards more flexibility where the customer pays per month depending on usage, this is counter-productive and will retard car sales,” he added. Car marketers say this will go against the holistic view of the auto industry, which balances affordability, safety and growth. MG Motor India president & CEO Rajeev Chaba said that the auto industry needs a “holistic view” that balances “consumer interests, safety and overall cost of acquisition & ownership with environment & emission issues and job creation & local manufacturing”. Without that, he added, there cannot be “exceptional growth”. Insurers are divided in their view on whether a comprehensive cover can be made mandatory. “The law requires that a vehicle owner buy only third-party insurance. Comprehensive cover is a voluntary contract between two parties. Someone can appeal, saying that they cannot be forced to purchase a cover,” said an official. However, another insurer said that there is scope to make cover mandatory as that is the only way to ensure insurance penetration. “If third-party insurance was not mandatory, we would not be getting the extent of coverage that is there at present,” he said. Industry officials feel that the order is directed at the transport department, asking them to ensure compliance. “The insurance industry has not been asked to do anything and we will continue to sell policies. Even today, 99% new vehicles opt for comprehensive cover,” said an official. “In the larger interest of society, vehicles should have adequate coverage and owner should be aware of the scope of coverage. Dealerships should have a board giving the customer information on accidental insurance cover as well,” said Digit Insurance head (legal, claims & investigation) Ajay Jadeja. He added that If owner buys standalone compulsory personal accident policy, then the owners risk is covered in all vehicles he owns. The HC order reads, “After September 1, 2021, it is mandatory for coverage of bumper-to-bumper insurance every year, in addition to covering the driver, passengers and owner of the vehicle, for a period of five years.” Insurers are not clear whether implementation would mean that the premium for five years has to be collected up front. Industry officials are also surprised at the use of the term ‘bumper-to-bumper’ cover as it is a layman term for widest possible cover. This, in some cases, is interpreted to mean comprehensive cover, while others use it to refer to zero depreciation policies where the insured get parts replaced without deduction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hcs-5-yr-motor-cover-order-to-hike-car-costs/articleshow/85699849.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

However, the RBI is yet to finalise whether to launch the currency using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or a centralised ledger. DLT is the platform on which cryptocurrencies are based, enabling them to be held and traded without any central authority. The statement by Das indicates that the RBI is on track with its plans for a central bank digital currency (CBIC). “We are being extremely careful about it because it’s completely a new product, not just for the RBI, but globally,” Das told a TV channel. He said that the RBI is studying various aspects of digital currency, including its security, impact on India’s financial sector as well as how it would affect monetary policy and currency in circulation. In the interview, Das said that the monetary policy could change course if there was a sign of durable recovery. He said that while currently there is a gap in capacity utilisation in India and there is slack in the economy, he did not see any sign of stagflation. During the monetary policy press conference on August 6, RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar had said that the central bank would come out with a mode for operations of fiat digital currency by the end of the year. A fortnight before the monetary policy, Sankar had said that every central bank in the world was likely to launch a digital currency and said the time for them is now. RBI’s launch of a digital currency comes when it has mounting concerns over the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies. Although the Supreme Court has lifted a ban on banks providing services to companies dealing in cryptocurrencies, banks are reluctant to support such businesses given their regulator’s discomfort.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-may-launch-e-currency-by-dec/articleshow/85699576.cms||---

It was the first time on Thursday that his wife and partner met. But neither made any demand for the body, allowing cops to hand it over to the man’s kin. Md Alamgir had met his “love” 24 years ago outside an apartment where he worked and, since they belonged to different communities, he proposed he use a Hindu name. A year later, as the woman from Bangasree Pally gave birth to a girl, the man, now rechristened Ajoy Giri, told her he had a house to look after and couldn’t abandon his parents. For 12 years, they mostly stayed apart before he returned to take care of his daughter. But he would often go home in Karaya for work and ailing kin. On August 24, he died at the woman’s residence about three days after falling ill, when the woman, a domestic help, and their 23-year-old daughter were out. “As the death took place when no one was at home, Vidyasagar Hospital informed Parnasree police. We asked for his address and the woman claimed he had been working in Chetla and his parents lived in Karaya. She added they were never officially married. We looked into his phone thinking foul play might be involved,” said an officer. But cops stumbled on to an address of Topsia. “We found a 50-year-old woman who identified the man as her husband who had recently gone missing. The homemaker, who has a 22-year-old son with the deceased, said she had no idea Alamgir had a second wife but said he often stayed back in Alipore where he worked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/death-exposes-57-yr-old-mans-24-year-double-life/articleshow/85698415.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Vijayawada||‘Offline GOs’ PIL: HC issues notices to govt||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Friday issued notices to the state government to file counter affidavit in the public interest litigation petition challenging the decision to not publish government orders online. The government recently took a decision not to post GOs online and a memo was issued to all departments directing that all GOs should be issued in offline mode with immediate effect. The government has been posting all GOs, other than those classified as confidential, online since 2008. One GMNS Devi moved a PIL challenging the decision, stating it violated the Right to Information Act. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate VVSS Srikanth said citizens have the right to know about the day-to-day activities of the government. Not publishing the GOs online tramples the rights of citizens guaranteed under the RTI Act, he alleged, and cited the recent orders of the Telangana high court in a similar matter directing the state government to put GOs online within 24 hours of issuance. When the high court sought the government’s response from special government pleader C Sumon, he sought time to submit details by obtaining instructions from the officials concerned. Considering the arguments of the petitioner, the HC bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya issued notices to the state government, directing it to file an affidavit on contentions raised in the petition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/offline-gos-pil-hc-issues-notices-to-govt/articleshow/85697605.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Till now, 55% of earth work and 48% of runway and other pavement work has been completed, stated a press release from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) on Thursday. This airport, located around 30 kms from the city on the Ahmedabad-Rajkot highway, is expected to boost the industrial growth of the Saurashtra region. The brass industry of Jamnagar and ceramic industry of Morbi depend on Rajkot for air connectivity. A bypass road from both destinations to reach this airport has already been constructed. The airport is being developed at the cost of Rs 1,400 crore and the terminal will be capable of handling 1,300 passengers during peak hours. The airport, spread over 1,032 hectares, will have all modern facilities for passengers. “The terminal will have state-of-the-art passenger facilities, four passenger boarding bridges, three conveyor belts and 20 check-in counters along with modern firefighting and fire alarm systems,” the release said. There are plans to develop ample parking space. The runway length of the airport is 3040 m so as to enable landing and takeoff of B777-300ER and B747-400 type of aircraft. The airport will be capable of parking 14 aircraft at any given time. According to AAI, the design of the Hirasar airport is influenced by the existing palaces of Rajkot like Ranjit Vilas Palace.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/hirasar-to-be-ready-by-2023/articleshow/85699816.cms||---

PS Bhattacharya, project general manager, told TOI, “We completed the underground cable project on March 25 in a record time. The underground cabling will not just ensure uninterrupted power supply and reduced theft of power but also increased revenue for the UPCL.” The official added that 99% of electricity poles, overhead conductors, and insulators were removed during the project, making the city traffic more smooth. However, the project has come under sharp criticism from Congress. Nagar Nigam councillor and Congress leader Ashok Sharma called the work ‘unsatisfactory’. He also pointed out that the underground cables are laid in ducts specifically made for the purpose but no such ducts were made. To this, project manager Sanjiv Sharma said, “Ducts were made for cables as per requirement. The only exceptions were in the cases of nullahs, bridges and transformers where cables were put in galvanised iron (GI) pipes.” Earlier in February this year, mayor Anita Sharma had written a letter to the President of India alleging that while several structures in the city were demolished to clear encroachments in 2018, low-tension panels, which obstruct roads across the city, were erected in 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/underground-cable-project-completed-in-haridwar-say-officials-congress-points-out-glitches/articleshow/85696307.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

The proposal was tabled at the 51st standing committee meeting of the PMC chaired by mayor Sita Sahu here in presence of municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma and others. The civic body has agreed to give no-objection certificate to hand over 3,866sqm of land Mithapur station, 587sqm at autorickshaw stand near Patna Junction, 29.4sqm and 3,192.64sqm at Mithapur bus stand and 598sqm near Zero Mile at Transport Nagar to the UDHD. Sahu said the UDHD had earlier sent the proposal, seeking municipal land for construction metro stations, track and other works being carried out by Patna Metro Rail Corporation (PMRC). In lieu, the civic body has asked for the same amount of land from the department, she said. The PMC has passed the proposal to spend Rs 204 crore which was allocated under the Centre’s programme for combating air pollution and solid waste management and water supply management, by the 15th Finance Commission during the fiscal year 2020-21. Around Rs 20 crore will be given to transport department for the purchase of compressed natural gas (CNG) buses and Rs 15 crore to the environment, forest and climate change department to upgrade the unorganised parks in the municipal area. As per the plan, the parks will have benches, children rides, lights, boundary walls and food kiosks. Under the programme, the water bodies will be rejuvenated as the recreational area. The civic body will also procure sweeping machines, smog guns, mist sprayers and water sprinkler vehicles with an aim to improve air quality in the city. A proposal for setting up a leachate treatment plant at landfill site in Ramachak Bairiya to overcome the problem of seepage during monsoon was also passed in the meeting. Leachate is the black, foul-smelling toxic liquid emanating from rotting garbage at landfills and it infiltrates down to irreversibly contaminate the groundwater as well. “The civic body will now have one secondary garbage point each in all circles – Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankarbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City. There will be one secondary garbage point for 2-3 wards in order to keep the city clean. It will also help in segregation of solid and wet waste before they are dumped at the landfill site,” Sahu said. Altogether 29 proposals were approved at the meeting, including installation of submersible pumps, high-yield borings, litter-picker machine, mini excavator machine, two animal crematoriums at landfill site and five crematoriums at ghats in Patna City and Digha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/civic-body-approves-transfer-of-land-for-metro-rail-project-in-patna/articleshow/85698377.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation-Kolkata Police operation to enforce mask rule at markets||KOLKATA: The KMC and Kolkata Police will jointly conduct an awareness drive at the city’s markets to enforce wearing of masks. Traders of Kolkata’s major markets will be asked to entertain buyers only when they wear a mask, besides themselves wearing masks. KMC Board of Administrators chairman Firhad Hakim on Friday held an urgent meeting to enforce Covid protocols at major markets ahead of the anticipated third wave. Later, Hakim told reporters that the civic body will act against the traders who entertained customers without a mask. Kolkata’s markets had become hot spots of Covid infection last year. Keeping this in mind, the civic body has decided to enforce a strict ‘no mask, no entry’ policy at markets. The KMC officials will accompany police officers as part of the awareness drive. After an initial round of awareness, surprise raid will follow. According to a KMC health department official, the raids won’t spare the traders who failed to obey the instructions. “We will conduct surprise raids after conducting the awareness drive. If any trader is found guilty, he or she will have to face strict action,” a market department official said. The KMC is particularly worried about the functioning of several markets, including those in Bijoygarh, Azadgarh, Golf Green, Baghajatin and Maniktala, which had become hot spots of Covid infection last year. “We have asked the local ward coordinators to help us identify the traders who have been dodging all Covid protocols,” said a health department official associated with the KMC Covid combat team.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-cop-op-to-enforce-mask-rule-at-markets/articleshow/85698328.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Patna||RJD takes credit for govt move to fill vacant faculty positions||PATNA: The RJD on Friday claimed that its party workers and leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav compelled the Centre to fill the faculty positions, especially in reserved categories, lying vacant in the central universities and other central higher education institutions in a mission mode. Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi, called it the victory of the party’s collective efforts. He shared on his social media sites the letter which union education secretary Amit Khare had written to the heads of educational institutions on August 24 to fill the vacancies in a mission mode within a period of one year starting from September 5, 2021. “I am writing in connection with the faculty positions that are lying vacant, especially in the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and EWS category in the Central Higher Education Institutions (CHEIs) functioning under the administrative control of the ministry of education,” read a part of the letter addressed to all the directors of IITs, NITs, IIITs, IIMs, vice-chancellors of central universities and heads of centrally funded higher institutes and councils. RJD state president Jagadanand Singh said it was their party’s protest on August 7 under the leadership of Tejashwi on the occasion of Mandal Diwas, which forced the Centre to take such a decision. He further said RJD MPs had several times raised questions in Parliament regarding vacancies and his party men had also come on the road in support of this demand. “Kneeling down in front of our struggle, the central government has asked all the central universities to fill the backlogs in teaching posts reserved for SCs, STs and OBCs,” read a statement issued by Jagadanand. “Our party and leader have always been fighting for public rights. Our collective effort has started showing results and we will continue with it to reach the destination,” Jagadanand said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rjd-takes-credit-for-govt-move-to-fill-vacant-faculty-positions/articleshow/85698213.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Talking about the importance of highly nutritious drumstick, senior scientist and head of the KVK, Reeta Singh, said, “Generally, drumstick (botanical name moringa oleifera) and its pods are consumed by many people during its season, but few people know that fresh leaves of moringa are rich in minerals such as iron, calcium and potassium. The nutrition value of these leaves can be compared with high energy giving fruits such as carrots, oranges, pomegranates and reddish. One can grow this plant in an adverse climatic condition also.” Reeta said very few farmers know about its importance as a green fodder for cattle. “The remarkable thing about drumstick plant leaves is that its intake increases the milk output of cows and buffaloes and helps in making the cattle free from several diseases," she said. Speaking about its iron, calcium, potassium and other nutritious mineral contents, she said, “The diet of a lactating mother should be rich. Therefore, intake of two spoons of its leaves in powder form in the morning can do wonders as the woman may not need iron tablets.” In Jharkand and Odisha, people dry moringa leaves and keep it in powder form to mix it with ‘daal’ and ‘chapattis’ for the fortification of their diet plan. “But, it should be taken in a measured form. Intake of more than 5gm ever day can cause diarrhoea and dysentery,” she said. “It also helps in purification of the water and is also used for enriching the baby food,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/farmers-given-tips-on-benefits-of-drumstick/articleshow/85698083.cms||---

He has been made the party’s student wing president. The action against Aakash had irked RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap so much that he had sounded bugle of revolt against state party president Jagadanand Singh and his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s close aide Sanjay Yadav. Aakash thanked Paras and the party’s state president Prince Raj, MP. “The party (RJD) for which I worked for seven years insulted and ousted me. However, Paras sir and Prince bhaiya recognised my hard work by giving me the charge of student wing,” he told the media. When asked whether he will bring Tej Pratap also to the LJP (Paras) as the latter was not being given any importance in the RJD, Aakash said, “ I am a small worker and I will try to rope in as many students of the universities as possible and sort their issue. Workers, not a leader, make a party strong.” He further said many Chhatra RJD members will join him at Patna. Both Paras and Prince welcomed Aakash to their party and said his joining will strengthen their faction. Aakash came into limelight at the Chhatra RJD event during which the photograph of Tejashwi was missing while Tej was prominently displayed with his own on the main poster outside the party headquarters. That poster was removed next morning. Later, Jagadanand appointed Gagan Kumar the Chhatra RJD state president, following which Tej publicly criticised him and demanded his resignation. He also accused Jagadanand was being misguided by Sanjay Yadav. When asked about the rumour that Tej Pratap also may join hands with Paras, a senior RJD leader said, “He will never leave the party as his identity will be lost and presently he is an RJD MLA.” When asked about Aakash, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, “First of all Aakash never held the post of state Chhatra RJD president. It is a one’s personal choice which party he chooses to be with.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/tej-prataps-key-aide-joins-paras-faction-of-ljp/articleshow/85698505.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Residents allege that Ramky, the developer of JNPC and APIIC, has not taken any step to relocate them. They said they had been experiencing skin and respiratory problems for the past few years due to pollution caused by the pharma city. Tadi village, with over 500 houses, has a population of over 2,000 people. The green belt area was reduced by Ramky. Units coming up in the area earmarked for the belt pose a danger Tadi, which is only 50 meters away from the JNPC. “The groundwater here is contaminated. We have been purchasing water for drinking and other purposes. Child stunting is alarming and pregnant women are facing difficulties as a result of pollution,” say villagers B G Raju, K A Raju and G Chittibabu. District medical and health officer (DMHO), Vizag, P Surya Narayana said people in the village were complaining of pollution-related diseases. “A few years ago, we had conducted a survey in Tanam village under Parawada mandal to assess the pollution levels. We will discuss with the district administration the issues in Tadi,” he added. Speaking to TOI, B V Rani, mandal revenue officer, Parawada, said, “There is a proposal to relocate them to Peda Mushidivada under Parawada mandal.

The court’s directive came after the hearing of a petition challenging the government’s recent decision to take over willing private aided degree colleges and absorb aided staff into government services. The petitioners contended that students seeking admission into these colleges could not secure admission into their desired courses due to the government’s decision. Advocate Narra Srinivasa Rao, arguing on behalf of the petitioners, said the ordinance is violative of Articles 14, 19, 21 and 300A of the Constitution, and the AP Education Act and UGC Act. The government pleader countered the arguments, saying the taking over of colleges is meant to provide better facilities and to rationalise the teaching staff so that to utilise their services in an effective manner. The HC bench, headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya, asked him to submit details on taking over of private aided colleges by the government. — Srikanth Aluri||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/hc-seeks-details-on-govt-takeover-of-aided-colleges/articleshow/85697631.cms||---

The sensex closed 176 pts higher at 56,125, its all-time closing high with investors banking on economic recovery to pick up pace, market players said. The day’s gains on Dalal Street also got a boost from the 53-paise gain in the rupee-dollar rate to 73.69-to-a-dollar mark as the RBI did not intervene in the face of huge dollar inflows, they said. The day’s rally took investors’ wealth to a new record peak at above the Rs 246 lakh crore, official data showed. However, selling in Infosys, HDFC Bank and RIL limited the day’s gains. According to Joseph Thomas, head of research, Emkay Wealth Management, the market remained buoyant during the week because of expectations of good performance of the economy and corporates, “mainly against the background of low interest rates and liquidity which is aplenty”. The global markets are looking forward to the Jackson Hole Speech by the US Fed chairman, for more specific hints on the tapering, which could have some impact on the markets’ trend next week, Thomas said. Two factors are, however, making marketmen cautious, brokers said. For one, after three weeks of net inflows, foreign investors turned net sellers again this week. On Friday, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 779 crore, BSE data showed. In addition, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bonds is showing a rising trend. On Friday it closed above the 6.25% mark. According to Suman Chowdhury, Chief Analytical Officer, Acuite Ratings & Research, the net FPI outflow doesn’t augur well for the Indian equity markets in the near term. “After a gap of three years, FPIs have been a net seller in equities amounting to $1.18 billion in the April-July 2021 period as against a massive net purchase amount of $4.81 billion which was a key driver of the markets in the same period of the previous year,” FII sales can be attributed largely to increased concerns on the taper down of bond purchases by the US Fed, which are expected to commence by the end of the calendar year and normalise the excess liquidity in the global asset markets, he said. Since closing above the 50k mark for the first time on February 3 crossing, the sensex took 139 days to finally close above the 56k mark. During this time, investors’ wealth also rose by nearly Rs 48 lakh crore to its all-time high level of almost Rs 246 lakh crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-closes-above-56k-on-eco-outlook-rupee-strength/articleshow/85699736.cms||---

There were 124 passengers on board apart from six crew members and one co-pilot. After the 49-year-old captain Nawshad Ataul Qaiyum suffered heart attack, 29-year-old co-pilot Mirajul Pais landed the plane safely at Nagpur. Qaiyum’s pilot licence is valid till February 2026, shows his ID card. Known as pilot incapacitation in technical terms, this was first such case handled by the Nagpur airport. This is also rare in general. A statement by Biman Bangladesh said the aircraft was overflying Raipur when Kolkata airport was contacted to report the situation. The plane was asked to land at Nagpur by the Kolkata ATC. Raipur also has an international airport. The Nagpur air traffic control (ATC) was contacted at around 11am, and the ground staff quickly swung into action to facilitate landing of the plane by the shortest possible route. “It took around 20 minutes for the aircraft to reach Nagpur and the pilot was rushed to hospital,” said Roshan Kamble, airport in-charge. The flight BG022 was taking A-791 route, which means it was not overflying Nagpur. The regular route was through Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Jabalpur, and then entering Bangladesh airspace from Guwahati. The plane had to turn southwest to reach Nagpur, said Kamble. “The ATC here took quick action and was given the shortest possible route so that the pilot could be reached to a hospital,” said Kamble. The passengers and crew were kept in the airport’s transit area under the care of Air India staff. “An 8-member rescue team from Dhaka reached Nagpur at 9.15pm to take the passengers. “We sent the crew to Nagpur in a flight that was going to Dubai from Dhaka,” Tahera Khandaker, spokesperson of Biman Bangladesh, told TOI. The plane carrying passengers finally took off for Dhaka at 10.30pm. “Nagpur airport gave a quick response and the pilot was taken to hospital at the earliest. He is fine now. The family has been informed,” she said. “We follow International Air Transport Association (IATA) rules and pilots undergo medical checks before every flight,” said Khandaker. The hospital doctors had not received health history of the pilot till filing of this report as contact with family members couldn’t be established, said sources in Kingsway Hospital where the pilot was taken. Dr Mohammad Etheshamoddin, doctor on-duty at the airport, said, “When the plane landed in Nagpur, the captain was lying unconscious in the cockpit. He was rushed to a hospital.” The captain reportedly has a well-built physique and not obese, say sources. As the pilot collapsed, he was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) till landing. He didn’t have pulse, BP, own breathing. He was in complete cardiac arrest, said Dr Shailendra Ganjewar, a senior cardiologist of Kingsway Hospital. He has been put on ventilator. A team led by intensivist Dr Virendra Bhelekar continued CPR as per advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) at the hospital for 30 minutes. “This helped regain his BP and pulse. However, when the patient is in cardiac arrest for such a long time, blood supply to brain gets affected. It causes hypoxic injury to the brain, resulting in coma. Cardiac-wise, his BP and pulse are ok,” said Dr Ganjewar. “Next 24 hours are critical for the captain,” he said. “We have done emergency angiography. He has borderline blockages. Now, it depends on how he comes out of the brain injury. Our entire team is working on him. We want to send him home in good condition,” said Dr Ganjewar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pilot-suffers-heart-attack-mid-air-bdesh-plane-lands-in-nagpur/articleshow/85700961.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Vijayawada||Rayalaseema ryots want KRMB office in AP's Kurnool||AMARAVATI: Even as the suspense over the relocation of Krishna River Management Board office to Visakhapatnam from Hyderabad continues, several farmers’ organisations in Rayalaseema region have launched an agitation demanding the government to set up the KRMB office in Kurnool near the Srisailam project. The farmers’ bodies say the decision is a betrayal of the region. Interestingly, the Telangana government is also opposing the relocation and wants it to be set up in the river basin area. The KRMB is likely to discuss the issue at its next board meeting to be held on September 1. It may be recalled that at the apex council meeting of the KRMB held in December 2020, which was chaired by Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, it was agreed to shift the river board’s office to a place suggested by the AP government. The decision was taken as per the AP Reorganisation Act, which mandates shifting of KRMB to AP soil. Though the previous TDP government wanted it to be located in Vijayawada, it could not succeed to get the office relocated from Hyderabad till May 2019, when it demitted office after its drubbing in the assembly elections. Subsequently, the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government wanted the KRMB office to be located in Visakhapatnam. The port city, however, is neither located in the Krishna basin area nor is close to the irrigation projects on Krishna, including Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar. A senior official said Visakhapatnam was proposed in view of the state government’s decision to relocate the administration to the executive capital. Interestingly, the AP government has expressed its inability to provide accommodation in one of the government buildings to house the KRMB in Vizag. Since it would be a huge financial burden to hire private accommodation, senior officials of KRMB have looked at a few Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) buildings and have decided to hire either the premises of Dredging Corporation of India’s or the BSNL. KRMB estimates it would require at least Rs 1 crore for rental, maintenance and other costs to manage its office in Vizag, the costs of which have to be borne by AP, Telangana and the Centre. Presently, the river board’s office is housed at Jala Soudha, a Telangana government-owned building in Hyderabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/rayalaseema-ryots-want-krmb-office-in-kurnool/articleshow/85698351.cms||Samdani MN
---||Mumbai||School plan: Stagger hours, lunchtime||The state government’s Paediatric Covid Task Force has recommended staggering of school hours in two shifts, alternate days of physical and online classes, restricting the use of lifts and air-conditioning as the state government considers a wider reopening of schools. At the moment, only classes 8-12 are running in rural areas. Dr Pramod Jog, member of the task force, told TOI on Friday that the recommendations (see box) are a medical advice to reorganise schools. “They must introduce new procedures, particularly reduce the number of students at a given time and reset the classroom arrangements to maintain physical distancing at all times. All the staff members, including teachers, will have to be fully vaccinated before coming for work,” he said. Paediatrician Dr Vijay Yewale, another member of the task force, said: “Schools that have been shut for more than a year will have to be deep cleaned before reopening. Air-conditioners will have to be avoided. Like the 50% occupancy concept in restaurants, reducing the number of students attending school at a time has been recommended by staggering school shifts and days.” The task force has recommended that the authorities go easy on academics for a week or two and let students get used to the new circumstances. “Children have been through different experiences since last year, which could in some cases include losing a near one to Covid. It is better not to immediately bombard them with academics and give them time to adjust to the new environment,” said Yewale. Experts said the education department may consider these recommendations along with the standard operating protocol created, and both could be clubbed. “The task force has also suggested staggering the lunch break over a two-hour period instead of half an hour to allow fewer children to be sent for meals at a time. Encouraging children to walk to school if it is nearby, reducing seating in each school bus, avoiding AC vehicles, creating a school health clinic are also part of the recommendations,” Jog added. The task force recommended regular PTA meetings online to explain to parents not send a child to school if unwell or if there is a Covid patient in the house.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/school-plan-stagger-hours-lunchtime/articleshow/85702834.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Business||Kotak MF can’t offer fresh FMPs for 6 months: Sebi||MUMBAI: A default by some of the Essel Group companies is still affecting mutual funds more than two years later. Markets regulator Sebi on Friday penalised Kotak Mutual Fund for its delay in making full payment to some of its investors in mid-2019. The delay happened because two Essel Group companies — Edisons Utility Works and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures — had defaulted on non-convertible debentures (NCDs) held by six fixed maturity plans (FMPs) of Kotak MF. Sebi barred Kotak MF from launching new FMPs for six months and asked it to pay a fine of Rs 50 lakh. Further, it ordered the fund house to partially refund fees relating to fund management and advisory to investors in those six FMPs. In these FMPs, the full amount was not refunded to its investors after two of the Essel Group companies failed to refund money to these Kotak MF’s schemes during 2019. A spokesperson for the fund house, reacting to the Sebi order, said that all the investors were fully repaid along with applicable interest in September 2019. Kotak MF “is committed to protecting investor interest at all times”, the spokesperson added. The case relates to the fund house’s holding of zero-coupon NCDs of the two Essel Group companies in six FMPs on which the companies defaulted in April-May 2019. Although the NCDs were backed by shares of Zee Entertainment as collateral with the fund house, the share price had then fallen drastically. Hence, the fund house didn’t sell those shares to partially recover its loan to the two companies, sources in the MF had then told TOI. Since five other fund houses were also in a similar position, holding Zee Ent shares as collateral, any forced selling by Kotak MF would have prompted other fund houses to also sell the stock, leading to a crash in its price, the source had said then. At that time, HDFC MF, Aditya Birla MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Templeton MF and UTIMF were also hit by defaults by Essel Group companies. In its 84-page order, Sebi said that there were lapses on the part of Kotak MF in carrying out due diligence and in risk assessment while taking investment decisions relating to these NCDs. Sebi also said that the fund house had failed to disclose information about negative impact on the six FMPs to its investors on time. “Utter neglect of due diligence, inordinate delay in communicating with the investors, violation of the statutory sanctity of the maturity dates of the FMP schemes, permitting extension of the maturity of the NCDs of the issuers in contravention of extant regulations, etc...there remains no doubt in mind that the (fund house) has acted in gross violation of provisions of the Sebi … as well as various circulars issued by Sebi from time to time,” the order said. On its part, Kotak MF had relied on a Sebi circular relating to MFs issued on June 20, 2002 that had said that fund houses would make all effort to recover the full value of its investments that is illiquid till two years after closure of a scheme. Following the Sebi regulations, the fund house had made all efforts to recover full value of NCDs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/wealth/mutual-funds/kotak-mf-cant-offer-fresh-fmps-for-6-months-sebi/articleshow/85707527.cms||---

Police investigations revealed that two sharpshooters, who opened fire at the car in which a noted surgeon of Sitamarhi town, Dr Shiv Shanker Mahto, was travelling late on Tuesday night, mistook an auxiliary midwife as Dr Shabnam and shot her dead. The deceased, Babli Pandey, and Dr Shabnam were wearing masks at the time of the incident. The deceased, stated to be a resident of Sutihara village in Sitamarhi district, was employed as auxiliary midwife at the private nursing home of Dr Mahto on Sitamarhi-Dumra road under Mehsaul police outpost. Dr Mahto, who suffered bullet injuries in the firing, is recuperating at another private nursing home at the district headquarters. Sitamarhi superintendent of police Harkishore Rai said the main target of the contract killers was not Dr Mahto, but Dr Shabnam, who was travelling in the car with him on the fateful night. Though pictures of Dr Shabnam were provided to the assailants, they mistook the nurse as Dr Shabnam and shot her dead as soon as she got down from the car. The SP said a ‘supari’ (contract) of Rs 6 lakh was given to a professional gang to eliminate Dr Shabnam, a private practitioner living as second wife of Dr Mahto for over two years. The contract was given by none other than his first wife Seema Sinha, who was unhappy with Dr Mahto for having an illicit relationship with another woman. Sitamarhi sadar sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Ramakant Upadhyay said Rs 1 lakh was paid as advance to the contract killers to accomplish the task. Dr Mahto’s two nephews — Santosh and Sandeep — helped her. One Tipu alias Mumshad, a resident of Rajopatti, was asked to contact the ‘supari killers’, who offered them Rs 6 lakh for the work. The SDPO said four people — Seema Sinha (Dr Mahto’s first wife), their two nephews Sandeep and Santosh and Tipu — have been arrested and a motorcycle used in the crime, four cellphones, three live cartridges and five empty cartridges were seized. “The identity of the shooters has already been ascertained and raids are on to arrest them,” he added. During investigation, it came to light that Dr Mahto had a dispute with his first wife and he had also stopped giving money to her for survival. Two cases were lodged by his first wife in 2016. Dr Mahto has a kid from his second wife, who was living with him for over three years. The doctor couple was likely to open a new nursing home in the town, which may have enraged his first wife, who plotted the conspiracy to eliminate Dr Shabnam. Dr Mahto has two children with his first wife. An investigating officer said that Santosh was recently removed from the private nursing home of Dr Mahto and Sandeep was likely to be removed. The SP said the police cracked the case within 48 hours of the incident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/mask-saved-life-of-woman-doctor-in-sitamarhi-police/articleshow/85698432.cms||Ramashankar

The police said on Friday that they are investigating the terror funding angle after Sheikh’s links with J&K surfaced in the recent investigations. “Sheikh diverted some of the hawala funds he received to J&K in the last few years. He was in touch with many people in J&K and hence we are investigating if the money he diverted was used for terror activities or creating unrest in J&K,” a senior police official said. Once Sheikh is brought to the city along with the other accused Umar Gautam, the special investigations team (SIT) will question him in detail about the alleged terror funding. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh said, “In the last five years, Sheikh received Rs 60 crore through hawala apart from Rs 19 crore by foreign donations. We are conducting a detailed investigation of how the money was used and who all received the cash that Sheikh diverted.” Initial investigations have revealed that apart from funding conversion activities Sheikh also got 103 mosques built in five states. “Forty-five mosques were built in Maharashtra, 30 in Rajasthan, 17 in Madhya Pradesh, eight in Gujarat and three in Assam,” Singh added. Sources said that Sheikh received hawala funds through Dubai and he came in touch with Umar Gautam through a key contact in Dubai. Sheikh has also received foreign donations from UK, USA and UAE. A police official said that Sheikh also runs a school in Chhota Udepur that he used as a front to launder money. The UP ATS had arrested Umar Gautam and Qazi Jahangir in June this year on the charges of mass conversions of people through inducements like marriage or jobs. Umar was alleged to have converted over 1,000 persons in UP. He is suspected to be involved in mass conversions of deaf and mute students, women and children. Sheikh’s name surfaced during their interrogation and the cops learnt that his bank accounts were used for hawala transactions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/hawala-money-used-for-terror-funding-in-jk-cops/articleshow/85698937.cms||Tushar Tere

The central bank has also decided to allow distribution of coins through business correspondents and cash-in-transit companies. From September 1, banks will be given an incentive of Rs 75 per coin bag for distribution of coins in rural and semi urban areas and Rs 65 per bag for other centres. Earlier, the compensation offered was Rs 25 per bag. The RBI has also asked banks to offer business customers delivery of coins as part of doorstep banking services. “To ensure steady supply of coins to bulk customers and BCs for onward distribution, all banks may ensure that each of their branches maintains a minimum stock of one bag of coins in each denomination,” the RBI said. This is the second major step the RBI has taken recently towards distribution of currency and coins. Earlier, it had said that it will penalise banks Rs 10,000 if their ATMs run dry for over 10 hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbis-major-coin-push-in-rural-tier-2-areas/articleshow/85699461.cms||---

While launching the online portal on Friday, education minister, Vijay Kumar Choudhary, said, “Now, the students of the state will not face any problem. Earlier, many of them remained deprived of the scholarship funds due to their failure to upload documents to the National Scholarship Portal.” The minister also released scholarships worth Rs 171 crore for more than 3.22 lakh students belonging to the OBC, EBC, SC and ST categories. The amount will be credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries within a fortnight. Choudhary later told this reporter, “The scholarships sanctioned by the BC and EBC welfare department and the SC and ST welfare department will be routed through the education department. Hence, a student will no longer move from one department to another.” He added, “A few states ask students to make some payment for getting themselves registered on the scholarship portal, but no money will be charged from them in Bihar. The system is so student-friendly that the Bihar model may soon be adopted even at the national level.” The minister also pointed that the scholarship amount would be directly transferred to the students’ bank accounts within a month of the last date of submitting their applications on the portal. Deputy chief minister, Renu Devi, and SC and ST welfare minister, Santosh Suman Manjhi, were also present on the occasion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/govt-launches-new-scholarship-portal/articleshow/85698310.cms||B K Mishra
---||Vijayawada||Extend benefits of RoDTEP to sector, tobacco body urges govt||GUNTUR: The Indian Tobacco Association (ITA) has appealed to the Union government to include tobacco under the Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) scheme and encourage exports through aggressive promotion schemes. ITA, the nodal agency to represent the tobacco industry, noted that tobacco exports should have helped the centre achieve the target of exports through right policy making. Stating that export is a pre-requisite for the growth of any country, ITA said the country is heavily losing due to the non-inclusion of tobacco in the exports promotion scheme. In fact, India is well positioned to become a major player in the global tobacco market if it can harness the emerging opportunities through price competitiveness. Speaking to the media, ITA president Maddi Venkateswara Rao said that steep increase in cost of cultivation, transportation and logistics has adversely impacted the price competitiveness of Indian tobacco. “We have got the advantage of a wide range of soils and climatic conditions to produce different styles of tobaccos which can cater to the needs of different overseas markets. Sadly, India is unable to score over its competitors due to the price disadvantage,” said Venkateswara Rao. He cited the example of countries such as Brazil, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Thailand, where the economy is heavily dependent on tobacco. Rao said the industry was happy with the commerce ministry setting a target of a 30% growth in Indian tobacco exports. He said they have requested the Union commerce minister and the secretary to take proactive measures to help the industry. “Surprisingly, tobacco is not included in RoDTEP benefits, despite several appeals,” said Rao. He added the tobacco sector’s exports mainly include value-added products, such as flue-cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco and tobacco products, which bring in the country $900 million in foreign exchange each year. “As there is no level playing field in the international market, India’s exports of unprocessed tobacco have fallen sharply,” said Rao.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/extend-benefits-of-rodtep-to-sector-tobacco-body-urges-govt/articleshow/85696304.cms||Samdani MN

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the BJP’s ‘Jansahyog’ programme at the party office, he said sand mining remains suspended for three months during monsoon and it will resume on October 1. “Illegal sand mining has been stopped after stern action taken against several police and other officials,” he added. It may be mentioned that two IPS officers among many other officials had been suspended recently for their alleged nexus with sand smugglers engaged in its mining and transportation from Sone river in six districts. Janak, however, claimed that there was no dearth of sand in the state for construction work. The stock of sand was being sold at the rates fixed by the government, he claimed. Responding to a query, he said sand was being supplied to the agencies engaged in construction work allotted by the government. “Sarkari kaam mein koi dikkat nahi ho rahi hai,” he said.

Schools have reopened in the state but the threat of the third wave affecting unvaccinated children looms large. National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), under the Ministry of Home Affairs, stated in its report released earlier this week that a third wave of Covid-19 pandemic may reach its peak around October and children could be affected as severely as adults. In its report, the NIDM has spoken about the critical need for paediatric facilities, including doctors, staff and equipment like ventilators and ambulances if a large number of children got infected by the virus. It further said the available infrastructure was “nowhere close” to the requirements if the need arose. Schools in the city, which have resumed offline classes after nearly five months, claimed that they are taking all possible measures to prevent the spread of the virus and ensure safety of children. Mary Alphonse, principal of Don Bosco Academy, said: “We are rigorously following the social distancing and other Covid safety norms. Students are instructed by the teachers at the time of dispersal to avoid any rush. But, if unfortunately, our state gets affected by the third wave of Covid, we will go back to online mode to conduct classes.” Shailendra Mohan, vice-principal of Gyan Niketan Girls School, Ashiana Digha Road, said, “We are strictly following Covid safety protocol. Students are being sanitized and screened by the thermal scanner. They are also requested not to share lunch with anyone. After the dispersal, we sanitise the entire school.” He added: “We are offering both online and offline classes and will take further action as per government orders.” Parents also remain cautious about safety of their wards while sending them to schools. “My daughter started going to school from August 16, but the fear of Covid is still very much there. Every passing day, we hear about the possibility of third wave. I want my kids to be get vaccinated as soon as possible,” said Namita Das of Kankarbagh area. Children are also concerned about the possibility of third wave of the pandemic. “I am very happy to attend offline classes and enjoy campus life as we did two years ago. However, the news of third wave of the pandemic has made me apprehensive that we may again have to return to online mode,” said Lily Singh, a student of standard-1 at DAV Public School, BSEB Colony.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/schools-parents-apprehend-third-wave-of-covid/articleshow/85697985.cms||---
---||Patna||Flood alert sounded in Gopalganj, West Champaran as Gandak in spate||PATNA/BAGAHA: Incessant rain over the last three days in Nepal and the state has resulted in sudden rise in water level of the Gandak and caused flood-like situation in West Champaran and Gopalganj districts. The DMs of the two districts have sounded an alert in the blocks vulnerable to floods. The villagers have been asked to move to safer places. Water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said a flood-like situation was prevailing in the basins of several rivers. He added the rain would continue to lash the parts of the state for a month. While the water discharge through the Valmiki Nagar barrage across the Gandak was 1.97 lakh cusecs on Thursday afternoon, it increased to 4.04 lakh cusecs in the morning on Friday. The water discharge remained steady till around 10am and then fell to 3.72 lakh cusecs, followed by 3.47 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. Gandak barrage assistant engineer Kripanath Pathak said all the 36 gates of the barrage were opened in the morning to facilitate continued discharge of water. The Jhandutola border outpost camp of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) had two to three-feet deep water on its campus. The floodwaters have also entered lower parts of Bagaha town, besides entering Chakadahawa, Bintoli and Jhanduatola villages of Lakshmipur Rampurwa panchayat under the Valmiki Nagar police station. West Champaran DM Kundan Kumar sounded an alert in all 18 blocks of the district following heavy rain and fresh release of water from the Valmiki Nagar barrage. The rise in the water level of Gandak Bhapsa, Masan, Pandai and Shikarahana rivers has added to the concerns about the floods. The villagers have been asked to shift from the lower parts to safer areas in the blocks concerned. Gopalganj DM also sounded an alert in the vulnerable blocks of the district. He assessed the situation of the embankments in Mangalpur and Bishunpur areas under the sadar block. Meanwhile, Central Water Commission said the water level of the Gandak at Dumariaghat in Gopalganj district was 60cm above the danger level in the morning, and is expected to increase further by 23cm by Saturday morning or around 1 metre above the danger level. The Bagmati, Kamla and Punpun were flowing above the danger level at most places along their downstream with the water level showing rising trend. On Thursday night, the water level of the Bagmati river had crossed the danger level all along its downstream in the range of 1.35 metres to 2.17 metres. However, on Friday, the level had fallen, but was showing the rising trend again on Friday. Although the water discharge through Birpur barrage across Kosi river has not increased substantially, the three-day rainfall has led to swelling of several tributaries of the Kosi, posing flood threat to Purnia, Katihar, Saharsa, Supaul and Madhepura districts. The water level of Mahananda had also not risen dramatically on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/flood-alert-sounded-in-gopalganj-west-champaran-as-gandak-in-spate/articleshow/85698562.cms||Abhay Singh

He was speaking at a review meeting on development works taken up under the MLAs local area development (LAD) funds, at the Circuit House here on Friday. “Legislature sessions are being convened after six months. We have plans to convene the sessions successfully for 10 days. Hence, all ministers and MLAs should be present during the sessions compulsorily. Everyone should take part in the sessions, without requesting for holidays. I have communicated this message to all members officially. Officials too should be present during the sessions compulsorily,” Kageri said. However, he said, those who have health issues, or in any other unavoidable circumstances, may request holidays. “Abstaining from legislature sessions to participate in programmes in your constituencies is not a good decision. I have witnessed several instances of lack of quorum in the house. Maintaining the quorum by attending sessions will help in adding value to democracy,” Kageri said. “On bills to be presented during the sessions, the speaker said the same should be brought to the notice of his office in advance. Members should maintain the dignity of the floor, by not violating the discipline,” he suggested. On expenditure of LAD funds, Kageri said, “While MLAs complain about delay in the release of Rs 2 crore as LAD funds, we have also noticed delay in the implementation of works through the sanctions due to administrative reasons. In Karnataka, nearly Rs 1,000 crore of the LAD funds remain unutilised due to such reasons. Meanwhile, nearly Rs 20-Rs 30 crore remain unutilised in Dakshina Kannada too. Hence, I have directed all assistant commissioners to submit reports on such unutilised funds, specifying the reasons and suggestions to find solutions. Reports are expected next week,” he said, adding that appropriate decisions will be taken based on the reports. ‘Mysuru gang-rape shameful’ “The Mysuru gang-rape has made us bow our heads in shame. None of us expected such a heinous crime. I believe that the government has considered the issue very seriously, and is acting accordingly. I am confident that the government will take stern action against the accused,” the speaker said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/do-not-skip-legislature-sessions-kageri-tells-ministers-mlas/articleshow/85696331.cms||---

The counsel representing MoEF informed the tribunal that the AP government has filed an application for grant of environmental clearance which is still pending with them. The ministry sought a week’s time to file its stand on alleged violations at RLIS site. Sravan Kumar, the advocate representing the petitioner, and social activist Gavinolla Srinivas submitted that the violations have been confirmed by the Krishna River Management Board’s report and the NGT may proceed with the contempt action against the state government. However, AP read out its affidavit and maintained it did not carry out any works pertaining to the main component of RLIS and whatever has been done pertains to preparation of the detailed project report. The bench comprising justice K Ramakrishnan and expert member K Satya Gopal said they would consider MoEF’s stance on the alleged violations before passing their order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ngt-awaits-moefs-report-on-rlis-site/articleshow/85697585.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid cases rise, death count low in Kolkata||KOLKATA: A sudden spurt in the number of fresh Covid cases in Kolkata since Thursday — when the city recorded 118 new infections, crossing the three-figure mark for the first time since July 4’s 111 — has led to concern among medics and experts. Some predicted a slow and steady rise in fresh cases, which, they believe, may reach a peak by early-October, ushering in the third wave, most felt they could be mild infections and that fatalities were likely to be far lower than the first two waves. Others, however, felt it was too early to be complacent. While Kolkata recorded 112 fresh cases on Friday, the number has spiralled slowly from 60 to 89 between August 1 and 25. Daily deaths, however, have been hovering between zero and 4 in Kolkata during the period. “Since more than 40% of the city population has been vaccinated, there is now a strong immune wall to fight Covid. Infections will not only be mild, they will spread far slower, unlike the second wave that saw a very quick transmission and more virulent attacks since few had got the vaccine and hence had poor resistance,” said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. Others, like Apollo Gleneagles Hospital oncologist Subir Ganguly, however, said that many, including doctors, have been severely infected despite being double-vaccinated. “I would expect fresh cases to rise slowly now and explode during the pujas when a lot of crowding is likely to happen. The sudden spurt in Kolkata cases is directly linked to the Puja-shopping crowd that has swelled over the last few weeks. Most are flouting Covid protocol. Most importantly, people are venturing into crowds, which is responsible for transmission. We have let our guard down and I am not ruling out a severe wave yet,” said Ganguly. But Sarkar said since around 65% of Kolkata’s population has developed sero-positivity, casualties will be low despite high numbers. “We must look at casualties now rather than the number of infected. Deaths will be far fewer than the second wave. But we must stick to safety norms. A vast majority of our population has got one vaccine which doesn’t provide enough protection against the Delta variant,” he said. This month, the number of active cases in Kolkata, too, has spiralled steadily from 734 on August 1 to 919 on August 20. It rose to 973 on August 25, crossing the thousand-mark on Thursday when the city had 1,013 active cases. On Friday, it was 1,035. “We need not worry about the rising cases now, but must ensure that we vaccinate as fast as possible so that almost the entire population receives at least one shot,” said Sarkar. He added that even double vaccination may not be effective against all strains. “But it’s certainly better than a single shot so we need to step up the vaccination pace,” he said. Even if a substantial part of the Kolkata population is now vaccinated, a large enough section remained vulnerable, said cardiac surgeon and senior vice-president of Medica Superspecialty Hospital Kunal Sarkar. “Due to our large population base, there is still a big enough section which could be affected. Numbers will rise, but since we have a high enough sero-positive population now, infections should be mild. We need to identify the pockets and areas where transmission is happening and take steps,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cov-cases-rise-death-count-low-in-city/articleshow/85698303.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Mumbai||Don’t link restarting classes to kids being vaccinated: Experts||MUMBAI: The first coronavirus vaccine for adolescents is almost here, but experts say vaccination of children is not a prerequisite for reopening schools, or for kids to attend classes. Several public health experts echoed that the focus must be on vaccinating teachers and staffers at the earliest to restart schools that have remained shut for nearly 18 months.  Zydus Cadila’s vaccine, ZyCov-D, has got an emergency use approval from the Indian drug regulator this week. While a policy on vaccination of children is in the works, the Centre on Thursday indicated that it could start from October. There are also reports that children with pre-existing health conditions may be given priority and vaccination for healthy kids could start only next year.  “There is very little sense in thinking that schools should not be opened till kids are vaccinated,” said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, epidemiologist and health systems expert. Besides the issue of availability, the fact that ZyCov-D is based upon a completely new platform, DNA Plasmid, must be considered. “Since children between 12 to 17 have a really low risk of disease and far lower than adults, their vaccination needs to wait till a fairly large proportion of adults have been vaccinated,” he said. Lahariya is also signatory to an open letter to all chief ministers, where they have urged states to open schools, citing that fears of schools being super spreaders are unfounded.  According to immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, it is the teachers who need to be vaccinated first. “The thrust has to be about vaccination of adults, including teachers, supervisors and parents at home since they remain more vulnerable,” she said, adding that complete vaccination of children is also likely to take months and hence cannot be linked to reopening.  ZyCov-D is a three-dose vaccine that has to be taken at zero, 28 and 56 days. It means complete immunisation of a child would take at least ten weeks, Bal said. There are 44 crore children over two years old in the country, while in Maharashtra nearly 3.5crore to 4crore could fall in the below 18 category. An ethical debate also would be if the government wants to divert doses from more vulnerable adults to children without comorbidities. About 1% of children are estimated to have comorbidities.  Top epidemiologist Dr JP Mulyil said that it’s extremely rare for a healthy child without underlying comorbidities to die of this virus and the national policy ought to take that into consideration. “The aim of vaccination is to prevent severity and deaths, which is rare in kids. Healthy children also develop immunity to last a lifetime,” he said, adding the UK has taken a decision to not vaccinate kids under 12. A senior doctor from KEM Hospital concurred that young children have more active immune systems compared to adults, and may have stronger reactions, including fever, fatigue.  Paediatricians, meanwhile, are flooded with phone calls from anxious parents. Dr Vijay Yewale, a member of the state paediatric taskforce, said that vaccinating children was certainly an “added benefit”. “Over 95% children escape with minor infection because of less expression of receptors, which are required for the virus to cause damage. However, it’s a disease where nobody is safe till everybody is safe,” he said. There are also rare cases of multi-inflammatory syndrome in children. “But, looking at the low adult vaccination coverage, it would be practical to prioritise people who can get moderate and severe Covid,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dont-link-restarting-classes-to-kids-being-vaccinated-experts/articleshow/85702853.cms||Sumitra Debroy

According to the ministry, the toolkit will enable researchers and students to research quantum computing cost-effectively. The QSim project — executed collaboratively by IIT Roorkee, IISc Bangalore, and C-DAC — will help in developing and debugging quantum algorithms. Notably, quantum simulators are devices that allow individuals to study quantum effects, which are otherwise difficult to study in a lab. The authorities of IIT-Roorkee claimed that in areas such as cryptography, computational chemistry, and machine learning, quantum computing promises exponential growth in computing power. The premier institute added that QSim is a first-of-its-kind toolkit to be ‘indigenously’ developed and is intended to be a vital tool in learning and understanding the practical aspects of programming using quantum computers. “The quantum simulator launched today (August 27) is poised to be a key enabler in the direction of quantum education and research,” said Professor AK Chaturvedi, director of IIT-Roorkee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/indias-first-quantum-computer-simulator-toolkit-launched/articleshow/85696357.cms||Tapan Susheel

They were, however, later let off on station bail. The Annur police said the VAO, 32-year-old V Kalaiselvi, and her assistant 56-year-old P Muthusamy were booked under Sections 294(b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words in or near any public place), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) read with 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence) of the Indian Penal Code. On August 6, Muthusamy, who belongs to the Scheduled Caste, was made to prostrate before K Gopalsamy at Odderpalayam VAO office. After the video of the incident went viral on social media, district collector G S Sameeran had constituted a committee led by district revenue officer Leela Alex to probe the same. Based on the panel’s report, the VAO and her assistant had lodged two separate cases with the Annur police against Gopalsamy, After the second video, which showed Muthusamy assaulting Gopalsamy, emerged on social media, the VAO and her assistant were placed under suspension. Departmental action was also initiated against them. The Annur police are, meanwhile, trying to trace the whereabouts of the man who recorded the video and circulated the same on social media in two parts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/vao-assistant-arrested-let-off-on-bail/articleshow/85701021.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

HDIL was accused of not repaying loans of Rs 4,335 crore. The court said the fact that the accused was a woman could not be sole grounds to grant bail. It said Anita Kirdat was an expert in carrying out an audit and she was expected to submit a fair report showing the bank’s financial condition and point out siphoning of loan amount. “Relying on the audit report, the financial status of the bank is determined, but the applicant deliberately ignored the huge loan amount of HDIL group of companies. She did not point out that fictitious accounts were opened and teh report was submitted with fictitious accounts to RBI. Applicant being key person could have disclosed illegal activities in the bank in advancing the loan,” the court said. It said her conduct showed her active involvement in the crime. “Huge public money is involved. Nature of offence requires to be considered. Considering role of applicant in commission of crime, applicant is not entitled for bail,” the court said. Kirdat’s advocate said she was falsely implicated. It was argued that the probe was over and no direct evidence was found against her.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-auditors-bail-plea-rejected-in-pmc-bank-scam-case/articleshow/85701067.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘Moplah martyrs a part of India’s freedom struggle’||Kochi: Kerala History Congress (KHC) expressed concern over Indian Council for Historical Research’s (ICHR) decision to remove 387 Moplah martyrs from the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle. KHC said that people who were fed up by the colonial rule protested in diverse forms due to circumstantial pressure and Moplah martyrs are undoubtedly a part of India’s freedom struggle. KHC would protest strongly against ICHR’s action that trivializes historical facts. The freedom struggle history that omits those leaders who made impossible for the British to rule for six months will never be complete and authentic. “The approach of the followers of Hindutva teacher Golwalkar, who announced that Hindus should not waste their energy by taking part in the freedom struggle but use it to fight domestic enemies Christians and Muslims, towards the rebellion and its leadership would be like this,” said KHC in a statement. Sebastian Joseph, general secretary, KHC, said that the report of the ICHR committee was highly prejudiced and tantamount to creating falsified memories in the minds of people. “The present move aims at detextualization of critical historical findings which all started with demonumentalisation of history. It is an attempt at meddling with the collective memories of the people and targets the creation of collective memories based on communal lines. This would seriously affect secular, scientific history writing in the nation,” Joseph said. All those who have studied the Malabar rebellions had found that the strong protests led by the Moplah farmers of Malabar, who became active after being urged by Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Shaukat Ali and other national leaders, were part of the history of India’s freedom struggle. The faulty evaluation of a historical event based on certain abnormalities that happened when the brutal force of suppression by the British increased and leaders were put in jail is injustice. Removing the names of leaders like Variamkunnath Kunjahammad Haji, who tried to stop such abnormalities and maintain peace, from the list of freedom fighters would drain the essence of the struggle itself, said a statement from KHC. Abdul Razak, member of executive committee, KHC, said that if one sifts through the letter of Variamkunnath Haji (Oct 7, 1921 in The Hindu) it would be clear that rebels targeted Nambudiris ‘who is the cause of this uprising’ (in the words of Variamkunnath). “The rebel leader identifies Brahmin Janmis as their class enemy and their feudal oppression as the real cause of the event. Added to this, if one examines the class composition of the rebels who were arrested at Pookottur in 1921, it could be seen that 82% of them belonged to the class of sharecroppers. Hence religious ideology as propagated by the right wing was not a constitutive factor but only a contributive factor of the rebellion,” Razak said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/moplah-martyrs-a-part-of-indias-freedom-struggle/articleshow/85698475.cms||---

Sources said 20 such beds would be available at the Government Multispeciality Hospital in Sector 16. “We have the fabricated facility ready and will be able to use it when required if there is any upsurge soon,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, UT. To meet the demand of ICU in the city, after more than a decade, the eight-bedded ICU at GMSH-16 has been enhanced by an additional 14 beds. UT health department has requested ICU staff to train the ICU staff. As of now, there is an eight-bedded ICU in GMSH-16. This shall be enhanced by 14, taking the total to 22 beds. The civil hospital in Sector 45 has been upgraded with a 15-bedded paediatric ICU facility. GMCH-32 has also raised its ventilator support bed strength from 126 to 149. “The focus is on paediatric ICUs this time. However, as per the need, the same ventilators can be configured for adults also,” said a faculty in GMCH-32. While the city is gearing up for its next surge, as predicted by November, public health experts feel testing and vaccination must be the focus for prevention. “If most of us are vaccinated, there will be a remote possibility of severe infection, leading to hospitalisation,” said a public health expert. It is also planned that by then, dispensaries shall be linked electronically with civil hospitals for doctors to consult amongst themselves to stop unnecessary referrals. “This will be completed by November. Also, by December, we plan to complete the second doses,” said an official in the UT health department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/health-dept-approves-fabricated-beds-for-third-covid-wave/articleshow/85698423.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The trial in the case is likely to begin next month. The case came to light on February 24, 2019 with a 19-year-old college girl lodging a complaint against 26-year-old K Thirunavukkarasu, of Makkinampatti, 25-year-old N Sabarirajan alias Riswanth, of Jothi Nagar, 29-year-old N Sathish, of Suleeswaranpatti, and T Vasanthakumar, of Pakkothipalayam, for sexually harassing her. The next day, the Pollachi town police arrested three of them, while Thirunavukkarasu went into hiding. He was, however, nabbed on March 5, 2019. All the four were booked under Sections 354 (A) (punishment for sexual harassment) and 354 (B) of the Indian Penal Code, Section 66 (E) of the IT Act and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act. The case was then transferred to the Crime-Branch CID police, who tried to nab R Manivannan, 30, of Aachipatti. However, he surrendered before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court on March 25, 2019. Manivannan, who was later taken into police custody, confessed that he had raped a few women along with the arrested four and they had taken videos of the act. The Crime Branch-CID police altered it to a rape case on April 5, 2019. Meanwhile, the case was transferred to the CBI, which filed a chargesheet against the five before the CJM court on May 24, 2019. The chargesheet contained more than 1,000 pages. In 2020, the CBI arrested Arulanantham, Heron Paul and Babu in the case. Two weeks ago, Arunkumar, of Kittasurampalayam village, was also nabbed in connection with the case. Their names have been included in the supplementary chargesheet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/pollachi-rape-case-cbi-files-supplementary-chargesheet/articleshow/85701043.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Abducted IT man made to pay over Rs 72,000 for release||JAIPUR: Unidentified accused abducted a 28-year-old IT manager and extorted Rs 72,500 from him before claiming that they had kidnapped the wrong person. The incident unfolded late night Thursday when the manager was supervising the fibre cable work near Haldi Ghati Marg. Four accused arrived at the spot, snatched his mobile phone and bundled him into their car. According to the FIR, one of the accused told the abductee that they were looking for a boy who was allegedly troubling a friend’s girlfriend. They claimed that they had mistakenly abducted him and let him go, before forcing him to transfer Rs 72,500 through a mobile application. The accused then dropped the IT manager near Shivdaspur and fled. He then went to the police station and filed an FIR. Pratap Nagar police station SHO Balbir Singh told TOI that the police suspect the involvement of a gang that abducts people on false pretext. “There was a similar case reported from a different police station a few days ago. We are searching for the accused based on the description provided by the victim,” Singh said. Police said that the gang had released the victim near the Shivdaspura area of the city shortly after 1.30am. The victim then sought the help of a motorist passing by the area. A police party arrived at the spot near Haldi Ghati, and searched the victim’s car and discovered that some items, including cash were missing. “It appears to be the handiwork of some organised gang that claims to abduct people and release them later after extorting money through UPI transaction,” an official told TOI. Till late Friday evening, the police could not find any clue about the identity of the accused. They added that efforts were being made to track down people involved in the abduction case. “An FIR has been registered under sections of kidnapping (Section 365) and extortion (Section 384) of the IPC,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/abducted-it-man-made-to-pay-over-rs-72k-for-release/articleshow/85701074.cms||---

The college which started in 2015 is promoting agricultural education and is seeking to permit admission of first year programme during the current academic year. So far the college has seen three batches of students who completed the course. The college submitted to the court that they were not given an opportunity to be heard before the affiliation to the institution was withdrawn. It is the first agricultural institution in Goa to provide a professional four year degree programme in BSc (Hons) agriculture. It sought continuation of the affiliation of the agricultural programme which was granted by GU on March 12, 2021. GU had mentioned that due to ongoing pandemic it has been decided to grant continuation of affiliation to all programmes. “Consequently your college has been granted continuation of affiliation for BSc agricultural programme for the academic year 2021-22 . Please note that your college shall apply for continuation of affiliation for the academic year 2022-23 as and when applications are invited for seeking affiliation for the academic year 2022-23.” However, based on a letter of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), GU on July 31, 2021 withdrew affiliation without giving an opportunity to the institute to be heard. ICAR issued a letter March 2, 2021 to the vice chancellor of GU stating that the national agricultural education board of ICAR in its 27th meeting of the national agricultural education accreditation board held on Feb 24, 2021 did not consider BSc (Hons) agriculture programme of Don Bosco college of agriculture for accreditation. Counsel representing the college Adv Carlos Alvares Ferreira on Wednesday told the court that ICAR is a society and a non-statutory body and its accreditation is voluntary. The petitioner submitted that ICAR doesn’t give approval for permission to open or start or close colleges and offer programmes in agricultural science in any particular state. In 2019, if the first batch of students who passed out, 13 got placed in private firms, 17 passed junior research fellowship (JRF) and ICAR examinations out of which one got admission to Punjab agricultural university, Ludhiana for post graduation course; one at Lovely professional university and two students secured admissions for post graduation in different agricultural universities in Maharashtra through common entrance test (CET) conducted by the Maharashtra Council of Agriculture Education and Research (MCAER), Pune; three students established their own business in nursery, vegetable cultivation and mushroom production.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/agricuture-college-takes-legal-route-over-bsc-course/articleshow/85698502.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Waste management: Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation focus on secretariats||VISAKHAPATNAM: In a paradigm shift in its sanitation strategy, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) will soon switch to secretariat-level cleanliness planning from the existing ward-level planning. For this, the GVMC will be getting 678 new garbage collection/transfer vehicles under the CLAP (Clean Andhra Pradesh) programme. At least one vehicle would be deployed in each of the 572 ward secretariats of the city, while the remaining would be buffer vehicles. Due to its inadequate vehicle inventory, the GVMC is currently hiring about 500 vehicles for the solid waste management. The new vehicles could save the civic body’s exchequer crores of rupees every year. Meanwhile, the GVMC is planning to distribute 7.5 lakh garbage bins to about 2.5 lakh below the poverty line (BPL) families to improve waste segregation at source which would enhance the processing abilities of the civic body. The GVMC has already supplied about 1 lakh bins to the BPL families in the city. The new waste collection/transfer vehicles would come with three different compartments to accommodate wet, dry and hazardous waste. The city is currently generating about 1,000 metric tonnes of garbage a day. The construction works on the 15 MW (megawatt) waste-to-energy plant in the GVMC’s dumping yard in Kapuluppada are nearing completion. Once the plant becomes operational, it would help reduce municipal waste landfilling and increase recycling levels. GVMC commissioner G Srijana says the civic body currently has only one-third of the vehicles it needed for the solid waste management. “The new vehicles will arrive in the next two to three weeks. The GVMC can adopt a more structured approach in sanitation management once they arrive. The sanitation workforce deployment, waste collection planning, and vehicle allotment would be made secretariat-centric, which is expected to improve the service delivery,” said Srijana.

While he was working as a graphic designer in Bengaluru, he had a savings account at the Malleshwaram branch of the SBI. He used to keep fixed deposits in the same branch. His case relates to online transfer of money from an offline fixed deposit, to an unrelated savings bank account. Giving details of the order, Ravindranath Shanbhag, president, Human Rights Protection Foundation, said that Harish resigned his Bengaluru job in February 2019, and returned to his hometown. He transferred his saving bank and fixed deposits accounts to the Santhekatte branch of SBI. On August 23, 2019, Harish received a transaction message on his mobile phone, that he did not understand. When he checked the transactions, he was shocked to find three bank transactions within a few minutes. The first transaction was related to transfer of Rs 5 lakh from Harish’s fixed deposit accounts to his savings bank account. In the second transaction, Rs 50,010 was transferred from another fixed deposit account of Harish, to his savings bank account. The third transaction effected a transfer of all the money to the tune of Rs 5,50,010, to a savings bank account of an unknown person in the Delhi branch of SBI. He immediately transferred Rs 6,360 left in his account to a private bank account. Immediately, Harish rushed to the SBI branch of Santhekatte and explained the incident to the manager. He was assured the money was safe, and a complaint was filed with cyber police. . He was promised that his money would be remitted within 48 hours. His repeated queries and a complaint to a senior official did not produce any results. After five months of the incident, Harish approached UDCDRC with the help of HRPF, Udupi. After 16 months of deliberations, the commission has pronounced the judgment, and has ordered SBI to pay the disputed amount Rs.5,50,010/- along with 10% interest to Harish Gudigar.

From September 2021, the previous fee will be collected from all employees and a decision on refund of additional fee collected so far will be taken soon. A notice in this regard has been issued by the PU Registrar on Thursday. The PU administration issued a circular increasing the license fee by three times from April 1, without the approval of the Senate-Syndicate. The administration argued that the license fee had been implemented according to the revised rate by the Chandigarh administration. The Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) wrote a letter to the PU administration alleging that the license fee was wrongly collected. Later, PUTA asked the UT administration for details of the license fee under RTI, in which it was found that the PU administration had fixed the revised license fee for government houses by the Delhi government instead of UT (Chandigarh). Extra amount running into lakhs was collected from PU employees from April to August, 2021. In the wake of protests by employees and professors, PU administration conceded to the mistake and issued a letter to revert to the old license fee on Thursday. About 3,000 PU government employees and professors have been allotted different categories of houses and rooms. The license fee of E-type houses was increased from Rs 350 to Rs 1,200. The fee for F type houses was increased from Rs 500 to Rs 2,100 and that of G type houses from Rs 700 to Rs 3,920 per month. PU administration earned lakhs in license fees within a few months and now the the PU administration will return the extra amount to employees. PUTA president Dr Mritunjay said, “We are glad that this decision has been taken by the PU administration. It was our fight and we won it. PUTA made a lot of efforts regarding this matter due to which the PU administration rectified it considering it a mistake.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pu-rectifies-mistake-rolls-back-increased-licence-fee/articleshow/85698492.cms||---
---||World||India-Australia early FTA set to cover half of goods trade||NEW DELHI: As part of a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), India and Australia are looking to conclude an early harvest scheme — covering tariff cuts on items that account for nearly half the trade as well as easier rules for service sectors — by December, over a decade after talks first started. If the negotiations go as per plan, this will be the first among a set of trade deals that India is looking to clinch, with talks with the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and the UAE being pursued. While negotiations on many of them had started almost a decade ago, they are being pushed more aggressively after India exited a dialogue to be part of RCEP, the trade grouping with China, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand the Asean countries. There are, however, gaps that need to be narrowed down with Australia. For instance, when it comes to trade facilitation, India is unwilling to go beyond what it has committed at the WTO. Plus, it has had concerns over allowing agriculture and processed food items. India is hoping that the agreement will open the doors for its professionals, such as those in the IT sector, to get better access in Australia. Both sides are, however, confident of narrowing the differences. The December target was agreed upon during a meeting between commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and his Australian counterpart Dan Tehan. During the meeting, sources said, Goyal set a mid-September deadline for finalising the overall scope of the early harvest scheme. “The ministers appreciated the progress made in three rounds of talks between the chief trade negotiators of both sides and discussed the way forward for an early conclusion of a bilateral CECA… the ministers directed officials to speed up the negotiations and to meet as often as required to achieve an early harvest announcement by December 2021 on an interim agreement to liberalise and deepen bilateral trade in goods and services, and pave the way for a comprehensive agreement,” a joint statement issued on Friday said. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, India along with Japan has also been working closely with Australia on a resilient supply chain initiative, which seeks to reduce dependence on China. In recent months, Australia, which had signed a trade agreement with China a few years ago, has seen massive trade tension with Beijing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/india-australia-early-fta-set-to-cover-half-of-goods-trade/articleshow/85704417.cms||---

They have been remanded to judicial custody. However, no compensation has yet been announced by the administration for the kin of the victims despite viscera samples of four deceased revealed that the death was caused due to “methyl alcohol” [poisonous substance]. Since the postmortem was not conducted in other bodies, only two viscera sample reports are awaited, police said. SP (East) K Venkat Ashok said that four accused — a liquor vend owner’s brother and manager of the shop, Ramprakash, his partner Jitendra and a couple Ramjilal and Indira Devi, who had bought liquor from the shop and then sold it in the villages — have been arrested. Three others are still at large. Four others were arrested under Tajganj police limits. SP (City) Vikas Kumar said that liquor vend owners Bachu Singh and Sanuj Bansal, salesman Kamlesh Singh and a local resident Kishni, have been remanded to judicial custody. Meanwhile, the victims’ kin have demanded compensation from the government. Ramveer’s nephew Yogesh told TOI that officials had visited their village where four persons had died due to consumption of spurious liquor, but no relief package has been announced for the families yet. “The administration failed to stop the sale of toxic liquor in the village despite being informed. Now, they are not giving any compensation,” he said. Another victim Ramsahai’s wife Manju Devi said he was the only earning member in the family and after his death she and her four minor children are finding it difficult to survive. “We don’t know what will happen as there is no source of income,” she said, adding that this toxic liquor has ended her family.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-hooch-tragedy-up-police-arrests-8-accused-during-raids-at-multiple-locations/articleshow/85696471.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

A total of 93,436 people were jabbed in the record breaking exercise, a part of the statewide mega drive. The figure not only surpassed the target of 83,000 inoculations set for the day, but was also the highest in UP. About 66% persons of those vaccinated in Lucknow were the first dose beneficiaries, while the remaining completed their course by taking the second dose. Around 49% of the recipients were in the 18-44 years age category, 37% in 45-59 years age group and 14% elderly. The exercise was carried out at 178 centres, including 30 private centres, across Lucknow. The 148 government-aided centres included 65 special camps organised in residential areas, schools, offices and places of worship. These special camps served as the driving force for Friday’s initiative. Though people from all walks of life took benefit of the initiative, the drive particularly targeted slum dwellers, vendors and people living in the interior areas. “The turnout was so huge that a few centres ran out of stock by 1pm,” a senior health officer told TOI. While chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Manoj Agrawal said that the enthusiasm seen among people on Friday indicated that hesitancy factor is now gradually ending, district immunization officer Dr M K Singh informed that no case of adverse side effects was reported till late evening. A TOI reality check in over three dozen centres found citizens standing in beelines outside camps since early morning, braving hot and sultry conditions. Overcrowding, lack of Covid safety protocols and chaos was also reported from some centres, while people were without masks at many places. Covid protocols were flouted at the vaccination centre in Aliganj Modern schoolObservation rooms to monitor post vaccination side effects were absent at several places. Authorities introduced a token system at a few places in accordance with the availability of doses to maintain discipline. About 1,250 were inoculated at Gurudwara Naka, which was highest among special camps. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash also visited several camps to take stock. Friday’s inoculations took the number of doses administered in Lucknow to over 26 lakh, highest in the state. With this, over 13 lakh people in the state capital have taken at least a shot and 6.8 lakh have been fully vaccinated with two doses. The district’s adult population is about 36 lakh. The mass vaccination campaign started on January 16. The lowest single-day vaccination was on June 30 when 4,500 people were inoculated. The most, 80,412 ,inoculations were done on August 16, a record beaten on Friday. (With inputs Pragati Shukla, Kritika Mathur and Ayushi Mishra)Active cases just 25:Active Covid-19 cases in the city dropped to 25 on Friday.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot undergoes angioplasty at SMS hospital; recovering well: Doctors||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot underwent an angioplasty at the government-run SMS Hospital on Friday after he had complained of chest pain. “There was 90% blockage in one of his coronary arteries and one stent was implanted successfully. He is absolutely fine,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal of the SMS Medical College. “The procedure was uneventful and post-procedure, he is recovering well. He is asymptomatic and cheerful,” said Bhandari, adding that the chief minister has been advised complete rest for two-three days. The 70-year-old third time chief minister had tested positive for coronavirus in April this year, and since then he has been grappling with post-Covid complications. Gehlot had cancelled his trip to Delhi Thursday night to have discussions with the party high command on cabinet reshuffle and political appointments over health reasons. Dr Bhandari said Gehlot had complained of heaviness in his chest and pain in the neck following which an ECG was done which was normal. “However, we advised him to get a CT coronary angiography done and the blockage was detected in one of the main arteries. Since there was 90% blockage, one stent was placed,” Dr Bhandari said. “The CM has been suffering from post-Covid syndrome and this cardiac complication seems to be a part of the post-Covid issues. His cardiac status was absolutely healthy before Covid with CT coronary angiography normal,” said Dr Bhandari in a medical bulletin. He said Gehlot expressed confidence and faith in the team and infrastructure at the hospital. He said Gehlot was registered as a common citizen in the newly launched Rajasthan Government Health Scheme (RGHS) to get his angioplasty done. Earlier in the day, Gehlot had tweeted that he would undergo an angioplasty. “Post Covid-19, I was having health issues and since yesterday (Thursday), I was having a severe pain in my chest. Just got my CT angiography done in SMS Hospital and the angioplasty will be done,” he had said. “I am happy that I am getting it done at SMS Hospital. I am fine and will be back soon. Your blessings and well wishes are with me,” he said. Angioplasty is a procedure to open clogged heart arteries. Gehlot was accompanied to the hospital by state health minister Raghu Sharma, chief whip Mahesh Joshi, MLA Rafiq Khan and officials from his office. Governor Kalraj Mishra spoke to Gehlot over the phone and wished him speedy recovery. Former deputy CM Sachin Pilot also called health minister Sharma and the chief minister's son, Vaibhav Gehlot, and enquired about his health. Pilot also wished Gehlot a speedy recovery. “Received the news of chief minister Ashok Gehlot Ji unwell. I pray to God for your speedy recovery and long life,” Pilot tweeted in Hindi. Former CM Vasundhara Raje also wished Gehlot a speedy recovery. “Got the news of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot being unwell. I pray to God for his speedy recovery,” she said in a tweet. BJP state president Satish Poonia, deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore and other leaders also wished speedy recovery to the chief minister.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gehlot-undergoes-angioplasty-at-sms-hosp-recovering-well-docs/articleshow/85701138.cms||---

The Bapu Tower, a G+6 building, would house different exhibits related to Gandhi, especially his visit to Champaran in 1917. While reviewing a presentation on ‘conceptual design for display of exhibits in Bapu Tower’, Nitish said, “The situation prevailing in Bihar during his Champaran visit had a special impact on Gandhi. Similarly, people of Bihar were deeply influenced by his ideology,” he said. He said the Champaran Satyagraha has special importance in the history of freedom movement. “All the events and places related to Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagraha should be displayed prominently in the upcoming tower,” Nitish told the building construction department (BCD) officials. Earlier, the architect made a detailed presentation before the CM on the content and design of the exhibits to be displayed in the tower. Hailing the design, Nitish recalled how his government organized a two-day national discussion at Patna on the occasion of 100 years of Gandhi’s arrival in Bihar on April 10, 1917. He said Gandhian thinkers, ideologues, workers and youths from across the country had gathered and a document on Gandhi’s ideology was also prepared. The CM also said if only 10 to 15% of the youth adopt the ideologies of Gandhi, the society and the country would be transformed. He also highlighted the seven values of Gandhi which were essential to become a real human being. Nitish asked the BCD officials to depict all important messages of Gandhi, especially those related to prohibition, in the upcoming tower. BCD secretary Kumar Ravi made a presentation on physical progress in the construction of the tower. Nitish asked the officials to complete it as early as possible. CM reviews Moinul Haq Stadium plan The CM also reviewed a presentation on redevelopment plan of the Moinul Haq Stadium made by art, culture and youth department secretary Bandana Preyasi. Nitish said a cricket stadium of international standards was being constructed at Rajgir. He asked the officials and experts concerned to visit Rajgir to collect information about the ongoing construction works there and redraft the Moinul Haq Stadium plan, so that the Patna-based stadium could be constructed in a better way. Earlier, Preyasi made a presentation before the CM on the background and current status of the stadium. The architect made a presentation on the map and estimate of the redevelopment plan. He said the design prepared to upgrade the current structure into a world-class stadium would have facilities of hosting 10 other games besides cricket. He said there would be world-class drainage system. Besides, there will be better arrangements for parking. Restaurants will also be there in the new structure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/display-all-exhibits-on-gandhi-at-bapu-tower-nitish/articleshow/85698631.cms||Madan Kumar

Hindu Munnani state secretary Kadeswara Subramaniam told reporters here on Friday that the government has not granted them permission to install idols so far. “The state government should extend support and enable us to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi. Even if permission is not granted, we will go ahead with the celebrations, as Covid cases have come down.” He said the festival was being celebrated in a grand manner across the state for the past 40 years, thanks to the efforts of Hindu Munnani founder Rama Gopalan. But last year, he said, processions were skipped and the celebrations were muted because of the pandemic. While the absence of usual celebrations had resulted in disappointment, the pandemic had also dealt a severe blow to idol makers. Since processions were prohibited, Ganesh idols were not installed in public places, which hit their business, Subramaniam said. “Now, Covid cases have come down and normalcy has returned slowly. The state government has allowed commercial establishments, theatres, parks and recreation zones to reopen. A sizeable population has also taken Covid vaccine. So, we have decided to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi this year. Procession will also be organised as part of the celebrations. All Covid guidelines will be followed,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/hindu-munnani-to-install-more-than-1-lakh-ganesh-idols-in-state/articleshow/85701187.cms||---

In comparison, the footfall was around 62,000 passengers per day in end-July and just 18,000 passengers per day in mid-May. Airport officials said that at present, both T2 and T3 are more than capable of handling the present footfall, with no immediate plans of reopening T1 at the moment. Airport officials said that with the impact of the second Covid-19 wave decreasing, people are feeling the need to travel to their respective homes and base locations, with an increase seen in the ‘Visiting Family and Relatives’ (VFR) travel category, while the leisure travel (tourists) category has also seen an increase. DIAL’s own analysis, however, shows that business travel is yet to pick up substantially. The airport operator said that a total of 22.9 lakh passengers were handled by the Delhi airport in July. “Easing of travel restrictions following increase in vaccination numbers and low numbers of cases, and ease in capacity limitation to airlines, has given the much needed impetus to air travel,” said a DIAL spokesperson, stating that high-level of hygiene and safety standards are being maintained at the airports and use of various innovative no-contact check-in options have also instilled confidence among air travellers. DIAL says there are no immediate plans to reopen Terminal-1. “Passenger load has to keep increasing consistently for us to consider it,” said the official. In June 2021, a majority of those who flew were in the CFR category (48%), followed by vacationers (25%) and business travellers (19%).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/over-90k-flyers-a-day-at-igi-no-decision-on-reopening-t1-yet/articleshow/85698638.cms||---

---||Kochi||Uniformity in Holy Mass from Nov 28: Synod||Kochi: Second summit of the 29th Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church which concluded here on Friday decided to implement a uniform way of conducting the Holy Mass across the Church from November 28, the Sunday which marks the beginning of the next liturgical calendar in the Church. However, a total implementation is expected only by the Easter Sunday of 2022. According to a post-synod statement, all bishops of the Church have agreed to go for the change from November 28 itself. As per the new changes, the celebrant would face the faithful during the introductory, Liturgy of the Word and conclusion parts. During the Liturgy of the Eucharist, the celebrant would face the altar. In dioceses where there are difficulties in implementing the change, it should be introduced at least in cathedrals, pilgrim centres, minor seminaries and possible parishes on November 28 itself. It should be implemented in every diocese by at least by April 17, 2022, the Easter Sunday, after creating proper awareness, the statement said. Meanwhile, the priests of the Ernakulam Angamaly archdiocese, in a statement, said that they would file a complaint with Pope Francis against the Synod’s decision. We strongly believe that Pope Francis, who will never support any attempt to destroy the unity of the Church, will find a solution based on the complaint by Ernakulam Angamaly archdiocese and other dioceses where the mass has all these years been celebrated by facing the people, said Fr Jose Vailikodath, in a statement issued on behalf of the priests. The decision to unify the mode of celebrating the mass was initially taken in the Synod held in 1999. The present Synod’s decision to implement it came after receiving a letter from the Pope, exhorting all to support the process. Archbishop Leopoldo Girelli, the apostolic nuncio, had said in his address to the Synod that the Pope’s letter was an appeal to unity and not to cause division. He also had suggested the Synod to judiciously evaluate the timeframe for a prudent process of implementation. Meanwhile, laity activists of the Ernakulam Angamaly archdiocese in which Mount St Thomas, the headquarters of the Church, is located, staged a mock synod and a street play at the entrance of the headquarters to protest against the Synod’s decision.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/uniformity-in-holy-mass-from-nov-28-synod/articleshow/85698762.cms||---

---||Delhi||‘Beware of no-time disease that won’t let you slow down’||There is a lot of talk about physical, emotional and mental wellness, but what about professional wellbeing? In a session on the inaugural day of the Times Litfest titled ‘Religion Spirituality and Karma’, ISKCON monk and life coach Gaur Gopal Das said that professional wellness means something that not only pays well but also leaves you feeling well. Sadly, people do well at work, but don’t often enjoy their jobs. In a conversation with bestselling writer Ashwin Sanghi, he said that early on in his career as an electrical engineer he figured that we all on an average spend a whopping 90,000 hours of our lives at work, and that while he knew he would do well during that time, he wasn’t sure he would feel well every moment of it. So, he decided to give it up to pursue his spiritual calling. Being a nonconformist, Sanghi too gave up the well-trodden path to follow his passion. From being a businessman, he became a writer. However, both advised against taking ‘uncalculated risks’ to ‘feel well’. “Giving up your day job is not a good idea, as you might have family responsibilities and there are bills to be paid,” said the monk. “Initially, I too would pursue at night my passion for writing, while spending the whole day at work, running my business. So, my advice to young people is not to suddenly give up your job. It is difficult to write when you are hungry,” said Sanghi. So, the answer to leading a fulfilling work life then lies in pursuing parallel lines. “To do well, have a professional line, and to feel well, follow your passion, your hobby,” said Das, “and who knows one day it might become a mainstream profession.” Talking about ways to balance and align the four wheels of life -- personal life, relationships, work life, and our social contribution -- Das said that most of us are suffering from ‘no-time disease’. We lead such fast-paced lives that it is difficult to even figure out whether life needs to be balanced at all. “Step one is to slow down, in terms of life, because we are not ‘human doings’, we are ‘human beings’. Doing is an important aspect of our life but being is more important as it empowers our doing. When we slow down, we enter into that space of well-being and silence where we are able to listen to our own inner voice. This brings us to the stage of introspection. To align the four wheels of life, we need to be able to introspect to find out which aspect needs more attention. Post this, we have to take micro steps to address it,” the monk recommended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/beware-of-no-time-disease-that-wont-let-you-slow-down/articleshow/85698778.cms||---

E Seetharam Reddy alias Naganna was divisional committee member of Malkangiri East Division, Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC). A native of Chintiryala village in Ashwapuram mandal of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, Seetharam Reddy joined Masab Tank polytechnic college in1970.

---||Kochi||Protests land toll agency in trouble||Thiruvananthapuram: The delay in toll collection due to protests by various political parties has landed the agency which has secured the contract to man the toll plaza at Thiruvallam in a difficult situation. As per the agreement signed with the NHAI, they have to remit a sum of Rs 1.40 lakh each day. The sum can be deposited in intervals of three months. The major problem they are facing is that the agency has won the contract only for a period of six months, on completion of which the NHAI has to float fresh tenders. While the main argument of the agitators is that the toll collection can only be commenced upon the completion of works of the entire stretch from Kazhakootam to Mukkola, the NHAI officials maintained that there was nothing wrong in starting the toll collection now as the works were being carried out in two phases. The first phase comprises a 26.5 km stretch from Kazhakootam to Mukkola and the second phase includes a 16.2 km stretch from Mukkola to Karode. Both phases are treated as separate projects having separate detailed project reports (DPR). Accordingly, works for both the projects were awarded to separate construction firms. While the works of the first phase, which was completed last year, was carried out by KNR Constructions, the works for second phase is being carried out by L&T Constructions. “Hence there was no violation in starting the toll collection now,” said sources in the NHAI. The Kazhakootam-Mukkola stretch alone was completed over a whopping budget close to Rs 1,000 crore, where the land acquisition alone cost over Rs 700 crore. Besides the four lane road, the stretch has service roads on either side, drainage systems and as many as 16 culverts. The NHAI had also changed their original plan at some locations to accommodate the interest of the local public. This includes the construction of a flyover at Chackai in place of an underpass, an underpass at Thirupuram and an elevated highway at Kazhakootam. Meanwhile, the protest against the toll collection continued on Friday also. Youth Congress activists took out a march to the NHAI project director's office in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/protests-land-toll-agency-in-trouble/articleshow/85698759.cms||---

In a letter to state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote: “Though the trajectory of daily new cases has shown a decline over the last month, there are some districts in Maharashtra which are showing early signs of upsurge in Covid-19 cases and test positivity... In view of mass events and public gatherings expected during celebrations of upcoming festivals, including dahi handi and Ganeshotsav, it is advised that the state may consider imposing and enforcing local restrictions.” On Friday, Maharashtra reported 4,654 new cases, after two days of adding 5,000-plus cases, and 170 deaths. With this, the state’s total caseload rose to nearly 64.5 lakh and total fatalities climbed to almost 1.4 lakh. Mumbai reported over 300 new cases for the third consecutive day—362 cases on Friday as against 398 on Thursday and 342 on Wednesday—and five deaths. The city’s caseload rose to more than 7.4 lakh and overall death toll to 15,968. The test positivity rate rose to 1% with 35,870 tests in Mumbai; the figure had been around 0.7% for many days in August. BMC officials said the numbers over the next few days will prove whether the rise in cases is a “blip or something to worry about”. The BMC also issued an appeal to Mumbaikars to get themselves tested immediately if they had come in contact with infected people or had developed mild symptoms. “Against the backdrop of a possible third wave, as well as due to the relaxation in the restrictions, we have been told to step up testing,” said an official. To prepare for the third wave, Rs 1,367 crore has been budgeted for the state under the National Health Mission, said minister of state for public health Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar. Of this, the central share is Rs 820 crore, while that of the state is Rs 547 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-centre-tells-state-to-consider-local-curbs-in-festive-season/articleshow/85702993.cms||Bhavika Jain

He took interest in cooking at a very young age and studied hotel management course from Bengaluru, and later took over his father’s catering business in Thiruvalla. Naushad’s association with childhood friend and film director Blessy led him into the world of films. ‘Kaazhcha’, directed by Blessy, was the first movie he produced. This was followed by Chattambinad, Best Actor, Lion, Payyansand Spanish Masala. Naushad occupied a unique place in the catering industry with his capability to serve quality and tasty food, especially biryani, to any number of guests at a function. The faith in him made Naushad the favourite for the big names in all fields, from movies to politics to business. Naushad’s presence at the dining hall of a function where his unit is serving food was looked upon as a status symbol by the hosts. However, things took a drastic turn for him in the last few years. His health deteriorated while his catering business too suffered severely due to the pandemic. His wife’s death while he was in the ICU lowered his spirits. Her mortal remains were brought to the hospital for Naushad to catch a final glimpse. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his condolence message said that Naushad introduced varieties of tasty food to Keralites through television shows and he was popular among all.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/noted-chef-and-film-producer-naushad-dies/articleshow/85698864.cms||---
---||Agra||No relief for Kafeel as hearing in Aligarh court set to resume after government sanction||Slug: ‘Inflammatory’ anti-CAA speech at AMU Agra: Uttar Pradesh Police on Thursday said it will again approach Aligarh court with a set of charge-sheet and a copy of government’s sanction letter to restart the prosecution proceedings against suspended Gorakhpur paediatrician Kafeel Khan for his alleged inflammatory speech delivered at AMU in December 2019. It comes a day after the Allahabad high court quashed the ongoing hearing on the charge-sheet in the court due to the absence of prosecution sanction by the state government, which is required in some of the IPC sections slapped against Khan. Circle officer (CO) Shwetabh Pandey told TOI that police had applied for prosecution sanction in April 2020. But, it was received over a year later on May 27, 2021. In between, local police filed the charge-sheet without the necessary government nod and the court also took its cognisance and started the hearing. In March this year, Khan approached the high court seeking quashing of the local court’s proceedings due to the missing sanction. On Thursday, a single judge bench of Justice Gautam Chowdhary set aside the cognisance order passed by Aligarh court on July 27, 2020, as there was no requisite prosecution sanction order from the state government according to section 196 of the CrPC. In the absence of the sanction, the magistrate should not have taken cognisance of the charge-sheet for the offence under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration.) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the high court order stated. The court remanded the matter back to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Aligarh with a direction to pass a cognizance order against Khan only when prior sanction for prosecution is received from the state government. Khan was booked for his alleged inflammatory remarks at an anti-CAA protest rally at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on December 13, 2019. He was arrested from Mumbai on January 29, 2020 and was granted bail on February 10 by a court in Aligarh. But, on February 13, the UP government invoked the National Security Act, 1980 against him just hours before he was to come out of the Mathura jail. He remained incarcerated there for seven months. In September last year, the Allahabad high court termed Khan’s detention “illegal” and ordered his immediate release on bail from Mathura jail. However, criminal proceedings under other IPC sections were on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/no-relief-for-kafeel-as-hearing-in-aligarh-court-set-to-resume-after-government-sanction/articleshow/85696652.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Commission chairperson Justice Antony Dominic has issued an order in this regard to the Museum police station house officer. Even though the vehicles were impounded in connection with cases registered at the Museum police station, they have been dumped along the Museum-Kanakanagar stretch. The commission has also obtained a report from the Museum police on this. Meanwhile, in the report submitted by the Museum police before the commission it was mentioned that old vehicles dumped here had been auctioned. It was also said in the report that CCTV cameras were installed here as part of preventing waste dumping and anti-social activities. Also, the night patrolling carried out by the municipality squad ensures to prevent the dumping of waste. The report also says that steps would be taken to remove construction materials that had been piled up along the road for setting up a vending zone as part of rehabilitating the street vendors. However, the commission said all the vehicles dumped along this stretch should be removed with immediate effect. The action follows a complaint filed by J Vamadevan, a native of Mukkola.

---||Coimbatore||Pollachi MP seeks restoration of trains to southern districts||Coimbatore: Pollachi MP K Shamugasundaram, in a letter to railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, has sought restoration of train services from Coimbatore to southern districts. There is good demand and revenue potential in the Coimbatore - Dindigul section via Podanur – Pollachi, especially after gauge conversion, the MP said. “As lockdown norms are relaxed, train services in this section will connect tourist destinations in Mettupalayam, Coimbatore, Pollachi, Palani, Dindigul, Madurai, Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Rameswaram. Podanur – Pollachi – Dindigul section was converted to broad gauge at a cost of Rs 900 crore a few years ago. However, four trains operated on the route were never restored after the conversion,” he said. Conversion in Podanur – Pollachi section from metre gauge was completed in 2017. But regular express trains are not operated in the section. “Coimbatore – Podanur – Pollachi – Palani – Dindigul railway section connects Coimbatore and Madurai in the shortest route. It has significant passenger and parcel revenue potential, which is grossly underutilised with utilization rate of less than 40%,” said B Mohan Raj, secretary of Pollachi Train Passengers Welfare Association. “Movement of textile and other products from Coimbatore, tea and vegetables from Nilgiris, agriculture produce and coir products from Pollachi and Udumalai can reach southern districts through this route. Vegetables and fruits from and to the famous Oddanchatram market, seafood from Rameswaram and Kanniyakumari can reach western districts. Coordinated efforts among railway divisions will definitely increase the parcel revenue in addition to the revenue from the regular goods trains,” Mohan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/pollachi-mp-seeks-restoration-of-trains-to-southern-districts/articleshow/85701347.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The post of CEO is of class one rank and on par with an assistant collector’s. Rathod, who was arrested and suspended, was a class one officer. The ACB on May 25 had laid a trap and arrested Rathod along with his assistant Arvind Tiwari while reportedly seeking a bribe of Rs 50,000 from a Aarey slum dweller who wanted to carry out some repair work. Every commercial as well as residential repair and reconstruction inside the jurisdiction of Aarey needs permission from the CEO’s office. He had recently approached the CEO seeking permission to carry out repair work before monsoon. Rathod allegedly demanded Rs 50,000 as bribe. The complainant approached the ACB and laid a trap for Rathod and his assistant Tiwari. After arresting the duo, the ACB carried out a search of Rathod’s official bungalow inside Aarey and reportedly found Rs 3.46 crore. “The cash was 555.9% more than his known source of income,” said an ACB official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-acb-files-case-against-aarey-ceo-over-rs-3-5cr-cash-in-house/articleshow/85696795.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Delhi||Corneal transplants down by 52% as eye donations hit by pandemic||NEW DELHI: The number of corneal transplants — which involves removal of all or a part of a damaged cornea and its replacement by healthy tissue retrieved from the eye of a deceased donor — reduced by 52% due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Between April 2019 and March 2020, India had conducted 27,075 corneal transplants. However, after the pandemic, between April 2020 and March 2021, this number reduced to 12,998, according to Eye Bank Association of India (EBAI). One of the main reasons for the sharp drop in corneal transplants was the lack of eye donation. Dr Namrata Sharma, honorary general secretary of EBAI, who is also a professor of ophthalmology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told TOI that cornea donation had reduced by 63%. “Between April 2019 and March 2020, that is the year before the pandemic, there were 50,953 eye donations in the country. A year later, between April 2020 and March 2021, only 18,359 corneas were collected,” added Sharma. Cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the eye. It allows light to enter and performs two-thirds of the focusing task. For people suffering from vision loss due to irreparable damage to the tissue, transplant is the only option. A corneal transplant involves replacing a diseased or scarred cornea with a donor graft. Dr JS TItiyal, chief of RP Eye Centre at AIIMS that runs one of the most active corneal transplant programmes in the country, said donations at their eye bank had touched 2,400-2,500 in a year before the pandemic. “In the last one year, we have been able to collect only 200-300 corneas. This has affected transplants severely. The waiting time for the sight-saving surgery has also gone up. Because of the pandemic, we have lost the gains made after years of effort to boost cornea donations and transplants,” said Dr Mahipal Sachdev, chairman of Centre for Sight group of eye hospitals. Retrieval of corneal tissue was suspended temporarily when the Covid-19 outbreak started in 2020 March-end. Corneal transplants were also put on hold. “Home collection of corneas from deceased donors remained suspended till December 28, 2020, which led to a sharp drop in donations. Many hospitals had to adopt alternative options, such as using preserved cornea or putting tissue adhesives for temporary relief from corneal damage caused by small perforation to tide over the crisis,” said Sharma. The general secretary of EBAI added, “There being a dearth of eye donations in India, the burden of blindness is piling up. Corneal donation needs to be advocated as the biggest good one can do to the world after death.” Major General Dr JKS Parihar, president of EBAI, said, “Since the inception of the pandemic last year, eye donation in India has been severely impacted as banking activities were completely shut from March to May 2020. Even after these services restarted from June 2020, the growth in numbers is still extremely low. The second wave of Covid-19 further impacted the collection. This gigantic gap has resulted in an exponential rise in the additional burden of corneal blind patients in the country. With a huge burden of vision impairment in India, there is an immediate need to take preventive measures on a very urgent basis.” More than 11 lakh people in India suffer from blindness due to impairment of the cornea. To remedy this, eyes donated by a deceased person are used to replace the impaired cornea. Appealing to people to donate the eyes of deceased family members, Sharma said, “This act will go a long way in helping the cornea-blind tide over this hour of darkness.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/corneal-transplants-down-by-52-as-eye-donations-hit-by-pandemic/articleshow/85698898.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The college trust ands its educational agency had become defunct two decades ago, following which the Madras high court, in a legal scrutiny, had in 2005 declared the aided college with its movable and immovable assets as the government property. There were, however, no steps to convert the college into a government college, affecting the quality of education and its infrastructure. The college was under the administration of the regional joint director of collegiate education, Coimbatore, for the past 20 years. Recently, former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had assured to take steps to convert the college into a government facility, but nothing materialized. On Friday, higher education minister K Ponmudi made the announcement to convert it into a government arts and science college on the floor of the assembly, following a request from housing and urban development minister S Muthusamy. P Thirunavakkarasu, president, Association of University Teachers, said the two-decade-old struggle of people of Erode, student community and various sections of the employees has finally yielded results. The association also appealed Ponmudi to expedite the process and declare CN College, Erode, as the government college in the current academic year itself to benefit the poor students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/cn-college-to-become-govt-institute-soon/articleshow/85701376.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune hospitals test suspected nCoV cases for influenza viruses||PUNE: The seasonal viruses’ comeback has prompted some of the private hospitals in the city to parallelly test suspected Covid-19 patients for influenza viruses, besides the SARS-CoV-2 , to avoid unnecessary administration of steroids, blood thinners and potent antivirals like remdesivir. A sizable number of Puneites running a fever and having sore throat are testing negative for Covid. Besides vector-borne illnesses, including dengue and chikungunya, other monsoon ailments like diarrhoea, typhoid and skin infections are also on the rise. Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital’s infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag said, “Not all patients with a viral respiratory illness have Covid. This changes the medical management.” The re-emergence of the seasonal viruses has activated the use of diagnostic RT-PCR panel for other viruses, including subtypes of influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza (all four types) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. “Quite a few patients with suspected Covid are testing positive for influenza viruses, mainly subtypes of influenza A virus. Besides, patients are also testing positive for other common respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus,” Prayag said. The presence of circulating seasonal viruses seems to be surpassing SARS-CoV-2, the predominant virus till June. Large-scale testing data was needed to conclusively confirm this, though, experts stressed. “We are running the PCR panel for other viruses. The percentage of Covid positivity at our hospital is 6-7% as against 30% positivity for influenza viruses. Besides, the percentage of dengue and chikungunya positivity is between 14% and 20%,” said microbiologist Maithili Kavthekar, director (laboratory services), Sahyadri Hospital. Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief executive officer Bomi Bhote said, “We have the facility to test other seasonal viruses. The test is conducted as per the clinicians’ requests. Patients are testing positive for dengue, chikungunya and influenza.” Experts stressed on following Covid appropriate behaviour though the seasonal illnesses were back. They warned that public at large should not be complacent about Covid. Senior physician Madhav Dharme said, “Citizens with symptoms should avoid self-medication with antibiotics. We need to keep masking up and observe social distancing.” Critical care expert Kapil Borawake said, “One should continue to consider all fever patients as Covid unless proven otherwise.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hosps-test-suspected-ncov-cases-for-influenza-viruses/articleshow/85698841.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Humayun or Hanuman? What is in a name, villagers differ||NEW DELHI: Municipal councillors from the south Delhi localities of Mohammadpur and Humanyupur have proposed changes in the name of these urban villages to Madhavpuram and Hanumanpur. The suggestions have divided the local residents on religious lines, with some appreciating such a change and the others resisting it, pointing out that a nomenclature change isn’t cosmetic but necessitates alterations in documents and identities while adversely affecting the community sensitivities. Midway between Bhikaji Cama Place and RK Puram, Mohammadpur village has been around for 325 years since farmers from nearby Munirka village shifted to the vacant area near Teen Burji Mosque, an imposing Lodhi era monument. Kuldeep Singh Tomar,70, treasurer of the local RWA, said that over the years the village land was taken over to develop colonies like Sarojini Nagar and RK Puram.  “There is nothing communal in the demand for the name change. It only reflects the wishes of residents. There are hardly any Muslim families there,” claimed Tomar. The village chaupal, renovated by INTACH, is located not far from the ASI-protected mosque and the village well, which is now covered. Kulbeer Singh, another resident, rued that the village has been turned into a kabutarkhana (dovecove) with unplanned development and acquisition of its land. Cramped lanes, poorly managed parks and unplanned mushrooming of 4-5-storey houses show the area needs redevelopment. On the west of Mohammadpur exists the slum clusters of Kumhar Basti, Azad Basti and Adarsh Colony. There, people also produce knitted items, food products, leather products and other objects.  “Why the need to change a name that has existed for hundreds of years?” asked Rupender Kumar. “We have been brought up in this village and never has such a demand been raised before. What will we gain out of it?” Autorickshaw driver Monu had another poser. “What is the association of Madhavpuram with this place?” he asked. Barber Mohammad Samir opined that such issues were bound to be raked up when municipal elections were approaching. "A name change is not an issue in the area. The focus should be on improving the lives of residents by providing facilities," he said.  In 2014, an in-situ redevelopment plan for the village was prepared by Delhi Urban Arts Commission, but wasn’t implemented. Around 2km away is Humanyupur village, nestled between Deer Park and Safdarjung Enclave. Over the years, Humanyupur, a Jat-dominated village, has acquired a more cosmopolitan atmosphere with a large influx of residents from the north-eastern Indian states. Its lanes are lined with tattoo shops, salons and restaurants offering Naga, Tibetan, Assamese and Thai cuisine.  The village was also in the eye of controversy in 2018 when a gumti, a small domed tomb from the medieval ages, was painted saffron and turned into a temple. Most of the local residents that TOI spoke to appeared unaware of the demand for a name change. Sangh Priya Gautam, 33, was convinced people would suffer if a change was implemented. “Politicians should focus on development. Look at our roads, look at the garbage piles. Everyone knows what politicians are trying to do," Gautam said. Hukum Chand, 94, who lives near Jatav chaupal testified to Mahatma Gandhi visiting this village and felt politics was vitiating its atmosphere. "We have made no such demands,” he said. “Humanyupur's name has remained our identity for centuries.” Ashok Kumar, 56, who lives on the lanes where Northeast eateries proliferate, was adamant that there was no desire for a name change among residents. “This demand has its origins in the minds of unscrupulous people and everyone will have to suffer for it," he remarked darkly. Cheap rentals have made Humanyupur home to a large number of working-class migrants who only want to live in peace. Vegetable seller Rajesh Kumar, originally from Bihar who settled here in 1999, said he had no preference for Humanyupur or Hanumangarh so long as the area developed and prospered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/humayun-or-hanuman-what-is-in-a-name-villagers-differ/articleshow/85724034.cms||Paras Singh

The authorities have written to the Punjab Police Academy, Phillaur, demanding new dogs, including two explosive specialists and one tracker specialist. It takes six months to train the pups. The dog squad of Ludhiana police commissionerate has one dog each under three categories: tracker specialist (Pixie, a German Shepherd), explosive specialist (Sheru, a Labrador) and narcotic specialist (Sandy, also a Labrador). Each dog has a separate handler, who also trains them for different specialisations. Recently, explosive specialist Labrador Binny had retired due to ill-health and is being looked after by the staffers of the dog squad. These specialist dogs have helped the police in seizing drugs, finding explosives and solving burglaries, murders and rape cases as well. In charge of Ludhiana dog squad ASI Gurdev Singh said, “Our tracker specialist Pixie is nine years old, explosive specialist Sheru is eight years old and narcotic specialist Sandy is of six. Pixie and Sheru’s retirement is due next year and we are in need of more dogs. I have already written to the department concerned in PPA.” Sub-inspector Vikram Bhanot, who heads dog breeding-cum-training centre at PPA, Phillaur, told the TOI, “The retirement age of a dog is 10 years, but some may retire prior to this, depending on their health conditions. A committee is formed to purchase pups, which are trained and appointed at different districts. In 2019, we had purchased 48 dogs.”“We are receiving demands from the districts. The pandemic had delayed the procedure, as we were not allowed to train dogs. We get the best dog breeds in February, August and September. Next month, we will give an advertisement for purchasing dogs. Then after one month, the canines will be appointed at different districts,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/two-dogs-near-retirement-squad-to-get-new-members/articleshow/85696772.cms||Payal Dhawan

He said the administration had spoken to Serum Institute of India (SII). The SII officials claimed that they had increased the production of vaccine and the supply was expected to increase in the coming month compared to that in July and August, he said. “We are speaking to other vaccine manufacturers too, so that the supply to the state and the district can be increased in September to ensure that maximum people are fully vaccinated ahead of the possible third wave,” Pawar said after the district’s weekly Covid-19 review meeting. The deputy CM called for priority vaccination of the teaching and non-teaching staffers of educational institutions though the state was yet to take a final call on reopening schools and colleges. He said special camps should be organised in the district to ensure that they were vaccinated as early as possible. With the weekly positivity rate (WPR) remaining below 4% in the district for three weeks in a row, Ajit Pawar told the administration to continue with increased testing in the city and rural areas. This week, the WPR in Pune Municipal Corporation areas was 2.8%. It was 2.9% in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits and 3.6% in rural areas. The overall WPR was for the district 3.1%. Ahead of the possible third wave, Ajit Pawar said the district had made adequate arrangements for oxygen. He said the guidelines for Ganeshotsav would be decided at the state-level, as it was done for dahi handi celebrations. The local administration, along with police, should hold meetings with Ganesh mandals to ensure that there was no violation of Covid protocols, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dy-cm-for-maximum-shots-in-sept-ahead-of-third-wave/articleshow/85698869.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Coimbatore||Kodanad case: Court permits re-examining of key witnesses||UDHAGAMANDALAM: In a new twist to the Kodanad murder-burglary case, the Ooty sessions court has allowed re-examination of three crucial witnesses. They are: One, the forensic officer who has already gone on record saying evidence at the burglary scene had been tampered with by the time he reached the spot at 7.30am on April 24, 2017. Two, an assistant engineer of TNEB, Kodanad division, who shall now explain how the whole area, which always had uninterrupted power supply, suffered ‘power cut’ during the offence; And, three, the manager of the estate, who might give details of things stolen during the burglary. The Nilgiris sessions judge, C Sanjay Baba, gave permission for their re-examination after memos were filed on Friday. The court said that as there was no stay of proceedings by Madras high court, defence witnesses could be prosecuted on a day-to-day basis from September 2. More importantly, when the case was taken up for hearing none of the 10 accused persons, except K V Sayan, were present in the court. During the proceedings on Friday, the court witnessed a chaotic situation for a while when advocate Anandhakrishnan, counsel for N Ravi (PW35), interrupted by stating that a memo filed in connection with the case was still pending with the high court. The prosecution lawyers opposed him and argued that that he did not have any locus standi to interrupt the proceedings. As unparliamentary words were exchanged in court hall, judge Sanjay Baba intervened and said counsel for both the sides should know they were in a court of law and they should maintain the decorum of the court. Senthilkumar, counsel for Sayan, told TOI, “With the permission of the court, the prosecution can do trial on a day-to-day basis starting on September 2”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/nod-for-re-examination-of-3-witnesses-in-kodanad-case/articleshow/85701391.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Work on second phase of UER-II to start by September-end||NEW DELHI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is likely to kick off the construction for the second phase of Urban Extension Road (UER-II) by September-end, which will provide seamless connectivity from Mahipalpur on Delhi-Gurugram Expressway to Delhi-Chandigarh highway bypassing the congested Ring Road. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday directed the highways authority to make the 75.7 km access controlled highway operational by August 15, 2023. The road was proposed in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 and was touted as the third Ring Road to decongest the current Ring Road and Delhi-Gurugram Expressway. As per the original plan, Delhi Development Authority had to build the road. In 2017, this task was handed over to the NHAI. But the project got further delayed due to non-availability of land. The 75.7 km-long stretch will connect three NHs — NH-8, 10 and 1 — and make travel seamless across this region in the national capital. NHAI officials said they have bid out all the five packages of the project with estimated cost of Rs 7,716 crore, which will be developed as a four and six-lane access controlled highway with service roads. Those who will use the access controlled stretch will have to pay the user fee or toll charge, according to the plan. Sources said the project has been divided into five packages for carrying out construction simultaneously across the stretch. “We have more than 90% of the required land under possession in four packages and in the remaining one we will get over 90% land by September end. We will expedite the work. Since there are critical structures, there is little scope for using pre-cast material. We have to go for in-situ casting of structures,” said an official. Meanwhile, barely a week before the PM reviewed the project, the Delhi government’s environment department approved the transplantation of around 4,365 trees and to fell another 2,314 trees for the project. Officials said the Delhi government has also recommended the forest ministry’s approval for using nearly 54 hectare of land for the project, which is currently recorded as deemed forest. “We are confident of obtaining all statutory approvals in the next one week or 10 days,” said an NHAI official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/work-on-second-phase-of-uer-ii-to-start-by-sept-end/articleshow/85698945.cms||Dipak K Dash

Round 1 of the First-Year Junior College (FYJC) general merit list has thrown other surprises as well. More students, including top scorers this year, have not just chosen commerce but also science over arts. “Commerce has been a choice of many. More students opting for science despite not having taken asingle practical exam is surprising,” said professor Hasnain Naqvi, vice-principal, St Xavier’s junior college. Last year, the arts stream has been more sought after. St Xavier’s arts cut-off rose only marginally from 94.6% last year to 95.19% this time. Of the 28 students who scored 100%, 22 opted for science. The student on top of the merit list with a 100% opted for commerce. Colleges such as Vaze-Kelkar, K C and Ruparel that attracted 90% scorers for arts last year, had to settle for students with 89-88%. Ruia and Jain Hind arts cut-offs slipped by a per cent. Colleges such as Bhavans, Charni Road, and Royal, Mira Road, saw arts cut-off fall 5% and 4%, respectively. A total of 1.1 lakh students have been allotted commerce seats, followed by 70,263 in science and 17,258 arts. On the other hand, more science colleges, K C and Mithibai, for instance, attracted students with 90% scores this year. A total of 61,511 SSC students have been allotted science seats. Mulund’s Vaze-Kelkar college and Pace junior college, Andheri branch had a cut-off of 93.6% for science. Colleges like KC and Mithibai this year attracted students scoring 90% for the science stream. Lack of practical for students choosing science is a matter of concern for college heads. They are hoping physical classes will resume at least for practical purposes. Commerce colleges continued with their trend of pulling high scorers to the stream. “Being a financial capital, commerce will attract students. The cost of commerce education vis-a-vis science could be a factor too. Only when the cost of higher studies in science and medicine is subsidized will more students look at other streams,” said Dr Arvind Luhar, chairperson, Board of Studies in Accountancy, Mumbai University. This year, despite a drop in non-state board students seeking admissions in junior colleges , more ICSE and CBSE students managed to grab seats in top-rung colleges. More than 10,000 ICSE students and 6,000 CBSE students have been allotted seats in the first round. The number would have been higher had the state’s decision to hold a CET (after board exams were cancelled due to the pandemic) not forced these students to continue studies in their board schools. Results based on a written exam would have shot up the cut-offs, said professor Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal, Vaze-Kelkar College. A dip in minority cut-offs was an indication of where the general merit list was headed. Unlike previous years, minority cut-offs for top-rung colleges this year were lower than general. “Internal assessment has affected Christianminority students, whose schools are not liberal in awarding marks. The generalmerit list is a reflection of how non-minority schools have given away marks,”said a principal. More students this year got the college of their choice (first and second preference), compared to last year. Over 67% girls have got seats allotted in the first round.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-fyjc-cut-offs-dip-a-little-science-back-as-a-top-stream/articleshow/85703051.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Mumbai||Caved-in road at Mulund out of bounds for a month||MUMBAI: Two weeks after a storm water drain caved in at Mulund, the street — Guru Gobind Singh Marg — will be out of bounds for vehicular traffic for at least a month. This means that thousands of residents living in Mulund Colony will have to take a 20-minute detour to enter and exit their locality. Also, several BEST bus routes have been diverted after the cave-in. The BJP has lodged a police complaint accusing BMC officials of negligence and causing nuisance to the public. BJP MLA from Mulund, Mihir Kotecha, has written to officials of Mulund police station, asking them to file an FIR against BMC officials. “The BMC will take at least a month to repair this cave-in. The road will remain out of bounds and over 10,000 residents will be inconvenienced. They [BMC officials] did not carry out any audit and just kept laying the road over the old drains. This is nothing but negligence and there must be a criminal probe into this,” Kotecha said. Early this month, a portion of the road caved in. Initially, cracks had surfaced, but by evening, the road had caved in completely. Assistant municipal commissioner of ‘T’ ward, Chakrapani Alle, said: “The work has already started. The chief engineers of the Storm Water Drains department also visited the site. There is another culvert 100 metres next to the one that caved in. Auditors have suggested that with the caved-in portion, the other culvert also be fixed. We have kept the road closed till both culverts are repaired.” Kotecha said that officials were supposed to do an audit of the drains and culvert. “This was not done in a timely manner. We were lucky there was no accident or injury due to this cave-in. The police must probe and book BMC officials for this,” hes said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/caved-in-road-at-mulund-out-of-bounds-for-a-month-in-mumbai/articleshow/85698976.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Blessy who directed and scripted the movie was at the hospital in Thiruvalla, attending to the needs of his intimate friend for the past one month. “Right from childhood we spent a lot of time together. He was my junior in school and college. He was my neighbour too. Even before doing Kaazhcha we had a very intimate relationship,” remembered Blessy. “It was unfortunate that he passed away on the 17th anniversary of Kaazhcha,” he added. The film marked Blessy’s debut as an independent director. “Naushad used to listen to my stories and ideas about films patiently and encourage me. As students we took part in cultural activities together. It was almost like living together in the same house from childhood. I have lots of memories about him,” he said. Blessy said that he was witness to the dedication and hard work of Naushad which made him a renowned chef. Pathanamthitta district administration issued orders allowing the conduct of the funeral following Covid protocol after Blessy approached them for relaxation in lockdown rules for the funeral function.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/blessy-big-chef-goes-as-kaazhcha-turns-17/articleshow/85698988.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

---||Kochi||Probe team submits report to collector||Kochi: The nine-member team constituted by the district administration to probe into the complaints against former revenue officials of Fort Kochi revenue divisional office (RDO) submitted its report to district collector Jafar Malik Friday evening. The 50-page report was prepared after examining all the files in the RDO office. The team was constituted following a series of complaints from the public against officials in the RDO office that they delayed processing files intentionally and it might be to extort money from the people. Meanwhile, sources refused to divulge more details of the report as the issue came under the purview of the revenue department resulting in transfer of around 27 officials from the RDO office to other offices. “Though inspection of files is done every three years, this time, it was done following the complaints. We have examined all the files in the office and submitted a report to the collector after consolidating our findings,” said an official. The team examined files received from agriculture, village and other offices, applications for conversion of land and looked into whether the delay was intentional, where it was delayed, was there any superseding in order of files, irregularities and violations. Though some beneficiaries had verbally complained that the officers demanded bribe from them for speeding up their applications, there was no written complaint. Officials examined more than 3,000 files received after the last inspection conducted more than four years ago. “I have yet to see the report. The inspection team generally do not recommend any disciplinary action against erring officials. They look into whether there was any anomalies taken place or any inordinate delay in processing files or any financial irregularities happened. There were complaints of inordinate delay in processing files leading to transfer of many officials. We feel the procedures in the RDO office will fall in line once the new sub-collector takes charge,” said Malik. The inspection of files in the RDO office was pending for more than one year and the controversy erupted in the middle of that. Following the issue, the district administration mulled to reshuffle the staff in all revenue offices in the district. No new RDO has been joined in Fort Kochi RDO office so far after former sub-collector Harees Rasheed was posted in Kolkata.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/probe-team-submits-report-to-collector/articleshow/85696877.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Teen blows up Rs 10 lakh of mum’s account on PUBG||MUMBAI: A teen’s brittle sensitivity and waywardness are not easy to handle. A 16-year-old who had clandestinely squandered Rs 10 lakh from his mother’s account to play PUBG — a banned game — walked out of his home after his father realised that the boy had blown up the money and reprimanded him for what he had done. Scared that he was caught and upset about the chiding, the teen walked out in a huff, after leaving a note that read — ‘Will never come back home’. The boy, said crime branch officials, had figured a way to procure the banned game. All hell broke loose at home when the ‘goodbye’ note was found by the boy’s parents on Tuesday. They immediately approached the police. A missing person’s complaint was lodged at MIDC police station. Tracking the boy’s whereabouts through technical surveillance, a team of the crime branch led by inspector Mahesh Kumar tracked down the boy to Mahakali locality in Andheri (east) on Wednesday — a day after he had gone missing. The police refused to divulge details of where the boy’s whereabouts in that 24-hour span that he was nowhere to be found. “It’s about a “sensitive, callow teenager”, is all what an officer would say. But the men in khaki did have a word of advice for the young boy’s parents who hail from a middle-class family. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Datta Nalawade said, “We have told the parents not to stress him with too many questions.” Another officer said parents need to be alert of their children’s activities as many kids tend to fall prey to online frauds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-teen-blows-up-rs-10l-of-mums-a/c-on-pubg/articleshow/85703065.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Ahmedabad||New normal was seen in 1918 crisis||AHMEDABAD: As the world came to a standstill in 2020 due to Covid crisis, economies plummeted, lakhs lost their livelihood, and lakhs of others were forced to migrate to their home towns. Similar scenes had played out across the globe from 1918 to 1920 because of the influenza outbreak. Prof Amol Agarwal of Ahmedabad University has presented his paper on the theme ‘Impact of Pandemics on Indian Banking Sector’. In it, he mentioned that during the plague and influenza, western India — part of erstwhile Bombay Presidency — was badly affected. “There was no central bank such as Reserve Bank of India at that time. Records indicate that Bank of Bombay or presidency bank lost as much as 37% deposits,” he said. “On the other hand, the joint stock banks were not affected much. In fact, after this period, the banking sector grew vigorously and industrial banks and insurance companies were established.” He was speaking at the second edition of International Conference on Indian Business and Economic History organized by IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A). The last day of the conference on Friday featured a virtual roundtable. Experts including Prof Chinmay Tumbe from IIM-A, Prof Guido Alfani from Bocconi University of Italy, Prof Bishnupriya Gupta from Warwick University, and Prof Tirthankar Roy from London School of Economics discussed impact of pandemic on economies. In his talk, Prof Alfani said that Covid renewed the interest of historians in past pandemics. He said, “Not all pandemics have resulted in economic resurgence, and often the health crisis has led to deepening financial inequality, loss of labour due to heavy death toll, and plummeting GDPs. The economic impact of Covid can be compared with that of influenza.” Prof Tumbe said that both Covid and influenza came in waves and resulted in mass migration. He also said that 1918 is considered the worst macroeconomic year in recorded Indian history due to the pandemic. Prof Gupta said the aftermath saw increased participation of women, but the impact, as shown by a study on the 1921-1931 period, was short-lived.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/new-normal-was-seen-in-1918-crisis/articleshow/85698997.cms||Parth Shastri

Movement of motor vehicles is restricted on the 1.3km stretch from 9am to 9pm on all days to decongest the Chandni Chowk area and now 11 battery-run golf carts will help visitors traverse the distance. The service would be free, but priority would be given to the elderly, differently abled, women and children for travel. The Delhi government’s transport department has invited Expression of Interest (EOI) on behalf of the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), to select one or more agencies to procure and operate such golf carts on the main Chandni Chowk road. Market trader associations, NGOs, societies, companies and other entities are eligible to submit their EOIs for the project. Initially, the period of engagement of an agency would be three years but the period can be extended on the discretion of SRDC. The electric golf carts will be of vintage look to suit the overall aesthetics and heritage environment of Chandni Chowk. The agency will have to first take approval from SRDC on the design and colour scheme of the carts before these are procured. Apart from the driver, the carts will be able to accommodate seven passengers. The golf carts will have uniformed drivers and will be allowed to pick up or drop passengers only at designated stops. As part of the first phase, total 11 electric golf carts, including one spare, would be allowed to operate but during subsequent phases, the number of carts to operate in Chandni Chowk may be increased to 22, including two spare carts. Initially, the golf carts will be run on the main Chandni Chowk road but operation of the carts may be later extended to roads adjoining the main road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/mix-of-new-old-vintage-e-golf-carts-on-chandni-chowk-rd-soon/articleshow/85699011.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Ajay Rathodia, a resident of Kotali Navinagri village, was convicted in three offences and sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment. But he will be imprisoned for only 10 years as the three sentences will run concurrently. Another accused, Jagdish Rathodia was acquitted by the court. “Ajay was sentenced to three years of imprisonment under IPC 363 with Rs 1,000 fine, five years under IPC 366 with Rs 1,000 fine and 10 years under IPC 376 (II) and POCSO Act with Rs 5,000 fine. All the three sentences will run concurrently,” said advocate Atul Vyas, assistant government pleader and public prosecutor. Ajay was booked for kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl in October 2018 by the taluka police. The girl’s father told the police that Ajay kidnapped her and took her to Sabarkantha. Ajay promised the girl that he would marry her and then raped her on multiple occasions. The girl later told the police that he forced himself upon her.

---||Ludhiana||Ministry for anti-dumping duty on yarn import, bizmen happy||Ludhiana: In a breather for the domestic yarn manufacturers, especially those who are into polyester spun yarn (PSY), the Union minister for industry and commerce has accepted their demand to impose anti-dumping duty (ADD) on the import of PSY from China, Indonesia and Vietnam. The import had increased by 943% during the past five years. One of the biggest bodies of yarn manufacturers, Northern India Textile Mills’ Association (NITMA), had been taking up this demand at different levels, claiming that the uncontrolled imports of PSY had eaten up a significant share of domestic markets and was hurting the local industry. Now all eyes are on the ministry of finance as a formal notification is awaited to confirm imposition of ADD.Sanjay Garg, president of NITMA, said, “We are thankful to minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal and the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) for their recommendation to impose ADD on PSY originating in or exported from China, Indonesia and Vietnam. There has been a huge surge in the import of this yarn post-GST, as with the removal of excise and other duties the polyester yarn is being cleared at zero duty. Imports of virgin PSY have increased by 943% in five years and in a shocking trend, imports from Vietnam alone have increased by 88 times. Imports for this yarn in 2020-21 are 60,810 tonnes, out of the total domestic consumption of 264,000 tonnes, which means that imports have gobbled up 23% of the total market share and this trend is increasing at a great speed.”Asserting that now the domestic yarn manufacturers would be able to survive, Garg added, “We urge the minister for finance to notify the ADD at the earliest, as any delay will push the domestic industry backwards, jeopardising jobs of many.”According to yarn manufacturer Siddharth Khanna, “NITMA members made several representations to all the authorities about the increasing import of the PSY and its dangers. Besides this, many other producers of PSY throughout the country undertook the herculean task of collecting data so that facts could be presented before the authorities. Finally, the DGTR, in its final findings, agreed to the concerns flagged by the NITMA.”Association’s vice-president Aman Gupta said, “Due to increase in the imports of PSY, the synthetic yarn segment of India’s textile sector was devastated, as a result most of the units had become NPAs and the rest were on the verge of it. Only a handful of PSY manufacturers in India are doing well and majority are in dire straits. The recommendation by the Union minister has come as a big relief for us.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ministry-for-anti-dumping-duty-on-yarn-import-bizmen-happy/articleshow/85696919.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala government in limbo over participatory pension||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government is in a catch-22 situation over the report by the committee appointed to revisit the participatory pension scheme (national pension scheme, NPS) implemented for state government employees, submitted four months ago. The government’s lukewarm approach to the report is ostensibly because of the committee’s recommendations that the scheme can be continued, which is against LDF’s pre-election assurance in 2016 that the scheme would be withdrawn if LDF came to power. The Satish Chandra Babu committee was appointed on November 6, 2018, to revisit NPS implemented for employees who joined the service after April 1, 2013, by the previous UDF government. The tenure of the committee, originally appointed for six months, was extended four times and it submitted its report on April 30 this year. Though the government has not publicized the report yet, finance minister K N Balagopal said in the assembly that the committee’s recommendations include continuing the NPS scheme by taking into consideration the future financial position of the government. It recommended that the government’s share should be increased to 14% (presently at 10%), provide death-cum-retirement gratuity (DCRG) to employees under NPS, offer ex-gratia pension to employees retiring without completing 10 years under NPS, and provide option to continue in the statutory pension scheme for employees who received their appointment order prior to April 1, 2013, but could join the service only after this date due to administrative reasons. Out of almost 5 lakh state government employees, 1.4 lakh employees are presently under NPS. Even though NPS has been implemented in the state, the government is yet to provide its full benefits to employees under the scheme, citing that providing all benefits would mean that the state government has fully endorsed the scheme. “The state government share is 10% here while Centre increased it to 14%. Also, DCRG is not offered in the state while the Centre offers up to a maximum of Rs 20 lakh. The Centre also offers family pension to the family of those who die in service but it is not provided in the state. In effect, the employees stand to lose either way, as neither has the scheme been scrapped because of financial reasons, nor fully endorsed due to political reasons,” a senior official with the finance department said on conditions of anonymity. Presently, under NPS in the state, 10% of basic and dearness allowances together form the employee share, while a matching share is provided by the state government. About Rs 3,000 crore has been invested in NPS in the state since the scheme’s launch. “Originally, there was an attempt to put the blame on the Centre citing that since it passed Pension Fund Regulatory And Development Authority Act, 2013, the state cannot withdraw the NPS. But the committee has made it clear that the state can take a policy decision on whether to continue with NPS or not. With this the onus is on the state government now,” government sources said. Finance minister K N Balagopal had said in the assembly that the report is “being examined by the government”. As per data available in the assembly, the government spent Rs 70 lakh for the functioning of the committee to revisit NPS, including honorarium for the chairman and members and other expenses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-in-limbo-over-participatory-pension/articleshow/85699081.cms||KP Saikiran

Justice Ravikumar, who had been a judge of the high court since January 2009 and had practised as a lawyer in the high court since late ‘80s, became teary-eyed during his farewell speech when he remembered his late father K Devan, who was a bench clerk at a Changanassery court. “At this moment of happiness, I prostate with the memories of my parents, father late Sri K Devan, who was a bench clerk in judicial first class magistrate court, Changanassery, mother late Smt. Saraswathy and also my late elder sister, Smt. Radhamani, whose blessings from the heavenly abode takes me to this position.” He also remembered that it was former chief justice of India KG Balakrishnan who asked him to shift practice to Ernakulam from Mavelikkara. A full court reference was held at the high court on Friday afternoon to bid farewell to justice Ravikumar. Chief justice S Manikumar, senior judges, lawyers, and high court staff participated in the function. In his speech, justice Ravikumar also reminded young lawyers that there is no shortcut to success and the reason for the success of doyens of the bar is assiduity and hard work. Chief justice S Manikumar noted in his address that justice Ravikumar is the fifth judge of the Kerala high court to be elevated as a judge of the Supreme Court without occupying the position of a chief justice. Advocate general Gopalakrishna Kurup K, while speaking at the function, said justice Ravikumar is the 15th Malayali to adorn the bench of the Supreme Court.

---||Pune||Police seek ammo factory help to crack Metro site bullet mystery||Pune: Work continued at the Pune Metro rail’s Hill View car shed near Vanaz like any other day on Friday, but a general sense of intrigue about the source of firing of the four bullets, recovered on Wednesday from the site, was evident when the TOI visited the spot. Police said there was still no breakthrough in the probe to identify the source of firing. “We will seek assistance from Ammunition Factory Khadki (AFK) experts to establish the identity of firearms used for firing the bullets,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI. Anjay Kumar (24), a welder working in the car shed, had sustained burn marks as one of the bullets grazed him. He was treated at a hospital and discharged later. There wasn’t much discussion about Wednesday’s incident at the car shed site on Thursday, as most workers were seen busy with their tasks. A few others, who had a brief interaction with the TOI, narrated the sequence of incident and how there was panic for quite some time when a bullet lead was first found near the place where Kumar was working. The police later found the rest of the bullet leads from a spot near the power house. “Much of our talk revolved around the source from where the bullets were fired,” said a worker, while a Metro official pointed to the spot where one of the bullets grazed Kumar and was later found nearby. Gupta said, “We are still not sure about the make of the weapon. The AFK experts will be in a position to arrive at a conclusion on what could be the weapon used in the firing incident. They can help us identify the source where the bullets were manufactured. The experts will also help us identify the place from where the bullets were fired.” DCP (zone III) Pournima Gaikwad said, “We have sent queries to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Pune, for information on how far can a bullet travel after it is fired. The report is awaited.” An officer, who is part of the Kothrud police’s investigation team, said, “The rear side of the car shed, which is closer to the ARAI hillock, is protected by a compound wall. Had there been a firing inside the car shed, we would have not only found the leads but also empty rounds.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/police-seek-ammo-factory-help-to-crack-metro-site-bullet-mystery/articleshow/85700572.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Pune||Tech glitches delay website to track conveyance deed||Pune: Technical glitches and poor coordination among three departments have delayed the launch of the website to track conveyance deed applications in the state. Commissioner of cooperation and registrar of cooperative societies Anil Kawade is confident that the website would go live by mid-September. It was originally supposed to be up and running by March, but technical issues in coordination, linking data obtained from three departments and the second wave of the pandemic affected the process, he said. “We have approached the Maharashtra IT department and the National Informatics Centre to help collate data from the registration, revenue and cooperation departments,” he told TOI. The registration department will provide stamp duty-related details, while the revenue department will ensure that the name of the housing society is correct on the record of rights. The data synchronization is being addressed by the Maharashtra IT department. “We should it ready after September 15,” Kawade added. The aim is to track the applications submitted to the deputy district registrar and give the societies concerned an idea about the progress of their application. This will streamline the entire system, Kawade said. With over 72,341 housing societies not having their conveyance deed, the website was aimed at helping them register their proposals, with the three departments coordinating in the process. Kawade said the process would be like tracking a passport application. “The website will track an application once it is put before the deputy district registrar and give the society an idea about its status,” Kawade said. On January 1, the department initiated a special drive to help housing societies obtain conveyance deed or even move for deemed conveyance. The conveyance (or sale) deed is required to be executed on non-judicial stamp paper. Then, it needs to be registered at the registrar’s office. After that, the transfer of the property moves into the public domain. Stamp duty and registration fee is obtained by the government as revenue. When this happens, the process of conveyance deed is complete. Suhas Patwardhan, vice-president of Maharashtra Housing Federation, said they have been asking for this for long. ““The website would make it easy for housing societies that do not have their conveyance deed. The process would be simple and transparent,” he said. Meanwhile, the state cooperation department said it is planning to launch an online grievance redressal system for petty complaints, Kawade said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/tech-glitches-delay-website-to-track-conveyance-deed/articleshow/85700532.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The victim, Vikas Dinkar of Phugewadi, was going to Hinjewadi to pick up his wife from a lab, where she works as a technician. “When I reached New Sangvi around 8.30pm, I noticed two youths coming from the opposite side. They were not riding the bike properly. To avoid colliding with it, I applied brakes and stopped. But the duo crashed into my motorcycle and I fell,” Dinkar told TOI. Dinkar said he was in a hurry and so he apologised to them instead of arguing. “One of them then picked up a cement block and threw it at me. It hit me on my face. I fell and started bleeding,” Dinkar said. When he regained consciousness, he saw a few more youths with the duo.

Parents’ consent will be mandatory. The decision was taken at a meeting presided over by CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the evening. According to sources, the school education department plans to reopen primary classes once a week from mid-September. While schools cheered the decision, parents vehemently opposed it, pointing out that schools are being reopened when the government is asking people to be cautious of the third wave and a vaccine for children is still awaited. The reopening guidelines issued by the government on Friday night make it mandatory for all teachers and other school staff to have taken at least one vaccine dose by September 1. If anyone hasn’t been vaccinated, it’s the school’s responsibility to ensure they do take a shot before reopening day, the order says. Those unvaccinated cannot be allowed to enter the campus. School principals have been allowed to fix schedules on their own, according to student strength and availability of rooms, but the maximum strength in any class cannot exceed 50%, the order says.

---||Nagpur||Don’t expect immediate FIR in embezzlement cases, says Bombay high court||NAGPUR: Rejecting the anticipatory bail pleas of two accused, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court ruled that misappropriation cases can’t be equated with bodily harm ones, where FIRs are lodged immediately. Booked for misappropriation of Rs28 lakh, the duo had sought bail on the contention that the complainant had delayed lodging an FIR. Justice Vinay Joshi held, “It is a case of misappropriation and manipulation of accounts. Considering the nature of offence, it cannot be treated at par with bodily offence cases to expect immediate lodging of FIR. As and when the owner verified accounts, he came to know about the discrepancies and then he lodged the report. At this prima facie stage, delay cannot be considered as a valid ground in their favour.” Claiming that the accused were falsely implicated, petitioners Arvind Shukla and Surendra Kinekar prayed for pre-arrest protection from the crime registered at Bhandara police station under Section 406 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. While Shukla was working as a cashier at New Era Motors run by complainant Hussain in Bhandara, Kinekar was his assistant and used to look after the propriety firm’s accounts. They were entrusted with the job to maintain accounts, cash and ledger books, and to look after the day-to-day transactions. The accused argued that besides inadequate material, there was considerable delay in lodging FIR as the alleged fraud took place between October 2019 and February this year, but the complaint was filed in April. Their applications were strongly opposed by additional public prosecutors AM Deshpande and Neeraj Jawade, contending that both accused had manipulated accounts and misappropriated the huge sum of Rs28.43 lakh for their own benefit in a systematic manner. They also manipulated the computer password and made false entries into the account books, which requires thorough investigation, the lawyers argued. “While the complainant was verifying the balance sheet, he came across some discrepancies in the amounts received from customers. Upon his detailed probing, it was found that there has been manipulation in 49 cases of different customers,” they added. Opposing the petitioner’s arguments on delay, the prosecutors added that the complainant had filed a police report on April 20 and June 28, but their cognizance was not taken. “The misappropriated amount is yet to be recovered. The police have to verify the handwriting on cash book and receipts issued to customers. It is necessary to carry out an investigation with respect to all the accounts and modus adopted by the petitioners. With regard to these facts, it is not a fit case to exercise judicial discretion,” justice Joshi said before dismissing the petitions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/dont-expect-immediate-fir-in-embezzlement-cases-hc/articleshow/85699296.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The facility, which has started out with a small R&D team of 10 people with expertise in drug discovery, medicinal chemistry and aroma chemicals, will work on building a portfolio of new molecules that are going off-patent over the coming 5 to 10 years in a bid to cater to the need for affordable healthcare. The company said the initial focus will be on developing molecules with their intermediates for pharma APIs and after getting drug licence will also work on finished API doses. Pointing out that Covid-19 has impacted global supply chains, especially in the pharma sector that is hugely dependent on APIs from China, Tetra Med Sciences director Sunita Eyunni said molecule development and formulation of drugs has became a huge challenge not just in India but globally as well. “As cost, quality and timely deliveries are critical components of the supply chain, the Covid-19 impact has jeopardized the production schedule of pharma firms. Our new R&D center is an important step in our commitment to the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” she said. Tetra Med Sciences founder Lathaa Subramanian said: “Recognising the impact of API supply chain shortage and cost competency of pharma sector and encouraged by government support to women entrepreneurs, the company decided to work in new molecules development, starting with intermediates for APIs, at Hyderabad as it has a huge scientific talent pool, knowledge base and competitive manpower advantage.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tetra-med-sciences-sets-up-rd-centre-in-hyd-to-develop-new-molecules-for-pharma-apis/articleshow/85699260.cms||---
---||Mumbai||PMLA court allows PNB’s plea for release of NiMo properties||MUMBAI: A special PMLA court on Friday allowed Punjab National Bank’s (PNB) plea seeking release and restoration of certain properties attached by Enforcement Directorate (ED) during investigations in a money-laundering case involving fugitive businessman, Nirav Modi. The properties are worth around Rs 540 crore. This is the second such order in a month. Earlier, properties worth Rs 440 crore were ordered to be released. Modi and several others are accused in the Rs 13,000-crore fraud case. Last month, PNB had sought the properties to be released to the liquidator of Modi-owned Firestar Diamond International Pvt Ltd (FDIPL), the resolution professional of Firestar International Ltd and recovery officer. “The property mentioned in Schedule A to the application... shall be released in favour of PNB to the recovery officer, Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Mumbai, holding a recovery certificate, after obtaining an undertaking to be filed in court to return or restore it as per this court’s direction as and when directed, or the value thereof, as the case may be,” the court said on Friday. It also said that while releasing the property, an appropriate inventory, memo and list should be drawn before handing it over to the authority. “After release of property from attachment by prosecution, ED, it shall be dealt with strictly in a manner provided by law...” the court said. Modi is held in a UK prison and proceedings on his extradition are underway. At the time court had ordered confiscation of Modi’s properties under the Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) Act, PNB had sought exemption of the mortgaged, hypothecated, and guarantors’ properties where it and the consortium claimed to have a bona fide and legitimate legal interest. PNB had argued that it had obtained a decree for recovery from DRT of over Rs 7,000 crore in respect of default by Modi’s companies and firms. In June 2020, in an order of confiscation under FEO Act, the court exempted from the list properties secured to PNB and a consortium of banks through mortgage, hypothecation or personal guarantee. Under the Act, once an accused is declared an FEO, his/her properties can be confiscated directly to the central government. ED had in 2018 sought confiscation of properties of Modi and he was declared an FEO in December 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-pmla-court-allows-pnbs-plea-for-release-of-nimo-properties/articleshow/85703096.cms||---

The unit is ensuring sustainable solutions for complete utilization for it. The fly ash generated at the NTPC is ideal for manufacturing cement, concrete, concrete products, bricks and tiles, claimed the general manager (ash handling) K Gopala Krishna. According to him, in order to promote the use of fly ash bricks in building construction, NTPC Singrauli has set up five fly ash brick manufacturing plants. Besides, NTPC Singrauli is also supplying 9.75 lakh metric tons (LMT) pond ash for free to National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) National Highway Road Project NH-7 (Rewa-Varanasi). It will also supply free two lakh cubic meters (LCM) pond ash to NHAI road project -bypass to Varanasi’. Fly ash is being supplied to brick manufacturers at different locations for free of cost in a radius of 100 km. Indian Railways’ sprawling network is leveraged to transport fly ash in an economical and environment-friendly manner. These initiatives are in line to achieve 100% utilization of fly ash at the power station and therefore by effectively adapting environment friendly power generation methods for sustainable growth, said Krishna. According to records, India produces an estimated 226 million tons of fly ash annually, out of which about 188 million is being utilized. This results in close to 40 million tons of fly ash being stored in ash dykes or simply dumped in open area, without proper guidelines, posing a threat to the environment. Utilization of fly ash has attained huge importance as its production has been consistently increasing with escalating demand of power. Although for the progress of the environment, renewable energy is gaining strong relevance, still coal-based generation forms the backbone for grid stability in the Indian context and ash is an inherent part of the coal. The fly ash produced by thermal power stations is excellent and contains low unburnt carbon and has high pozzolanic activity conforming to the relevant Indian standards. “Since it is ideal for manufacturing cement, concrete, concrete products, cellular concrete products, bricks, blocks and tile, instead of using fertile topsoil, we need to push the use of ash in all such products,” said Krishna. Thermal power plants across India generate large quantities of fly ash with coal produced in India generating up to 30 to 45% ash when fired in boilers. Fly ash is presently utilised in the manufacturing of Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) (25%), fly ash bricks (10%) and reclamation of low-lying areas (15%). Fly Ash is also being used for road construction (10%) and Ash dyke construction (10%). “Ash is not an environmental hazard but one of the few saviours of mother Earth. It is high time for considering ash as a power plant byproduct instead of a waste material needing disposal.,” he said, adding that the utilization of ash products should be made mandatory for PWD, NHAI, cement industries. These sectors should also bear the transportation costs. Thermal power plants should facilitate the lifting of ash from their power plants. It will not only boost up ash utilization but also spare electricity consumers from having to shell out money for these additional costs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/fly-ash-ideal-for-manufacturing-cement-concrete-bricks-and-tiles/articleshow/85701632.cms||---

A heart-rending video of this went viral, eventually leading to their rescue. The other children are five, three and two years old. They were left to fend for themselves as their parents died due to the Covid recently. A video of them begging for food, the eldest sister carrying the infant in her arms, was shared widely on social media. chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan saw the video and ordered the administration to rescue them. All five are now at a ‘Sishu Grih’, shelter for children. District collector Dr Satish Kumar S said he came to know about the children two days ago. “We took immediate action. The child welfare committee approached them and shifted them to sishu griha after taking consent of their grandfather. We will take care of them and will do the needful in compliance with juvenile justice laws,” he told TOI. The children hail from Uttar Pradesh, the collector said. Their aunt kept them with her for a while in UP but then left them with their grandfather in Bhind district. “Their grandfather is too old to earn for himself. We had to take his consent to shift these children to rehab. Initially, he was not ready. We had to counsel him,” said the collector. Administrative officers have been asked to prepare their documents. Lahar MLA Govind Singh too has assured all support to the children. The government may give these children for adoption, as per the rules, if their relatives give consent, said sources. The pandemic has orphaned over 300 children in Madhya Pradesh. The state government has created a database to support them under a scheme announced by CM Chouhan. MP was one of the first states to start identification of children orphaned by the pandemic after which the Mukhya Mantri Bal Kalyan Yojana was announced. Under this scheme, children who have lost both their parents will be provided a sustenance allowance of Rs 5,000 per month till they attain the age of 21. If the child pursues studies beyond the age of 21, the allowance would be provided till the age of 24. The legal guardian of such children will be identified according to the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act. Even those children being taken care of by the government in childcare institutions will be eligible for the benefits after they turn 18. The two-child norm has no bearing on the scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/orphaned-by-covid-5-siblings-found-begging-in-mp-rescued/articleshow/85699273.cms||---

This despite the fact that the second day of vaccination in the mega drive was mainly for administering the second jab to eligible persons with the provision that even those who come to vaccination centres for the first jab will also be vaccinated. But, it so happened that persons coming for the first jab far exceeded those turning up to get the second dose, thereby not allowing the state to reduce the increasing gap between population with one dose of vaccine and people with both the doses. The figures of vaccination across the state till 7.30 pm on the second day of vaccination shows that Guna, which topped the vaccination table with 330% vaccination of the target, vaccinated 32,961 persons as against the target of 10,000, but 24,867 of them had got the first jab and 8,068, the second jab. The percentage of second dose coverage on the day was 64% as against the 330% overall coverage achieved that day. Tikamgarh, which stands second in the tally with 41,587doses administered as against the target of 15,000 also administered the first dose to 35,219 persons as against 6,668 persons, who were given the second dose. Thus, 279 % of the target was achieved but the emphasis on second dose coverage was missed here, too. It’s not the situation in the two districts who are on the top of the table but everywhere except for a few places like Bhopal and Indore, where emphasis on second dose coverage on the second day of the mega drive can be traced in the vaccination data., For example, in Bhopal 51,949 persons were administered the vaccine as against the target of 23,000 and 29,190 of them were given the second jab and 22,759 got the first dose. Thus, Bhopal not only achieved 226% of the vaccination but true to the objective of second day vaccination, it vaccinated more people who were eligible for the second dose but had not received the second jab. In fact, Bhopal would have easily surpassed the target of vaccination on the second day by administering the second dose of vaccines only. Similarly, Indore had a target of 62,000 vaccines on the second day and against that, 89,664 persons were vaccinated — 57,178 of them got the second dose and 32,486, the first dose. Ujjain, too, vaccinated more people with the second dose than the one on the second day of vaccination. Ujjain, which vaccinated 39,964 persons on the day, gave the second jab to 24,519 as against 15,455, who got the first jab. At most of the other places, the persons given the second jab are not even half of those who got the first jab though emphasis on the second day of mega vaccination drive was to bring people to the vaccination centres, who after taking the first dose of vaccine, are not turning up for the second dose, which completes the vaccination process against the deadly Coronavirus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-fails-to-achieve-2nd-dose-target-in-mega-vax-drive/articleshow/85699302.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

He was discharged with oxygen dependency in which he needed to take occasional breaths from the oxygen cylinder at home. Dr Nehal Shah, principal of SBB College of Physiotherapy, said that several patients like Thakkar have not fully recovered from the effects of Covid. “Majority of the patients that take treatment at our facility were infected during the second wave. Breathlessness and fatigue are two major complaints for the patients,” she said. Dr Shah along with Dr Anjali Bhise and Dr K M Annamalai from the city are among the authors from across the country that prepared national guidelines for physiotherapy professionals for the Indian Association of Physiotherapists to manage recovered Covid patients. The guidelines stress on factors such as improving lung capacity, improving muscle strength and body coordination. “Several patients also complain of constipation due to reduced physical activity. We recommend light exercises to almost all patients who have got recovered from the pandemic to ensure that their body functions are restored to normal,” said Dr Annamalai, chief physiotherapist with Apollo Hospital. “Fatigue is primarily due to low oxygen supply to the muscles, due to which the patient feels tired. But with sustained efforts, we have seen good results, especially in cases of high oxygen dependency.” The experts stressed on uniform procedures to be followed by physiotherapy professionals for desired results.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/physiotherapy-module-for-covid-patients/articleshow/85699303.cms||Parth Shastri

Observing that “it has been settled for a very long time, every member is bound by the decision taken by the requisite majority of the society,” Justice Gautam Patel, in an August 24 order, permitted a modification by the majority members of a housing society to a 2018 consent terms over redevelopment of Ganpati Niwas in Bangur Nagar, Goregaon (W). The HC allowed the terms to be changed to enable the builder to sell free-sale and commercial components. The HC also deleted a requirement for the builder to furnish an unconditional bank guarantee of Rs 15 crore in favour of the housing society before the flat owners vacate the premises as the civic authority issued permission for construction on August 16. The building was constru-cted in 1978. There are 91 me-mbers, of which 27 were the dissenting minority. The builder had entered into an agreement with society in 2013. The new building is a proposed 28-storey tower, including two podium floors, said advocate Ameet Mehta, who represented the majority members of the society. Senior counsel Mukesh Vashi, appearing for the developer, sought the amendment to the consent term order of February 2018. The minority members, for whom advocate Sanjeev Singh appeared, had in 2018, approached the HC to question if they can be asked to vacate their flats until the BMC has given all necessary approvals to construct up to 24 floors. In 2018, the HC order had said that the society members peacefully vacate their premises subject to the builder paying them the promised amounts and registering agreements for their permanent new homes. The society, through its chairman, filed an affidavit dated August 12 before the HC. He said the society is agreeable to the modifications suggested by the developer. They referred to the society’s general body resolutions, dated February 28, 2018, and September 18, 2018, approving the building plans submitted by the builder and for a modification of the February 20, 2018, order. The HC noted that the majority members have approved the general body resolutions for modification. It thus modified its order to hold that the builder is permitted to create third-party rights over proposed basement, ground floor and first floor of commercial premises and residential premises for free sale component to avail finance to carry out the redevelopment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dissenting-members-identity-in-redevpt-project-not-independent-from-society-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/85699378.cms||Swati Deshpande

The family, comprising a mother and her teenage daughter and son, is said to have travelled from Kollam to Ernakulam and back spending a night in the safety of the train in fear of the goons who were allegedly harassing them. Justice Devan Ramachandran, who is sitting in the police-protection jurisdiction, issued the order after noticing news reports about the incident. The court has also directed government pleader EC Bineesh to obtain a detailed report on the issue from the jurisdictional police officers, including the district police chief of Kollam. Further, the court directed the registry to place the matter along with the news reports before the chief justice for considering whether a suo motu case can be registered on the issue. Along with seeking a report from police, the court directed, “Pending the afore report, I direct the police officers concerned to ensure the lives of the family are well protected, however, without causing any harassment or prejudice to any other person, including those against whom complaints may have been made. In other words, this court only requires the lives of the family to be adequately protected, without any other person being subjected to any proceedings, until the afore directed report is obtained.” Shelter arranged Kerala women’s commission member Shahida Kamaal met the mother, Manju, and her children at the PWD rest house in Kollam on Friday and arranged temporary shelter for them at Gandhi Bhavan, Pathanapuram. Shahida said that legal action would be initiated against those who harassed the family. Meanwhile, support is pouring in from all corners to the family. The authorities of Farooq College, Kozhikode, have offered to take care of the education of Manju’s daughter, who has passed Plus Two. MGM Group of Education, Kottarakkara, has also offered her assistance to continue education.

He said that many startups in Kerala have collapsed during the pandemic after they failed to meet the expenses of building rent, electricity, internet and security cleaning charges. “We hope that when they work in a startup ecosystem, it will give them an opportunity to share jobs and technology,” he said. As of now, there are 72 startups operating in Technolodges and Technocity Kalamassery. Startups proposing to join the initiative have options for cabins of various sizes with basic facilities for mininum four employees. “The advantage is the built-in infrastructure and low rentals when compared to general rates,” said Nedumkeriyil.

---||Bhopal||Gas victims turned away by Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre, move Supreme Court panel||BHOPAL: NGOs working with the survivors of Bhopal gas disaster have written to chairman of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee, Justice V K Agrawal, drawing his attention towards problems faced by the gas victims in registration at Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre (BMHRC) for treatment particularly if they don’t have a smart card. The hospital refuses to register gas victim patients if there is some anomaly or typo mistake in the court order for compensation and their name or some other details like father’s name or husband’s name in the court order doesn’t tally with the name in their Aadhaar card or voter I-card. Stating that it has become a routine for the registration department to deny admission to extremely sick gas victims visiting the hospital, representative for four NGOs working among the gas victims, Rachna Dhingra said it happens when the gas victim visiting BMHRC doesn’t have a smart card and brings the copies of their final order for the purpose of identification. Citing an example, she said that a gas victim Rehana visited the hospital on August 23, due to chest pain. Since she doesn’t have a smart card, she had brought copies of the compensation order. Since she was not married at the time when the order was passed, it carried her father’s name and not husband. But, in her Aadhaar card, which was made after she got married, her husband’s name was registered instead of her father. The hospital refused to admit her in the hospital until she proved that she was the same Rehana, who had received the gas compensation. This has happened with Rehana twice in the past as well, Rachna wrote. Talking to TOI, she said that it’s a routine practice at BMHRC and if a Mahira has been misspelled as Mahir or something else in the order copy due to typographic error, which is very common, they are denied free treatment. She further said that it’s absolutely unethical on the part of BMHRC management to refuse admission to a serious gas victim on such a flimsy ground, she said that the apex court had mandated smart card for all gas victims but it was provided to only 3.5 lakh gas victims only..  Besides, to avoid such glitches they can download the list of gas victims compensated by the court from the gas welfare commissioner office but they seem more interested in turning away gas victims, rather than laying down a clear SOP for identification of gas victims, she said. Rehana’s husband said that though they have admitted his wife for treatment but they are still not considering her a gas victim. “They gave us the names of eight documents and asked us to bring any three of them to establish her identity as a gas victim. We have given them all the documents that we could lay our hands on. They have now said that they would let us know on Monday whether she can be treated free of cost as a gas victim or not.” Member of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee, Purnendu Shukla, said that the committee has received the complaint from the NGOs as well as the patient Rehana.The hospital management has been asked to respond. He admitted that complaints of this nature from gas victims have been common since the inception of BMHRC and yet the hospital management has not been able to address the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/gas-victims-turned-away-by-by-bmhrc-move-sc-panel/articleshow/85699353.cms||---

Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index was 134 in the ‘moderate’ category on Friday. Track the pollution level in your citySystem of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said on Thursday that the contribution of coarser particles in PM10 increased to around 65% as compared to the long-time normal of 50%. Gufran Beig, founder project director, SAFAR, said, “In the monsoon period, PM2.5, which are fine particles, mostly remain high. However, in August, it was found that PM10 was the main pollutant on most of the days, which is not common.” He added the reason behind higher concentration of PM10 could be transportation of dust from arid region to Delhi and construction activity happening in and around the capital. Central Pollution Control Board’s data shows that PM10 remained the major pollutant from August 23 to August 27. The city has not recorded any intense rain activity in the past few days. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre For Science and Environment, said, “Due to the washout effect of the rains, overall particulate pollution is normally lower during monsoon. However, the level of coarse particles can vary, especially during short dry spells when dust can become the lead pollutant. Persistent elevation and increase in its ratio can also indicate some dust event in the region.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/pm10-remains-lead-pollutant-in-delhis-air-this-month/articleshow/85699433.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Congress has made the appointments for state-level executive committee, which will steer the party in the local polls and prepare for the Lok Sabha polls in 2024. The Congress has not been able to completely recover from its decimation since 2014 Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha polls. Though some lost grounds, especially in Kolhapur district, have been regained by the party in the last seven years. Among the key appointments is Vishal Patil from Sangli, grandson of former chief minister Vasantdada Patil. Ramhari Rupanvar, Congress MLC from Solapur, has been inducted as state vice-president of the party. Gurubal Mali, a political observer, said, “The organisational post will help Vishal Patil to build the party again. In Sangli district, Vikramsimha Sawant, a close relative of minister Vishwajeet Kadam, has been made the district president. It shows the party high command has kept the balance between Patil and Kadam families. Most importantly, it has chosen the younger generation.” Rupanvar’s selection has shown that the loyalists will continue to be treated better. Rupanvar was among the few who openly told party president Sonia Gandhi that Congress will not win on more than two seats in 2014 Lok Sabha election. In Solapur district, Dhawalsinha Mohite-Patil has been made the district president of the party. Though a long time loyalist, the younger Mohite-Patil’s name was finalised in consultation with senior party leader Sushilkumar Shinde. In Satara district, former CM and sitting MLA of Karad Prithviraj Chavan has been made member of disciplinary action committee. Udaysingh Undalkar-Patil, son of Vilaskaka Undalkar-Patil, has been made general secretary.

The order was issued by a division bench of Justice Devan Ramachandran and Justice Kauser Edappagath while considering a review petition on the issue of Covid-19 treatment rates in private hospitals. In the order, the court said it would be impossible to reign in the Covid-19 pandemic and other related diseases unless the healthcare sector is allowed to function peacefully and with the autonomy that it requires. “The doctors, nurses and other health care providers are certainly the most vital and valuable in the health care system, particularly the women who courageously discharge their duties and sometimes act even beyond the call of their duty. We are, therefore, without doubt that the government and other stakeholders, including the district collectors and the district superintendents of police must now ensure that such events and instances do not happen in future and that quick and swift action is taken if any such report is made,” the order stated. An order was issued by the court after Indian Medical Association (IMA) informed the court that sporadic instances of attacks are happening and they have made doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers extremely vulnerable, particularly when emergency rooms are often manned by women during nights. If this situation continues, it might become difficult for the health sector to function properly, the court was told.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/hc-directs-govt-to-act-swiftly/articleshow/85699478.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cyber cops help Vakola shopowner retrieve Rs 25 lakh he ‘lost’ in online deal||MUMBAI: Though the Maharashtra government is yet to initiate a helpline-cum-call centre to freeze or track the flow of money stolen digitally, the Vakola police cyber team recently managed to stop a suspected ‘fraud’ of Rs24.7 lakh. The case involved a Santacruz shopowner who deals in mobiles and had transferred the money to an an agency in Gwalior whose owner claimed he sold mobile at a discounted rate. The complainant, Shah Alam Ansari (26), made a payment of Rs 24.7 lakh through RTGS and placed an order for 200 high-end mobiles. However, right after transferring the money, the Gwalior resident stopped receiving Ansari’s calls. Suspecting a fraud, Ansari approached the police the very next day on August 20. Ansari applauded the police for its swift action that helped him get back Rs 24.7 lakh on August 25. Assistant commissioner of police (Vakola division) Avinash Dharmadhikari said the team comprising Vakola senior inspector Sunaina Nate, sub-inspectors Vijay Thosar, Mukesh Patil and Ankita Warke immediately swung into action. They got in touch with the bank’s nodal officer in Gwalior to get the beneficiary’s account deatils and froze his account. However, no case has been registered against the Gwalior resident who, on realising that his account was frozen, claimed that his intention was not to dupe Ansari, and he was not reachable on his mobile as he was inside a temple for six hours. He also handed over a cheque for the amount that was credited into his account. Cyber lawyer Dr Prashant Mali said, “The biggest losers in online frauds or cyber frauds are people from Mumbai and Maharashtra. But we (Maharashtra government) are yet to get helpline number 155-260 activated.” More than 58,000 complaints of online banking frauds have been filed with the Maharashtra State Cyber Cell in the last 12 months. Of this, over 14,000 complaints are from Mumbai alone. The amount involved runs into several crores. Yet, barely 600 cases have resulted in FIRs. Many applications have been turned into non-cognizable offences that do not show up in crime statistics and are not probed unless a court order pushes for it. Despite being among the worst-hit by cybercrime, Maharashtra has underplayed the problem and shown no urgency in teaming up with the Centre to institute a helpline-cum-call centre The Union home ministry and the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre have already launched helpline number ‘155260’ in seven states and Union territories. It allows a victim of a fraud to register an instant complaint and have information escalated to financial intermediaries involved in the transaction. This has resulted in Delhi and Rajasthan police recovering Rs 1.13 crore since the helpline opened on April 1. Maharashtra’s cyber police, on the other hand, has set no deadlines to implement the plan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cyber-cops-help-vakola-shopowner-retrieve-rs-25l-he-lost-in-online-deal/articleshow/85703123.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

All workers and employees can avail the facility for free during the drive, which is being organised with the coordinated effort of DSIIDC, district administration and logistic support from Jhilmil Entrepreneurs Welfare Group. “The need for this vaccination camp was felt because most of the workers in these industrial areas are migrant workers and they find it difficult to follow the procedure for getting the jab. Besides, they have misconceptions about the vaccine and its side effects. It is estimated that there are few lakh migrant workers in Delhi and unless all of them are vaccinated, the risk of Covid-19 in Delhi will remain,” said Vivek Gupta, coordinator of the welfare group. “The initiative taken by DSIIDC is fully complemented by the district magistrate’s office.

At a crucial meeting of top BJP leaders, ministers and heads of various units, convened at the party state headquarters on Friday, the ministers were instructed to undertake tour of districts under their charge two days a week and respond boldly to the anti-BJP propaganda allegedly spread by the opposition parties. The meeting chaired by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and party’s national joint general secretary Shiv Prakash, also briefed the workers on government steps taken to ensure 27% reservation to the OBCs and monitoring of welfare schemes launched for the SCs and STs. “The party office-bearers should set their goals and workers should act as a bridge between the organisation and the government. We will make Madhya Pradesh a model state with the perfect coordination between the organisation and the government," said Chouhan He also advised the workers to select the team on the basis of work and keeping in mind various sections, castes and sub-castes. "Not only Congress, but many other parties, social organisations and people are trying to break the country and society, interfering with our ideology and spreading propaganda. We have to plan a strategy to make their attempts futile," said CM. BJP national joint general secretary, Shiv Prakash is learnt to have instructed the ministers to compulsorily visit and stay in districts of their charge, for at least two days a week. He also asked the leaders to convey a message to the public that 27% reservation is applicable for OBC communities in the state and the government will try its best to pursue the case in the High Court. He said ministers should dedicate time to the workers to discuss local issues, collect feedback and contain the discontentment, if any. The meeting also holds significance as it is for the first time that the party has convened a joint discussion after appointments in districts, various fronts and cells. A roadmap of the organisational programmes was also discussed. BJP state president, Vishnu Dutt Sharma said, "We discussed a strategy to expand the work of the government and the organisation with coordination of the workers. We have also decided to celebrate the birth centenary of the party's founder member and ideologue late Kushabhau Thakre on August 30.” BJP is eyeing to win the two assembly seats held by Congress, in Prithvipur and Jobat and to retain the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat apart from Raigaon assembly seat in the upcoming by-elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bjp-tells-mins-to-visit-dists-with-obc-quota-message-twice-a-wk/articleshow/85699508.cms||---
---||Delhi||Govt goes to HC against LG order on prosecutors picked by Delhi Police||NEW DELHI: The AAP government on Friday moved Delhi High Court challenging the lieutenant governor’s decision to appoint lawyers recommended by police as special public prosecutors (SPP) in some cases, including those related to the Republic Day violence during the farmer’s protests and the northeast Delhi riots. The government argued that such appointments would not be in the interest of “fair trial”. The plea also asked why the LG referred the issue to the President of India when the “appointment of SPPs” was a routine matter. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the LG and the Centre to file response before October 21 as well as an application seeking stay on the decision. The AAP government said these SPPs had been chosen by Delhi Police, giving rise to a conflict of interest since the prosecution should be independent from police. “The irony is that SPPs appointed by us are independent persons. You can’t have SPPs who are part of the investigating arm, that is, Delhi Police... In Devangana Kalita’s case, the court has already judicially criticised the shoddy police conduct,” senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Delhi government, argued. The petition has challenged the July 23 order of the LG, stating the SPPs were taking charge of the matters by displacing the regular public prosecutors and urged the court to intervene. Delhi government has also challenged the order by which the LG has invoked the proviso to Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution to refer to the President the SPP appointments. The decision of the President is pending. The petition has contested the July 26 notification appointing the SPPs to conduct the cases and the Centre’s August 4 order endorsing the LG’s view and approving the appointments. “On the issue which certainly cannot fit the description of an exceptional situation to protect national interest... the LG is referring to the President. Your Lordships cannot allow the escape route of the provisio... it affects federalism,” Singhvi submitted. He claimed that the LG had been routinely interfering in the appointment of SPPs and undermining the elected government. Repeated invocation of the reference power is wrong, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-goes-to-hc-against-lg-order-on-prosecutors-picked-by-delhi-police/articleshow/85699593.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Vegetable prices soar after July flood fury in Kolhapur city||Kolhapur: A month after the Panchganga river swelled and submerged many parts of Kolhapur, its impact is still being felt. The combined effect of the damage to the crop and high demand during the month of Sharvan has sent vegetable prices soaring. Vegetable vendors said that while the prices of tomatoes have fallen to as low as Rs 2 and Rs 4 a kilo in many parts of the state, they are still selling at Rs 15 a kilo in Kolhapur city markets. At the same time, Brinjal is selling at Rs 80 a kg, compared to Rs 60 a kg last month. The prices of all vegetables have gone up by Rs 15-20 a kilo on an average. Capsicum is selling at Rs 20, lady’s finger at Rs 40, cluster beans at Rs 60, potato at Rs 30 and green peas at Rs 100 a kilo in the retail market. Manisha Jadhav, a homemaker at Laxmipuri vegetable market, said that apart from tomatoes, all other vegetable are either selling at the same rate or on a higher side. “As the shravan month is ongoing, most people prefer to eat vegetarian food and there is a lot of demand for vegetables. This rise in prices has severely affected the home budgets in these difficult times.” The flood last month damaged vegetable crop on an estimated 472 hectares, around 60% of which is grown in the Shirol taluka. It is considered the ‘vegetable basket’ of the region but gets severely impacted during flood. Shirol taluka has the highest acreage of land under vegetable cultivation in the district. Farmers here grow the regular, organic and exotic vegetables and sell in the large urban markets. This has resulted in a significant drop in the arrival of vegetables from Shirol and other the local regions, forcing the traders and vendors to rely on getting the supply from adjoining districts and state to meet the high demand. The additional transportation costs and higher buying rates are reflecting in the local markets. Raziya Sheikh, vendor at Shahupuri vegetable market, said that the supply got hit due to floods as the major vegetable producing region of Shirol faced heavy crop damage in the last month. “Every year, in the month of Shravan, the demand for vegetable increases. The increase in demand and low supply has led to a rise in the prices,” he said. A vegetable vendor from Laxmipuri market, Jameer Bagwan, said that the vegetables have been selling at a higher side since the floods. However, the prices have gone up further over the past few days due to the demand. In other parts of the state, the vegetable prices have come down, especially of the tomatoes, due to a glut in the market. Nashik farmers even threw crates of tomatoes on the road outside local markets on Thursday owing to the low rates they were offered in the auction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/vegetable-prices-soar-after-july-flood-fury-in-kolhapur-city/articleshow/85699510.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Former chief minister Kamal Nath demands implementation of increased OBC quota||BHOPAL: Former chief minister and LOP Kamal Nath on Friday demanded that the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government start implementation of increased 27% reservation for OBCs with immediate effect, except for departments where the matter is sub-judice. On Thursday, the advocate general specified that Madhya Pradesh High Court has not restricted the state government from implementing 27% reservation for OBCs. The Madhya Pradesh cabinet of the erstwhile Kamal Nath Congress government on March 8, 2019 increased reservation of OBCs from 14% to 27% through an Ordinance. This took total reservations in the state to 73% (including 10% reservations for economically backward classes), breaking the 50% limit of caste-based reservations. “For the uplift of OBCs, our government had increased reservations from 14% to 27%,” Kamal Nath tweeted on Friday. “Some petitions were filed regarding this in the court, interim order was given on those but there was no restriction in any other places,” he claimed. PCC chief Kamal Nath argued that on the basis of a wrong legal opinion, the BJP government did not implement the increased reservation quota of OBCs in government jobs and educational institutions. “Based on a wrong opinion given on this order, the Shivraj government stopped appointments in all other departments by which the backward classes were continuously being deprived of their rights,” @OfficeOfKNath said. “False claims were being served continuously. We were protesting against that.” Referring to the views of the advocate general, the senior Congress leader said, “Now government has accepted on the basis of an opinion that there is no restriction on the decision made by our government to increase reservations to 27% in the state. Apart from departments connected to the interim order, benefit of increased reservation in government jobs and educational institutions can be given.” The veteran Congress leader not only asked for implementation of the 27% reservation for OBCs with immediate effect but also recommended that the case of OBCs be argued strongly in the courts. “I demand from the Shivraj government that after this view, he should discard the politics of falsehood and misleading facts, and immediately issue a revised order to give the benefit of increased reservation in government appointments and educational institutions. The decision taken by our government in the interest of backward classes should be implemented immediately and strongly support the case of OBCs during the hearing of the petitions,” Nath said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/nath-demands-implementation-of-increased-obc-quota/articleshow/85699552.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Meet to finalise strategy for Oct 2 farmers’ protest held||Bhopal: Nine months after the farmers’ agitation in Delhi, an extensive campaign will be kicked off in the country from October 2, Gandhi Jayanti. The strategy was finalised in Bhopal after a meeting of Rajendra Singh and PV Rajagopal, chief of the Ekata Parishad. Rajendra Singh later said, “After nine months a new baby — Bharat Punarnirman abhiyan — is born to support the farmers." Singh and Rajgopal held day-long meeting along with other activists in Bhopal on Thursday to finalise strategy for the October 2 agitation. Singh, known as waterman of India for his innovative works on water conservation, told TOI, “A meeting of farmers from 23 states held in Chennai on August 22, has already taken a decision to start this campaign, which will last till November 26 when it will culminate in Delhi.” The farmers issue along with those related to the conservation of water would be raised all across the countrywide campaign in the form of rallies and yatras. August 26 marks nine months of the farmers’ agitation when they started protest at a Delhi border in December last year. Demanding scrapping of the three ‘contentious’ farm laws, more and more farmers joined the andolan at more Delhi borders. Now, to further strengthen the agitation, according to Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), farmers from southern India have been arriving at the protest sites on Delhi borders. “More farmers from distant locations are joining the protest sites. Hundreds of farmers from Tamil Nadu reached the Singhu border. A contingent of farmers from Karnataka also addressed the gathering at Ghazipur border,” the SKM said. “Now farmers’ agitation will start from the capital cities of all the states the way it started from Punjab 9 months ago. It will go around across and highlight the issue,” Rajendra Singh said. The three controversial laws that the farmers have been demanding to be repealed, will do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of corporate, the SKM has maintained. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/meet-to-finalise-strategy-for-oct-2-farmers-protest-held/articleshow/85699595.cms||---

This is the 13th such inspection conducted by various departments at the garment maker in the recent past. “Some people are trying to shut down Kitex, which currently employs 15,000 people. The paradox is that the industries minister had repeatedly stated that there will be no continuous or surprise inspections in factories and that a centralized system will be set up for the same. Is this the so-called single-window business-friendly system?” asked chairman of Kitex group Sabu M Jacob. The inspections on Friday had started in the morning and continued till afternoon, said an official from Kitex Garments. The manufacturer who exports children’s clothing to European and US markets has been facing continuous surprise inspections by various departments over the last three months. As a result, Kitex dropped its plans to invest Rs 3,500 crore in Kerala and chose Telangana as the destination for investments worth Rs 1,000 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/surprise-inspections-continue-at-kitex-garments/articleshow/85699594.cms||---
---||Mumbai||New deans for eleven medical colleges in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: In the biggest ever reshuffle in the medical education department led by senior Congress leader Amit Deshmukh, the state government on Friday appointed deans of 11 government-medical colleges across the state. Three seniormost professors in Grant Medical College and J J group of hospitals too have been shifted. Surgery professor Mukund Tayde will be new dean of the government-run Sindhudurg Medical College, while skin professor Mahendra Kurha will lead Alibaugh Medical College and psychiatry professor Vinayak Kale will be the new dean of BJ Medical College, Pune. Srinivas Shintre of BJ Medical College will be the new dean of Yavatmal Medical College, ENT professor Ashok Nitnaware will lead the Government Medical College, Chandrapur, Bhavana Sonawane will be dean of Indira Gandhi Medical College, Nagpur, Milind Fulpali has been shifted from Nagpur to Jalgaon Government Medical College, Miraj Medical College’s Pradip Dixit moves to Kolhapur Government Medical College. Bhaskar Khaire will be new dean of Ambajogai Medical College, Apurva Pawade is shifted to Gondia and Bhalchandra Murha will be new dean of Osmanabad Government Medical College. According to a medical education department official, these are senior most professors and have been shifted as professors, however, they have been given additional charge. “It is expected that soon, they will be appointed on a regular basis. It was for the first time in recent history of the medical education department that every medical college has a dean,” he said. About J J Hospital dean, the official said, as of now Ranjeet Mankeshwar, who is holding additional charge, will continue as no decision was taken on appointment of a regular dean. “Many senior deans and senior professors are vying for J J dean’s post, but it is unlikely that Mankeshwar will be disturbed in view of his impressive performance. In the wake of the pandemic situation, though J J was not a Covid hospital, it dealt with more professionally for other diseases and procedures. Most VIPs, including the governor, CM, Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and Amit Deshmukh preferred to take anti-covid vaccine at J J due to professional management and confidence in government hospital,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-new-deans-for-eleven-medical-colleges-in-state/articleshow/85703142.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: No interim relief for Hindu Raksha Dal chief in slogan case||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday refused to grant interim protection from arrest to the president of Hindu Raksha Dal, accused of raising communal slogans and inciting the youth to propagate against a particular religion at a rally at Jantar Mantar on August 8. Justice Mukta Gupta, however, issued notice on Bhupinder Tomar’s anticipatory bail application and sought a status report from Delhi Police. “Prima facie, there are all kinds of slogans and speeches being given. Let the status report be given,” the judge said, posting the matter for further hearing on September 13. Tomar’s counsel sought relief, arguing that his client was granted interim protection by the trial court and that he was not the one who was shouting the objectionable slogans. “I want to know where you were (at the time of sloganeering). You were not present at all?..Let me have the complete status report,” the court responded. Earlier this month, a sessions court had dismissed Bhupinder Tomar alias Pinki Chaudhary’s anticipatory bail application, saying, “we are not a Taliban state”. It said that in the past, such incidents had flared communal tension leading to riots and loss to life and property. “We are not Taliban state. Rule of law is the sacrosanct governing principle in our plural and multicultural society. While the whole of India is celebrating ‘azadi ka amrut mahotsav’, there are some minds still chained with intolerant and self-centric beliefs,” the judge had said in the order passed on August 21. The sessions court stated that complicity of the accused in the case was “prima facie” apparent from the available evidence and the accusations against him were serious and severe in nature. The police had opposed the pre-arrest bail application, alleging that the accused used the platform at Jantar Mantar to create communal disharmony. The rally had been organised despite the permission being denied by the competent authority, they stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-interim-relief-for-hindu-raksha-dal-chief-in-slogan-case/articleshow/85699679.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Barkatullah University not game for sport, has just 1 faculty for physical education department||BHOPAL: With only one permanent faculty, Barkatullah University has been running the physical education department for the past several years. Consequently, the National Council of Teachers Education (NCTE) has discontinued post graduate courses (M.PEd). BU’s incharge registrar Ajeet Shrivastava admitted that there are problems. While the state government is trying to improve sports facilities in the state, MP’s one of the oldest universities, Barkatullah University, fails to even save its sports department. BU’s physical education department lost the affiliation to run an important post-graduate course M.Ped. It was also not allowed to run the B.Ped course. However, it was added in the second round of the counselling. A senior faculty of the university told TOI that the university is playing with the future of the students. “There is a need to have 6-8 permanent teachers in the department. However, it has been running with only a teaching faculty Prof Alok Mishra. This is enough to gauge the level of education being imparted in the university,” said the faculty without quoting his name. NCTE recognised the B.PEd and M.Ped course for the university and colleges. A senior teaching faculty without quoting his name said that NCTE was not happy the way BU was running the course. “BU had faced the same problem last year also. Again, the same problem surfaced this year. This is funny that despite knowing everything about the issue nothing was done in this regard,” said the faculty. He even questioned what kind of students BU will get at the end of the counselling. “All the top-quality students went to the colleges affiliated to BU. The university will not get good students. This is not done. BU should think seriously about it,” said another faculty. Even students said that they were at a loss in the absence of any PG course in the university. “I come from a humble background. I can’t pay the heavy fee charged by the private colleges. I went to the university but they told me that they were not allowed to give admission as M.PEd was not given recognition by the NCTE. This is a big loss to the students who wish to pursue a career in this discipline,” said a student Vikas Sharma. When contacted, BU’s incharge registrar, Ajeet Shrivastava accepted that there were problems. “Jo bhee hai sabke saamne hai (Whatever is the issue, it is for everyone to see). We are trying to recruit more,” said Shrivastava.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bu-not-game-for-sport-has-just-1-faculty-for-physical-edu-dept/articleshow/85699641.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Nashik||State govt sets up food processing directorate||Nashik: The state agriculture department has set up a food and agro processing directorate with focus on boosting the sector in Maharashtra. Currently, there are around 16,000 such units across the state. State agriculture secretary Eknath Dawale said the department has set a target of attracting an investment of around Rs 10,000 crore in the next four-five years. The decision of the agriculture department assumes significance as Nashik’s tomato growers have been dumping their produce on the road after the whole price went down. Officials said solution to low prices of agriculture produce lie in adding value to vegetables and fruits being cultivated by the farmers. “While private companies will be encouraged to set up medium and small food processing units, the state government would help such units by providing subsidies for making investments,” Dawale said. Further, it would be the responsibility of the directorate to aggressively market the products that are produced by these units. “The directorate has also identified districts under One District, One Production scheme of the government. We are already in the process of engaging some staff from the agriculture department for functioning of the directorate,” Dawale said. “The directorate will chalk out an action plan to attract private players in food processing, branding and marketing of the products and other related activities,” he added. Sunil Pawar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB), said there has been huge fluctuation in supply of agricultural commodities like onion, tomatoes, potatoes and other produce. “The bumper supply of agricultural produce leads to a crash in prices that causes loss to farmers. Hence, value addition is the only solution for which the state government has set up a separate directorate for food and agro processing,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/state-govt-sets-up-food-processing-directorate/articleshow/85699640.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Goa||While injured, I shut out negativity and only focused on getting better: Naorem||Panaji: Nongdomba Naorem had no doubt that he would end up at FC Goa, sooner or later. The midfielder’s move to FC Goa was officially announced only on Tuesday, the 21-year-old had made up his mind that he would end up here, even as he tried to recover from an ACL injury that kept him out of action for the second part of the season (2020-21). The left-winger was loaned from Kerala Blasters to ATK Mohun Bagan in the January transfer window, and once the injury came to light, there was a tussle between the two clubs. There were plenty of accusations and counter accusations that kept flying around but Naorem remained focused on his rehabilitation. It didn’t take much time for him to convince himself that Goa would be his next destination. “First, I felt really bad because I knew I couldn’t play for the whole season and had to wait at least nine to ten months. But I told myself I cannot keep thinking about it and focus on my rehab and do surgery so that I can play for Goa this season,” Naorem told TOI. The former India U-17 World Cupper was motivated throughout by friends and players, particularly India’s top centre-back Sandesh Jhingan, who himself lost out on a season through an ACL injury before making a strong comeback last year for ATK Mohun Bagan. “I keep thinking about all the positive things and take out all the negativity. In six to seven months, everyday I will keep getting better,” said Naorem, who played three games last season for Kerala Blasters before an injury sidelined him. Naorem has already won the I-League with Mohun Bagan when he was loaned out by Kerala in the 2019-20 season. He brings his winning mentality into Juan Ferrando’s side who are yet to lift the ISL trophy after two final defeats in seven editions. “FC Goa is always in the top-four in every season. I really want to help the club win the ISL. I can assure to give my 100% every time, in every training and in every match. I want to help the club achieve their dream of winning the ISL,” said Naorem. The Manipuri lad has been an admirer of Goa’s attacking style of play that has made them the most successful club with six play-off appearances in seven seasons. He is adapting well to his new team where former India under-17 teammates Amarjit Singh and goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh are making him comfortable. Naorem, though, knows he will face competition for a place in the team. “I have to improve in every way. Not thinking I am good or have talent because I have a lot of competition in my position. Everyday for me is a learning process and I’m trying to improve,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/while-injured-i-shut-out-negativity-and-only-focused-on-getting-better-naorem/articleshow/85724487.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The court was hearing the bail plea of Kannan and Bhavani, who were arrested by the Tallakulam police on July 1. The case of the prosecution is that the trust director G R Shivakumar and his associate Mathershaw had sold a child to the petitioners. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that they have made several applications to hospitals, trusts and orphanages to adopt a child. The members of the NGO entrusted the child to the petitioners and only on their request, they donated money to them and were not aware that it was meant for the child. He further submitted that the petitioners are innocent and they have not committed any offence as alleged by the prosecution. The petitioners have adopted the child believing that all the legal formalities were followed by the NGO. Taking into account the fact that the petitioners have adopted the child by believing that legal procedures were followed, justice B Pugalendhi granted bail and directed them to appear before the police station everyday until further orders.

This time, he issued an unusual diktat asking party workers not to befriend government officers and also not to post photos clicked with them on social media. “Do not make friends with officers. Will you?” he asked, addressing a training session for party workers in Valsad on Friday. Following a lukewarm response, Paatil asked BJP workers to instead click photos with party’s leaders or elected officer bearers and pin these on social media to make the party stronger. The session was held to gear up the party workers prior to the assembly election slated for sometime next year. “Not many have responded. Seems many have friendship (with officers),” the BJP leader quipped tongue-in-cheek, while reiterating his orders and asking if his words were understood “Will you make friendship? And if you have, break it,” he urged. “Do not click photos with government officers. Instead, while visiting government offices click a photo with a worker or an office bearer and upload it stating that you met them for work in your area and was assured that the work will be completed. Post such photos,” Paatil emphasized. “In a party, we all work for the people. If we give importance to our members or the elected leaders, he or she will grow and if they grow, the party too will become strong. Ultimately you will also become strong,” Paatil told the workers. He also instructed party workers not to take their internal complaints to the media or outside but raise complaint in the party about their concerns. The event was also attended by MOS for forest and tribal development, Ramanlal Patkar, K C Patel, Valsad MP besides MLAs Kanu Desai and Bharat Patel. At the event BJP’s page presidents were distributed identity cards and felicitated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/paatil-tells-cadre-not-to-befriend-govt-officers/articleshow/85699720.cms||---

We also discussed the status of PMRY scheme in the district,” Shahnawaz said. Earlier in the day, the industry minister visited the Barauni industrial area and took stock of the progress of the ongoing projects, including a bottling plant of a multinational private beverage company developed on the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) land near Barauni. “A slew of new industrial projects would soon be launched on the BIADA land to restore the image of Begusarai as the industrial hub of the state and also realise the dreams of Bihar’s first chief minister Sri Krishna Sinha, who during his tenure visualized the place as the industrial centre of the eastern India,” Shahnawaz said. He added: “We are also exploring the possibility of setting up electronics and textiles industries in the area. For this purpose, a plot of 200 acres has been earmarked.” Later, the minister interacted with the district unit members of Bihar Industries Association. Begusatai was earlier known as the industrial capital of the state as the first CM had ensured a slew of industries in the area, but the district lost most of its industrial sheen during the 1990s and early 2000s as most industries fell sick and even the once celebrated Barauni industrial area became almost defunct. However, after the Narendra Modi government announced revival of the closed fertilizer plant, setting up of a new petrochemical unit, including expansion of Barauni refinery capacity, besides construction of a six-lane road overbridge over Ganga river, the local industries also seem to have started growing wings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/will-make-begusarai-industrial-hub-again-shahnawaz/articleshow/85698260.cms||---

The EC has stipulated that door-to-door campaigning can be conducted only in groups of five, and while most candidates have already commenced door-to-door campaigning, they are relying ever more extensively on WhatsApp, Telegram and other portals to reach out to voters. Social media managers for all parties are leaving no stone unturned to shore up the profile of their candidates on the internet. From regular updates on candidates’ activities to their vision for the twin cities, these managers are doing all they can to compensate for the lack of physical presence. Social media websites are being flooded with photographs and videos of candidates’ daily activities. President of AAP’s Dharwad district unit Santosh Nargund said that the party workers were asking for residents’ phone numbers so that they could share the party’s manifesto with them. “We have created many WhatsApp groups, through which we are communicating with those whom we cannot reach in person. We are sharing details of AAP government’s achievements in Delhi, and our party’s vision on phone,” said Santosh. Hubballi-Dharwad Mahanagar Zilla Congress party president Altaf Hallur said that the party’s candidates were busy campaigning on the ground, but said that the party’s campaign on social media would get off the ground soon. “Our social media team is collecting data, and our campaign on the internet will soon gather pace,” Hallur said. BJP’s candidate for ward 52 Umesh Dushi said that the saffron party’s social media wing had created various WhatsApp groups, through which people were being intimated about the many achievements of the BJP-led state and central governments. “We are also sharing our vision for the development of the ward. We are working under the leadership of former chief minister Jagadish Shettar and Union minister and Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi,” Dushi said. Nodal officer for model code of conduct for the HDMC polls Gopalkrishna B said that eight teams had been created, each comprising officials from across departments. “They are monitoring the activities of all candidates, and if any party is found to be violating the rules, stringent action will be initiated,” he said. Dharwad deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil said that the safety guidelines and the standard operating procedure (SOP) to be adhered to while campaigning had been communicated to all political parties. “To ensure enforcement of Covid protocol, special teams have been constituted, members of which will keep a close watch on the parties’ activities,” Patil said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/parties-rely-extensively-on-social-media-for-hdmc-poll-campaign/articleshow/85694950.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The operation had started on August 24 and is still continuing. According to a press statement issued by the department, I-T officials found many incriminating documents, loose sheets, and digital evidence indicating the involvement of the group in unaccounted transactions. “Substantial evidence of transactions outside the regular books of accounts, unaccounted cash expenses, cash advances received and interest paid in cash, has been found. Evidence of on-money payments in real estate projects including flats, shops and land deals has also been found. Total unaccounted cash receipts in various projects of approximately Rs 350 crore have been unearthed, along with corroborative evidence. Further, evidence related to land purchase of approximately Rs 154 crore has also been found, of which Rs 144 crore was purportedly paid in cash,” an official said. This group is among Gujarat’s prominent real estate builders and developers and is engaged in construction and land trading business in and around Rajkot. The I-T sleuths had covered more than 40 premises during the search operation including the group’s partners, contractors, key employees and some of its customers. According to officials, the search and seizure operation has resulted in detection of concealment of income in excess of Rs 300 crore spread over various assessment years and this figure is likely to go up. The officials seized unaccounted cash of Rs 6.4 crore and jewellery valued Rs 1.7 crore during search operation from various premises. A promissory note of Rs 4 crore too was seized and 25 bank lockers have been put under prohibitory orders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/unaccounted-cash-receipts-of-rs-350cr-found/articleshow/85699916.cms||---

The incident took place at 6pm on July 12, but came to light on Thursday. Ghataprabha police arrested four persons in this regard, while search is on for another man who is absconding. According to the complaint, when the girl was walking home from a tailoring shop in the evening, about five men, who are neighbours of the victim, started teasing her and asked her to go near them. When the girl refused and resisted, the accused forcefully took her into a sugarcane field and raped her taking turns. They threatened to kill her if she revealed the incident to her family. Following this the girl slipped into depression and was not eating properly. When worried family members asked her the reason, she broke down and narrated the incident to them. However, there was a delay in filing the complaint because family members too feared the consequences. Finally, a complaint was filed on Thursday at the local police station. Immediately police swung into action and arrested four men. They are looking out for the fifth accused, who is absconding.Child protection officer JT Lokesh said that family members of the survivor first approached district child welfare committee on Tuesday. The minor was in a state of shock when she arrived at the CWC and was counselled. On Thursday, CWC passed an order directing police to register a case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/minor-dalit-girl-gang-raped-in-belagavi/articleshow/85694988.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Ludhiana||Congress high command’s peace formula in tatters in Punjab||JALANDHAR: The peace formula worked out by the Congress central leadership over a month back has failed and the crisis in Punjab unit is blowing up once again with more bitterness. Things seem to be reaching a point of no return with a few swift happenings in the party’s state unit. Incidentally, it was exactly two years back, in the first week of August 2019, when chief minister Amarinder Singh had faced piercing questions from MLAs during Congress Legislature Party meeting. It was for the first time that unlike their earlier complete deference to the CM, MLAs were questioning him about results on important issues. Then in March 2020, he faced questions from his party MLAs even on the floor of the state legislative assembly. While party’s central leadership expected Capt Amarinder and state Congress president Navjot Sidhu to co-exist at the helm, despite latter raising serious questions about the CM’s working and Amarinder’s strong disliking for him, happenings of the last three days have precipitated to a level where these appear irreversible. The happenings of Thursday and Friday have made it clear that battle lines have been drawn for the final showdown. It is anybody’s guess if some out of the box formula by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi can salvage Congress from sinking further into the crisis in Punjab. Precipitation of crisis started when four Punjab ministers, after holding a meeting with a group of around two dozen other MLAs, minced no words in saying that Amarinder was colluding with the Badals and he should be replaced if Congress wants to win the election. However, the next day, AICC general secretary and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat reportedly said that assembly polls would be contested under the leadership of Amarinder. If that was not enough, on Thursday he further embarrassed Sidhu by saying that either he should remove his advisers or he (Rawat) would remove them. These statements emboldened Amarinder’s camp and they held a show of strength by hosting a dinner at sports minister Rana Sodhi’s residence and claimed that “58 MLAs and eight MPs attended it”. Apparently infuriated by Rawat’s public comments about removal of his advisers, Sidhu hit back on Friday morning, saying he should be given freedom to take decisions and he would take the party to new heights in Punjab or he would “itt naal itt vaja daunga (smash things)”. Sensing that situation was getting out of his hands, Rawat avoided responding. However, no sweet talk by the party central leadership may reduce the bitterness spewed out in the last three days. While Sidhu and his camp have been sticking to issues they have been raising, Capt Amarinder’s camp has now started claiming “satisfaction” with the CM’s working.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/cong-high-commands-peace-formula-in-tatters/articleshow/85702006.cms||IP Singh
---||Delhi||Uphaar fire tragedy: Delhi cops point to proof tampering||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police told a city court on Friday that alleged tampering of evidence by real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy case has not only potentially eroded the institutional integrity of the judiciary, but also seriously affected the administration of the criminal justice system. Police added that only the complainant could not be considered the victim of the crime in the present case, but the justice delivery system had been made a victim too. The submissions were made before chief metropolitan magistrate Pankaj Sharma during the hearing of a case related to alleged removing and defacing of evidence related to the incident in which fire broke out at the Uphaar cinema hall during the screening of “'Border'” on June 13, 1997, in which 59 lives were lost. The Ansals were convicted in the case and sentenced to two-year imprisonment by the Supreme Court. The public prosecutor, appearing for police, told the court that handpicking several most crucial and material documents from voluminous files running into more than thousand pages pertaining to the most sensitive case of the city having international ramification, getting them removed, defaced and obliterate demonstrated the nefarious design and deliberate flagrant act allegedly done by the accused pursuant to a well-planned conspiracy to cover up the crime. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/uphaar-cops-point-to-proof-tampering/articleshow/85699811.cms||---

Travel and tourism industry players say that even though bookings were lukewarm till last week, last-minute inquiries and confirmed bookings have picked up nicely. Looking to break away from pressing deadlines and mundane routine, people have planned road trips to watering holes such as Daman, Silvassa, Diu, Mount Abu, Udaipur and Kumbhalgarh, which are at a driveable distances from the various cities of Gujarat. Bookings to long-haul destinations such as Goa, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer have also been buoyant, travel industry players say. Thanks to a pick-up in last-minute bookings, prices of round-trip flights to Jaipur, Jodhpur and Goa have surged from 40%-140%. “Growth in bookings to tourist destinations suggests a revival in sentiment for travel and tourism and people are slowly beginning to gain confidence as they move out. People have got a long weekend after a long time and three-night four-day packages are seeing high demand. People are choosing good properties and resorts where they can relax with loved ones,” said Anuj Pathak, president, Tour Operators and Travel Agents’ Association of Gujarat (TAG). Gambling around Janmashtami is an age-old tradition and those looking for card sessions are bound to head to Goa as other popular international destinations such as Hong Kong-Macau and Las Vegas have travel restrictions in place, industry players say. “Goa has opened up for tourists since August 10. Anyone entering the state must be either fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the date of travel or submit Covid-negative reports on arrival. Despite Covid-19 related restrictions, tourists’ spirits are high as far as travel is concerned,” said Manish Sharma, chairman of the Gujarat chapter of Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI). Hotels at destinations such as the Statue of Unity, Diu, Daman, Sasan Gir, Saputara, Polo Forest, Udaipur, Jaipur, Kumbhalgarh, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer among others are nearly full. “Hotels are almost full at popular destinations and from August 23 onwards, bookings have poured in, showing a trend of holidays being planned at the last minute. With this, room tariffs have increased by at least 40%,” said Ankit Bajaj, the owner of an Ahmedabad-based travel company.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/last-minute-travel-bookings-upbeat/articleshow/85699835.cms||Niyati Parikh

Kovind has accepted the request made by Sambhajiraje to meet him. While speaking to TOI over phone, Sambhajiraje said meeting the President will help generate momentum towards attaining the goal towards reservation. “We will put all legal issues before the President of India pertaining to reservation. We expect him to take up our prime demand to expand the limit of reservations to the government. Recently, the government introduced a bill to give back power of granting reservations to states, which was unanimously supported by all parties. But without expanding the scope and cap of 50%, the communities like Marathas, Gujjars and Patels can never get reservation,” said Sambhajiraje.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/quota-issue-sambhajiraje-to-meet-prez-on-sept-2/articleshow/85699776.cms||---

While the chief minister met his one-time bête noire and former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, Sidhu met his loyalist and party MLA Pargat Singh. “Sidhu and I discussed matters of the party organisation... where all rallies would be organised as there are enquiries from party leaders. We are in the process of setting up the party office… There is no groupism in Punjab Congress. I have been raising issues for over two years now and solutions should have been found by now. The issues need to be resolved before facing the people in elections,” said Pargat. Bhattal later said the meeting was a “courtesy call” and Amarinder’s daughter too accompanied him. She said there was no agenda for the meeting. “We all have to work for the party’s win in the next assembly polls,” she said, adding that it was time for the party leaders to put up a united face to bring the party back to power. On Tuesday, four ministers – Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Charanjit Singh Channi – had said that they have lost faith in the chief minister. It was followed by a show of strength by Amarinder’s loyalists over a dinner hosted by minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi. Meanwhile, cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and MLA Kulbir Singh Zira also met Sidhu and Pargat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/cm-meets-bhattal-pargat-hosts-sidhu/articleshow/85702043.cms||---

Monserrate said it is a democracy, and that anyone can contest anywhere. “If anyone wishes to contest, they are free to contest, I have no issues with anyone,” he said. Monserrate also refused to comment on Madkaikar’s statement on Thursday. “Monserrate has started reconstituting the Panaji and Taleigao mandals, and neither my supporters nor I have been accommodated in the mandals,” the former mayor had said. “Indirectly, it seems that those people who worked hard to get Monserrate elected, who went door-to-door to campaign, he has pushed aside.” “There will be 10 people who will be contesting in Panaji, let the people decide,” Monserrate said. “We may want to win, but ultimately, you have to see whether people want to get you elected. That is very important. You must not take the people for granted. I look at it that way.” Monserrate said that it is part of politics to want to grow, and wished his rivals best of luck. On Thursday, Madkaikar and fellow former mayor Tony Rodrigues met senior Congress functionaries and conveyed their interest to return to the party. Madkaikar and Rodrigues had said that they are keen to contest the 2022 assembly elections from Panaji and Taleigao if given the Congress ticket. State party president Girish Chodankar had said that the two would be inducted in the party in a bid to strengthen Congress, but gave no assurance of a party ticket.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/babush-let-people-of-panaji-choose-best-representative/articleshow/85700078.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh may be asked to prove majority at September 3 session||CHANDIGARH: As the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) delegation on Friday met Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore urging him to direct chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to prove his majority in the Punjab legislative assembly, experts said there was no such bar that such an exercise could not be carried out during a one-day special session of the assembly called on September 3 to mark the 400th Prakash Purb of Guru Tegh Bahadur. Former deputy speaker Bir Devinder Singh said there was no such provision in the Indian Constitution for a special session, so it would be treated as a regular one. He added the September 3 session had been called under Article 173(1) of the Constitution by the governor on the recommendations of the cabinet to fulfil the statutory requirement of having a session within six months from the last session, otherwise the House lost its legitimacy. He added when it was a regular session, anybody could bring the no-confidence motion or ask the chief minister to prove his majority on the floor of the House. But, he said, under the garb of calling a special session, the Congress government was running away from discussing urgent issues of the state. He termed the session a legislative fraud. When contacted, Punjab parliamentary affairs minister Brahm Mohindra said the session will fulfil the Constitutional obligation of having a session before September 9 (within six months from the last session) and the cabinet could decide to have another session after that to take up the bills and other official business. Against the total number of 14 sittings held in 2020, only eight sittings have been held this year. Also, 15 sittings were held in 2019, 14 each in 2018 and 2017, and 16 in 2016. Questioned on this, deputy speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti said there was no fixed criteria of minimum number of sittings in a year and it all depended upon the government if it had legislative business or not. “If the business advisory committee recommends any legislative or official business, number of assembly sittings can be increased,” he added. The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha (Punjab Legislative Assembly) said subject to the provisions contained in Article 174 of the Constitution, there shall be three sessions in a financial year (budget session, summer/monsoon session and winter session) and the total number of sittings in all sessions put together would not be less than 40.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/cm-may-be-asked-to-prove-majority-at-sept-3-session/articleshow/85702084.cms||---

The details have been placed on the NITI Ayog’s website. Monetization in effect means handing over of the listed airports to private sector. The Union Ministry of Aviation says monetization is proposed to be done in four phases between 2022 and 2025. It is aimed at augmenting financial resources for infrastructure development. The larger objective is to focus on monetization of these 25 airports, while bundling of smaller airports may be explored based on market testing of transactions and investor feedback, the NITI Ayog said and added that the overall capital expenditure is valued at Rs 20,782 crore. Hubballi Airport is the only airport from Karnataka in the list. The proposal is to privatise it in the third phase - 2023-2024. The airports at Chennai, Vijayawada, Tirupati, Vadodara and Bhopal are to be privatized during the same year. The aviation ministry expects revenue of Rs 4,193 crore From Hubballi airport the ministry expects a capital expenditure of Rs 130 crore. It is the third largest airport in the state with increased number of flights and passengers under Udan scheme. However, the Centre’s move has attracted criticism. “The Union government has started privatizing railways, BSNL, Life Insurance Corporation of India and now airports. This will be a move against public interest because private operators who come with profit motive will exploit the end users.” said Ramanjanappa Aldalli, district president of Socialist Unity Center of India (Communist). The aviation ministry has stated that to ensure commensurate development of non-profitable airports along with the profitable airports with the help of private sector investment and participation, pairing /clubbing of smaller airports with each of the six bigger airports and leasing out as a package is being explored. Further, divestment of AAI’s residual stake in four airport joint ventures has also been considered under the monetisation pipeline. This includes the private sector operated airports in Mumbai (26% stake), Delhi (26%), Hyderabad (13%), and Bengaluru (13%). Monetisation plan Year Airports 2021-21 - Varanasi, Raipur, Bhuvaneshwar, Amritsar, Trichy, Indore 2022-23 - Patna, Nagpur, Calicut, Hubballi, Coimbatore, Madurai, Surat, Ranchi, Jodhpur 2024-25 - Imphal, Agartala, Udaipur, Dehradun, Rajmundry||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/centre-to-monetise-hubballi-airport-move-draws-flak/articleshow/85695009.cms||---

A total 87.14 acres will be acquired for the purpose, a notification issued by the state government said.The civilian airport is being developed with the help of the Indian Navy whose airbase is coming up there under the second phase of Project Seabird. The state government had requested the defence department to extend the facility of the Naval airbase to civilians, in order to boost tourism in the area. Though the Navy had agreed to this, it had put a condition that the additional land required to build the civilian terminal and runways should be provided by the state government. An MoU was signed last year between defence department and the Karnataka government.Private land of 87 acres and 15 guntas in Alageri, Belekeri and Bhavikeri villages will be acquired in accordance with Section 19(1) and 19(2) of Land Acquisition Act, 2013, the notification said. Assistant commissioners Kumta and deputy commissioner Uttara Kannada have the powers to acquire the land. They should ensure that the entire amount required for the compensation is ready. The officials should also confirm that the same land was not acquired earlier, the notification said.Though there is resistance from some quarters for land acquisition, most are reportedly willing to give away their land. The airport is just 35km away from Goa border and a large number of the tourists are expected to come to Karwar airport as Goa airport is already crowded and will be shifted to Mopa in North Goa soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/govt-gives-nod-for-land-acquisition-for-civilian-airport-near-karwar/articleshow/85695049.cms||---

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday laid the foundation stone of the five-storey building that will cost around Rs 21 crore. “Players who bring medals are honoured and receive prizes in crores, but when they sweat during the training in the field before bringing the medal, they are supported by Delhi government,” Sisodia said. The hostel, which will have 64 rooms for the players and their coaches, will also be equipped with a two-mat wrestling hall, medical room, physiotherapy centre, gym and a steam bath, among various state-of-the-art facilities. The construction of the Rs 20.9-crore project will be completed in about 16 months, he said. Sisodia said Chhatrasal Stadium had given five Olympic medals to the country in wrestling and the hostel will help prepare more world-class wrestlers. Players with potential are being supported by Delhi government’s ‘Play and Progress’ and ‘Mission Excellence’ programmes, as part of which financial assistance is given for training, coaching, sports equipment etc. “In our schools, playing is not considered a subject of learning, whereas the game of a player is his real education. Keeping this in mind, Delhi government is preparing to open Delhi Sports University and Delhi Sports School,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/5-storey-hostel-at-chhatrasal-stadium-soon/articleshow/85699856.cms||---

At least two landslides were reported on the stretch on Friday while the Mussoorie-Barlowgunj Road also remained blocked for a long period. Another massive landslide — which occurred on Thursday and then recurred in the morning hours of Friday — near Galogi power station further made it difficult for vehicles to pass through.  Residents as well as tourists were stuck for several hours. “It took me close to three hours to reach Dehradun. This is generally an hour-long journey,” said a resident. The jam coupled with bad weather also dampened the spirit of tourists flocking to the Queen of Hills for the Janmashtmi long weekend. “It took several hours to reach Mussoorie. We had chosen to come to Mussoorie considering it is close to Delhi, but we ended up spending over nine hours on the road,” said a tourist from NCR region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/landslides-lead-to-severe-jams-on-mussoorie-doon-rd-vehicles-stuck-for-hrs/articleshow/85695058.cms||Anmol Jain

While talking to TOI from Kabul, an Afghan Sikh who lost one of his Muslim friends Usman in the bomb attack said that his friend lived in the vicinity of Gurdwara and was killed in the bomb blast since he was also at the airport wanting to flee the country. “We were lucky to have returned to Gurdwara else we would have been killed.”, he said. Notably, a group of around 145 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus had reached the Kabul airport at around 8 am on Wednesday. However, owing to alleged confusion created by their rescuers and firing by Taliban outside the airport they were forced to return to Gurdwara at around 4 am on Thursday and by late Thursday evening the back-to-back explosions rocked the Kabul airport. Guljeet Singh, president of Gurdwara Guru Nanak Sahib, Vikaspuri, Delhi, informed that the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus wouldn’t be able to reach the airport unless the Taliban allowed them, adding that they were lucky that they had returned to Gurdwara since the suicide bombers exploded themselves near the place where the buses of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were parked. A source in Afghanistan informed that they had not heard anything from Indian rescuers or from the Sikh NGO’s who also claims to be working for their evacuation from Kabul. He said they held a meeting on Friday and decided to not leave the Gurdwara for the next five days. “We will leave for the airport only in groups of 10 to 15 persons in order to avoid any attention that too only if Indian government will airlift us from Kabul” said the source. President of Indian World Forum Puneet Singh Chandhok said “We are waiting to hear from the Center government for the evacuation of stranded persons , not only the Afghan Hindu and Sikhs have to be evacuated from Kabul but also the Indians, Nepalese and Sri Lankans”. He , however, informed that all the Indians and Afghan Sikhs, and Hindus were safe after the blasts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/afghan-sikhs-and-hindus-decide-to-stay-put-in-gurdwara-for-the-next-few-days/articleshow/85704673.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||Employers must’ve latitude in determining candidate’s suitability: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: One may be "eligible" to be a police constable but the authorities can have a wider latitude in deciding "suitability", the Supreme Court has ruled while upholding the Delhi Police's decision to reject candidature of three men and a woman for post of constable even though criminal cases against them had ended in compromise or acquittal. The screening committee of Delhi police had rejected candidatures of the four on the ground that criminal cases of serious nature did not wipe off the taint despite compromise or acquittal, making them unsuitable for a sensitive post as police constable. The central administrative tribunal and Delhi High Court concurred that the screening committee could not have rejected their candidature, given the fact that they were young people. Setting aside the decisions of CAT and Delhi HC, a bench of Justices K M Joseph and S Ravindra Bhat said, "Courts exercising judicial review cannot second guess the suitability of a candidate for any public office or post. Absent evidence of malice or mindlessness (to the materials), or illegality by the public employer, an intense scrutiny on why a candidate is excluded as unsuitable renders the courts' decision suspect to the charge of trespass into executive power of determining suitability of an individual for appointment." Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Bhat said public service -- like any other, pre-supposes that the state employer has an element of latitude or choice on who should enter its service. "Norms, based on principles, govern essential aspects such as qualification, experience, age, number of attempts permitted to a candidate, etc. These broadly constitute eligibility conditions required of each candidate or applicant aspiring to enter public service. Judicial review, under the Constitution, is permissible to ensure that those norms are fair and reasonable, and applied fairly, in a non-discriminatory manner. However, suitability is entirely different; the autonomy or choice of the public employer is greatest, as long as the process of decision making is neither illegal, unfair, or lacking in bona fides," the bench said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sc-employers-mustve-latitude-in-determining-candidates-suitability/articleshow/85699906.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Nagpur||Fact-finding team begins probe to unravel Ganga Jamuna fiasco||Nagpur: A group of activists and scholars have commenced a fact-finding exercise into the closure of red-light area Ganga Jamuna effected by city police since August 11. On Friday, a group of sex workers, activists, lawyers, scribes, NGO representatives and other members of the civil society brainstormed over the police action on Ganga Jamuna, including the latest notification issued by police commissioner (CP) Amitesh Kumar. The meeting, which was also attended online by NGOs and activists from other states, took place at National Institute of Social Work College at Krida Chowk. A sex worker pointed out that she too was raising a daughter and inculcating good values in her. “We too have families that are dependent on the income generated through our sex work,” she said. National Network of Sex Workers president Kiran Deshmukh, who had come from Sangli to extend her support to her counterparts in Ganga Jamuna, said it is the women’s right to make their own life decisions — especially whom to chose as their partners within four walls. Advocate Diwesh Kumar called sex workers ‘service providers’. “Giving access to one's body is not a crime. Even in the medical field one gives access to one's body to another,” he said. “Running a brothel is illegal but ‘prostitution’ is not. One's home cannot be categorized as a public place,” Kumar added. Former journalist Sham Pandharipande said a broad-based community should be formed to take the advocacy to senior officers across the services and administrative layers. He added that women and child trafficking is illegal. Dinanath Waghmare, convener of the Sangharsh Vahini — a body championing the cause of oppressed and backward groups — said women’s groups across the region would create awareness about the rights and plight of the sex workers. "The fact finding committee is in the process of amassing information about the ground realities and opinions of different sections of the society regarding the Ganga Jamuna issue, which will be shared with senior police officers, collectors and the divisional commissioner," he said. One of the residents of the Ganga Jamuna, Chandabai Khatri, said she had been living in the area for the last 40 years without any hassle. "My two daughters are married and I am staying with my daughters-in-law, but never had any adverse experience from a customer of the red-light area. Nor did cops ever come inquiring inside my house," she added. Hemlata Lohave, project manager of the Indian Red Cross Society, was also present during the discussion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/fact-finding-team-begins-probe-to-unravel-ganga-jamuna-fiasco/articleshow/85699883.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Since 2014, Telangana clocks Rs 1.35 lakh crore revenue from liquor sales||HYDERABAD: Income from liquor has been the largest source of own revenue for Telangana since its formation in 2014. Over the past seven years, state has earned Rs 1.35 lakh crore from liquor, with revenue having nearly tripled from Rs 10,833 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 27,888 crore in 2020-21. The continual increase in revenue from liquor sales can be linked to the state’s consumption pattern as well as the recent price hike. Furthermore, sources in the government said the income graph would continue to rise in the future and sales figures since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic confirm this. For instance, the maximum year-on-year increase has been in the pandemic year of 2020-21 at Rs 5,283 crore. And that’s not all. While the pandemic is far from over, in the first four months of this fiscal (2021-22), the state has already generated Rs 9,509 crore from liquor sales. With the new liquor policy coming into force in October, there has been a discussion on feasibility of increasing liquor prices in a limited way, sources said. A new application price system will be implemented for boundaries and new licences. In addition to the existing 2,216 wine stores, 150 new shops will be approved. Insiders said that the number of new shops to be approved could even go up. There is also a plan to allow more wine shops in major gram panchayats and larger mandals. The excise department also plans to allow 159 additional bars with extended hours to stay open longer at night.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/since-2014-t-clocks-rs-1-35l-cr-revenue-from-liquor-sales/articleshow/85703171.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Delhi||Delhi: Tussle over affiliation delays College of Art admissions||NEW DELHI: Due to the tussle over affiliation between Delhi government and Delhi University, admission to the undergraduate and postgraduate courses in College of Art for the new academic session is yet to start. In March 2021, Delhi government, which runs the college, had announced that COA would be affiliated with Ambedkar University Delhi but DU hadn’t responded to this till August 13, forcing the Directorate of Training and Technical Education to write to the DU registrar about the issue. DU has now included COA’s de-affiliation in the agenda of the Executive Council meeting scheduled for August 31. On July 6, B S Chauhan, officiating principal of COA, had written to the registrar requesting the university not to further delay the de-affiliation process. The letter stated, “College of Art is not getting any support from University of Delhi in the admission process, examinations of bachelor’s and master's degrees through online and offline mode or any financial assistance and scholarship to our students. Even the admissions/enrolments in PhD in Fine Arts have been stopped by the faculty of music and fine arts since 2018-19.” It added, “The college is getting stepmother treatment from the University of Delhi as various matters are pending for so many years, such as upgradation of syllabus, which is awaiting approval from 2017-18.” Close to 106 faculty positions are currently vacant in the college, where 1,500 students are enrolled. On August 13, the DTTE joint director wrote to DU to say, “We have still not been informed of the status on the affiliation of the courses of College of Art. Further, the principal is requesting early action as the matter of delay in de-affiliation is causing a delay in admission.” However, DU’s EC has resisted the move of Delhi government to affiliate COA with AUD and demanded that the admission process commence as laid down in the statues of Delhi University. In a letter, EC member Seema Das said, “We request you to urgently initiate the process of admissions for first year UG and PG students in College of Arts. Any delay is not in the interest of the creative and versatile students who are eagerly waiting to be part of the premier college in DU. In this regard, we need not take any cognisance of both the letters of Government of NCT of Delhi dated March 3 and 5, 2021, which are in violation of the DU Act, 1922, and statute 30 of the ordinances.” The college on Tilak Marg in central Delhi was affiliated to DU in 1974 after it was established as the arts department in Delhi Polytechnic (now Delhi Technological University) in 1942. In 1981, the Bachelor of Fine Arts became a four-year programme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/tussle-over-affiliation-delays-college-of-art-admissions/articleshow/85724712.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Goa||HC raps Centre over no public notice for Blue Flag process||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has set aside a notification issued last year concerning ‘Blue Flag’ certification standards for Miramar beach as the central government in a “most causal manner” deprived people the right to object to activities proposed in an “eco-sensitive zone”. The central government had not issued a public notice in the case. A division bench comprising justices Sunil P Deshmukh and M S Sonak observed that, “Unless there was genuine public interest or some urgency that did not brook the delay of even 60 days, the central government was not justified in dispensing with a public notice under clause (a) of sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the said rules and depriving the stakeholders of opportunity to lodge their objections.” In the absence of any real public interest involved in the dispensation of such public notice, the Central government could not have, in a most casual manner, dispensed with such requirement and deprived the public of an opportunity to object to the activities proposed in an eco-sensitive zone, the court said. In the notification dated January 9, 2020 issued under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, the government dispensed with the requirement of public notice. In a 2019 notification, it was declared that certain specified structures/facilities shall be permitted in the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) area subject to maintaining a minimum distance of 10m from the high tide line (HTL) so as to obtain Blue Flag certification on 12 beaches, including Miramar. This was questioned in a public interest litigation filed by Kashinath Shetye and others. The petitioners pointed out that if a public notice had been issued, then they would would have lodged their objections by pointing out that most of the facilities proposed already exist at Miramar beach, and therefore, to permit such facilities up to a distance of 10 metres of HTL might result in disproportionate environmental damage. Counsel Nigel Da Costa Frias, who appeared for the petitioners, argued that there was neither any public interest nor any situation of urgency, based on which such public notice could have been dispensed with by CentreR Chodankar, the central government’s standing counsel, said that the dispensation of the public notice was in public interest, and submitted that there was due public consultation and interministerial consultation. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to dispense with the requirement of public notice under the said rules, Chodankar stated, and said that this decision had the backing of the ministers concerned. After considering the arguments, the court said, “The central government, upon challenge, had to explain by placing relevant material, the reasons for which and circumstances in which the notice under clause (a) of sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the said Rules came to be dispensed with. The mere recital of ‘public interest’ in the impugned notification or an ipse dixit in the defense affidavit is not sufficient in such matters,” the high court said. The affidavit does not even attempt to answer what was the public interest involved in dispensing with the public notice, the court noted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hc-raps-centre-over-no-public-notice-for-blue-flag-process/articleshow/85700048.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: UDH may ease construction norms near defence areas||JAIPUR: The urban development and housing (UDH) department is mulling a proposal to ease the restrictions on the construction of buildings close to cantonment or defence establishments from 500 metre to 100 metre. The final decision will be, however, taken after deliberations with ministry of defence. As per the proposal, the construction up to 15 metre (four-storeys) will be allowed. An official said, “The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has forwarded the proposal to the UDH. If approved, it would not be mandatory for owners to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to carry out construction activity in the mentioned limits.” Earlier, the Rajasthan High Court had stayed the order of the UDH department issued on June 12, 2017 in which the state government had withdrawn the earlier restrictions put under JDA Building Regulations, 2010. The state government was asked not to allow any construction within the radius of 500 metre from the boundary of Army area without seeking prior No-objection Certificate (NoC). Union of India through station commander, south-west command filed a petition challenging the order of the UDH which had withdrawn restrictions in construction in the army areas. An official said, “The final decision will only be taken after seeking legal advise and defence officials.” Sources said, earlier, to maintain security standards, the Army had written to the state government and the JDA to restrict the construction near the military area boundary. A proposal was also given to prepare separate by-laws to carry out construction near defence area. An official source said, “The proposal to reduce the cap from 500 metre to 100 metre is moved as thousands of constructions and renovations are getting affected. There are cases that JDA itself has allotted plots in less than 500 metre radius of the military area boundary for construction,” said a source. Other than Jaipur, in Rajasthan there are 10 defence establishments where NOC is required including Mount Abu, Ajmer, Nasirabad, Bikaner, Suratgarh, Alwar, Bharatpur, Kota, Jodhpur and Jalipa. The defence ministry on October 21, 2016 issued a circular stating that any construction or repair activity within such a restricted zone of 10 metres will require prior NOC from local military authority LMA/defence establishments. “Following this, the UDH department issued notice to inform all the civic bodies across the state. Due to this, construction at many plots was affected,” added source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/udh-may-ease-construction-norms-near-defence-areas/articleshow/85702162.cms||---
---||Dehradun||U’khand HC grants bail to former MP & murder convict Yadav||Nainital: For the third time this year, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) has granted short-term bail on medical grounds to former Member of Parliament (MP) D P Yadav who is serving life sentence in Dehradun jail for the murder of a legislator. A strongman from west UP, Yadav was convicted by a special CBI court in 2015 for the murder of Dadri (Ghaziabad) MLA Mahendra Bhati in 1992. The lawmaker was shot dead at Dadri railway crossing in December 1992. Along with Yadav, three of his accomplices were also convicted and are serving life sentences. The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma heard the matter on Thursday and said that Yadav would be granted 30-day bail to undergo treatment. The controversial politician -- whose son, Vikas Yadav is also serving jail term in Nitish Katara and Jessica Lall murders -- has to undergo an operation for spinal problems. The court said that Yadav should undergo treatment during this period as it cannot go on granting him bail again and again. In April this year, the HC had given him bail for two months. In June, he again approached the court for bail on medical grounds and was given another two months. On Thursday, the court was informed that Yadav was not operated upon because of several co-morbidities and depression and needed more time. The CBI, however, opposed the bail application arguing that “treatment for spinal problems seemed only an excuse”. The court asked Yadav to submit a personal bond of Rs 50,000. The court has also directed him to “maintain peace and tranquillity during the pendency of the appeal” and to “not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case”. Yadav is a four-time MLA and was also in Mulayam Singh Yadav's cabinet of ministers. He later joined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and was briefly a part of the BJP. In 2007, he formed the Rashtriya Parivartan Dal party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-grants-bail-to-former-mp-murder-convict-yadav/articleshow/85695141.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Aurangabad||Beat marshals with loaded rifles patrol industrial area||AURANGABAD: The MIDC Waluj police have given rifles to the beat marshals patrolling the industrial area to put a curb on the property and body offences in the limits of Waluj industrial area. It is for the first time that the beat marshals have been given loaded firearms for patrolling. The law and order situation in Waluj, which houses the largest of industrial area of Aurangabad as well as the region, has been a cause of concern. It is one of five key industrial areas in the district. Aurangabad city police commissioner Nikhil Gupta said that the move was amongst the long list of steps being taken to boost safety and security in the industrial area. It would boost the confidence amongst industrialists and the workforce. Authorities maintained that the recent incidents of attacks on industrialists and also the past incidents of robbing workmen of their mobile phones and cash, have played a role in taking of this decision. Aurangabad has about 5,000 industrial units housed in five industrial areas and employ over four lakh direct and indirect workmen. About 70% of these units, including large number of MNCs and workforce are located in Waluj, making it the most buzzing industrial area of the region. Newly appointed inspector of MIDC Waluj police station, Sandeep Gurme, said, “On going through the records, we have found that criminal elements have on and off bothered the employees as well as employers here. We have pledged to address the issue on a priority.” The officer said that ensuring presence of armed policemen will give confidence to the workforce that is continuously on the move in the area and at the same time will deter the criminal elements. The police, with the help of industrial houses, have started preparing a list of criminal elements that have been troubling the industrial houses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/beat-marshals-with-loaded-rifles-patrol-industrial-area/articleshow/85699925.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||MahaRera: Society must step into builder’s shoes, complete project||MUMBAI: Ganga Jamna Sangam society in Khar (W) was recently formed by 19 flat purchasers who had paid large sums to the builder but were still to get possession of their apartments. MahaRera chief Ajoy Mehta’s order said: “The issue or legal validity of termination is not crucial before this authority nor within its scope to adjudicate on its validity. The more important issue...are the implications of the termination and the consequences that follow on the allottees, including the new flat purchasers in the saleable component, the bank and the society at large. It is amply clear that the developer acquired the rights to develop from the development agreement entered upon by the society.” “The society cannot now by the action of termination wish away the liabilities created by the developer,” it added. The August 21 order further said that on termination, the society becomes the ‘promoter’ and all earlier bona fide liabilities created by the developer would now “squarely rest on the shoulders of the society”. It added, “The society, thus, cannot now abandon the allottees, including new flat purchasers, on the pretext that the development agreement is terminated. Societies, while appointing developers, must conduct proper due diligence of the development agreement being entered into. During execution of the project, it should exercise supervision and monitor its progress diligently to ensure that the purpose of appointing the developer is achieved in a timely manner and all bona fide liabilities created in the process are fulfilled.” It said the society “shall step into the shoes of the respondent (builder)...and ensure smooth completion of the project, safeguarding interests which shall include payment of interest on delayed possession of all present allottees and all new purchasers, if any,...and in no manner jeopardise their interest in terms of their individual rights and interest”. Six flat purchasers had approached MahaRera complaining that the builder had failed to deliver the flats, and sought compensation with interest. The society, too, filed an intervening application. So did Bank of Baroda, which had loaned the builder for this project. Twelve flats were mortgaged by the builder to the bank. The bank submitted that there are still 13 unsold apartments on which they have a charge created. Its interest is towards recovery of the outstanding bank dues as the builder did not pay its debts towards the mortgaged loan. The MahaRera order said the society will have to take necessary legal recourse to recover the interest and other charges. Secondly, the interest of the bank shall be protected and the same shall be taken care of while appointing the new developer by the society. All the liabilities shall be transferred to the new developer or the said society in case of self-development on ‘as is where is’ basis, it added. “Lastly, the society must ensure that all the liabilities as accruing on date, including the liability of paying interest on delayed possession, all the transactions as on date and all the duties-cum-responsibilities as on date are clearly enumerated,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharera-society-must-step-into-builders-shoes-complete-project-in-mumbai/articleshow/85699979.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

The team had picked up the suspended inspector from a lodge at Kothagiri in Nilgiris district around 9.30pm on Thursday. The police also arrested her brother Pandiyaraj in connection with the case on Friday. Both Vasanthi and Pandiyaraj were taken to Government Rajaji Hospital for medical examination before being produced before the Madurai district court.

However, when he went to the police station the next day, Vasanthi claimed that there was no money in it and it contained only newspapers. Asrath submitted a representation to Madurai district superintendent of police V Baskaran on the matter. After a preliminary inquiry by the additional superintendent, the district crime branch police registered a case against Vasanthi, her brother and the three others under IPC sections 384 (extortion), 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) and 506 (1) (criminal intimidation).

---||Dehradun||Bridge on Doon-Rishikesh highway collapses into river after rain, govt orders probe||Dehradun: A bridge on the Dehradun-Rishikesh highway collapsed into a swollen seasonal river during rush hour on Friday following heavy rainfall in Uttarakhand. At least five vehicles suffered damage, but no casualties were reported. On Friday morning, cracks appeared on the Ranipokhari bridge, 10 km from Dehradun airport, as two of its pillars gave way. Videos shot by witnesses showed a portion of the bridge starting to fall even as several cars could be seen reversing while drivers and passengers in others ran away, leaving their vehicles behind. Some of the automobiles turned turtle as a 20-metre-long portion of the structure plummeted into the monsoon-fed Jakhan river. A district official told TOI that five vehicles were damaged and two people received minor injuries. The 432-metre-long bridge was built by the Public Works Department (PWD) in 1964 and connects the state capital to Rishikesh.  Ranipokhari station officer Jitendra Chauhan said the sudden increase in water level in the river due to heavy rain submerged the pillars that held the bridge, resulting in its crash. “We have halted traffic on the route,” he said, adding that police and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were conducting rescue operations at the site. The state government has ordered a probe into the incident. Tourism and PWD minister Satpal Maharaj said chief engineer Hariom Sharma has been tasked with heading the investigation and would soon submit a report. Maharaj has also asked officials to monitor all hydropower projects in the state. “There has been heavy rainfall in most parts of the state and authorities have been told to monitor all bridges and hydropower projects. Any kind of dereliction of duty will not be tolerated,” said the minister. Uttarakhand has been receiving incessant rainfall the entire week leading to several instances of landslides and rain-related mishaps. Meanwhile, in Vikasnagar, a house collapsed and at least one person is feared dead.

Their important demands include opening of schools from Class I to VIII and releasing of RTE money. MP Kirori Lal Meena supported their movement and was on stage the entire time. The matter was resolved after assurance by the state government that their demands will be accepted. Around 1pm, MLA Pratap Singh Khachariyawas visited the protest area expressing support, but the school association demanded written orders by the government or said they will organise such a protest again. Around 3pm, a delegation went to meet education minister Govind Singh Dotasra who has given assurance to the private school owners that they will reconsider the decision of opening schools from class VI to VIII from September 5 onwards. The minister signed the letter in front of the secretary of government and the director regarding payment of RTE amount, immediately issued instructions to make the payment of both the instalments before September 15. School Shiksha Pariwar president Anil Sharma said that in the matter of admission, different options were given on the PSP portal and Shala Darpan portal regarding the requirement of TC, due to which non-government schools could not take admission without any TC, whereas government schools could also take admission without TC. It was clarified by the minister that there will be equal options in both the portals and there will be no discrimination of any kind. New rules for schools to get recognised by government were released in 2012, in which many conditions were put that it was very difficult for small and medium-class schools established before 2012 to fulfil. The minister agreed to give relief to such schools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/3000-pvt-school-owners-protest-demand-reopening-for-classes-1-8/articleshow/85702175.cms||---

According to data by Airports Authority of India (AAI), 3.45 lakh passengers travelled from the city airport in July 2021 – up 48.2% against 2.33 lakh passengers in June 2021. With new flights launched and existing ones operating on schedule, even the aircraft movement for both domestic and international flights saw a surge. During the same period, aircraft movement grew from 2,378 flights in June to 3,264 flights in July. Travel and hospitality industry sources attribute the surge not just to the consumer confidence growing back but a gradually improving sentiment for both corporate travel as well as leisure. In fact, with greater passenger movement, hoteliers across Ahmedabad are getting a major cushion with increased occupancy. “Not just leisure travel but even corporate movement has seen a surge. Company delegates who need to travel for on-site requirements are now arriving into the city in greater numbers taking our occupancy levels at par with the pre-pandemic times ,” said Jay Sudhakaran, general manager, Novotel Ahmedabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/passenger-footfalls-at-city-airport-surge/articleshow/85699941.cms||---

NGT has appointed KRMB chairman as the nodal officer by replacing the director of mines and geology (Telangana) to coordinate with the team and get the report. The tribunal has also allowed AP government to implead in the case during the hearing on Friday. The AP government has been contending that Telangana government was going ahead with Palamuru-Rangareddy scheme without permission and requisite approvals. A farmer, Kosigi Venkataiah from Mahabubnagar district, had filed a petition before NGT, Chennai bench, against PRLIS for indiscriminate extraction of soil from lakes to build a huge bund for Udandapur reservoir. The NGT in July constituted a joint committee consisting of a senior officer from the Union environment and forest ministry, a senior scientist from CPCB, Chennai, district collector, Mahabubnagar, director, mines and geology, and a senior scientist from NEERI. The director of mines and geology was directed to act as the nodal officer for providing necessary logistics and co-ordinate with the team members. Earlier, NGT had directed the committee to submit a factual as well as action taken report on or before August 27. However, the committee failed to take up the inspection and submit the report as directed by the NGT due to the non-cooperation of Telangana government. Subsequently, a farmer from Kadapa district, D Chandramouleswara Reddy, filed another petition in NGT alleging that Telangana government was illegally constructing PRLIS without obtaining environmental clearance in the name of drinking water scheme. NGT then included a senior officer from CWC. AP advocate general S Sriram, during the hearing on Friday, alleged that the nodal officer for the inspection panel, the director of mines and geology (Telangana) was purposely not coordinating with the committee despite the fact that members were willing to visit the project site and submit the report as directed by the NGT. Expressing displeasure over the Telangana government ,NGT appointed KRMB chairman as nodal officer to get the inspection panel report following the request made by AP advocate general. AP argued that there is no need to excavate huge canals, tunnels and construction of 6 reservoirs having storage capacity of 68 TMC for the supply of drinking water of 6.1 TMC under Phase-I. It contended that the public hearing should be be conducted for phase-I and phase-II in one go. AP requested the NGT to grant stay against the execution of the scheme as there was enough evidence before the NGT about the violations by Telangana government. However, NGT observed that it would take a call after getting the inspection report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/unhappy-with-state-govt-ngt-orders-inspection-of-prlis/articleshow/85703193.cms||Samdani MN
---||Goa||Goa: Congress and AAP have approached me, says minister Michael Lobo||PANAJI: In a startling revelation that will set political tongues wagging, science and technology minister Michael Lobo on Friday said that Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have approached him with offers to join their parties. The two-time BJP legislator from Calangute gave enough indications of his greater political ambitions, stating that he can play an important role in Goa and that he should not be restricted to Bardez taluka. “We will play an important role in the next assembly election,” Lobo said. Political observers pointed out that this was Lobo’s subtle message to BJP that he needs to be given a larger role in the party for election-related matters. In recent months, it appears that Lobo hasn’t enjoyed the freedom he once had in the Bardez political arena. On speculations that he is in touch with Congress, Lobo said, “Political parties are always in touch with performing MLAs,” Lobo said. He also said that there is nothing wrong with parties approaching MLAs. “It is up to us to decide our future course. We are in BJP for the past 15 years,” he said. When asked if Congress has also approached him, Lobo said, “When elections are approaching, leaders of political parties will approach MLAs. A lot of people have joined BJP, in fact many Congressman have joined BJP.” Stating that he is working for the people of Goa, Lobo said, “Even people come to meet me from Tiswadi, Pernem, Mayem and Mandrem for help. I assist them in whatever way I can. I never tell them that they are not from my constituency, or that they should go to their respective MLA or minister,” while insisting that as political representatives they should work for the people of Goa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-and-aap-have-approached-me-says-lobo/articleshow/85700022.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Many small schools face bankruptcy in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: For more than 15 months, schools have been shut due to the pandemic that has impacted them financially with many owners going bankrupt. School owners are still facing problems, especially in paying their rent, electricity bills and teachers’ salaries with not more than 40% parents paying the fees. In small schools, where middle class or lower middle class students study, the situation is worse. Mukesh Gandhi, director of Gandhi Baal Niketan School in Dher Ke Balaji, Jaipur, said, "Not more than 40% parents have paid the fees. The situation will not change until the schools re-open." Most of these schools have fees starting from Rs 300 per month to Rs 2,000 per month. On the other hand, renowned schools of Jaipur where the fees runs into lakhs of rupees a year are in a better position with majority of the parents paying fees. Seema Bardhwaj, director of Blooming Buds school in Behror, said that they are in deep debt but cannot start any other business for survival as students will be left behind. She said that the unless the schools re-open, the situation will not change. In rural areas of Rajasthan, the situation is even more difficult. In Nawa town of Nagaur district, parents have not even paid 10% of the school fees. Hari Om Sharma, principal of a school, said that parents don’t even send their children for online classes as they know that fees has to be paid. Hence, private schools have been demanding opening of all classes but experts believe that phase wise opening will be better.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/many-small-schools-face-bankruptcy/articleshow/85702214.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Several institutes gave false information on online classes: Govt||Jaipur: The demand for pending RTE money by the school authorities has been debunked by the government officials saying that many schools haven’t submitted any proof that they have provided online classes to students amidst the pandemic. The state government had asked the schools to provide information regarding the medium through which they have given online classes to students and phone numbers of students for verification. There are around 28,000 private schools in Rajasthan out of which 30% have submitted false information with fake numbers and many schools have common numbers of students. A senior education officer on condition of anonymity said, “According to the information, many schools have allegedly given fake details. Some have given false names or same number for the entire class or same number for the entire school. We have marked them with red and will decide what has to be done.” In pandemic, it has been difficult for lower middle class students to attend online classes and for schools to have enough infrastructure to organise online classes. Hence, for those schools, government is not ready to pay anything. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar said, “We are not demanding it for schools who have not given any online classes. Government has already identified such schools and we want to exclude such schools but clear the amount for others. This is an injustice, to include everyone under one umbrella.” Government has assured to clear the payment by September 15 this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/several-institutes-gave-false-information-on-online-classes-govt/articleshow/85702187.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Bopal Sewer Deaths: Third body found after 16 hours||AHMEDABAD: After an operation lasting 16 hours, the body of Sandeep Meda, 33, was recovered at 4am on Friday by Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES). It was found about about a kilometre from the manhole where the three labourers entered the drainage line — without protective gear — and were asphyxiated by sewer gas, in Bopal on Thursday.  The incident occurred around 11.45am on Thursday, when the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority contractor who had employed the tribal family, allegedly told Sandeep to enter the manhole and break the wall of a sealed but connected dummy drainage line, which was going across a railway line.  “As soon as Sandeep broke the wall, he began choking on trapped sewer gas. His eldest brother, Bharat, 53, and youngest brother, Raju, 25, jumped in to save him. When the trio did not surface, the police and AMC fire department were called. The family lived in shanties near Shantivan Farms in Shela and were from Dahod. The bodies of Bharat and Raju were pulled out from the 20-foot manhole by fire personnel on Thursday afternoon, while Sandeep’s body was still missing. Pankaj Raval, station officer AFES Navrangpura, was told to take over with a fresh team while the team, which at the spot since noon, was asked to withdraw. Raval said the second team made rexamined the manholes in question. One eyewitness, another labourer, said he had seen his hand as he was being washed away in the drainage line. “My team decided to carry out a searches in other manholes. And looking inside three to four other manholes, we were lucky to spot his hand. In all these manholes, fire jawans were lowered with torches. As the fifth manhole cover was removed, we found the body. The jawan who went in to retrieve it said one of his legs had got stuck in a T-junction pipe and the body was hence not moved towards the pumping station.” Raval said the decision to look in other manholes was taken as the pipeline between first two chambers was broken but they could not find Sandeep. Raval said had his leg not got stuck, he would have got pulled to the pumping station which would have made the search more difficult. Raval said it appears he as if he may have died in just a short while, after being washed away in the drainage line.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/3rd-body-found-after-16-hours/articleshow/85700012.cms||---
---||Nagpur||BJP to send over 75k lettersto remind CM of I-Day year||Nagpur: The tiff between BJP and Shiv Sena over Union minister Narayan Rane’s controversial comments aimed at chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over the issue of the number of years since Independence Day refuses to die down. Three days after Rane’s arrest, the BJP has decided to send over 75,000 letters to Thackeray’s official residence Varsha in Mumbai to remind him about the exact year in which the country achieved independence. After BJP leader Ashish Shelar announced the plan to send letters to Thackeray, former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule started the drive from Amravati on Thursday in the presence of several Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) members. The letters were displayed at a public rally. “Though our leadership has set a target of over 75,000 letters from across Maharashtra, the figure would cross the one lakh mark. We will flood the CM’s residence with these letters so that no place would be left to store them. The objective is to remind Thackeray not to forget the number of years since the nation gained independence,” Bawankule told the media. He added that BJP workers would continue to send letters until any official from Varsha requests them to stop by tendering an apology. The latest move by the BJP is likely to open a new chapter of confrontation between the allies-turned- rivals after Rane alleged that Thackeray enquired about the year of India’s independence from his secretary during a speech on August 15 as he wasn’t aware of it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/bjp-to-send-over-75k-lettersto-remind-cm-of-i-day-year/articleshow/85700057.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

This decision is being criticised not only in India but all over the world. With this decision, the simplicity and purity of Sabarmati Ashram will end, he said in a series of tweets.He said that Mahatma Gandhi led a simple life and devoted it to the freedom struggle and to the service of humanity.“Creating state-of-the-art and luxury infrastructure in the ashram of the Mahatma who lived a simple life is contrary to the originality of his life. Bapu’s thoughts and principles are reflected in the Sabarmati Ashram,” he said.“All the intellectuals have opposed this move by writing a letter to the Central government. I again appeal to the Central government not to tamper with the original form of Sabarmati Ashram. Instead of trying to earn money from it, let it be a centre of contemplation,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cm-decries-revamp-of-sabarmati-ashram/articleshow/85702263.cms||---

The district administration has held several rounds of meetings with all the stakeholders — coaching institutes, caterers, hostellers and transporters to ensure Covid protocol be followed in full spirit. Ujjawal Rathore, Kota collector, has made special arrangements for vaccination for coaching students upon their arrival in the city. “Students will get priority in vaccination in case they are not inoculated and are above 18 years of age. I have asked the coaching majors to inform students that they should either bring an RT-PCR test or vaccination certificate,” Rathore said over the phone. The city houses 1.5 lakh students during the peak season from July to November. The coaching institutes are expecting the return of 50,000 students in the first couple of weeks in September. Already, 15,000-20,000 students are in Kota at present and more are arriving every day, which has brought cheers to almost everyone in the city associated directly or indirectly. The institutes are working overtime by cleaning, sanitising, marking and pasting instructions on the boards for students. “My entire teaching and non-teaching staff are vaccinated. These students are our kids and their quality education and safety are our responsibility,” said Naveen Maheshwari, director of Allen Career Institute. Almost all coaching institutes are starting their first batch from September 1. Nitin Vijay, director of Motion Education Pvt Ltd has held a training-cum-orientation programme for the teachers on how to avert any medical urgency.

Considering the importance, the hostel associations have decided to keep one student in every room to maintain social distancing. Sunil Agarwal, president of the coral park hostel association, having 3,600 seats, said, “Students’ safety comes first for us. Even hostels with double rooms are renting out to individual students.” Instructions for the mess are that food will be served individually, not in dining hall until new guidelines come.

In Lucknow, while many temples will be decorated with colourful string lights and flowers, this year, celebrations will again be modest and devoid of tableaux or ‘dahi-handi’ competitions. At the 60-year-old Shree Radha Madhav temple in Daliganj, the festival will be a both virtual and non-virtual affair. The idol of Lord Krishna will be decked up in ‘Banarsi’ apparel with a silver ‘mukut’ (tiara). The ritual of ‘panchabhishek’ will also be done, followed by ‘maha-aarti’ on the main day: August 30. “Janmashtami is a muchawaited festival for us and devotees. The temple will be decked up with floral arrangements, LED and laser lighting. For devotees not residing in Lucknow, or those unable to visit the temple, we will have live streaming on Facebook,” said organiser Anurag Sahu. Like every year, devotees will be able to catch a glimpse of New Ganeshganj’s ‘digital jhanki’ offline and online. “There is still a concern about the third wave of the pandemic. In view of that, we will be putting up only digital jhankis. A swing with ‘Laddu Gopal’ will also be there with a rope for public to sway it. The celebration will begin at 6pm on Monday and will go on till September 4. This will also be live-streamed on Facebook,” said organiser Anupam Mittal. Khari Shyam Temple will also live-stream their aarti on Facebook. At Reserve Police Lines and 35 Battalion of PAC in Mahanagar, celebrations will be small but with tableux. The public will be able to catch a glimpse of the mostawaited tableux in the city with Covid precautions. ISKCON temple will welcome Lord Krishna with cultural programmes. The rituals will begin on August 30 midnight, followed by cultural programmes in the evening, and culminate on August 31 with ‘Nandotsav’ and a community feast. Amid reverberations of ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’, 1,008 conch shells filled with panchamrut (mixture of holy water, yogurt, honey and milk) will be emptied on the idol of Lord Krishna. This ritual is called ‘shankh abhishekh’. Tight security will be in place to avoid overcrowding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/digital-aarti-live-stream-to-mark-second-janmashtami-with-small-tableux/articleshow/85702291.cms||Aditi Singh

---||Nagpur||A ‘NEET’ dictionary for Marathi-medium students||Nagpur: Grasping English words in medical curriculum can indeed be a challenge for those coming from vernacular-medium schools and now a unique dictionary aims to provide some succour. NGO Lift For Upliftment (LFU), which is currently training tribal kids for the medical entrance exam in Gadchiroli, will release the dictionary on Saturday in a virtual event. LFU is a Pune-based organization founded by doctors who took the initiative to train tribal students for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET). Starting with the tribal belt of Melghat (Amravati), the NGO has now started a residential camp in Bhamragarh (Gadchiroli). The Gadchiroli coaching initiative is a collaboration with Dr Prakash Amte’s Lok Biradari Prakalp. All academic and lodging/boarding facilities are completely free of cost. Dr Atul Dhakne, founder-president of LFU, said, “Language should not be a barrier for anyone's dream, career and goals and understanding science. Our LFU volunteers made a dictionary for students to remove that barrier and to bring them closer to their dreams.” The dictionary takes the NCERT books as its base and translates words into Marathi. The dictionary goes chapter wise and even mentions the page number on which that English word is mentioned. This give a progressive sequence to the student when using the dictionary. The dictionary sometimes also explains a bit more comprehensively the meaning of the word, which will make it easier for students to understand. LFU volunteers led by MBBS student Raj Surana pooled in their time to compile the dictionary. In a written statement Surana said, “The book has been divided into two sections. Section 1 has all the chemistry chapters while Section 2 is all about class 11 biology in sequence as per NCERT. All the words which might be difficult to interpret for the students have been translated into Marathi. It will help students to learn chapters with a greater understanding. We always believe that concepts learnt in the mother tongue are retained the most.” In 2020, LFU tasted success as almost half a dozen of its Melghat tribal students were eligible for medical admissions. TOI had profiled one such student, Shantilal Kasdekar, who came from a family of labourers but never gave up on his dream to become a doctor. He is currently enrolled for MBBS in the prestigious Nair Hospital at Mumbai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/a-neet-dictionary-for-marathi-medium-students/articleshow/85700079.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The MCAP will focus on six action areas for implementable climate change projects that can contribute to the city’s resilience (see box). A climate cell has been proposed within the BMC to help with understanding the practical impact of climate change in Mumbai and to coordinate with various its departments and the state environment ministry to implement the MCAP. The existing IT infrastructure will also be used for data collection and analysis. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said while climate change is a reality and cannot be stopped, its pace could be slowed by taking up robust mitigation and adaptation measures. “While development is needed, we should try to see how it can be made more sustainable. For instance, one of the projects, a desalination plant, is an attempt to reduce the dependency on monsoons,” he said. The action plan is coming after Mumbai joined the C40 Cities Network in December 2020. The plan will be drafted with technical support from WRI India, which has been engaged as a knowledge partner. “Such a plan will help us make quick and informed decisions, ensuring the safety of those most vulnerable in our city. I feel the MCAP is the need of the hour and should be drafted on priority,” said BMC commissioner I S Chahal, recalling that since he took charge in May last year, the city has seen two cyclones pass by, a phenomenon not witnessed for decades. The greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory for the Plan was set for 2019 as the base year. As expected, the energy sector contributes the highest emissions, at 71%, while the transport sector contributes 24%. Roxy Mathew Koll of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, said Mumbai is at a crossroads facing sea level rise and extreme rain events. “There is a need for redesigning and thinking on what needs to be done to make the city more climate-resilient,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-city-to-get-its-own-action-plan-to-counter-climate-change-effects/articleshow/85700158.cms||Richa Pinto

Addressing the concluding ceremony of the school’s diamond jubilee year, he said, former chief minister Sampurnanand envisaged the need for sainik schools in the Sixties. “Just two years after setting up of this school, India was attacked by China in 1962. Sampurnanand ji had foresight and could sense the need for Sainik Schools in the country,” he said. The CM said, India should be grateful to Sampurnanand for his vision. “It was his farsightedness that led to establishment of Sainik Schools that churn out disciplined citizens not only for the Army, but also in administration, management and health,” he said. Reiterating that Lucknow was home to country’s first Sainik School, the CM said, it’s a matter of pride the government laid the foundation of UP’s fifth Sainik School in Gorakhpur this year. “Education isn’t confined to book knowledge. It aims at holistic development of an individual, and this is well portrayed by this school,” the CM said. He also added, “Our government is continuously working towards women empowerment. In 2018, we decided to admit girls in Sainik Schools. In 2017, when we came to power, we paid tributes to Kargil hero Captain Manoj Pandey by naming the school after him.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/lucknow-home-to-first-sainik-school-yogi-lauds-sampurnanands-vision/articleshow/85702283.cms||---
---||Nashik||WhatsApp used to boost vaccination in villages||Nashik: The district health department is making use of WhatsApp to disseminate information among beneficiaries in rural Nashik – especially in hilly, tribal areas – about vaccination programmes in the nearest session sites. The district’s Covid vaccination coordinator and deputy collector Ganesh Misal said that WhatApp is proving to be a boon in passing on information to the villagers about the availability of vaccine at session sites. “The health officials have used the social media not only to spread awareness about the vaccination but, at the same time, inform people about the vaccination schedules,” said Misal. The officer pointed out that the health authorities and even those from departments have the contact details of sarpanch and other local elected representatives to whom they pass on the information about vaccination sessions. When pointed out that in remote areas people do not have access to mobile, Santosh Bhangare, one of the elected representatives from Peth taluka, said, “The message is sent to multiple contacts in my jurisdiction and it quickly spreads like wildfire.” Also, the number of people from 18-44 age group are now visiting vaccination sites for the getting the dose. “Senior citizens who have been saying no to get vaccinated are now queuing outside the centres to get jabs after seeing young population taking the shots,” ND Gavit, another elected representative from Surgana, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/whatsapp-used-to-boost-vaccination-in-villages/articleshow/85700111.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The patient is in the Intensive Care Unit for observation and her condition is stable, said doctors. A 50-year-old woman from Shahjahanpur was admitted to QMH on August 23 with complaints of excessive abdominal distension with pain and respiratory issues. She was suffering from such problems for a year. Head of obstetrics and gynecology department Professor SP Jaiswar, who led the surgery team, said that it was the largest ovarian tumour removed at KGMU. “Due to ignorance, the patient didn’t visit any hospital till abdomen became excessively enlarged, otherwise such tumours can be easily detected at an early stage,” she added. “Cancer marker tests were high, which indicated the possibility of malignancy, hence we removed the tumour immediately,” said Prof Jaiswar. In the surgery done on Thursday, the ovarian tumour was removed along with uterus, tubes and ovaries. Two units of blood were transfused during the procedure. Two other faculty members involved in the surgery, Prof Seema Mehrotra and Dr Monica Agrawal said, “The tumour has been sent for biopsy to confirm malignancy.” Prof Rajani Gupta and her team also assisted the team in the surgery.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/31-kg-tumour-removed-from-50-year-olds-ovary/articleshow/85702321.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They were released from the Bushehr prison on Monday and their lawyer is in the process of arranging for their repatriation to India, an email from the Consulate of India in Bandar Abbas, Iran, to president of International fishermen development trust, P Justin Antony, who was initiating measures for the release of the men, stated. Antony, quoting a senior official in the Consul of India in Iran on Friday said that the men who are not in Bushehr will be taken to the consul in Bandar Abbas on Sunday, following which the formalities to repatriate them will be carried out. The fishermen Albert Ravi, 38, Godwin John Weldon, 40, Arockia Ligin, 24, Joseph Besky, 50, Jesudas, 27, Daynas, 40, Sahaya Vijay, 22, Michaeal Adimai, 45, and Velington, 36, all from Kanyakumari district, worked for a Kuwaiti employer. On January 15, 2020, they went fishing from Fahaheel in Kuwait in three fishing boats. Two days later, they were detained by Iranian authorities on charges of entering their territorial waters. Lodged in the Bushehr prison, their legal battle was a long one. The families paid Rs 8.1 lakh at Rs 90,000 each as fees for a lawyer but were kept at bay for a very long time, to an extent that they came to know that they were convicted only much later. All the men were the breadwinners and the families struggled to arrange for the money. Cheated by the lawyer in Iran, these families were pushed into deeper financial distress. With the help of activists they ran pillar to post and petitioned officials, the Prime Minister, home minister, external affairs ministers, state government and officials in the fisheries department. Antony also made a representation to home minister Amit Shah during his election rally in Kanyakumari district in March this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/9-indian-fishermen-jailed-in-iran-for-19-months-released/articleshow/85702324.cms||---

It has not only helped in weaning away poor women from quacks and self-medication but also helped poor women save Rs 1.25 crore on consultation fee, medicines and surgical procedures. Though a handful of mosques in the city have attached clinics, Masjid Mohammed Mustafa clinic at Wadi-e-Mahmood in Rajendranagar caters exclusively to women patients. Interestingly, all the medical and paramedical staff are women. The clinic handles about 200 women patients daily. The clinic caters to the medical and health needs of women and girls in 30 slums in Rajendranagar mandal. To mark the completion of one year, the mosque clinic conducted a survey that revealed that 75% of patients with chronic illness had saved themselves from futile treatment, doctor shopping and quacks. The clinic is run by Helping Hand Foundation (HHF) and supported by SEED, an NGO based in the US, and an NRI from the US. This clinic introduced unique health programmes for the first time at the grassroots level. They include wellness and weight loss programme, community ophthalmology, community dentistry, community non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and control and midday meals for children,” said HHF managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari. According to the survey, 80% of women had reported general improvement in their health. Also, the need for visiting clinic has significantly reduced from two to three visits per month to almost negligible now. About 20% of long-term patients suffering from chronic illness expressed improved physico-social issues, which has significantly improved their family bonding. Of the 1,248 women above 30 screened for NCD, 48% were found to be having high risk of developing NCDs due to overweight and other risk factors like family history and lifestyle. As many as 53% of women had BMI more than 25 putting them in grade 2 obesity. All women above 25 were enrolled in wellness and weight loss programme. In 18% of women, hypertension was diagnosed and 6% women had diabetes. These women were not aware of their health condition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/clinic-at-city-mosque-treats-25k-women-in-1-yr/articleshow/85703207.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 53 roadside parking lots closed for overcharging||LUCKNOW: At least 53 roadside parking slots were closed on Friday a day after their contract was cancelled by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) on grounds that they lack basic public amenities mandated in the contract and complaints of overcharging. The move, however, invited protests from corporators who said that the decision taken without making any alternative arrangements will result in inconvenience to people. TimesViewLMC should make alternative arrangements at the earliest to address the inconvenience being faced by people. A probe should be started to fix responsibility of the LMC officers who allotted the contract without verifying the availability of basic amenities in the parking lots.Areas where these parking lots are located include Shahnajaf Road, Lalbagh, Aminabaad, Mirabai Marg, Niralanagar, Aliganj, Gomtinagar, Gomtinagar Extension, Tedhi Pulia, Faizabad Road, Kanpur Road, Gole Market and Transportnagar. All of the lots were situated on the roadside in the open. According to LMC officials, the decision to close the parking lots was taken by municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi on the direction of the state government. These lots do not have facilities like shed, drinking water and toilets which are mandatory as per the contract. There were also some complaints of overcharging. The decision will affect more than 35,000 commuters parking their vehicles in these lots. BJP corporator from Chihnat ward Dilip Srivastava said, “Lack of an alternative will not only lead to traffic congestion, but also cause inconvenience to people who will not get a suitable place to park their vehicles.” Rajiv Singh, a computer engineer, who parks his vehicle at a lot in Mirabai Marg, said “LMC should have cured the disease instead of closing the facility. We are now forced to park vehicles without any security.” Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said the decision has been taken to stop illegal business by the parking mafia. Alternative arrangements will be made soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/53-roadside-parking-lots-closed-for-overcharging/articleshow/85702340.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Delimitation of wards to trigger development issues||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Friday started the process of preparing draft of delimitation of wards for single-member ward system. The new wards will be formed on the basis of population census of 2011, and not the prevailing count, which may lead to high discrepancy in number of population in wards in outer and inner areas of the city. This is likely to create problems in developmental works as fund allocation will not increase proportionately. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, population census of 2021 is yet to start. Therefore, the state election commission (SEC) has directed the NMC to consider population census of 2011. Population of the city, comprising Hudkeshwar and Narsala, was 24.47 lakh as per population census-2011. The current population has likely increased to 28-29 lakh. Ruling party leader in the NMC Avinash Thakre told TOI that the population has increased in outer areas. “Few of the wards, especially those in outer areas, will have more voters than those in old localities, which may cause problems for the candidates,” he said. Thakre said that main impact will be seen after elections as “all wards are likely to get equal funds but those having high population will not get extra money”. “Already, outer areas are lacking various types of facilities. But there is no other option as population census 2021 could not happen,” he said. Expressing similar views, Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe said that the system will not affect elections or the candidates but it is likely to have an impact when it comes to taking up developmental works. Both said that OBC reservation should be implemented in civic elections. “If existing guidelines are considered, elections will be held only with SC and ST reservation. Therefore, process of OBC reservation needs to be completed and introduced in civic elections,” he said. On August 26, TOI had reported that of the 151 wards, 42 will be reserved — 30 for Schedule Caste and 12 for Schedule Tribe. Of the remaining 109 wards, 54 wards will be reserved for women and 55 will be open. The SEC had directed the NMC to start the delimitaion process from August 27. Accordingly, deputy commissioner Nirbhay Jain reportedly submitted draft of committee to be formed for completing the process. Sources from the NMC said civic chief will be chairman of the committee. One of the two additional municipal commissioners, Jain, assistant commissioner (GAD) Mahesh Dhamecha, assistant director of town planning, and others will be in the committee. The civic chief has also directed the officials concerned to collect data of population census, blocks etc. The draft of delimitation of wards is likely to be ready in at least 30-45 days. It will be submitted to the SEC, followed by suggestions and objections from the people, reservation process etc. As per schedule, polling should be held in February 2022 and election for mayor is supposed to be completed on or before March 5, 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/delimitation-outer-wards-to-have-high-popn-face-devp-issues/articleshow/85697727.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Two kill cabbie, travel to five cities with the body; arrested||JAIPUR: Two men strangulated a taxi driver with a belt and travelled for two days across five cities with the body emanating acrid odour in the car’s trunk. The two accused were arrested by the Ramganj police and identified as Naimuddin alias Nammu (20) and Farhan alias Fardeen (23). Both are drug addicts and have been booked multiple times under different offences by the city police. Deputy commissioner of police, North, Parsi Deshmukh said that the accused had killed the driver Khem Chand Mahawar, a resident of Amber Road, and threw his body into Kalisindh river near Jhalawar. According to Additional DCP, North, Sumit Kumar Gupta, the matter unravelled when the driver’s son on August 19, filed an FIR at Ramganj police station in which he said that his father had left for a ride but has since gone missing because his phone was switched off. “We had kept the stolen vehicle under close surveillance and found that the accused had paid for the fuel at a petrol station in Tonk. We arrested the duo from there and brought them to Jaipur for further investigation,” Gupta told TOI. The police said that the entire incident unfolded as follows. The accused booked a cab from Ramganj to go to Lucknow on August 19. The accused asked the cab driver to go as far as Nepal. Somewhere around August 22, the cab was heading back to Jaipur. Near Kanota, the two accused high on drugs asked Mahawar to take a halt. They told him that they were carrying about 10 grams of smack and asked him to return to Bassi where they claimed that drugs were left in an eatery. Mahawar refused to return to Bassi. “A scuffle broke out and one of the accused pulled out his belt and strangulated the driver,” Gupta said. Both hauled the body into the vehicle’s trunk and drove the vehicle out of the city limits. They then travelled to Sikandra, Bharatpur, Karauli, Kota and arrived in Jhalawar on August 24. In Aklera in Jhalawar district, the accused hauled out the body from the car’s trunk and threw it into the river before going to Tonk. The police said that they have recovered the car and the duo are being interrogated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/2-kill-cabbie-travel-to-five-cities-with-the-body-arrested/articleshow/85702367.cms||---

Five huge trees, including a jamun, peepal and neem were felled near the playground in the panchayat. Satish Kumar, a residents this village, filed a petition before the permanent lok adalat on July 15, stating that some people had felled their trees for their selfish needs, without any reason. Though he had complained to the revenue department and local body administration, no action was taken. District judge and chairman of the adalat, Theni, judge A Mohamed Jeyaudeen who took the petition for hearing, issued summons to the engineer, Tangedco, Kandamanur, panchayat president of Srirengapuram, panchayat secretary of Thappukundu and village administrative officer of Thadiseri. The Tangedco engineer informed the court that the electricity board had sought permission from the panchayat administration to remove the branches of trees, when a transformer was established near the playground in the village. He said that the panchayat president and secretary had ordered the cutting of the branches but the trees were felled by accident. The VAO had in turn lodged a complaint with the Veerapandi police and the felled trees were seized and kept in the panchayat office. The judge said that hearing of the plaintiff and the defendants had proved that the large trees had been felled without proper reason.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/theni-lok-adalat-orders-vao-to-plant-100-trees-to-replace-5-felled-for-no-good-reason/articleshow/85702356.cms||---

This was a far cry from the scene a few months ago when people used to crowd its gates early in the morning trying to get the shot. Awarded for vaccinating one lakh people since its inception in January, the facility will soon be shifted to Madurai Medical College premises. GRH dean Dr A Rathinavel said the 24-hour centre was a boon for the working class with restrictions being eased and many coming late in the night to take the jab. ``We have adequate doses and there is almost zero wastage,’’ he said. Dr S Waseemsha, one of the four nodal officers for the centre, said it was started on January 16 when healthcare workers were the main focus and vaccination was for those aged above 60 and 45 plus with comorbidities. But, crowds started thronging as the second wave peaked. They then launched a dial and register system, but that faced some problems. Online registering with the help of CovidFree Madurai, a community initiative, followed. With technology support from ZOHO corporation, this helped them ease the crowds. ``I took my second dose at 8.40 pm on Thursday and it was a cool experience. There were five others in the waiting hall and the late night open air hospital experience made it a pleasure,’’ said S Dev of Gomathypuram.  ``I brought my elderly father for a vaccine at 9 pm for his second dose. He enjoyed it as we had to stand in a long queue for the first dose in a local PHC in the hot sun,’’ said S Asokan of Anna Nagar. Dr Wassimsha, said they were vaccinating about 200 people on average between 8 pm and 8 am on all days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/grh-24x7-vax-centre-turns-a-hit-in-madurai/articleshow/85702336.cms||---

Speaking at the 26th annual convocation of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, he said: “with the collective efforts of our doctors, healthcare workers and administrators, the nation has been conducting the world’s largest vaccination drive. We have made incredible progress with more than 61 crore citizens successfully vaccinated across the country. In Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of the country, nearly 6.7 crore people have been vaccinated so far. I appreciate the efforts of all those who are contributing to this great mission.” He added that the nation should remain grateful to all doctors, nurses, medical students, healthcare and sanitation workers and administrators who served fellow citizens while risking their lives and rose to the occasion of crisis. He also lauded the role of SGPGI in Covid-19 control while appreciating the support provided by the UP government. Stating that buildings and facilities alone do not make a world class institute, he told the awardees and degree holders that the human element in health care was indispensable. “More important than method and technology is the human element, that is, the healer (in you). You have acquired great skills and knowledge; now is the time to put them to use in serving others. For the patient, hoping for relief and recovery, you are nothing less than an angel. Their faith in you is a great responsibility for you,” he said. Defining the vision for SGPGI, the President said: “Many eminent personalities have worked hard to make SGPGI a premier institute. Now is the time to expand your influence. I am told that the chief minister has announced the setting up of medical colleges in every district. It is incumbent upon you to extend your expertise to all these upcoming institutes so that they can be developed as centres of excellence in their own way. This will help people get best treatment within the state which will eventually emerge as a preferred destination for healthcare.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/no-rest-till-all-eligible-personsget-vaccinated-says-president/articleshow/85702365.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Zero shadow day occurs due to the Earth’s rotation axis being inclined at 23.5 degrees to the plane of its revolution around the sun and it differs from place to place, experts added. During the session, people were made to stand in circles and see if they could see their shadows at 12.19 pm on Friday. A bottle of water and a stick was kept in the middle of the ground and the participants saw the shadow disappear at 12.19 pm and then slowly come back. In southern Tamil Nadu, people in Rameswaram in Ramanathapuram will experience it on August 29, Tirunelveli on August 30 and in Tiruchendur in Tuticorin district on August 31. People in Kanyakumar will see it on September 1, TNSF members said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/madurai-residents-observe-zero-shadow-day/articleshow/85702380.cms||---

Under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), India also reimbursed the indirect and invisible taxed exports paid during the process of manufacturing and exports. Under MEIS, exporters were refunded 5-7% of exported amount as an incentive against the taxes charged by state government and the Centre for duties paid on purchases of diesel, electricity, and other indirect taxes. The MEIS scheme was made to lapse in 2020 as it was not WTO compliant and the Centre came up with RoDTEP (Remission of Duties & Taxes of Exported Products) which was effective from January 2021. But the rates were fixed on August, which was 0.5% of the export amount. Atul Poddar, president of Federation of Rajasthan Exporters, said, “We are surprised that in textile made-up sector, the rates of RoDTEP for yarn and fabric have been fixed at 3.8% and 4.3% respectively, whereas quilts and comforters which use yarn and fabric as their raw material have been pegged at 0.5%. It means we are encouraging raw material exports and discouraging the finished product which has more value for exports.” In the international markets, Poddar said, many of our neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam, Cambodia among others enjoy a duty-free access to the US and European markets whereas Indian products are subjected to import duties. “The reduction in reimbursements will further make Indian products more expensive in American and European markets. If we had got legitimate refunds under the RoDTEP scheme, we would have had a good chance to compete and increase our share in overseas markets. The decision by the government has robbed us of our chances to survive and let alone grow the exports to achieve the target of $400 billion set by the prime minister,” added Poddar. Poddar said the handicraft industry will approach the Centre to review and restore the reimbursement rates to levels available under the MEIS.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/exporters-of-handicrafts-up-in-arms-against-cut-in-tax-refunds/articleshow/85702379.cms||---

According to officials, the leopard may have slipped into the well searching for prey. The villagers spotted the big cat in the well and informed the forest department following which a team was rushed to the spot for carrying out the rescue work. When the team of forest officials reached the spot they found that the leopard was sitting on the iron foundation of a water pump inside the well. The forest officials lowered a cage in the well to rescue the animal. The entire rescue operation took around two hours. “We immediately got the leopard checked by a veterinary doctor. The leopard is physically fit and we will soon release it after the necessary official procedure,” a forest official said. Last year in July, a four-year-old female leopard had fallen into a well in Chadegaon village near Nashik Road area of the city and was rescued by forest officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/deola-forest-dept-rescues-leopard-that-fell-in-well/articleshow/85700172.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Lucknow||Crop damage: UP to decide compensation criteria||Lucknow: Intensifying its focus on the farming community ahead of UP polls, the state government has decided to carry out a statewide drive to ascertain an equitable quantum of crops for compensation in case of damages due to inclement weather. Additional chief secretary, agriculture, Devesh Chaturvedi has directed all divisional commissioners and district magistrates to conduct rigorous inspection of harvesting sessions and the employed procedures that are reflective of the qualitative estimation of crops which could be covered under the government-approved insurance scheme. The exercise of estimating the quantum of Kharif/Rabi/Zayed crops is essentially done by the revenue department officials, mainly lekhpals. It is based on the inputs from the revenue officials that the acreage of any crop is decided. Chaturvedi said the district authorities will now be required to examine the inputs of the revenue officials. For this, officials like the DMs and the SDMs will be required to conduct assessment of the exercise from time to time. The development gains significance in view of BJP stepping up efforts to woo the farming community which plays a crucial role in deciding the electoral fortunes of any political party. The move holds importance especially in the agriculturally richwest UP region. The ACS said that the Centre has implemented a host of schemes to scale up crop cover and productivity. “The implementation of the schemes will be possible only when the appropriate estimation of crop cover and assessment of harvesting procedures is done,” he said. Officials said that this would give the correct picture of the crop productivity which was crucial for providing financial cover to the farmers. In July, the state government had rolled out a special drive to enroll farmers under the PM’s crop insurance scheme, provisioning financial cover to the crops which sustain damages due to adverse weather.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/crop-damage-up-to-decide-compensation-criteria/articleshow/85702390.cms||---

In Noida, about 41,000 doses were administered against the target of 40,000 at 195 centres, including 157 government ones, while over 66,000 people got jabs in Ghaziabad compared to the target of 57,600. Ghaziabad had set up 160 centres, including 147 government ones. Compared to the past two drives, the third seemed better executed. Unlike the previous big vaccination days, there were no major complaints of mismanagement at the centres, though crowds had to be managed at some places. However, the CoWIN portal worked quite slowly on Friday and the staff faced difficulties in filling in the details of the recipients. Ghaziabad officials said they would have vaccinated more people if the portal functioned properly. Maintaining Covid protocols, though, remained tough at almost all centres in Ghaziabad. Moreover, most of the recipients didn’t sit in the observation room for half an hour after getting the vaccine. Talking about Friday’s drive, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, Noida district immunisation officer, said, “We had decided to keep the online registration and walk-in centres separate. There were 33 centres where only those with online slots were allowed. At the other 107 centres, walk-ins were being allowed. This helped in crowd management this time. However, those who could not get the shot should not worry as regular vaccination is being done daily in the district.” Though the drive went smooth, fewer doses will now be available for the exclusive second dose vaccination on Saturday. With the next three days being public holidays, more people are expected to turn up for vaccination. However, more doses are expected to arrive by Saturday evening and government centres remain closed on Sunday. Following the mega drive, the pace of vaccination is expected to be stabilised by Monday now. Ghaziabad vaccination nodal officer Dr GP Mathuria said the emphasis was given on vaccinating everyone who reached the centre. Also, this time too the number of centres has been increased. So that the beneficiaries can be vaccinated in most of the areas. CMO Dr Bhavtosh Shankhadhar said efforts were made that the maximum number of vaccinations was given. During the first mega drive, more than 79000 shots were administered, whereas in the second drive, over 42000 people were vaccinated. An inspection team that had arrived from the Meerut division to oversee the mock drill of PICU ward at District Combined Hospital directed ti the hospital administration to add one more vaccination site at the centre after seeing the long queues of beneficiaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/over-1l-vax-jabs-given-in-months-3rd-mega-drive/articleshow/85712630.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Lucknow||Akhilesh blames BSP for ending alliance after 2019 polls||Lucknow: Describing the coming together of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls as the ‘biggest alliance’ of the country, Akhilesh Yadav on Friday held the latter responsible for calling off the political pact. This was possibly the first time that Akhilesh accused the BSP of ending the alliance, which according to him was “a ray of hope” for the country. At the time of calling off the alliance, BSP supremo Mayawati had stated that her decision to part ways with SP was based on the latter’s conduct in the Lok Sabha polls. Asked whether BSP was a rival, like the BJP, SP chief said, Mayawati was a big leader of the state who had taken a wrong path. “Mayawati ji pradesh ki badi neta hain … lekin unka rasta galat hai … desh ko ek umeed jagi thi UP ke gathbandhan ko le kar ke … who desh ka sabse bada gathbandhan tha … usse bada gathbandhan koi nahi ho sakta tha … us koshish ko khatam kiya tha … us koshish ko khatam kiya hai us party ne … (Mayawati is a big leader but on a wrong path … the alliance was a ray of hope for the people of the country .. that was the biggest alliance that could happen … but BSP put an end to that attempt),” Akhilesh said. On the issue of possibilities of alliance with Asaddudin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) in UP, Akhilesh said the party and its leaders speak the language that suits the BJP. Earlier, at the same event, Owaisi had attacked the SP for keeping mum on the issues related to Muslims and had dared the SP or the BSP to enter into an alliance with the AIMIM in UP. Attacking the ruling BJP, Akhilesh had questioned the manner in which retired IPS Amitabh Thakur was physically lifted and shoved into a police van and ‘ill-treated’ by the cops. “All that the government can do is to humiliate and ill-treat people,” he said, citing the manner in which police arrested Thakur in connection with the self-immolation case of a rape survivor and her companion outside the Supreme Court. The two had accused Thakur, among others, of harassment. Thakur was arrested on Friday and sent to jail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/akhilesh-blames-bsp-for-ending-alliance-after-2019-polls/articleshow/85702418.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

In Noida, there are 61 health and wellness centres, including 35 at the sub-centre level, and of these, 26 do not have CHOs. These sub-centres are the first healthcare points in villages and family planning drives, counselling sessions, routine immunisation programmes and ante-natal check-ups are planned at these facilities. Some centres also conduct procedures like insertion of copper IUDs, as part of the family planning drive. The government had planned to upgrade the sub-centres that focused on maternal and child healthcare to health and wellness centres and in Ghaziabad, the target was to increase the number of such facilities to 76 by 2020-21 fiscal. But only 42 are operational. Chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, said usually, one CHO is posted in each facility. In the first week of August, the CMO had written a letter to the director of the National Health Mission (NHM) seeking appointment of CHOs for the 34 centres. But a response is awaited. Officials in Noida also said that regular requests are made to the state officials about CHO postings. “We have 23 new health and wellness centres that need CHOs. Additionally, there are three centres where the CHO posts have been lying vacant since early last year,” said Manjeet Singh, district program manager, NMH, Gautam Budh Nagar. He added that there are also about 128 sub-centres that are being managed by local-level healthcare workers. Under the NHM, healthcare workers get a six-month bridge course following which they appear for exams before getting selected as CHOs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/village-health-centres-hit-by-lack-of-officers-to-run-them/articleshow/85712643.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Jaipur||Convert roadways into department: Minister writes to Rajasthan CM||JAIPUR: Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas has sent a proposal to the government to convert the Rajasthan roadways corporation into a department because of the continuous losses over the years. According to the proposal, the corporation should be converted into a department so that the salaries of the employees and pensions along with the benefits of the retired staff can be paid in a timely manner which are usually released after a delay of at least one month. The roadways was a department prior to 1964 following which it has been working as a corporation. The employees union also support this conversion. Khachariyawas said, “I have written to chief minister Ashok Gehlot about conversion of roadways into a department as at present it is running into losses. Roadways has also has properties running into thousands of crores which can be used for better purposes which is not being done now. Moreover, retired employees are still to get the benefits and some of them have even died but roadways has been unable to give them their due.” According to the proposal sent by the minister, the roadways is still running buses on routes which have negligible passengers and incurring losses. The proposal further said that inclusion of around 2000 buses on rural routes which otherwise have been neglected till now, would ensure better public transport facilities for the locals. Meanwhile, roadways employees union also support the conversion and their union, United Front’s state convener M L Yadav said, “If the roadways is converted into a department and comes directly under the government then at least we will get our payments on time. We have been protesting about the same since July and especially during this pandemic time, the delayed salaries as well as pensions are taking a toll on us. We want a systematic solution to this issue.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/convert-roadways-into-dept-min-writes-to-cm/articleshow/85702425.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Investigate defects of Atal Setu’||Panaji: Goencho Avaaz has demanded an investigation into the “shocking and rapid deterioration” and repeated closures of the relatively new Atal Setu over the Mandovi. Goencho Avaaz has also demanded accountability and action against those responsible for the “sub-standard and the poorly supervised work” on the cable-stayed bridge that was hurriedly inaugurated in 2019 by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar. Goencho Avaaz said that the bridge, which is touted as an engineering marvel, is sub-standard and riddled with defects. In a letter to Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation, they have demanded a joint inspection “by teams from Goencho Avaaz, PWD, the consultant TPF Engineering Pvt Ltd and the contractor L&T”. “Considering the shocking and rapid deterioration and constant closures of this new bridge, Goencho Avaaz demands an investigation and a joint inspection on deck level and approaches at Merces by teams from Goencho Avaaz, PWD, the consultant TPF Engineering Pvt Ltd and the contractor L&T,” said Goencho Avaaz in a letter to Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC). The inquiry should investigate the role played by various agencies in building the bridge, the lack of diligence and supervision, the allegations of corruption and the reason for cost overruns. Goencho Avaaz said. “It is disgraceful that just two years after the bridge was thrown open for vehicular traffic, large potholes developed necessitating closure of the Old Goa-Porvorim section of the bridge for four days in March 2021 for rectification,” said Goencho Avaaz. GSIDC, the nodal agency to supervise the project, has now closed the up ramp to Porvorim from the Merces junction and has asked L&T, which built the bridge, to repair the defects. In April 2020 too, the Merces-Porvorim arm was closed for traffic to repair the faulty approach road which recurred in May. The Atal Setu bridge was estimated to cost Rs.385 crore when work commenced, but the cost escalated to Rs 581 crore without interest. Goencho Avaaz said that the “shabby work and unbelievable cost overruns” justify allegations of serious corruption, which needs to be investigated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/investigate-defects-of-atal-setu/articleshow/85700459.cms||---

The full-fledged contact tracing that was seen at the peak of the second wave is missing now, for which poor cooperation from the public is being blamed. From reporting 184 cases in the second week of August, fresh infections came down to 151 for the week between August 15 and 21. Except for Srirangam, the other three zones including K Abishekapuram, Ponmalai and Ariyamangalam have reported a fall in infections. Around eight wards account for 45% of the cases reported. In the first week of August, only 5 wards were classified vulnerable, but in the third week, as many as seven have habitations with a high number of cases. This means that despite a fall in infection, cases are concentrated in some areas. Selva Nagar extension in Karumandapam and another Selva Nagar on Vayalur road and Periyar Nagar in Srirangam have habitations with several positive cases reported in the recent week. Ward 45 covering Karumandapam and ward 52 covering Vayalur road have recorded 20 and 18 cases respectively in the month so far, the highest in the city. “Residents are not cooperating in sharing their travel history as they claim that they have not ventured out. Some bulk cases were reported after attending events,” a health official said. While six cases were reported in wards 63 and 64, the civic body seems to have not traced the cause of infection so far. Officials added that they have appointed around 500 volunteers across 65 wards to conduct door-to-door survey for identifying potential cases by screening the oxygen level using a pulse oximeter. “We will conduct camps in the wards that have reported positive cases in bulk. Arrangements will be made for public announcements,” Dr M Yazhini, city health officer, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/fresh-cases-down-in-trichy-city-but-hotspots-abound/articleshow/85700217.cms||Deepak Karthik

However, barely an hour later, Akhilesh cleared the air on the issue, at least for now, by saying that ‘this is not the time for merger’ but confirmed that the alliance between the two parties was on. Speaking at an event organised by a news channel, Shivpal was asked about the possibility of his coming together with bhatija (Akhilesh). Shivpal said he was all in for an alliance with SP but wants respect and honour for his associates in the PSP-L. Asked about the odds of PSP-L merger in SP, Shivpal said: “… If my party leaders and workers get the honour and respect …”. This was the first time since he parted ways from Akhilesh that Shivpal talked about the merger. Shivpal, however, minced no words while talking about the status of his relations with Akhilesh. “Mukhya mantri Yogiji toh phone par aa jaate hain lekin bhatije nahi aate hain phone par… ye mujhe dukh hai … ye mujhe afsoos hai (CM Yogi ji takes my phone calls, but Akhilesh never takes my calls … and that saddens me),” he said in response to a question. Akhilesh Yadav, who spoke at the same event an hour later, though said that SP will give respect and honour to uncle Shivpal and his party. He steered clear off the merger issue. He said SP had left seat for him and his party and added: “Aur unka baqiada samman poora kiya jayega, (Will give him the honour).” On the issue of merger, he said: “Vilay ka samay nahi hai abhi (There is no time for merger as of now),” adding that at present, it was time for politics of alliance. Asked if there was any possibility of merger once the elections draw closer, Akhilesh said there was still time left for these issues though elections are round the corner in terms of preparations of political parties.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/shivpal-keen-on-sp-psp-l-merger-but-akhilesh-disposes-it-politely/articleshow/85702449.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Last year, the PMC had mopped up Rs790.37crore during April 1, 2020 to August 27, 2020. This year, the collection during the same period is Rs1001.88 crore. The PMC data shows that owners of over 5.54 lakh properties had paid the tax last year during the period. The number increased to over 6.26 lakh during the current fiscal. According to civic officials, a special scheme introduced for diligent taxpayers helped in increasing the overall revenue of the tax department. “Many taxpayers did their duty even during the pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020. Last year, they paid their dues within the prescribed time limit. Special discount of 15% on the property tax was given to these people this year. Property tax owners took the benefit of this scheme and initiated payments before June 30 this year,” said Vilas Kanade, head of the PMC’s property tax department. As per the PMC data, owners of 4.04 lakh properties have paid tax of Rs303.76crore to avail this special 15% discount. Property tax is charged based on the annual rateable value of the property. The civic body gives two options for tax payment: offline as well as online. The civic official said that this year property tax bills could not be issued to many properties due to the second wave of the pandemic. Majority of the citizens have paid tax online. Property tax earns the highest revenue for the civic body. The PMC earns around Rs14,000 crore to Rs16,000 crore per year through property tax.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-mops-up-rs-1000cr-in-property-tax-in-5-months/articleshow/85700292.cms||---

It had registered the money laundering case in 2019 and on July 7, arrested Khadse’s son-in-law Girish Chaudhari. He is in judicial custody. ED sources said they have not attached the MIDC plot at Bhosari in Pune district as it belonged to government and Khadse’s relatives had purchased it fraudulently after manipulating records. ED has alleged a 3-acre land was acquired by MIDC in 1968 from one Rasul Akbar Ukani. In 2010, mutation entry for the land was made in the name of MIDC in the revenue record. But no compensation was paid to Ukani, who died in 1981. In 2016, ready reckoner value of the land was about Rs 23 crore. “Eknath Khadse, due to his official position as the state revenue minister, knew this fact and planned the conspiracy with Mandakini and Girish Chaudhari to fraudulently purchase the land from the heirs of Ukani in the names of Mandakini and Chaudhari for Rs 3.75 crore and to avail the higher compensation at ready reckoner value,” an ED press release said. But the land could not be transferred in Chaudhari and Mandakini’s names due to mutation entry in revenue records. Khadse, his wife and Chaudhari received Rs 5.5 crore in cash from unknown sources and third parties, ED said. “This fund was placed, routed and layered through bank accounts of various shell companies and bank accounts of Khadse by creating complex web of transactions and finally integrated (sic) the said funds of Rs 5.50 crore in the bank accounts of the Girish Chaudhari and Mandakini Khadse in guise of loan,” the release said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-likely-to-file-chargesheet-in-khadse-case-next-week/articleshow/85700283.cms||Vijay V Singh

Chief judicial magistrate Shivnath Kale sentenced the accused to five years of rigorous imprisonment. The case is considered as a major achievement of Chandrapur cyber police as they tracked the accused in Delhi, Odisha and Bihar following complaints lodged in Ramnagar, Warora and Rajura police stations in the district. Total nine cases were registered in the three police stations. The victims had complained about unknown persons in Delhi and Gurgaon withdrawing money from their bank accounts, though they had not done the transactions. Based on the investigations carried out by cyber police, the cops rounded up one Vishal Umre (35) from Warora, who was stealing the 16 digit ATM card number and its PIN while the card holders were using it at ATM machines. Umre used to forward these details to his accomplices in Gurgaon and Delhi, who in turn used to clone the card and withdraw the money. Acting on the information spilled by Umre, the cops had arrested Haridas Vishwas (29) of Sikhpalli in Malkangiri district in Odisha, Kisan Yadav (25) from Delhi, Jitendra Kumar Singh (24) of Gaya district in Bihar and Paritosh Poddar (32) from Malkangiri.

It’s election time in the Movie Artistes Association (MAA) and for the first time ever, it appears that there will be five panels in fray to capture power. Shocked out of their wits with elections for just over a 700-member association splitting artistes into several groups, senior actors are frantically trying to salvage the image of MAA by working towards getting a body elected unanimously. The fire and fury is firstly about elections not being held though the term of present body had expired in March this year. Senior actor Prakash Raj fired the first salvo demanding that elections be held while practically parading his panel. Naresh, who is current president of the association, responded saying the elections were delayed as the elected body was busy during the Covid-19 situation helping families. An artiste from Naresh camp went on to bring in the ‘local’ versus ‘non-local’ issue to the fore saying that Prakash Raj was not a Telugu. Things took a dramatic turn when actor Manchu Vishnu offered to construct a building for the association from his personal funds and contributions from his family. Nandamuri Balakrishna said he too would contribute. In all the chaos that had been prevailing, actress Hema shot off a letter to several members of MAA and also circulated an audio message in which she raised the issue of usage of funds. “No funds have been raised but whatever the association has is being used up for various programmes,” Hema said. And for this, she incurred the wrath of the disciplinary committee which sought an explanation from her for her utterances. “The funds are properly being used for Covid-19 relief and for paying members’ mediclaim insurance,” Jeevitha Rajasekhar, who is secretary of the present body, said trying to set the record straight. The general body meeting of MAA was held on August 22 and the elections will be held on October 10.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/no-holds-barred-fight-in-maa-elections/articleshow/85700295.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The drill was held at four Community Health Centers (CHCs) in Bisrakh, Bhangel, Dadri and Jewar and the Covid Hospital in Sector 39 in Noida, and the District Combined Hospital (DCH) in Ghaziabad. According to officials, children were prepared as dummy patients who were brought in by ambulances and shifted to the emergency and further to PICU ward by the staff. Meanwhile, the nodal officers were appointed to monitor the situation in all districts. Nine-year-old Mayank Sharma played a patient at CHC Bhangel. Son of an ASHA worker, Mamta Sharma, Mayank, is well versed with health centres and said he is not scared of injections. “My mother and other doctors said that it was very important work and I had to act well. I was not scared as I was told that I will be given chocolates later,” he said. While three children – two siblings, aged 11 and 10 years, who had come with their mother to see a doctor, and the son of a health department staff – were brought by ambulances and taken to the PICU ward where oxygen through BiPAP machine and HFNC were provided. The senior officials also checked the medicine stock and other facilities. Eight-year-old Mayank Kumar, son of a health department staff, was the most confident one and didn’t get scared during the drill. The other two siblings were quite hesitant, the doctors said. “Doctors posted at government district hospitals will guide doctors at the community health centres and other smaller centres through video conferencing in handling patients admitted to PICU wards, in case the Covid third wave arrives and affects a large number of children,” said Dr Raj Kumar, additional director, health department, Meerut division, who oversaw the drill at the PICU facility located in District Combined Hospital, Ghaziabad. In Ghaziabad, only two paediatricians are posted at DCH, which serves as a 100-bed L2 Covid facility whenever the need arises. There are seven paediatricians at District Women Hospital and two at MMG District Hospital. The four CHCs do not have a single paediatrician. Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent, DCH, said, “The drill started at 10.15am and went for two hours. Another drill will be planned after some weeks. We have also made proper arrangements for the stay of children’s parents who will remain here as attendants. No major gap was found at the DCH, which has a 30-bed dedicated PICU ward, and the hospital administration was told to improve signage inside the medical facility.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/govt-centres-test-paediatric-care-with-covid-drill/articleshow/85712664.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Noida||Combined Hospital wants medico-legal cases sent to MMG||Ghaziabad: Authorities at the District Combined Hospital, whih has been facing a staff crunch for several months, have urged the health department to direct medico-legal cases, in which surgeries and CT-scans are required, to MMG District Hospital. While the CT-scan facility at the hospital is being run on a public-private partnership model and the radiologist operates from Pune, the hospital has no surgeon for the past several months. Chief medical superintendent Dr Sanjay Teotia has written to the chief medical officer (CMO) requesting him to stop referrals of medico-legal work from community health centres and primary health centres. “CT-scans are often required in medico-legal cases. Our radiologist in Pune checks CT-scans done here online and then sends the reports. In cases where a patient’s fingerprint has to be certified by a radiologist, we cannot do much. In some cases, a radiologist has to be present during court hearings, which is not possible, because the person is in Pune. Moreover, our radiologist who works for a private firm does not want to get involved in this process,” Teotia said, adding that sometimes, such issues have led to problems between local police officers and the hospital staff as well. He said MMG hospital has the required facilities and the cases should be sent there. According to a source at the hospital, the CT-scan facility was set up about three years ago, but the number of medico-legal cases has increased in the past few months. “For the past one-and-a-half-years, the hospital was running as a Covid facility. Now that Covid patients are less, police cases are coming here almost daily,” the source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/combined-hospital-wants-medico-legal-cases-sent-to-mmg/articleshow/85712658.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government denies dumping secretariat waste in Hussainsagar, mum on satellite images||HYDERABAD: In response to a petition in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) alleging dumping of secretariat demolition debris in Hussainsagar, the state has claimed that 1.4 lakh tonnes of construction waste from the site was sent to Jeedimetla processing plant. The state affidavit, however, was silent on satellite imagery cited by petitioner Lubna Sarwat to claim old secretariat debris was being used to encroach the lake. “Applicant has raised objections that in the guise of repairing surplus weir, Hussainsagar FTL was tampered with, lake bed exposed and material dumped near Kukatpally nala. The allegations are baseless,” the state said. “It is also reiterated that Hussainsagar has two surplus weirs and six sluices. Floodwater can be directly discharged through surplus weirs as sluices are not operational since long. To repair the sluices and weir, there is additional discharge through the weir into the natural surplus course. The applicant assumed the government was dewatering and desilting Hussainsagar. There is marginal increase in water flow from the sluices due to repair but it has been curtailed,” the government said in the report to NGT. On sewerage plan in and around city, the report stated the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) quantified total sewage generation as1,950 MLD within ORR covering GHMC. “There are around 25 STPs with a capacity of 772 MLD. Shah Technical Consultants, Mumbai, was engaged by HMWS&SB to prepare the Comprehensive Sewerage Master Plan for GHMC and it suggested 31 STPs with a treatment capacity of 1,259 MLD in three packages.” Agency for construction of 17 STPs with a capacity of 376 MLD falling under Hussainsagar catchment has been finalised and work was in progress. The remaining 14 STPs along Musi and water bodies with a capacity of 883MLD are yet to get administrative sanction, the state said. There were 3 STPs of HMDA for Hussainsagar — Balkapurnala (20MLD), Picket nala (30 MLD) and Rangadhamuni Cheruvu, Kukatpally (5 MLD) — and the treated water was being discharged into the lake to maintain hydraulic balance, the state said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/govt-denies-dumping-sectt-waste-in-hussainsagar-mum-on-satellite-images/articleshow/85700326.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Pune||Registration of two-wheeler slows down in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad||PUNE: Registration of two-wheelers has slowed down in the last eight months at Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad RTOs, officials said. The number of people buying bikes/ scooters has decreased since the pandemic as a majority of them are working from home, said officials at the regional transport offices and two-wheeler dealers. Moreover, the second wave of the pandemic in April, May and June further slowed down sales as offices postponed reopening. When it comes to overall vehicle registrations in both the RTOs, the numbers are almost on par with pre-Covid times until July. “We are satisfied with the overall registrations. The registration for cars has shown positive sign, reconfirming that people are now interested in buying. Two-wheelers are a bit of a concern as their registrations might dip further in the coming months. Apart from offices, schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions are closed, and students have left for their homes. Students are also a major market for two- wheelers,” another Pune RTO official pointed out. The manager of a two-wheeler showroom in Camp said that despite new models coming into the market, there has not been much of an interest from customers. “There was a slight improvement in sales in the first two months of the year, but then the second wave hit. When things were looking up between January and March, some people thought that the offices and educational institutes would open, and enquiries and sales increased. On an average, we sold around 50 to 60 units each month (January to March. Now, things have changed again. Sales have dropped to almost six to seven every month, with almost no queries,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/registration-of-two-wheeler-slows-down-in-pune-pimpri-chinchwad/articleshow/85700322.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Hyderabad||Affordability & open spaces in east Hyderabad lure techies away from IT hub||HYDERABAD: Affordable prices, large green spaces and robust civic infrastructure is driving a large population of techies to Hyderabad’s eastern corridor, in search of homes. The daily 20 km (or more) commute to their offices in the IT corridor, they say, is hardly a deterrent. The top choices: Kompally, Yapral, Gundlapochampally among others. “The travel time from Gundlapochampally to my office in Gachibowli is 40 to 45 minutes. But with work from home becoming a regular affair, the location wasn’t a major factor while buying a house. So, I invested here as this part of town is more viable and way less congested than the western corridor,” said Prashant Mishra, an IT employee. According to industry experts, residential property rates in areas around Hi-Tec City such as Gachibowli, Kondapur, Narsingi, Nallagandla are currently pegged at anywhere between Rs8,000 and Rs12,000 per square feet (sft). In the eastern belt, these prices range from Rs4,500 to Rs6,000 per sft. The cost apart, lung spaces, access to good healthcare, educational institutions and other social infrastructure are also reasons influencing the decision of these buyers. “Areas in the IT belt are extremely concretized with very little open and green spaces. Not to forget, the heavy traffic and pollution that the area experiences on a daily basis. Kompally, on the other hand, works better for me not just in terms of the lung space but also in terms of decent schools, hospitals and other facilities available around it,” said Meenal Singh, also working in the western part of Hyderabad. Industry experts admitted to this trend fast picking up among home-buyers, especially in the last two years. “The western corridor is now overly populated. That’s burdened the civic infrastructure and resources of the area such as water, roads etc,” said Tapas Patel, chief executive officer, Om Shri Builders and Developers that has a significant presence in Yapral and its surrounding. He added: “That the outer ring road has improved connectivity of the city, is also influencing many customers.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/affordability-open-spaces-in-east-hyd-lure-techies-away-from-it-hub/articleshow/85700340.cms||Preeti Biswas

The accused is currently in judicial custody. The biker, who is reportedly unemployed and lives in the Patharghata area in New Town, has a criminal record for petty thefts. He has claimed that he was drunk on the day of the incident and admitted to have committed the crime. “We are glad that the culprit has finally been arrested. I am happy that this incident has brought together all the residents and fight in unison for my daughter as well as the issue of women safety,” said the mother of the victim. On August 17, the woman was riding a scooterette with his 13-year-old brother when the incident happened on the service road between New Town police station and Greenfield Heights complex around 10.15pm. She was returning home from her mother’s café when the man on bike started trailing her. As the woman tried to speed away, the man braked very close to her scooterette and tried to touch her when she skidded and fell off the two-wheeler. She screamed for help and the man fled seeing employees from a nearby petrol pump approaching. Cops said they had come across multiple hurdles on their road to investigation. “The CCTV footage wasn’t clear. The woman couldn’t remember the bike’s registration number or the face of the tormentor. Those who had come to the woman’s rescue hadn’t seen the man’s face either. But we kept on probing and ultimately with the help of source networking we arrested the man two days ago,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. The victim had gone for the TI parade on Thursday. However, she couldn’t identify the culprit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/man-in-cop-net-10-days-after-chasing-teasing-woman-on-bike-in-new-town/articleshow/85697813.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Mumbai||Data for OBC quota can be collected in 3 months: Ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis||MUMBAI: Opposition leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday reiterated his demand that elections to local bodies be postponed till the issue of OBC reservation is resolved. He was speaking to the media on Friday after the meeting of political parties called by the Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by Uddhav Thackeray to discuss OBC reservations. Fadnavis said the census for OBCs could be conducted on the same lines as it was done for the Marathas in four months and which had not been rejected by the courts. He said the collection of empirical data for OBC reservation could be done in three months. Most local bodies elections are to be held in early 2022. The government, he said, has not prepared any data so far. “OBC reservation has been completely done away with. Hence we have demanded that the triple test demanded by the Supreme Court be fulfilled and reservations restored. The court has asked for an empirical enquiry into political backwardness, which can be done within 2-3 months. It is the responsibility of the State Backward Commission, and if it is provided with resources, it can do it,” said Fadnavis. Shiv Sena’s minister for urban development department Eknath Shinde, speaking to the media, said the chief minister has instructed the department concerned to ensure restoration of political reservation for OBCs in the local body polls. “It was a positive discussion. Thackeray made an appeal and all-party leaders responded positively to not indulge in gaining credit for the restoration of reservation. At the same time, it has been decided to meet again next week,” he said. “The restoration may result in it (quota) shrinking in a few local bodies whereas it will increase in others to compensate the loss. Work on collecting empirical data is already underway,” he said. The OBC reservation in the local bodies was scrapped by the Supreme Court in May this year as it exceeded the 50% limit on all reservations. The apex court had read down Section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act Thackeray on Friday met leaders across party lines to discuss the issue at Sahyadri, the government guest house. As per the state proposal, the issue may be resolved by keeping all the reservations including OBC quota up to the 50% limit, considering the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (SC) population in the respective local body jurisdiction. A minister said that without touching the SC and ST quota, OBC reservation can be made applicable up to 27% if possible, else it could be less than 27% in case total reservation crosses the 50% limit. The state will seek legal opinion on the issue before taking a final decision on the reservation formula. Congress’s state president Nana Patole said, “No party has opposed the OBC reservation, and every party is of the opinion that the OBC reservation should be restored.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/data-for-obc-quota-can-be-collected-in-3-mths-in-mumbai-ex-cm/articleshow/85700362.cms||---

As many as 29.2 lakh vaccinations had taken place across over 12,000 centres in the state as per Cowin portal data till the filing of this report. Lucknow ranked best with 93,000 plus doses. This was the second highest number of doses given in the state in a day though health officials were confident that the final tally would surpass the previous mark. “This is the lion’s share (over 29%) in India’s feat of one crore plus vaccinations done on Friday,” said Dr Praful Bharadwaj, health officer, UP and member, Covid-19 vaccination Core Group, UP, adding that the hard work put in by field workers coupled with effective planning at the back-end made it happen. Among districts’ performance for the day, Lucknow ranked best with 93,000 plus doses administered followed by Prayagraj, Hardoi, Agra, Aligarh and Sitapur where more than 70,000 doses were given. Chitrakoot remained at the bottom with less than 10,000 jabs. Data from the portal showed that UP maintained its top slot in the overall doses administered category with 6.96 crore jabs undertaken. Also, the state remained way ahead of the other states on Friday too. Its nearest contender for the day was Karnataka where more than 10 lakh doses were administered. In fact, total inoculations undertaken in UP on Friday were nearly equal to the total number of doses administered in the top five states after UP (in the overall doses administered category) – Maharashtra (9.84 lakh), Gujarat (4.89 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (0.38 lakh), Rajasthan (4.59 lakh) and Karnataka (10.7 lakh). On the overall scale, 5.87 core persons in UP have taken at least one dose, while 1.09 crore are fully vaccinated. Among districts, Lucknow, Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Gorakhpur, Meerut, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi and Bareilly have more than 15 lakh people having taken at least one dose of the vaccine.

The patrolmen will wear the GPS devices while on duty. The devices would enable the top officials to track their real-time location. “The job of the patrolmen is important. Their job involves patrolling the railway tracks, carefully observing the tracks and reporting anything suspicious that might affect train movement. During the monsoon, they have to look for water accumulation and flow of water, which might sweep away the tracks and also check for possibility of landslide or rock fall. Each man needs to walk on the tracks for 4-5km. It was observed that some of them were not doing their job seriously, so giving them the GPS devices was important,” a rail official said. The official said there were cases when the men did not report to work, but said they were at the spot or used roads near the tracks to cover the distance without checking the tracks. “According to the earlier system, their superiors had to move in rail trolleys and physically check whether they were on their beats. Surprise inspections had to be conducted. Now this will not be required. If the GPS device is switched off or the location of a patrolman is different, he can be immediately contacted, questioned and action can be initiated,” another official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/gps-trackers-for-patrolmen/articleshow/85700386.cms||Joy Sengupta

The city’s residents are fed up with the leadership of the BJP, which has failed on many fronts in the last five years. People now want a change and we will provide a strong alternative,” he said. Many senior leaders from the party were in the fray for the post of city chief, however, the party’s top brass threw their weight behind Bagwe. Party sources said that Bagwe’s long political experience must have led to his reappointment ahead of the crucial polls.  “The Congress has done a lot for the city. We will now go to the citizens with details of the work done by the party,” Bagwe, a former MLA and minister said. He said that meetings and gatherings of party workers at block levels will begin soon.

The work along this stretch poses a challenge due to the space constraint given that there is barely any space between unfinished flyover and adjoining buildings in several places. Dismantling of the stretch will start from the first week of September and will continue for the next three months. “Work of the first phase of dismantling work is completed. The road on which the stretch has been dismantled will be restored by KMC,” said a KMDA official. The traffic blockade between Ganesh Talkies and Girish Park was done six hours earlier than originally scheduled with the agency appointed by KMDA to dismantle the flyover deciding to shift the equipment from Strand Road-Posta to Girish Park on Thursday afternoon. The stretch was shut down after local traffic guards ensure there were no vehicles parked there. The smooth transition was also largely possible due to the relocation of milk traders to a new address on Rabindra Sarani. They had followed police instructions and parked their trucks outside the barricaded section of Vivekananda Road. KMDA will now barricade the stretch from Ganesh Talkies to Girish Park. Officials said that trials had been conducted to ensure minimum vibration during work and KMDA will compensate if any building suffers damage. “This 250m stretch is the most challenging for us, not only because the existing structure is the most damaged but also because there aer several buildings adjacent to the flyover. Trial runs have been conducted on Strand Road to check the level of vibration during the dismantling work. No building should suffer any damage. However, if there is any damage, compensation will be provided,” said a KMDA official. Tram services will remain suspended on MG Road during the second phase of dismantling work.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/posta-flyover-demolition-enters-second-phase/articleshow/85697840.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Hyderabad||Demand for platelets shoots up as dengue cases surge in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: With seven out of 10 critical patients in hospitals turning out to be dengue patients, the demand for platelets, especially single donor platelets has sky-rocketed. Apart from pleas on social media groups, most blood banks are seeing requests for 10 to 20 units each day and the situation is only likely to worsen further, experts say. “Despite reaching out to friends, acquaintances, blood banks and highly active social media groups, patients’ relatives are spending 24 hours on an average to get donors and dozens of requests are pouring in,” said the Red Cross Blood Bank. The same was echoed by Aarohi Blood Bank in the city. In one such case, relatives made more than 50 calls and reached out for all possible options to get platelets. “My 14-year-old nephew was very critical with less than 5,000 platelet count on Saturday and despite all attempts we could get just one unit by Saturday night. The next day we got another unit from police and some other groups reached out to us. He is now recovering and is in the ICU but I would say we were lucky to get it on time,” said Srikanth Uyala, adding that due to the Covid-19 situation, donors continue to be reluctant to donate. Srikanth had posted a request on Twitter on Saturday. Apart from reluctance from donors, single donor platelets are not stored by blood banks as they can only be stored up to five days. Blood banks are offering to segregate the platelets but it is difficult to get a donor. “We are seeing up to five requests per day each asking for 1 or 2 units. Unlike earlier when we used to get requests for plasma, we are now seeing requests for platelets, especially since the last 10 days,” said Arun Daniel Yellamaty, founder, Youngistan Foundation. A platelet transfusion, meanwhile, is required when the platelet count drops below 10,000 from its normal range of 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. “If the platelet count is less than 10,000 or if there is bleeding manifestation like blood in urine, stool, stomach or brain then blood transfusion is required,” said Dr MN Lakshmikant Reddy, consultant internal medicine, Medicover hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/demand-for-platelets-shoots-up-as-dengue-cases-surge/articleshow/85700374.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Supreme Court upholds bail for Kalyan youth accused of IS ties||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a special leave petition filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to challenge the bail confirmed by the Bombay high court for Kalyan youth Areeb Majeed, accused of alleged Islamic State (IS) links following his visit to Syria. A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and A S Bopanna dismissed the agency’s challenge, upholding the bail granted in February to Majeed. Bombay high court had confirmed his bail on February 23 and he was released on March 5. Majeed had been arrested on November 28, 2014, on arrival at Mumbai airport. Observing the likelihood of his trial being delayed for a “considerable period”, the HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale had confirmed bail that was granted by a special NIA court last year. The bench had cited his fundamental right to life in the context of the right to speedy trial. The bail was for Rs 1 lakh with two solvent surety bonds in like amount. The rigours under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act that make granting of bail difficult in terror cases would “melt down when there is no likelihood of trial being completed in a reasonable time…,’’ said the HC bench, stressing on the aspect being “significant’’ in Majeed’s case given the time he has already spent behind bars. The HC noted the “process of examining 51 prosecution witnesses has taken more than five years and there are 107 more witnesses” to be examined by NIA. It, however, partly allowed an NIA plea by setting aside findings on merits of the case and upholding the bail only on the grounds pendency of trial and his incarceration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-upholds-bail-for-kalyan-youth-accused-of-is-ties/articleshow/85700422.cms||Swati Deshpande

Members of the group are mostly people who were once associated with the movement. They have crowd-sourced for the renovation that will take place on Saturday. The memorial commemorates the sacrifices of Bidhu Sarkar, Anup Bhons, Kesto Sanyal, Shanku Dutta, Sukumar Bhattacharya, Gobindo Chakraborty, Shekhar Guha, Shankar Das and Samir Bhowmik. Writer Supriyo Chowdhury, during one of his recent visits to College Street, felt extremely sad to find out the unkempt condition of the memorial. He wrote about it on Facebook and appealed to people for its restoration. “The stories of these nine youths are not found in textbooks. So there is an urgent need to renovate this memorial, which brings back memories of Calcutta during the seventies,” said Chowdhury. Sunish Deb, retired public servant, recalled one of the most shocking incidents of his life. “On October 28, 1970, I went to meet Sukumar-da. We were talking when some policemen arrested me. I got the news of his death while they were taking me to a police station. It was unbelievable that the person whom I met a few minutes ago was murdered,” said Deb. Sajal Mitra, who was an active member of Naxalite movement, fears that with the passing of a generation that had the first-hand experience of the horrors of state atrocities, there will be no one to recount these tales of precious sacrifices. They will be lost forever. Sumit Chowdhury, another member of the group, said the initiative has been taken to reassert the unstructured history that are available on the streets itself. He added that many people from the older generation to the present generation will be present on Saturday for the renovation of the memorial.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/citizens-group-crowd-fund-to-renovate-naxal-memorial/articleshow/85697843.cms||Dipawali Mitra

The judge on Thursday directed the prison authorities to produce KSBL chairman before the court on or before September 6. As of now, Parthasarathy is in judicial remand in connection with a case filed by IndusInd Bank. After he is produced before the magistrate, a decision will be taken by the judge on granting judicial remand in the two cases filed by HDFC. “Yes, PT warrant in two pending cases against Parthasarathy was moved in court,’‘ a senior officer in Hyderabad police confirmed. In Hyderabad Central Crime Station (CCS), there are three cases against the KSBL chairman and a few others for defaulting on a total of Rs780 crore loan. Similarly, in Cyberabad police commissionerate, ICICI Bank filed a case against KSBL for committing Rs563 crore fraud. Parthasarathy was in the custody of Hyderabad police for two days till Thursday and faced a volley of questions from investigators. Now, cops have sought three more days from the court for interrogation. The advocate of the accused opposed the police’s plea for extension of custodial interrogation. The arguments in this issue were completed on Thursday and the court’s decision on the issue is awaited. The investigators told the court that they need to verify some documents in the presence of Parthasarathy to seek his clarification.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/karvy-scam-cops-move-prison-transit-warrants-in-2-cases/articleshow/85700420.cms||Srinath Vudali

A special MCOCA court on Friday sent the lawyer to police custody remand till September 1. Barate was arrested in July and the police were probing those who sheltered him during the period he was at large. “Barate told the police he was staying at a lawyer’s residence at Mhaske Vasti, on Alandi road. He knew Barate was wanted in several cases, but still sheltered him,” assistant commissioner of police (crime-1) Surendranath Deshmukh said. “We verified the lawyer’s role and, after technical investigation, established his involvement in sheltering Barate.

The work was initiated by the Thanjavur project implementation unit (PIU) of NHAI in August 2020. While at least 50% of the construction work was supposed to be completed by now, only 15% has been accomplished. The contractor is laying the service roads and stormwater drains for the past one year now. The major work involving the erection of pillars for is yet to commence. “Seeing the pace of work going on, it seems we have to endure the congestion and safety risks for two more years. There is no progress in the flyover project,” S Panjabagesan, a resident of Thiruverumbur said. The 800m-long flyover will take off near Bhel factory’s training centre bus stop and ends near Thiruverumbur taluk office, bypassing the Ganesa roundabout, which witnesses heavy vehicles meeting with accidents frequently due to a wrong alignment. The flyover was proposed to help Thanjavur and Trichy-bound commuters to skip the industrial area, especially when Bhel workers leave the factory which results in congestion. “We are working to get a revised design approval from the regional office of NHAI in Madurai to commence the flyover’s structural work. Construction work will be expedited soon,” a senior official with the NHAI said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/a-year-after-bhel-flyover-work-drags-on/articleshow/85700427.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Meerut||HC gives UP 3 months to probe land grabbing in crucial corridor joining Corbett & Rajaji||Meerut: The Allahabad high court has directed the Uttar Pradesh government to wind up in three months its ongoing inquiry into the encroachment of over 12,000-acre land inside a crucial forest corridor which connects Rajaji National Park with Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve and sees heavy movement of wild animals. Over the last six decades, starting 1950s, businessmen and locals from UP, Punjab, Rajasthan and as far as Assam grabbed land units inside the reserve forest stretch. For this, the land records were fudged, suggesting complicity of revenue department officials. A large part of the corridor passes through Najibabad forest division of Bijnor and sees regular movement of wild animals. Even the riverbed of Kho river, a tributary of Ganga, has been encroached. Soon after a TOI report on the massive encroachments, the UP government had in October last year formed a four-member high-level panel comprising commissioner of Board of Revenue, UP, DM of Bijnor, Joint Director of Consolidation Directorate, Lucknow, and Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) of Bijnor to look into it. The high court has now directed the state government to complete the probe within three months while hearing a petition filed by a whistleblower in the case, Kishan Chand, who is a stenographer in the office of sub-divisional magistrate in Najibabad, Bijnor. Chand said that it has been nine month since the probe was constituted, but the committee is yet to submit its report. Speaking to TOI, Chand said, “The committee was formed in October. I had approached the court after four months, in February 2021, seeking its status and report. But the Covid-19 struck and the courts were shut. No hearing took place until June end. The court directions came on August 24.” A division bench comprising acting Chief Justice MN Bhandari and AK Ojha gave the direction. In August last year, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), which comes under the Union environment ministry, had also asked the UP government to file a report on the encroachment on the Najibabad forest division. The state government had then asked the district administration to file a response. The then district magistrate (DM) had admitted to having found prima facie evidence that revenue records of Telipada village were fudged. Telipada is one of the 12 villages flagged by the whistleblower where encroachment took place. The then Bijnor DM Ramakant Pandey had said, “Lucknow administration had sought some information based on the TOI report on the allegation. But let me tell you the discrepancy dates back to the early 50s and during those times rules were different.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/hc-gives-up-3-months-to-probe-land-grabbing-in-crucial-corridor-joining-corbett-rajaji/articleshow/85695830.cms||Sandeep Rai

The airline said it will operate a weekly service on Thursdays. It had been operating 14 flights a week before suspending operations in the last week of March 2020. According to airline sources, flight UL 131/132 would arrive in Trichy at 10 am and leave at 11 am every Thursday. In a statement to its trade partners, the airlines stated that it has resumed acceptance of passengers travelling on tourist visa from India. The protocol with guidelines of Covid-19 with a change in the approval process and quarantine measures for those travelling on tourist visa has been circulated and it should be strictly followed by the partners. Accordingly, a negative RT-PCR test done within 72 hours of travel is mandatory for travellers age above 2 years who must also undergo a PCR test upon arrival at the destination. Though all international airlines suspended their service to Trichy amid pandemic, travel agents said this situation has created an opportunity for Trichy to handle several flights from various foreign destinations that had not yet started services. Regular services by various international airlines to Trichy from Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait are yet to be resumed. However, flights under Vande Bharat Mission and special arrangements have been operated from Doha, Dubai, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi by Air India Express and IndiGo Air to Trichy.

---||Pune||FYJC cut-off marks dip in all three streams in Pune colleges this year against all odds||PUNE: In a big surprise and contrary to the general expectations after the results of all the education boards for Std X , the cut-off percentages for admissions to all streams for First Year Junior College in the city have reduced this year when compared with last year. Except for the cut-off marks in the science stream in Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, which increased by two marks to 97% from 96.6%, in a majority of the other colleges, the cut-off marks have reduced, in all the three streams. At Fergusson College, a student needed 96.4% this year for admission to the science stream, down from last year’s 97%. For arts in the same college, a student had to have scored 97% this year, a slight fall from last year’s 97.4%. The admission to the same stream in Symbiosis college closed at 93.4% , a dip from last year’s 96.6%. The top commerce colleges in the city, BMCC and Symbiosis, commanded 95.2% and 91% this year. Last year, it was 96.4% and 94.2%, respectively. Principals said fewer high scoring students from the Vidarbha-Marathwada region applying in Pune colleges due to the Covid-19 situation as well as financial constraints because of the pandemic could be the reasons for the cut-off marks falling. The decrease in cut-off marks in the merit list also proved the assumption wrong that since the board exams were cancelled, students were randomly given high marks in Std X using the internal assessment formula. Seema Purohit, principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce, said there was a decrease in cut-off marks across the streams in the city colleges, this year. “We would know more when the actual admissions happen, but there is a chance that students from Marathwada and Vidarbha areas have chosen colleges near their homes instead of Pune colleges due to the Covid-19 situation in cities,” she said. In BMCC, 40-45% of the students are from this region and many from the Latur region scored very high, increasing the overall cut-off marks, she added. The second reason could be the deep financial crises brought on by the pandemic that most families from the rural areas face. “ It will stop them from sending their children to colleges in Pune as the expenses are high here,” Purohit added. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of the Laxmanrao Apte Prashala , said she is unable to understand the phenomena, a sentiment shared by many other educators. The fact that so many students scored high in Std X should have reflected in the FYJC admissions in the increase in the cut-off marks. That it has not happened is surprising, she added. “As for the increase in the cut-off marks in our science stream, parents prefer a school-like atmosphere for their children for Stds XI and XII, especially in these uncertain times. We follow the school pattern in FYJC too, which means no loitering around, compulsory attendance, completing your classwork and homework. Our online classes are also strict and is an added reason for students and parents choosing our school,” Sinnarkar said. Hrishikesh Soman, principal of Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce, said while the merit list is baffling, it also proves that there was no random award of marks in Std X. “The Std X marks were based on the internal marks obtained by the student in Std X and Std IX. While it is true that more students passed Std X this year compared with the last year, maybe the top scorers were rationalised. Also, there is a chance that more students who scored high also opted for diploma/ITI courses among others,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/fyjc-cut-off-marks-dip-in-all-three-streams-in-city-colleges-this-year-against-all-odds/articleshow/85700454.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

General secretary of the MDMK, Vaiko has appealed to the state government to fulfil the demands of the Manapparai people. State higher education minister K Ponmudi had on Thursday announced that 10 new government arts and science colleges will be established across the state, including Virudhunagar, Kallakurichi and Vellore districts. “Youths in Manapparai are dependent on Trichy district headquarters for the higher education. The scenario must change. The chief minister M K Stalin should intervene and give a solution,” Vaiko said in a statement. The leader’s demand comes after the locals took to social media platforms to express their disappointment. “The demand was one of the poll promises of all political parties. It was a DMK candidate who got elected to the assembly from Manapparai. Since the locality has many youths from below poverty line families, the state government should understand the significance of the demand,” Sakthivel Rengasamy, a resident of Manapparai said. The locals have planned to register their protest if the demand was not reconsidered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/manapparai-residents-upset-as-demand-for-govt-college-not-met/articleshow/85700485.cms||---

Apart from penalising the violators for their respective offences, the traffic inspector conducts a small awareness session near the road by involving the violators so as to prevent them from repeating the same offence. S Mathivanan, the inspector attached to Fort range in Trichy city responsible for overseeing traffic movement in Chathiram bus stand, Melachinthamani, Sasthri road and Chennai bypass said he opted for the awareness speech as a tool to make people realise the severity of their offence. On spotting youths riding triples in two-wheeler and those riding without helmets, the inspector moves them to vacant space adjacent to the road and sensitises them on the Motor Vehicles Act. Similarly, on being informed about youngsters waiting to avail driving license at the RTO campuses, the inspector volunteers to meet them and convey the importance of good samaritan law to help people injured in accidents. “People who help injured road users will not be asked to report as a witness. They can help the injured without any reservation,” Mathivanan tells the youths who obtained a driving license. At the Anna statue, the inspector utilises a temporary shelter to educate pedestrians without facemask. “If the commuter has an emergency work, I will only penalise. Others will be sensitised for 10 to 15 minutes about the road safety protocols. Mostly, there will be no recurrence of an offence by the same violator,” Mathivanan told TOI. Two-wheelers violating one-way routes and youngsters riding without a valid driving license were among those who were lectured. Mathivanan uses the public address system in the traffic signals to build road safety and Covid-19 awareness among the commuters waiting in the signals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/traffic-cops-awareness-drive-to-stop-violations-on-trichy-roads-earns-praise/articleshow/85700514.cms||---

Claiming he will not rest till the last Dalit family was covered, the CM urged intellectuals to take a proactive role and enlighten Dalits on the scheme. “The scheme will turn into a movement in the country,” he said. At a review meeting on Dalit Bandhu in Karimnagar district collectorate, KCR said the scheme was not aimed at garnering votes during elections. He said his government was viewing implementation of Dalit Bandhu as a ‘maha yagna’. The government will spend about Rs20,000 crore to Rs30,000 crore on two to three lakh Dalit families a year via the scheme, he said. “About Rs1.75 lakh crore will be spent on Dalits in a phased manner.” As per Samagra Kutumba survey, there are17 lakh Dalit families with 75 lakh population, which works out to 18% of the state’s population. “With the population rising, we will also try to increase the reservations to SCs in the state,” KCR said The CM said the scheme was to be launched last year but was delayed due to the pandemic. “I have been thinking about the scheme for a long time. When I was an MLA of Siddipet, I implemented Dalit Chaitanya Jyothi and worked for growth of Dalits.” “The condition of Dalits all over the country is pathetic. If we see their condition in north India, it’s worse,” he said. Ministers T Harish Rao, K Eshwar and Gangula Kamalakar, Rajya Sabha MP J Santosh Kumar and officials were present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dalit-bandhu-is-a-maha-yagna-says-cm/articleshow/85700539.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Pune||Maharashtra: For schools’ reopening, Covid task force advises shorter hours, 2 shifts, no lifts||PUNE: The state government’s Paediatric Covid Task Force has recommended staggering school hours in two shifts and not more than four hours, alternate days of physical and online classes, restricting the use of lifts and less focus on academics during the first two weeks as the state government considers reopening of schools. Dr Pramod Jog, member of the task force, told TOI on Friday that the recommendations are a medical advice to reorganise schools. “They must introduce new procedures, particularly reduce the number of students at a given time and reset the classroom arrangements to maintain physical distancing at all times. All the staff members, including teachers, will have to be fully vaccinated before coming for work,” he said. Paediatrician Dr Vijay Yewale, another member of the task force, said avoiding lifts can minimize Covid-19 transmission in schools and will preclude the possibility of children crowding in the elevators. “Schools that have been shut for more than a year will have to be deep cleaned before reopening. Air-conditioners will have to be avoided. Like the 50% occupancy concept in restaurants, reducing the number of students attending school at a time has been recommended by staggering school shifts and days,” he added. The task force has recommended that the authorities not focus too much on academics for a week or two for student to get used to the new rules. “Children have been through different experiences since last year, which could in some cases include losing a near one to Covid. It is better not to immediately bombard them with academics and give them time to adjust to the new environment,” he said. Experts said the education department may consider these recommendations along with the standard operating protocol created, and both could be clubbed. “The task force has also suggested staggering the lunch break over a two-hour period instead of half an hour to allow fewer children to be sent for meals at a time. Encouraging children to walk to school if it is near by, so as to not crowd school buses, reducing seating in each school bus with adequate distancing between two students, avoiding air-conditioned transport vehicles, creating a school health clinic where ever possible are also part of the recommendations,” Dr Jog added. A health clinic, possible only in some schools, should have a thermometer, pulse oxymeters, basic medication like paracetamol, ORS and first-aid box. If a child is unwell, he should be referred to the nearest hospital or sent home with parent, as per one of the recommendations. The task force recommended regular PTA meetings where parents can be explained to not send a child to school if unwell or if there is a Covid patient in the family or the residence is in a containment zone. It also said that a child who suffered from Covid can be sent to school after 14 days from onset of illness without repeating a SarsCoV2 test.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/for-schools-reopening-task-force-advises-shorterhours-2-shifts-no-lifts/articleshow/85700501.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Yuva Sainik’ part of Juhu clashes rewarded with post||MUMBAI: Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday appointed Mohsin Sheikh as the Yuva Sena’s joint secretary after he faced the brunt of police lathis during the Sena’s protest outside union minister Narayan Rane’s Juhu residence on Wednesday. Shaikh’s photos of being lathi-charged by the police with some of his clothes torn had gone viral. Shaikh was injured in the clashes on Wednesday. “Congratulations on the election of Yuva Sena’s daring tiger Mohsin Sheikh as the Joint Secretary of Yuva Sena!” Yuva Sena secretary Varun Sardesai tweeted on Friday. Political observers said that Sheikh was rewarded for this fight against Rane. Sena insiders said that with the Yuva Sena now at the centre of the streetfights with the BJP, the party is likely to give tickets to around 12 to 15 Yuva Sena functionaries for the upcoming BMC elections. Already Yuva Sena functionaries like Amey Ghole and Samadhan Sarvankar are corporators, while others like Sainath Durghe and Rahul Kanal have been appointed members on BMC committees. Some of the Yuva Sena’s faces who will bag tickets for the elections are also likely to be from the minority community. Sheikh was earlier in the NCP. He joined the Sena in 2017. His wife Nadia Sheikh is NCP corporator from Mankhurd. With Yuva Sena office-bearers and functionaries leading the charge for the Sena against Rane after his comments, the Aaditya-led youth wing has shed its image of being a soft and dormant organisation. Right since it was launched in 2010, the Yuva Sena has overshadowed the Bhartiya Vidyarthi Sena (BVS), which was earlier known for its militant street politics. Yuva Sena members who protested outside Rane’s residence met the CM, a leader from the party’s youth wing said. The meeting took place on Tuesday night at Thackeray’s official residence Varsha, said Sardesai, who led the team during the protest. Aaditya Thackeray was present at the meet. The CM Thackeray reportedly applauded Yuva Sena’s actions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-yuva-sainik-part-of-juhu-clashes-rewarded-with-post/articleshow/85700526.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kolkata||Calcutta University adds seats in Maulana, Scottish, 3 others||KOLKATA: Calcutta University has given five of its affiliated colleges, including Maulana Azad and Scottish Church, the final sanction to increase seats to accommodate deserving candidates from among the record high number of applicants. As undergraduate applications closed on Friday, Presidency University logged 58,000 applications for 665 seats, Jadavpur University 55,000 for 1,066 seats in arts and science streams and Calcutta University’s Scottish Church and Surendranath colleges, among others, more than 50,000 each. Several institutes said they received new applications even on Friday and most claimed the number had risen four-to-five times the usual figure. Maulana Azad College principal Subhasis Dutta said they have received 41,000 applications. “The number of applications this time is beyond our expectations,” he said. A few days ago, CU had asked the college to apply for seat increase and to add 32 berths. Most added seats are in science subjects. “We have been urging for seat increase since 2019 in various subjects. It has finally been approved at a time when application number is huge,” Dutta added. Scottish Church, which has received 58,878 applications, got the CU sanction to increase 37 seats. Principal Madhumanjari Mandal Choubey said, “This year, the application number is very high. But it also gives us a sense of satisfaction that such large number of students want to study at our college. We are confident all seats will be filled up,” she said. Apart from the five colleges that have got the final approval, more institutes under CU are being screened to be granted the seat-increase nod. According to the norms, 10% seats can be added for honours subjects and 15% for general courses in a college at a time. “The CU Syndicate has clear resolution on this, we cannot go beyond it,” CU vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee told TOI. After the undergraduate application deadline was extended from August 20 to 27, Jadavpur University received 5,000 new applications in the extended week and Presidency 1,000. JU registrar Snehamanju Basu said, “The number of applications has gone up. The number is very high and we have very little time to prepare the merit list.” Like others, Bethune and Lady Brabourne have also been swamped, with Bethune logging over 28,000 applications for 480 seats and Lady Brabourne over 33,000 for 600 seats. Lady Brabourne principal Siuli Sarkar said, “The applications during the extended period were mostly from students who received their revised mark sheets late.” A few institutes wound up form submission by Friday evening and started sorting. But for most, the deadline will end at Saturday midnight.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cu-adds-seats-in-maulana-scottish-3-others/articleshow/85700544.cms||---

The ‘Dandora’ public meetings have been held at Indravelli in Adilabad and Raviryala in Chevella Parliamentary constituency. Two ‘Deekshas’ have also been held, one demanding minority Bandhu and another one for SCs and STs development which was a two-day affair. While former TPCC president Uttam and MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy were absent from the two ‘Dandora’ meetings, the former attended the minority morcha held at Dharna Sthal near Indira Park in the city. In the case of Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, he has not attended any of the four meetings. Komatireddy had openly expressed his unhappiness over A Revanth Reddy being elevated as president of the state Congress. Though all these seniors have been citing various reasons for not attending the meetings, a senior leader in the AICC told TOI that the issue has been brought to the notice of the party leadership in Delhi. A senior AICC leader said: “The party leadership is seriously looking into the issue. The seniors have to start attending the ‘Dandora’ meetings failing which they would have to explain their position to the party high command.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cong-senior-leaders-missing-in-action/articleshow/85700563.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Commuters’ nightmare on broken stretches made worse in monsoon||GURUGRAM: Broken and potholed roads in several parts of the city have become a pain for the commuters. Pataudi road, Basai road, Sector 37C road, internal roads in Sector 10, the stretch from Hero Honda Chowk to Umang Bhardwaj Chowk, Dwarka Expressway road are among the worst affected. And with the monsoon rains, residents say all these stretches have taken a turn for the worse and are in need of urgent repair. The Sector 37C road is completely damaged, adding to the misery of the commuters using the stretch daily. “For the past four years, we have been raising the issue on different platforms and also brought this to the notice of the local MLA. But our repeated complaints have only fallen on deaf ears,” said Deepchand Yadav, a resident. “Around 5,000 families live in this area in different housing societies and use this road. And every time it rains, the stretch becomes accident-prone as potholes as deep as four feet appear.” Several stretches on Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and Sector 86 are also in bad shape. Residents say the major problem they face while raising complaints is to first identify the jurisdiction of the roads since a number of government agencies are involved. “I live in Sector 86 and have to commute everyday to my workplace in Sector 44. There is not even a 100-metre stretch on the road that I take from Circle 4 towards Rampura Chowk, which is even and not damaged. The authorities should fix the stretches on priority so that traffic snarls and accidents are prevented,” said Nitin Gupta, a resident. MCG officials say they are planning a major overhaul of the main roads that come under the civic body’s jurisdiction. “We are planning to completely redesign Pataudi road and the estimated cost of the project will be around Rs 150 crore. We are also planning to repair and fix Sector 10A and other roads under MCG’s jurisdiction. Work will begin soon,” said Thakur Lal Sharma, chief engineer, MCG. GMDA officials did not respond to TOI’s queries. The stretch extending from Hero Honda Chowk to Umang Bhardwaj Chowk comes under GMDA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/commuters-nightmare-on-broken-stretches-made-worse-in-monsoon/articleshow/85702841.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 4-day rush for provisional lists to weed out errors||KOLKATA: The window between receiving all undergraduate applications on August 27 and publishing merit lists by August 31 may be of merely four days, but universities and colleges will put up a provisional list in between to weed out errors as well as fake applications. Presidency University will publish a provisional general merit list on August 30 and ask applicants for online reporting on August 31 and September 1 to cross-check their credentials. Earlier, the general provisional merit list was to be published on August 27. “We will try our best to publish a merit list, which is free of all errors. All of us are working together in that direction,” said a head of the department who is also a member of the admission committee. Lady Brabourne College will publish a subject-wise provisional merit list on August 29. Applicants can report discrepancies, if any, on August 29 and 30. A revised comprehensive merit list will be published on August 31. Some dates have been changed at Scottish Church College, too. “A provisional merit for Phase 1 will be published on August 29 and the final merit list on August 31. The first leg of admission will begin on September 1,” said Scottish Church principal Madhumanjari Mandal. The change of application deadline—from August 20 to August 27—has apparently turned the arrangements at Ashutosh College upside down as the authorities there had finished conducting online reporting and preparing an initial merit list before August 20. “But the extension of deadline for application till August 27 changed everything. All the ranks on the merit list will change again. Those who appeared for online reporting will again have to do so on August 28, August 29, and August 30. We will have to go through the same procedure all over again. We will also have to ensure that the merit list is free of errors and does not contain any fake application,” said a member of the admission committee. From conducting online reporting and scrutinizing applications to weeding out fake applications and putting up names of eligible candidates, college authorities will have their hands full for the next four days till the last date for publication of merit list on August 31. According to the guidelines by the education department, colleges and universities are supposed to publish merit lists by August 31 and wrap up admissions by September 30 so that classes for new semester can start from October. Many principals have, however, expressed concern over shortening of the gap between receiving applications and publishing merit lists. Given the time shortage, in many colleges, the staff will work this Saturday, despite it being a holiday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/4-day-rush-for-provisional-lists-to-weed-out-errors/articleshow/85700621.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Chandigarh||Rs 16 crore needed for roads, paver blocks in villages: Chandigarh municipal corporation||CHANDIGARH: The building and roads (B&R) wing of the municipal corporation’s engineering department has prepared a financial estimate of Rs 15.88 crore to construct roads and fix paver blocks in villages transferred to the civic body from the UT administration a couple of years back. The amount was fixed following an inspection of these villages by officials. Outer area roads of most of the villages were found to be recarpeted and in a poor condition as compared to others. Village and location-wise financial estimates have been prepared. A total of 20 works of different villages have been identified and prepared, which need to be done as per the laid down specifications. The financial estimate of the work of each village is varying from Rs 9 lakh to Rs 1 crore according to its area and scope. As the MC is suffering a fund crunch, it has written to the UT administration to give special financial grant to carry out these works. “The administration had given Rs 50 crore dedicated works for the development of the villages. This amount is being spent on the works related to public health, which comprises works related to sewage and storms lines. Since the tender process of these works has completed, majority of the works have even allotted to the competent contractors and companies as per the laid down terms and conditions. Therefore, for the road works of the B&R wing, we need money from the Chandigarh administration and they have been requested for the same,” a senior officer of the MC said. As these villages have no municipal councillors now, the nominated councilors have been given these villages to look after them to listen to residents’ problems. The nominated councillors had held regular meeting with people. It based on this feedback that the engineering department had prepared the plan. Box: Works start in 2nd week of Sept All road recarpeting works have been closed owing to the monsoon season. Sources in the MC said the works will start by the second week of September. Since the rainy and extreme winter seasons are not considered good to lay down new roads, the authority prefers to avoid spending money in these seasons. Out of around Rs 38 crore for road recarpeting works of the last financial year, the MC has yet to complete around Rs 19 crore works on the ground. The MC has already received dedicated funds for these works.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/rs-16cr-needed-for-roads-paver-blocks-in-villages-says-mc-dept/articleshow/85697935.cms||Deepak Yadav

Raut told reporters, “BJP and Shiv Sena had difference of opinion over some issues, but our relationship never turned bitter. The leaders, who joined BJP in the last few years, have spoiled the relationship between the two parties. Their notoriety is similar to that of Bangladeshi and Pakistani infiltrators, who disturb our social harmony here (in India).” “...The way Rane is acting, he is displaying animosity. What kind of person the BJP has appointed to improve our relationship,” he said sarcastically. Raut added: “We know that the relationship between late (Sena founder) Balasaheb Thackeray and Atalji as well as Advaniji was cordial.

---||Ahmedabad||Bopal Sewer Deaths: ‘Stop blame game, take responsibility’||AHMEDABAD: With three workers meeting a tragic end while cleaning a manhole in Bopal on Thursday, the classic game of passing the buck has begun. “We will take at least two days to prepare a report on the sequence of incidents that led to the deaths. The contractor is responsible for providing protective gear to the employees he engages. First let the report be submitted,” says AB Gor, CEO of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority. “If you have given a contract to someone to build your house won’t you oversee if work is done properly? A civic authority cannot shrug off responsibility after outsourcing work it is supposed to execute. It is its responsibility to ensure that the contractor follows rules,” said Ravindra Bhartiya, an RTI activist working for rights of manhole workers. Bhartiya has found many instances in Gujarat where contractors hire local sub-contractors who provide daily wage labourers to clean drains. “There is supposed to be a vigilance committee under the district collectorate to check the safety of workers, but this is not followed,” he said. The contracts mention 44 conditions -- including provision of safety gear like masks with oxygen apparatus, safety lines, gumshoes etc -- in case a worker has to enter a manhole. “All laws protecting the rights of manhole workers are in place including the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act 2013, 2014 order, Gujarat HC directions and Gujarat government affidavits. Implementation of these laws should be the state’s priority,” said High Court advocate Hirak Ganguly, who represented petitioner Parsottam Vaghela in his writ petition in 2016 seeking proper implementation of SC’s landmark order on manhole workers. Gandhinagar and Surat municipal corporations have procured robots for manhole cleaning. “Authorities must identify such technology and deploy them to eliminate human intervention,” Ganguly said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/stop-blame-game-take-responsibility/articleshow/85700677.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

One of them was celebrating his birthday. Police said the three teenagers were not wearing helmets and the bike was cruising at the time of the accident. The accident occurred when the teenagers were on their way back to their Devuni Erravalli village in Rangareddy district after purchasing a cake in Chevella town to celebrate the birthday of H Jayavardhan (16). “At about 7.15 pm, Jayavardhan lost control over the two-wheeler possibly due to speeding.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Yellow bins go missing, Covid waste spills on road||KOLKATA: Fifteen months after installation, several yellow bins, meant for Covid waste disposal, have gone missing from roads and streets across the city. This has resulted in the Covid waste strewn on roads in various parts of the city. According to a Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s health department official, the lack of vigilance by the civic body’s Covid-combat team had resulted in the disappearance of the bins earmarked for the disposal of household Covid waste in several neighbourhoods. “With the Covid graph of the city taking a downward turn, our vigilance against the dumping of household Covid wastes on roads also slackened,” said a KMC health department official. According to a civic official, the KMC health department had procured 2,000 yellow bins for the disposal of household Covid waste in June 2020. However, a source in the KMC health department conceded that over 400 such bins couldn’t be placed in several areas across the city. A TOI team found several unused yellow bins gathering dust as they are lying dumped in the civic body’s ward health centres. The results have been obvious. Large parts of the city such as Jadavpur, Baghajatin, Tollygunge, Garia, Patuli, Behala roads are getting littered with masks, gloves, adult diapers or medicine strips. A KMC doctor said that though the number of Covid positive patients has dropped to a large extent, that doesn’t mean there is any room for complacency. “If roads are getting littered with masks only, it can lead to a health hazard as there could be asymptomatic patients in a neighbourhood,” said the KMC doctor, who is a part of the civic body’s Covid combat team. Sources in the KMC health department said the yellow bins were installed more than a year ago after the private agency, engaged by the civic body, complained of the kitchen waste mixing with Covid waste from large households. “After we installed yellow bins earmarked for disposal of Covid wastes in the majority of the KMC wards, the agency has witnessed positive results, particularly in some Covid-sensitive areas,” said a KMC official. However, a section of the KMC health officials agreed that there was still the threat of the kitchen waste mixing with Covid wastes from some neighbourhoods. “If we want to eliminate the risk of a health hazard, we need to install more bins in the areas, where there are no bins or lesser number of bins for the disposal of Covid wastes,” said a KMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/yellow-bins-go-missing-cov-waste-spills-on-road/articleshow/85698069.cms||Saikat Ray

I committed no crime. This was only a show of power. In future we too shall be in power,” he said, adding that he knew “many secrets” which he would “reveal slowly.” Rane addressed a series of press conferences in Ratnagiri, where he resumed his Jan Aashirwad Yatra on Friday. The yatra had been interrupted by his arrest and subsequent release earlier this week. Rane had been arrested following complaints filed by Shiv Sena workers against his “slap CM” remark. Continuing his tirade against the Thackerays and the Shiv Sena, Rane warned that Varun Sardesai (Thackeray’s nephew) who led the “attack” on his home would not return if ever he attempted the same again. Accompanied by BJP MLA from Bandra West Ashish Shelar and BJP MLC Prasad Lad, Rane was speaking at the BJP office in Golap, Ratnagiri. Rane said he was aware of several secrets and he would reveal them slowly. “They call themselves cultured, then who instructed to throw acid on the face of his sister-in-law? Don’t compel me to speak, it might prove very costly,” Rane said. At another press conference in Ratnagiri, he warned the police to act within the legal framework, or they too would have to face action. Referring to the deaths of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and his ex-manager Disha Salian, he said the real culprits have not been found. “Rane will now go after them. Now I am speaking little but will reveal everything soon,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-rane-says-he-knows-many-secrets-will-reveal-them/articleshow/85700702.cms||---

Criticising Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s ‘Praja Samgrama Yatra’, he said the padayatra could come in handy to check any leftout government properties which could also be sold by the Centre. He alleged that the BJP government at the Centre was busy with ‘Becho India’ programme after giving slogans like ‘Make in India’, ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’. “There are news reports that the BJP government has embarked on a mission to sell Rs 6 lakh crore worth properties belonging to the PSUs, including a 21-acre railway land at Moula Ali in Hyderabad. Sanjay owes an answer to the people what is the purpose of his padaytra,” KTR said at a press conference here. He said in the past seven years, the Centre had not given any additional financial assistance except mandatory share in taxes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave Rs 1,000 crore to Gujarat to tackle and another Rs 500 crore to another state but Telangana drew a blank from the Centre during last October floods in Hyderabad. “While Rs 2.75 lakh crore taxes were deposited to the Centre, Telangana received only Rs 1.45 lakh crore in return,” KTR said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ktr-what-is-purpose-of-sanjays-padayatra/articleshow/85700654.cms||Koride Mahesh

Cases were filed to settle political scores,” said Suresh Rana, UP’s sugarcane minister. But Rana refused to comment on Supreme Court’s August 10 ruling that state governments cannot withdraw criminal cases against MPs and MLAs without prior permission from the high court. Rana was also booked for allegedly fanning communal passions through his speeches in the run-up to the 2013 riots which had left at least 62 dead. He was booked for “hate speech” at a panchayat on September 7, 2013. The state government had asked for withdrawal of 79 riot cases in the last four years, which also included cases filed against Rana. In March this year, a special court, where Rana’s case was being heard, allowed its withdrawal after the government's submission. But after the apex court’s order, the state will now have to approach the high court. “The honourable court is doing its work. I cannot comment on it,” Rana said when asked about the apex court’s verdict. Minister Rana had come to attend a private function in Muzaffarnagar, whose Thana Bhawan he has been representing in the state assembly since 2012.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/sp-booked-political-opponents-after-muzaffarnagar-riots-says-ups-cane-minister/articleshow/85696066.cms||Mohd Dilshad

On the sidelines of the district’s Covid review meeting, he said such decisions should be taken in the interest of citizens. “I shall discuss the issue on Sunday with all the elected representatives as I shall be here to review the presentation of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority,” he said. The BJP-ruled Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday put on hold the decision on leasing out amenity spaces to private parties in the civic body’s general body meeting after NCP declared that it would be opposing it. NCP had earlier said it would support the proposal, giving some riders.

He was addressing MTech students, PhD scholars and researchers at the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT), a deemed university of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), after inaugurating newly constructed infrastructure at the institute campus in Khadakwasla. Underlining the latest success of producing 1 lakh hand grenades by a private company in Nagpur, Singh said, “The company produced this large quantity of grenades in five months and successfully delivered it to the Indian Army.” “The Indian cost of one grenade is Rs3,400. The same grenade has been exported to Indonesia for over Rs7,000. In a nutshell, I just want to make the point that if we make progress in technology, India has the potential to become an economic superpower,” he said. “The ministry has launched the “iDEX (Innovations for Defence Excellence) for Fauji” to achieve this objective and has also made budgetary provision of Rs1,000 crore. Moreover, it has allocated Rs500 crore to encourage startups to conduct research in defence technology and aerospace,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/tech-advancement-key-to-superpower-tag-rajnath-singh/articleshow/85698052.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Chennai||Madras high court allows probe in Kodanad case, says deaths serious & suspicious||CHENNAI: Rejecting the plea of a prosecution witness, the Madras high court on Friday allowed further investigation into the case of murder and burglary at former chief minister Jayalalithaa’s Kodanad estate in April 2017, saying that deaths of people connected with the incident are ‘serious and suspicious.’ “In this case, not only a murder and dacoity had taken place at Kodanadu tea estate, it had been followed by serious and suspicious deaths,” said Justice M Nirmal Kumar on Friday, refusing to stall trial in the Nilgiris sessions court and ruling that nothing could stop further investigation including filing of chargesheet. The judge was passing orders on a petition filed by N Ravi, prosecution witness 35 in the trial, opposing further investigation and seeking early completion of the trial which had reached the questioning stage. The case had acquired political overtones after former CM K Palaniswami said in the assembly that attempts were being made to frame him in the case. The AIADMK also staged a walkout over the issue. Justice Nirmal Kumar, acceding to the submissions of advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram and public prosecutor Hasan Mohamed Jinnah, said: “This court holds that the investigating agency/police invoking Section 173(8) CrPC at any stage of the criminal proceeding cannot be doubted, objected and faulted with.”  The duty cast upon the court is to see that there is proper, fair, impartial and effective investigation. The filing of a charge sheet or the pendency of the trial can by no means prohibit further investigation, he added. As per Section 173(8) of CrPC…nothing can stop the investigating officer to continue with further investigation after filing of the charge sheet when they come across and obtains further evidence,” the court said. “The object of a criminal trial is to discover the truth and plausible evidence is to be brought on record, whatever stage it may be…Whatever materials are collected, it is ultimately the concerned court to decide the acceptance and otherwise of the same. It is always better to have a fair and impartial trial to arrive at a just decision,” said Justice Nirmal Kumar. As to the locus of the petitioner, who is an Amma Peravai office-bearer, the judge said: “The petitioner is neither a defacto complainant, nor a victim or accused. He is only a witness in this case. He has no say in the manner of investigation and trial of the case. Further, no prejudice would be caused to the petitioner if further investigation is conducted.” Trashing Ravi’s apprehension that further investigation of the case might delay conclusion of trial, the judge said: “Fair trial is the first imperative of dispensation of justice and there is qualitative difference between right to speedy trial and fair trial.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-allows-probe-in-kodanad-case-says-deaths-serious-suspicious/articleshow/85700713.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Museum to display mounted cops’ rich history of 181 years||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Mounted Police that began its journey in 1840 with two sowars (riders) and turned into a full fledged unit two years later is finally set to open its doors to people, including tourists in the city. Following the ambitious plan drawn up by the police commissioner Soumen Mitra, the unit is all set to have a museum that will display its rich history in the past 181 years. Currently, the unit has 75 horses under its command. The Kolkata Police has its own museum in north Kolkata that houses priceless weapons and documents, including those on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. “There are certain plans regarding the new venture and experts have been roped in by Lalbazar for the purpose. Our aim is to show why and how the unit was created by the British in 1840 and to highlight the work we have done so far. The main work began in 1842 when the patrolling duty of the Maidan was assigned to the Kolkata Police — a duty that we still carry out every morning and evening. Besides being the main response team in and around Maidan, the unit has played a major role in controlling city traffic in the European quarters during the British period. Our role during the Maidan football duels is also recorded in history. Rare photographs in our archive have been scanned and some horses that have won laurels on behalf of Kolkata Police will find a mention in the museum. All the uniforms, including those for special occasions, will also be put on display. An expert has already visited us and has chosen some rare photographs that he wishes to exhibit,” said an officer. The officer said that a special installation — a cop riding a horse — will come up at the unit’s office and the stable located beside the DCP Central office on SN Banerjee Road. “The installation has arrived and the statue will be unveiled soon. The initial plans are to design the main gate resembling horse hoofs. We have already renovated three rooms on the ground floor and we will choose one as the main display room. The attempt is to ensure that we make an identity of our own,” said the officer. The museum will also be showcasing the training of these horses. Cops expect to throw open the facility in phases. “While we had planned August 15 for the unveiling of the statue, we are pushing it to complete some renovation work. The earliest date might be around Pujas or we might complete the entire set up and open towards the end of this year,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/museum-to-display-mounted-cops-rich-history-of-181-years/articleshow/85698156.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The school authorities denied certificates to these students after their parents failed to pay the school fees. The parents approached the District Education Officer (DEO) Ahmedabad (rural) R R Vyas with whose intervention the four children were enrolled at Divine Gurukulam school. “According to the RTE Act rules, a child cannot be denied education even if they do not have a leaving certificate. We approached Divine Gurukulam authority and they had seats available to accommodate the four students,” said Vyas. “The school asked us to pay the fees a couple of times. We are not in a position to pay the fees hence the school denied giving us the leaving certificates,” said Kamal Dangre whose two children, one in Class 3 and the other in Class 9 were studying at DPS East. Dangre said he was unable to pay fees to the tune of Rs 1.14 lakh for his two children. . Another parent Jatin Patel could not pay Rs 1.75 lakh fees for his two kids and he too was denied leaving certificates by DPS East authorities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/school-denies-lc-deo-intervenes/articleshow/85700739.cms||---
---||Pune||51% PHCs in 17 Maharashtra districts have just 1 doctor for 30,000 people: Survey||PUNE: An extensive survey of 150 state-run hospitals has revealed that Maharashtra is grossly underprepared for health emergencies, with only 0.4 government hospital beds being available for 1,000 people as against the World Health Organization (WHO) norm of at least 2 beds. Besides, there is only one permanent medical officer at half (51%) of the 122 primary health centres (PHCs) covered during the study, which means there is only one doctor for over 30,000 people as compared to the WHO norm of one doctor for 1,000 people. Jan Arogya Abhiyan (JAA), a network of various social organizations and health activists working for the right to healthcare, carried out the hospital survey at the village and taluka levels in 17 districts in the state, including Pune, in July this year. Public health services are the mainstay and only source of medical support for many. These services must be rapidly upgraded by ensuring the regular appointment of adequate staff and enhancing services, experts have said. “One can’t imagine how just one regular medical officer is required to manage a PHC which covers a population of over 30,000 people while performing outreach Covid activities. This has led to closed OPDs and badly-affected essential mother and child care services during the pandemic,” said health activist Girish Bhave, a member of JAA’s state committee. “The survey has found that the major staff shortages are partly addressed through contractual engagements. Such gaps have led to an overload of work for the existing staff, while patients suffer due to lack of services,” Bhave said. The survey also revealed that 30% of specialist doctor posts were vacant and 12% doctors were working on a contractual basis at the sub-district hospitals (SDHs) covered in the survey. The highest number of vacant posts in SDHs were those for psychiatrists (100%), radiologists (36%), orthopaedic surgeons (36%) and ENT surgeons (43%). “The vacancies of specialist doctors have had a direct impact on the special services and surgeries at hospitals,” said health activist Shailaja Aralkar, a member of the JAA’s state committee. In addition, doctors in rural hospitals were given Covid duty, which led to long delays for serious non-Covid patients, while in some places, treatment and surgeries for non-Covid patients were discontinued, she said. The need for public health facilities increased during the Covid period, as people from various socio-economic sections require public services for Covid treatment and vaccination. However, due to major shortfalls in the public system, the rural population is forced to go to private hospitals, leading to massive overcharging for care (both Covid and non-Covid patients), the experts said. “The finances of households have collapsed and many rural families have gone into massive debt,” Aralkar said. Even though the Covid situation has demonstrated the absolutely essential role of public health services in India, NITI Aayog continues to argue for accelerated privatisation of healthcare. This body is recommending handing over of district hospitals to private players across the country, the health activists alleged “Given this situation, the Maharashtra government must completely reject the recommendations of NITI Aayog for further commercialisation and privatization of public hospitals,” Bhave said. Out of 38 RHs and SDHs, 22 (59%) hospitals did not perform C-sections during the Covid period. This situation was found to be especially severe in Akola, Amravati, Osmanabad, Thane, Nandurbar, Palghar, Pune, Yavatmal and Hingoli districts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/51-phcs-in-17-state-dists-have-just-1-doc-for-30k-people-survey/articleshow/85700750.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The list includes eight engineering colleges, a management institute and one offering general courses. In its interim report submitted to vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari, the fact-finding panel comprising NU management council (MC) members has recommended directives to colleges to not pressure employees and release their dues as soon as possible. It also recommended release of pending wages within a week and submission of proof, including bank details, to the university. The panel led by senior member Rajesh Bhoyar visited the ten colleges in the last couple of months after receiving several complaints from aggrieved teaching and non-teaching employees. Senior teachers Urmila Dabir and Nitin Kongre along with Vishnu Changde were the other members on the panel assisted by NU deputy registrar Raman Madne, who was appointed as secretary. The colleges named include four from Priyadarshini Group and JD College of Engineering, where Chaudhari was working as a principal before taking up the VC’s post. Senior officials from a couple of colleges told TOI that they are facing financial issues due to the Maharashtra government’s failure to release scholarship dues of backward community students since the last couple of years. Chaudhari told TOI that the report would be placed before the forthcoming MC meeting on August 30. “As the panel was constituted by the MC, only members can collectively take a decision. The panel was constituted on June 15 to visit the colleges to take a review and suggest a way out. All stakeholders of the education system, including the colleges, have been affected due to the pandemic,” he said. TOI had highlighted the plight of such employees from two engineering colleges on August 14 while quoting a complaint filed by them with the central and state authorities, including AICTE.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nu-panel-names-10-colleges-for-withholding-salaries-of-staffers/articleshow/85696056.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||Salt Lake waterlogging: Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation plans to desilt drains||KOLKATA: At last Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has drawn up a plan to clean sewerage and drainage lines in Salt Lake. The VIP township has been going through unprecedented waterlogging this monsoon. However, residents rued they haven’t seen any effort from the civic body to desilt the choked rainwater drainage channels and gully pits. TOI on August 6 reported how water has been flooding into reservoirs of households and “rain, stagnant water put Salt Lake residents’ health at risk.” In Salt Lake, the reservoirs are built below the driveways. Every time there’s waterlogging, filthy water flows into the driveways and on to the water reservoirs. Even as BMC would cite the overflowing canals as the major reason, the civic body is finally addressing the issue. “We have instructions from mayor Krishna Chakraborty to start cleaning the drains in the next few days. We were planning to start today but heavy rains prevented us,” a BMC official said. In the ongoing monsoon, several blocks across Sector I, II and III have been swamped with water even after moderate rains. “God help us is there’s heavy downpour. The streets fill up and the water level refuses to go down,” said Dipti Roy, an octogenarian resident of AE Block. “I see no difference between those living in low-lying rural areas like Ghatal and a showpiece urban locale like Salt Lake. People from both places start panicking every time there’s heavy rainfall,” rued P K Chatterjee, a resident of BK Block. Rajesh Chirimar, member, board of administrators and coordinator, ward 39, BMC, said, “Desilting the drains is the need of the hour if we were to prevent such trouble.” Chirimar also called for plastic ban, which he claimed to be the reason behind blocked sewer lines. BMC teams will be deployed to clear the choked manholes and gullypits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/salt-lake-waterlogging-bmc-plans-to-desilt-drains/articleshow/85698112.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Also, if the house address is not found to be in accordance with the registration number, the vehicle will be impounded, traffic police officials said. In a first, Mohali traffic police have started sending traffic violation challans to people’s homes after CCTV cameras installed at various traffic signals across the district capture their violations. Traffic police personnel posted at all traffic signals have been directed to take pictures of vehicles violating stop lines and zebra crossings on their smart phones. Superintendent of police (Traffic) SP Gurjot Singh Kler said the Mohali traffic police have adopted a modern system to tackle traffic violations and send challans to people’s houses. He said CCTV cameras have been installed at various lightpoints in the district and traffic violators are being closely monitored. The SP said, “After people are caught violating traffic rules on these cameras, challan receipts will be sent to their home addresses. A total of 104 traffic challans have been issued from door to door against drivers violating traffic rules in urban areas of the district with the help of CCTV cameras from August 1, 2021 till date.” He added that home addresses of 11 drivers violating traffic rules have not been found and information regarding this has been sent to the Regional Transport Authority concerned. “Vehicles of drivers whose home addresses has been found to be incorrectly registered will be impounded as per law. Therefore, in future, if drivers are found to be violating traffic rules, then with the help of CCTV cameras, challans will be sent to their houses according to traffic rules,” he cautioned. Gurjot Singh pointed out that lakhs of people are involved in road accidents across the country due to non-compliance with traffic rules. The Traffic Education Cell, Mohali and Traffic Police, Mohali have been arranging meetings from time to time to make people aware of traffic rules.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mohali-police-starts-sending-traffic-violation-challans-at-doorsteps/articleshow/85698105.cms||---

---||Goa||Goan teen India’s big hope in coastal rowing||PANAJI: India is pinning its hopes in coastal rowing on a Goan teenager. Born in Goa, Gayle Zulema de Miranda, 18, is the granddaughter of late cartoonist Mario de Miranda and has been given the go-ahead by the Rowing Federation of India to participate in the World Rowing Beach Sprint Finals to be held in Oeiras, Portugal, next month. She will be competing in the junior category and will be the first from India to take part. “We are yet to see her row in India, but with the feedback that I am getting, she seems to be a very exciting prospect for India in the future,” Rajlaxmi Singh Deo, president of the Rowing Federation of India, told TOI. The rowing federation’s excitement about the youngster stems from her recent results, particularly in 2021. After all, she picked up a gold at the Florida State Rowing Association Sweep Championships in a four, finished fourth at the American Youth Cup Series in a single scull with the Miami Beach team and made it to the semifinals in quadruple scull at the US Club Nationals with the OKC High Performance team. “I have a long way to go, and I am willing to put in the work to succeed,” said Gayle Zulema, whose mother, Magen, is an American, while her father, Raul de Miranda, and she are Indian citizens with permanent resident status in the United States. Gayle Zulema took to rowing at age 14, encouraged by her prior school, Rippowam Cisqua School in New York. “It is rare to start rowing before middle school, so when the opportunity presented itself, I tried. A one-week summer camp turned into an eight-week camp and I was very excited to join the local RowAmerica racing team in 2018,” said Gayle Zulema. Since then, she has had to deal with a tough training schedule. Rippowam allowed use of the faculty gymnasium, so that she could train on study breaks and encouraged her to continue to follow her dreams. Gayle Zulema trained with the Miami Beach Rowing Club last winter and, happy with her performance, coach De Camillis was able to secure an invitation by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Training site/Riversport OKC. The highly competitive program is led by head coach Reilly Dampeer and has an impressive roster of coaches. At OKC, Gayle Zulema trained alongside other highly motivated under-19 and under-23 athletes who have the long-term goal of competing in world championships and Olympics for the United States. “My training at OKC was dream,” she said. Next month, she will join her new school—the United World College Atlantic in Wales. “I am so proud to be joining Atlantic College because they have the most inspiring goals, to bring students from around the world so that they have a real sense of global unity and do their best to make the world a better place,” she said. Atlantic College is backing Gayle Zulema’s commitment to rowing for India, allowing her leeway to train and compete. “With 100 nationalities represented on campus, it is my hope there will be other students from other nationalities represented at the World Rowing Beach Sprints Finals third edition to be held in Saundersfoot, Wales in 2022,” said Gayle Zulema, who hails from Loutolim. Her dream is to see that Goa will eventually have a coastal rowing programme and also host international events. “Coastal rowing is at the forefront of the ‘row-for-all’ effort to bring more diversity into rowing,” said Gayle Zulema, explaining the differences between fresh-water and coastal rowing. “The boats are far cheaper. The only infrastructure needed is a beach and a few buoys, erasing many hurdles faced by traditional rowing.” For now, Gayle Zulema’s focus is on the championships in Portugal. Once that concludes, she will turn her focus on senior national championships, Asian Games 2022, and possibly the Olympic qualifiers for Paris 2024. “I believe India will have a strong team in place for the Asian Games and again in Paris,” said Gayle Zulema. A lot of people have made this journey possible for Gayle Zulema. From the Goa Rowing Association and Goa Olympic Association to national coach Ismail Baig, Rowing Federation of India, USRowing, Rowing Federation of Wales and Guin Batten, the Coastal Chair for World Rowing. When she landed in Portugal last month, she got plenty of support from the Rowing Federation of Portugal and Leandro Fernandes at Ave Rowing Boats and the Club Fluvial Vilacondense in Vila do Conde. But most of all, she remains thankful to her grandfather, Mario de Miranda, for the inspiration. “My grandfather is my inspiration at the start and finish line of each race. While he was not an athlete, he used his pen and paper to give back to Goa and India. Similarly, I would be very proud to use my oars to give back to Goa and India,” said Gayle Zulema.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goan-teen-indias-big-hope-in-coastal-rowing/articleshow/85700778.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kolkata||Film activist from Kolkata frets over cine community in Afghanistan||KOLKATA: A film activist, who went from Kolkata to Kabul in July 2019 for conducting a workshop on cinema organised by Roya Film House, is very worried about how the cine community will survive there in the Taliban regime. Premendra Mazumder, who is the secretary (Asia Pacific section) of the International Federation of Film Societies, has spoken to director Roya Sadat and is organizing an online festival of the films made by Afghani directors. This will be done to express solidarity with Afghani cine community. Memories of his Kabul visit haunt him now. Just 15 days before his visit, a combined gun and bomb attack had devastated Kabul. “Five gunmen had entered a building under construction and fired on Afghan security personnel evacuating people onto the street. At least 45 were killed,” Mazumder told TOI.  His well-wishers were very worried when Mazumder decided to go to Kabul after such an attack. “On January 20, 2018, a group of gunmen had attacked the Inter-Continental Hotel in Kabul where I was staying. There was a 12-hour-long battle which had left 40 people dead including 14 foreigners. So, security was very tight when I went. However, the guards grew fond of me the moment they heard that I was from India and had a film connection. They thought that I was from the land of three Khans and even exempted me from regular security checks. They would even show me their dance clips,” he added. A file photo of Premendra Mazumder at the workshop on cinema in Kabul in 2019The fact that Mazumdar’s body of work has no connection with Bollywood didn’t matter to them. Speaking about the prominent members of Afghanistan, Mazumder mentioned Siddiq Barmak, Roya Sadat, Abdul Latif Ahmadi, Sahraa Karimi and Alka Sadat. “Abdul Latif Ahmadi was the president of Afghan Film, the state-run Afghan film company. Siddiq Barmak had won Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes for his first feature film titled ‘Osama’. Roya Sadat is the first woman director in the history of Afghan cinema in the post-Taliban era. Among her films are ‘Three Dots’, ‘Playing The Taar’ and ‘A Letter to the President’. Sahraa Karimi directed the film ‘Hava, Maryam, Ayesha’, which premiered at Venice. Alka Sadat became famous with her first 25-minute film ‘Half Value Life’ which highlights social injustice and crime,” he said. Mazumder went to Kabul on an invitation from Roya Sadat. She has been organising the Afghanistan International Women’s Film Festival Herat. “This workshop was a part of the fifth edition of this festival. Over 20 young filmmakers participated in it. Of them, 50% were young girls. The concluding session was held at Kabul University’s faculty of arts,” he added. Mazumder has connected with Sadat and her producer husband Aziz Dildar, who teaches in Kabul. “They are outside the country now. I’m worried about the security of the young and talented filmmakers who remain in Afghanistan,” he said. Currently, Mazumder is choosing 10 films for the virtual festival. “Cinema is under threat in the Taliban regime. I’ve to be cautious while selecting a film critical of the Taliban by a director who is still in Afghanistan,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/film-activist-from-kol-frets-over-cine-community-in-af/articleshow/85698195.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The stretch will be from Borkhedi toll plaza to Telangana border, say sources in National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Union minister for finance and corporate affairs Nirmala Sitharaman had on Monday unveiled asset monetisation pipeline of central ministries and public sector. Roads are one of the sectors which will be part of the NMP, under which government will be transferring revenue rights to private parties in return for upfront money. The NHAI had converted the national highway stretch from Butibori to Telangana border into four-lane between 2012 and 2018. Borkhedi toll plaza is situated around 35km from city on Chandrapur road. At Jamb, the national highway separates to go towards Hinganghat and one arm goes to Chandrapur. The highway further passes through Pandharkawda and Kelapur before entering Adilabad district in Telangana. The NHAI regional office has suggested the stretch as it is the most used road in the division. For a light vehicle, one has to pay Rs135 toll at Borkhedi. There is another toll booth at Daroda, after Hinganghat. Toll charge for a light vehicle is Rs90 at Daroda. Third toll plaza is at Kelapur in Yavatmal district, where Rs90 is charged for every light vehicle. The NHAI had four-laned the road using central funds and is recovering the expenditure through toll. The NHAI official said, “Private agency will be given the stretch on lease for four years, which may be extended. The private player will give revenue to the government in advance and recover it and also maintenance cost through toll.” The NHAI officials are not sure whether toll charge will go up after the monetisation. But if the toll is increased, it will be a double whammy for people travelling from Nagpur to Jamb, Warora, Chandrapur, Ballarpur or the other way round. People going to these towns leave the national highway at Jamb, yet they have to pay the toll at Borkhedi. The NHAI is recovering toll at Borkhedi for development of Outer Ring Road in Nagpur. The private company manning the toll plaza is responsible for maintenance of the stretch from city to Borkhedi. The official said roads developed using central funds are being selected in the NMP. “Roads built or widened under build-operate-and-transfer (BoT) and those under private companies are not part of the NMP. There are other roads in and around district which are eligible for NMP like Saoner-Kalmeshwar-Amravati and Nagpur-Umred.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/139km-stretch-of-nagpur-hyd-highway-may-be-monetized/articleshow/85700796.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||Greens object to ‘wrong timing’ of pollution monitoring in CSTPS||Chandrapur: While the regional office of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has completed the monitoring of emissions from Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS), green NGOs and environmentalists have strongly objected to the timing of the monitoring, claiming that it will produce results favourable to the plant. District guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar had blamed high pollution from CSTPS for health hazards like respiratory and skin diseases in Chandrapur city and around, and had directed MPCB to investigate the pollution caused by the mega power plant. Complying with the directives, MPCB officials installed three ambient air quality monitoring machines in the CSTPS premises and conducted the monitoring exercise from Monday to Wednesday. While the report of monitoring exercise is expected next week, environmentalists have raised strong objection to MPCB’s “untimely move”. In his objection field with MPCB, Suresh Chopne, NGO Green Planet Society president and member of the regional advisory committee of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), claimed that “rainy season is not the right time for air quality monitoring as the rain, moisture and wind absorb gases and dust particles, and little or no pollution will be recorded on the monitoring machine”. He said that the outcome of monitoring may go in favour of the power plant, which would give it a clean chit against the pollution it causes. Green activist Sunil Dahiya, who works with the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said the joint report by CPCB and MPCB based on monitoring carried out in March 2021 had clearly highlighted that the SO2 emissions at all units were well above the prescribed limits. Ambient air quality at two out of three locations was beyond the prescribed limits too. Dahiya added that the washout and dilution of pollutants happens at a very fast rate during the monsoon season. “Hence, such a monitoring exercise will not help in gauging the real impact of operation of the power plant on pollution,” he said. Secondly, Dahiya further added, “The locations chosen for monitoring are all within power plant premises or near that, and none of the locations depicts the sensitive receptor or maximum ground level concentration areas, as it is rare to find impact of stack emissions from 275m height so close to the stack.” Environmentalist and professor Yogeshwar Dudhpachare too raised his objection regarding the timing of the pollution monitoring. MPCB regional officer Ashok Kare said the monitoring was carried out following the directives of guardian minister, and that MPCB will correlate the data gathered from this exercise with the monitoring data and stack emissions recorded earlier in the plant premises.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/greens-object-to-wrong-timing-of-pollution-monitoring-in-cstps/articleshow/85696101.cms||Mazhar Ali

These colleges were having in-charge deans for a considerably long period now. Interestingly, six out of the 11 deans appointed are Nagpurians.Dr Pradip Dixit, who was working as dean of Miraj GMCH and now transferred to Kolhapur GMC with additional charge as dean, is a Nagpurian. Similarly, Dr Apurva Pawde, who has been transferred to Gondia as head of department (HoD) of ENT with additional charge as dean of Gondia GMC, is also a Nagpurian. Dr Pawde was working in Akola GMCH for the last several years.Apart from these two, Dr Bhavna Sonawane, who was in-charge dean of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMCH), Nagpur, will handle this additional charge in future too. Dr Ashok Nitnaware from Nagpur GMCH’s ENT department is now transferred to Chandrapur as HoD of ENT. He will also handle additional charge as dean. Dr Milind Fulpatil from Super Speciality Hospital has been transferred to Jalgaon where he will handle HoD anatomy post with additional charge as dean. Dr Bhaskar Khare, alumni of GMCH Nagpur, will handle additional charge of dean at Swami Ramanand Teerth Medical College, Ambajogai. Dr Abhay Datarkar, professor and head of cranio-maxillofacial surgery at Government Dental College, Nagpur, has been given additional charge of dean, GDC.While it is a matter of pride for the city to have Nagpurians as deans of many medical colleges in the state, the appointments made on August 26 are still ‘additional charge’ as per government rules.Sources in the DMER said these appointments will be made full-time very soon with orders of divisional promotions of these professors likely to be released in next two weeks. But, as per sources, at least three of the professors are not interested in taking charge as deans. Some of them may back-out or take voluntary retirement. Things will be clear in next two weeks.Shortage of professors and teachers in state GMCs is a critical issue and the DMER is now expecting the appointments to be made through Maharashtra Public Service Commission as announced by the state government. Fresh teaching appointments are must to save the additional PG seats granted by the National Medical Commission to the GMCs in the state. Who’s where...

In Garhwal, a nearly 12-metre chunk of the Rishikesh-Yamunotri highway (NH-94) was washed away at Fakot in Tehri Garhwal district, the State Emergency Operation Centre said. The Rishikesh-Badrinath highway also got blocked near Shivmurti in Tehri district after boulders and rocks started rolling down the hillsides due to overnight rain. District magistrate, Tehri Garhwal, has issued orders to completely stop traffic on the NH-54 from Tapovan till Maletha and from Narendra Nagar to Chamba on NH-94, till the damaged sections of the highways are repaired. The Tanakpur-Champawat national highway (NH-09) was blocked near Swala after Thursday’s rains. Besides, the Joshimath-Malari state highway, which leads to the China border, is blocked near Tamaknala and Jumma for nearly two weeks now.  Dehradun was lashed by 140mm rain, Mussoorie received torrential showers, with 250 mm rain being recorded on Thursday night, and Narendra Nagar in Tehri Garhwal district recorded 110mm rainfall.”In Kumaon, at least four major national and state highways, most of them along the India-China border, were blocked, cutting off several villages. According to the disaster management department, heavy rains in Dharchula, Didihat and Munsiyari areas of Pithoragarh wreaked havoc on border towns, blocking the Thal-Munsiyari highway, Tawaghat-Lipulekh road and three others near the China border. Apart from these, 17 rural roads in Pithoragarh were also blocked and several in Nainital, Champawat and Bageshwar were damaged. Meanwhile, a 27-year-old contractual worker with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), Naveen Singh, was killed while clearing debris at Tadkot in Dharchula. “Heavy boulders fell on the earthmover machine Singh was operating, crushing the machine with him inside. He was a resident of Khunti village of Dharchula. We also had to evacuate around two dozen shops in the area,” a BRO official informed TOI. In another death reported from Dharchula tehsil, a 28-year-old woman, Pashupatinath Devi, while drying clothes outside her home, was crushed underneath falling boulders, which had been loosened by torrential rains. The Champawat-Tanakpur national highway, Bhowali highway in Nainital and Ramnagar road were alsoblocked. Bikram Singh, director of the regional meteorological centre, said,“Rains will continue in the state till August 28, as the western end of the monsoon continues to run along foothills of the Himalayas.

---||Mangaluru||MCC resolves to waive penalty on water bill if meter is faulty||Mangaluru: The Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) council met on Friday, and it was resolved that a penalty should not be levied on consumers, if the water meter is defunct. Consumers may pay the minimum average sum of the previous bills, and there is no need to pay a penalty for the period, if the meter was defunct, said mayor Premanand Shetty. Opposition corporator Praveenchandra Alva from the Congress said that nearly 50% of the water meters in the city are defunct, and many have received bills to the tune of Rs 5,000 instead of Rs 500. Another corporator from the Congress, Abdul Ravoof, sought to know the status of a ruling given by the previous mayor, to reduce the water tariff. “The monthly minimum charge for 24,000 litres of water was just Rs 65 earlier. At present, it is Rs 56 per month, for 8,000 litres. Accordingly, people are forced to pay Rs 168 per month for 24,000 litres of water. Though the council had resolved to revise the water tariff, a decision has not yet been taken,” Ravoof said. Opposition leader A C Vinyaraj demanded that the council take a delegation to the government, since the city corporation cannot take a decision on revising the water tariff. Meanwhile, the mayor said the water tariff was hiked when the city corporation was under administrative control. “I have spoken to the MLAs, and the MCC has also sent a council resolution seeking revision of water tariff to the government,” the mayor said. Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said the council resolution of October 2020 was sent to the government, and a reminder was sent in March 2021. The mayor said the city corporation will seek the government’s nod to reduce the water tariff in the city. University status for Fisheries College The MCC council has resolved to urge the state government to accord university status to Fisheries College in Mangaluru. A request in this regard was mooted by corporator Bharath Kumar. The Fisheries College in Yekkur was started in 1969, and it was under the University of Agricultural Sciences. Currently, it is part of Karnataka Veterinary, Animal, Fisheries Sciences University (KVAFSU), Bidar. The Fisheries College in Yekkur should be carved out of the KVAFSU, and it should be upgraded as Fisheries University. A separate university for the fisheries sector can also provide technical inputs to fishermen, Kumar stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mcc-resolves-to-waive-penalty-on-water-bill-if-meter-is-faulty/articleshow/85696168.cms||---
---||Goa||Pramod Sawant vs Arvind Kejriwal 2.0: CMs now squabble over power subsidy||PANAJI: After sparring on social media over Goa's political greats, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant and his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal once again locked horns on Friday, this time over the issue of power tariffs in Goa. On Wednesday, after the state announced a subsidy of Rs 120 crore to avoid a hike in power tariffs, Kejriwal congratulated the people of Goa, and said that “AAP along with the people of Goa had an agitation; as a result, the Goa government provided a subsidy to stop a hike in electricity tariffs”. On Friday, Sawant lashed out at Kejriwal, stating that some “political vultures” rushed to claim credit. “Some political vultures have rushed to claim credit, conveniently forgetting that the same subsidy to the tune of Rs 88 crore was given last year too. The Goa model of governance puts people first. As for the noisemakers, let me remind them, actions speak louder than words,” Sawant tweeted. Sawant had said that the subsidy has been announced in view of the hardships faced due to the pandemic. The power issue became a political battlefield after AAP promised up to 300 units of electricity free to every household. After the Goa government’s subsidy, Kejriwal had said, “Without having a single MLA, AAP has managed to stop the hike in electricity tariffs. I would like to appeal to the people of Goa to change the government, (and) electricity would be provided free”. The cabinet had stated that since the general public is facing difficulties on account of the ongoing pandemic, implementation of the tariff order issued in the financial year 2021-22 at this juncture would further increase the burden on consumers. Further, the pandemic has resulted in a downturn in the tourism and hospitality sectors as well as other related commercial activities, leading to loss of business and earning to a wide spectrum of state’s population.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/sawant-vs-kejri-2-0-cms-now-squabble-over-power-subsidy/articleshow/85700868.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Nagpur||‘Institutional isolation must to prevent spread of mutants, won’t discourage testing & vaccination’||Nagpur: After 13 months and two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has restarted compulsory institutional isolation of positive patients. Probably, Nagpur Municipal Corporation is the only civic body in the state to take the decision. Radhakrishnan B tells TOI what prompted this move and how it will be implemented.Q. What was the need for such decision and is it justified?A. There were five cases of Delta+ in the city in July but we came to know about them now. Since number of cases is very low now, it helps in tracing and testing around 30 contacts of each patient. This is important to contain spread of Delta+ or any other mutation and prevent increase in cases. Also, now everything is open and festive season will soon begin with Ganeshotsav. The spike in Kerala after relaxations during festivals is a lesson for us.Q. Is there any state government directive now? Is the move violation of guidelines?A. There is no fresh directive from the government but it had already given two options, including compulsory institutional isolation of positive patients. There is no violation as decision was taken well within the framework of law.Q. Who will get exemption?A. Bedridden patients and pregnant women. In case of children, decision will be taken looking at the condition. For VIPs and others, paid institutional isolation in private hotels will be facilitated.Q. What about people who are fully vaccinated?A. They will have to remain in institutional isolation in case of contracting the disease. Partial or fully vaccinated people can still spread the disease, even if they are asymptomatic. There is not much scientific evidence that they cannot transmit the disease. With vaccination disease severity will be less, hospitalization would not be required in all cases and recovery can be fast. Q. Will this not hinder vaccination drive?A. Instead, it will encourage vaccination. Q. Will the decision discourage testing?A. Not at all. Now, people are aware that this disease can be cured if testing is done early and proper treatment is taken. Number of tests is around 5,000 per day in the district, which means people are going for tests on their own.Q. Is there any study or projection that says that Delta+ has already spread in the city?A. There is a high possibility of this. We are the first in the state to do so. This will help us to know about mutations and extra precautions that need to be taken. With Neeri’s help, we are sending samples of patients whose CT value is below 25, vaccinated, symptomatic etc, for genome sequencing.Q. Institutional isolation for how many days?At least seven days. Patient will be sent to home isolation in case test is negative after seven days. Else, 14 days in institutional isolation.Q. Where will the isolation facilities be?We have started with MLA hostel. There is VNIT in case MLA Hostel is fully occupied, followed by Symbiosis etc. Many centres are ready.Q. What if Covid cases start rising again?A. This initiative has been taken to ensure that there is no increase in cases. We will manage till active cases reach 1,000 or more.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/institutional-isolation-must-to-prevent-spread-of-mutants-wont-discourage-testing-vaccination/articleshow/85696177.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar told TOI that fire and electric consultative committee in May 2020 had given nod to the fire and emergency services department to hire 100 firemen on contract basis. However, the civic administration had reduced the number to 50 and submitted a proposal before the panel. Considering increased population and the number of properties in the city, all members unanimously decided to give nod to the original proposal of appointing 100 firemen, said Bhoyar. “We have asked the administration to expedite the appointment process without delay,” he said.The standing panel gave its nod to appoint a private contractor to replace 15,000 sodium vapor street lights with LED lights and also allowed the administration to invite e-tenders to run four pay and park spots at marketplaces.Meanwhile, the town planning department has surpassed the revenue target for the current financial year. Against the targetted Rs86 crore revenue, the department has generated Rs100 crore in just five months. Bhoyar directed the department not to be lethargic after the achievement and continue to work with same enthusiasm so that it can contribute additional revenue of over Rs200 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/standing-panel-nod-to-hire-100-firemen-on-contract-basis/articleshow/85696157.cms||---

Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi inaugurated the plant, which has been installed on the rooftops of two major buildings of the depot. Senior officials like Manas Sarkar, MD, Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), implementing agency of the East-West Metro corridor, were present at Thursday’s event. Metro Railway awarded the Rs 8.2 crore project contract to S G Renew Energy Kolkata Private Limited. The solar power developer, which has executed the project on a PPP model, will operate and maintain the plant for 25 years. “We draw electricity from WBSEDCL to run the train operations and power supply to the seven currently functional Metro stations. But we can now make use of the solar plant and save around Rs 45 lakh annually,” a KMRC official said. The plant, covering 60,000 sqm of the depot’s workshop and 3173sqm area of the ATO building, has been constructed as part of 100 MW-peak rooftop solar generation projects for Indian Railways which aims to become “Net Zero Carbon Emitter” by 2030. After the solar plant’s launch, GM Joshi dedicated a rake to passenger service and planted saplings inside the depot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/solar-power-plant-at-ew-metros-salt-lake-depot/articleshow/85698218.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Goa||Goa govt announces 50% fee cut for engineering, other professional courses||PANAJI: While nearly 50% seats in Goa’s four private engineering colleges have been going vacant over the past few years, seats in the government-run Goa Engineering College, which offers subsidised fees, have been filled instantly. Now, in a bid to boost technical education in the state, the government has introduced a scheme that will extend an equal fee benefit to all students in the field. Although students of pharmacy and architecture degree programmes and the various polytechnics are also eligible, it is those from private engineering colleges who stand to benefit the most with a fee waiver of Rs 36,000 to Rs one lakh a year. The state has waived off over 50% of their fees and has fixed Rs 40,000 as the base fee for those admitted in 2021-22 across all engineering colleges. With the introduction of the scheme, students in private and government technical colleges will now pay the same fees starting with the batch to be admitted in 2021-22 and the three subsequent new batches to be admitted in the coming years. During each of these years, at least 12,000 students will stand to gain. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had earlier announced the four-year incentive as the Diamond Jubilee (DJ-GIFT) scheme to mark Goa’s 60th year of Liberation, for which a provision of Rs 40 crore has been made in the state budget. There will be no income criteria to avail of the scheme. It will also be applicable to students across the general and reserved categories, except for children of NRIs and central service personnel, and is expected to benefit over 95% students admitted in 15 technical institutes in the state. As the admission process for engineering and pharmacy diploma programmes begins next week, and with the diploma course admissions already having started on Monday, the scheme is expected to encourage more students to come forward to claim seats. “The chief minister realised that while hundreds of crores of rupees are being spent on subsidising fees for general degree programmes like BA, BCom and BSc, no such benefit was available to students of private engineering colleges. As technical education plays an important role in socio-economic development, the CM thought fees should no longer be a barrier for meritorious students to pursue technical education,” an official at the directorate of technical education said. For students admitted to the course during the four DJ-GIFT scheme years, the base fee will remain the same for the entire duration of their programme. This will enable the students and their parents to know the exact financial implications involved, unlike earlier when fees could be revised for senior years after one joined the programme. For instance, students admitted to the engineering programme in 2021-22 will pay the fixed base fee of Rs 40,000 for the duration of all four years of their course. However, the government may alter the base fee for students admitted during the subsequent years under the scheme. But once admitted, the students will pay that same base fee for their entire programme. For example, if the base fee is altered to Rs 45,000 per year for the batch admitted to the engineering course in 2022-23, that batch will pay this amount as base fee for all four years of their course. The DJ-GIFT scheme offers a waiver in the tuition and development fee component payable to the college concerned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/state-announces-50-fee-cut-for-engg-other-prof-courses/articleshow/85700840.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Those who let loose terror after making forcible entry into her house are let scot free by the cops.” “Bajoria accompanied by hardcore criminals broke open the gate and tried to erect a mesh fence adjacent to their house. A bull-dozer was deployed to pull down the compound wall built by us over 40 years ago,” Vijayatai had said in her complaint. Meanwhile, Vijayatai and Kranti met DIG of Amravati Chandrashekhar Meena and demanded immediate arrest of the rioters Bunty Jaiswal and Sumit Bajoria.

However, after rising pressure, Kavlekar was booked on Friday. A case under Sections 323, 324 (causing hurt), and 354 (using force intending to outrage modesty) of the IPC has been registered. Ponda PI Mohan Gaude said that police along with the family are searching for the accused, but he was not traceable. Since the incident comes in the wake of several crimes against young women, there was strong reaction from politicians. “Day by day, Goa is descending into lawlessness,” said GFP president Vijai Sardesai. Slamming the government, he said that it has no intention of taking the issue of women’s safety seriously. Sarcastically, he asked whether it was the girl who is to be blamed in this case. “I ask the CM @DrPramod Sawant whose fault is it? Is it the girl? Or is it his government’s failed action to protect?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-ponda-rider-offers-teen-lift-she-says-no-he-assaults-her/articleshow/85700889.cms||---

A petty dispute that started over a buffalo blocking the village road led to an argument and soon took a communal turn when one group attacked the other with rifles and batons. Seven persons of a group, including two women, were reported injured and one of them died during treatment. An FIR was registered against 11 men for rioting and murder. Eight were convicted by the court on Thursday.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Healthcare in rural hospitals suffered due to manpower shortage in pandemic’||MUMBAI: Twenty-two out of 38 rural hospitals and sub-district hospitals in rural Maharashtra didn’t perform the Caesarean section for childbirth since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Routine surgeries, including trauma, cataract and family planning procedures, were unavailable in a sizeable number of public hospitals in 17 districts, according to a survey conducted by a network of health NGOs. “The need for public health facilities increased during the Covid period as people from various socio-economic sections required public services for treatment and vaccination. However, due to major shortfalls in the public system, especially in rural areas, the poor were forced to go to private hospitals,” said Shauilaja Aralkar of the Jan Arogya Abhiyan, which conducted the survey. “Our survey found that health workers toiled, but the under-resourced health system faltered,” said JAA’s Girish Bhave. The survey, which was conducted by JAA volunteers in July, also found a crippling shortage of manpower in the public healthcare system. “There is only one permanent medical officer in half (51%) of the PHCs. This means only one regular doctor for an over 30,000 population, while the WHO norm is one doctor for a 1,000 population,” said Bhave. Only half of the primary healthcare centres have permanent nurses. There is almost a 50% vacancy in the posts of specialist doctors in rural hospitals. “General surgeons were available in only 25% of these hospitals while anesthetists were available in only 35% of them,” the survey added. The districts covered included Thane, Palghar, Pune, Akola, Amravati, Ahmednagar, Osmanabad, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Nandurbar, Parbhani, Beed, Yavatmal, Solapur and Hingoli. Nandurbar and Gadchiroli had the worst parameters, they said. One of the most serious findings is that there is no regular second medical officer in 49% of primary healthcare centres. While contractual doctors were called in, in 25% PHCs the post of second medical officer is vacant. “A single regular medical officer is being required to manage the PHC and cover a population of over 30,000 people, while performing outreach Covid as well as official record keeping and meetings. This has led to closed OPDs and has affected routine immunisation,” the survey found.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/healthcare-in-rural-hosps-suffered-due-to-manpower-shortage-in-pandemic/articleshow/85696248.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Three human kills in 10 days: Gadchiroli problem tiger may be captured||NAGPUR: With three human kills by tiger in just 10 days, Gadchiroli forest officials have pressed the panic button, and may seek permission from the chief wildlife warden to capture the problem tiger. In all three kills, the tiger has consumed a part of the thigh of the victim. On August 15, Dambaji Dongre, a resident of Churchura village in Porla range, was grazing cattle when he was attacked by a tiger. On August 19, Pundlik Nikure of Bhikarmausi under Chatgaon range was attacked. The last was Ramaji Choudhari from Gogaon at Porla on August 25. Though the Naxal-infested tribal district had lost all its tiger population, and there were no tigers till 2019, dispersing tigers from Brahmapuri have settled here. “As per the camera trap surveys, we have a population of 18-20 tigers in Wadsa and Gadchiroli divisions,” says Kishore Mankar, conservator of forests (CF). In the last three years, from January 27, 2019, till August 25, 2021, 16 persons have been killed in human-animal conflict. In 2019, six human deaths were recorded followed by four in 2020 and six in the current year. Barring the last three cases, compensation has been paid in all human kill cases. “We will identify the problem tiger as per NTCA SOP before seeking permission from the chief wildlife warden to capture the problem tiger. Till then, a primary response team (PRT) has been constituted to create awareness among the locals,” said Mankar. In the meanwhile, looking into the poorly formulated proposals to capture problem animals, PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye on August 8 issued an advisory to all APCCFs (wildlife) and CCFs (territorial), directing them to prepare such proposals to capture problem animals purely on scientific basis right from day one of the incidents. “It has been observed that in several cases of cattle kill followed by human-animal conflict, no senior officers visited the spot to review the situation and face the people to understand the cause of conflict. It is only when things go out of hand that alarm bells start ringing. This spoils the image of the forest department among people,” says the PCCF advisory. The PCCF has issued a detailed format for RFOs, ACFs, and DyCFs, and asked them to submit proposals with all scientific proof in the same format before seeking permission to capture the problem animals. The PCCF has also warned the staff to respond quickly to any conflict situation. If a wrong animal is identified or the proposals are not in proper format, the deputy conservator concerned will be responsible for the situation arising out of that, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/3-human-kills-in-10-days-gadchiroli-problem-tiger-may-be-captured/articleshow/85700855.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Opposition leader A C Vinayaraj from the Congress, referring to a project of developing a multilevel hydraulic car parking project in the city, said that even the MCC has no access to information pertaining to the works being taken by the MSCL. “Any demolition of the buildings or properties of the MCC should be discussed in the council as per the Karnataka Municipalities Act. MCC’s buildings, which were serving as night shelters for the homeless in the city, were demolished without bringing it to the notice of the council. There seems to be a lack of coordination between the city corporation and the MSCL,” Vinayraj said Mayor Premanand Shetty from the BJP sought the MSCL to furnish details of all projects to be taken up in the city, to the notice of the MCC. “The MSCL should stall the ongoing work till the proposal gets approved in the council of the city corporation. The proposal should be discussed by MSCL’s board of directors, and also in the council of the city corporation,” Shetty said. “In fact, the MSCL is developing a multilevel hydraulic car parking under the Smart City mission on a PPP mode, at a cost of Rs 2 crore. The managing director of the MSCL approved the project, and it has demolished two buildings of the city corporation to facilitate the work, for which tenders have also been invited,” officials said. The mayor said since the MCC has 50% stake in the MSCL, projects should be discussed in the council of the city corporation too. MCC to convene traffic meet A meeting of the senior officials from the Mangaluru city traffic police and corporators will be convened next week to discuss various traffic-related issues, the mayor said. He was replying to a corporator from the Congress, Abdul Ravoof, who raised the issue of the city lacking parking space due to the widening of roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mayor-asks-mscl-to-bring-new-projects-to-councils-notice/articleshow/85696239.cms||---

We trusted him and informed a few people who deposited their documents with us. Rajesh came and took photocopies of the documents and said that he would provide them jobs before August 15. He took Rs 5.15 lakh from us,” said Balwant. After four-five months, Balwant said he talked to Kansal and he came to his CSC centre with Rajesh. “They assured that all their contacts would be provided jobs and took Rs 5.50 lakh more from us. For assurance, they gave us forged joining letters and three cheques of HDFC banks worth Rs 1 lakh, 1.50 lakh, and Rs 2 lakh and of Rs 1.50 lakh as pending security. When we enquired about the joining letters, we found that they were forged.

According to an order issued by Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday, the guidelines issued by the Centre will supersede all the orders issued by the state government for international travellers, which included a waiver of the RT-PCR test for fully vaccinated flyers. The order provides relief to passengers arriving in the state from Europe, Middle East and South Africa countries who were required to go for a mandatory 14-day quarantine and RT-PCR tests during this period. In December, Maharashtra government had issued an order regarding additional protocols for travellers from these regions due to the surge in Delta variant cases in Britain.

Over the years after successful career I and my family realised that the real happiness is not in living in material world but it is in leaving it,” said 55-year-old Vipul Mehta, who had painstakingly built his business of narrow fabric manufacturing to what it is today. In the next few months Mehta, a resident of Ghod Dod Road, his wife Sima, sons Priyen and Raj will renounce worldly charms and take up the ascetic path as monks, as did their daughter Yashwi, who chose to adopt monkhood 11 years ago. Mehta said that his family was religious and they too had started thinking of monkhood 10 years ago. After going through rigorous practise for past few months they were chosen for Diksha. Similarly, another successful diamond trader from Mumbai, 54-year-old Lalit Shah, along with wife Smita, their two daughters, Vidhi and Hetvi and son Manav will also accept monkhood later this year. Like Mehtas and the Shahs, altogether six Jain families from Gujarat and Mumbai are set to embrace monkhood, exchanging life of luxury for hermitage. The Shanti Kanak Trust Adhyatma Parivar (SKTAP) announced this formally on Friday, while declaring the auspicious time for Diksha ceremony. “It is going to be a major event in history of city which has become known for largest Diksha events,” spokesperson for SKTAP, Ravindra Shah told TOI. The grand event will be organized with guidance of Acharya Yogtilaksuriswarji Maharaj. So far 60 individuals have been approved for Diksha and is likely to be held after the Diwali festival. “My brother and his family have been always religiously inclined and they all decided to take Diksha together. Their wish has been granted by our guruji,” said Chandravadan Shah, younger brother of Lalit. After their two daughters — Ruju and Nomi — have become monks two years ago, 53-year-old hardware businessman from Mumbai’s Mulund area, Virendra Parekh is set to renounce the materialistic world along with his wife Falguni. Ahmedabad-based businessman Bhavesh Bhandari’s daughter Vishwa (19) and son Bhavya (16) will walk the path of monkhood. “My children grew up listening to monks and got a chance to spend time with them during the lockdown after which they decided to become monks,” said Bhandari. “There is increase in worldly pleasure while simultaneously there is rise in Diksha as well. Becoming a monk is a tough task and we permit them only after tests,” said Yogtilaksuriswarji Maharaj.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/six-jain-families-set-to-accept-ascetic-life/articleshow/85699769.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Soren also unveiled the draft of the state's Electric Vehicle Policy for consultations with the companies concerned. During the meetings, Soren promised the corporate houses bigger incentives if they proposed employment provisions for the people from SC and ST communities of the state. “Since Independence, the biggest plants and units have been set up in our state only but a lot of opportunities and resources have remained untapped. We want to change this scenario. The idea is to move forward and take you all with us,” Soren said. He added, “We have a big workforce waiting for opportunities and have abundant amenities in our state. In Jharkhand, a substantial part of the population is from SC and ST communities. If the people from these communities are employed, we will add more incentives to the policy. They are very hard-working people and will get a chance to move ahead with you. With your support, our state can touch heights.” On the first day, officials of the state government also held deliberations on the draft electric vehicle policy. Under the new policy, the government intends to set up an electric vehicle manufacturing cluster in the state by providing 100% exemption in stamp duties and registration fees apart from a 50% subsidy on land if they set up units within two years of the implementation of the policy. Talking to the industrialists, state secretary industry secretary Puja Singhal said, “We are also proposing 100% incentives for MSMEs on GST for 7 years, apart from 9 years and 13 years for large and mega-scale industries respectively. Additionally, we are proposing 100% exemption from vehicle registration fees and 100% exemption from road tax.” Representatives from Tata group, Hyundai Motors, Honda and attended the round table on the draft electric vehicle policy which was chaired by Soren. “The proposed Electric Vehicle Policy has been presented in front of you.

A language lab for English and Sanskrit was inaugurated by MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas at the BBA building of the Faculty of Commerce. “We are planning to have such labs all around the university. I am very happy to see that the BBA programme has taken the initiative. This lab will be an inspiration to other programmes and buildings,” said Vyas.

---||Ranchi||CBI ‘clueless’ about murder angle in Jharkhand judge death||RANCHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) seems to be clueless on the point of establishing a criminal conspiracy in the death of Dhanbad judge Uttam Anand. In a sealed report submitted to the Jharkhand high court here on Friday, the CBI has reportedly said its investigation has confirmed that the judge succumbed to injuries caused by the autorickshaw which knocked him down early on July 28 when Anand was out for his morning walk. The report was submitted to a division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad, who were conducting an online hearing of the matter. The high court has been monitoring the investigation taken over by CBI after the state government’s recommendation. The bench had directed the CBI to furnish a fresh status report of the investigation done so far and ordered it to examine the suspected conspiracy angle behind the death of the judge. During the hearing, the bench was informed that two persons – Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma — have been arrested and are being interrogated. The CBI has also requisitioned for a narco analysis test of the duo for which their blood and urine samples were sent to a specialised laboratory outside the state. The CBI counsel said since the forensic science laboratories in the state capital did not have provisions for testing samples of the accused, the samples have been sent outside. The bench then cautioned the CBI against tampering with the samples and suspected interpolation in the test reports. The court also ordered the agency to ensure that the samples and the reports are brought back by air and not by train. The bench further said if the need arises to take the accused for the proposed tests, then air travel should be the only option. Air travel will ensure more safety and security, the judges observed. It may be mentioned that Anand’s death has been suspected to be a murder given the fact that he was handling some sensitive cases. CCTV cameras had captured the incident when Anand was knocked down and one footage went viral on social media after it was reportedly leaked by a policeman, who was later suspended. The incident rocked the judiciary not only in the state but the entire country and the Supreme Court had also taken cognizance of the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cbi-yet-to-find-criminal-conspiracy-angle-in-dhanbad-judges-death-case/articleshow/85698836.cms||---
---||Ranchi||State Congress sees red over turncoats bagging key posts||Ranchi: The newly appointed Jharkhand Congress president, Rajesh Thakur, and four working presidents on Friday paid courtesy visits to senior Congress leaders in New Delhi ahead of their scheduled return to Jharkhand on Saturday. Even though a grand welcome is awaiting them at the party’s state headquarters in Ranchi on Saturday afternoon, resentment has started to grow within the veteran leaders, office-bearers and karyakartas over the selection of candidates. Veteran leaders, who were eyeing the top job and larger roles in the state leadership, have in muffled voices expressed their dissatisfaction over the national leadership’s decision to appoint turncoats as working presidents. “All of them – Geeta Koda, Bandhu Tirkey, Jaleshwar Mahto and Shehzada Anwar – have joined the party in the last three years. Tirkey has been inducted into the party but is yet to be approved by Jharkhand Assembly speaker’s court as a Congress MLA,” a veteran office-bearer preferring anonymity said on Friday. Another group of Congressmen have questioned Thakur’s credentials. “He contested on an MCC ticket from Bokaro in 2000 and became a party regular only in 2013. Though he has been the working president for two years, he has little organizational experience,” a former legislator said. Others questioned the party leadership’s decision to not appoint a tribal as the state chief. “Out of the 28 ST assembly seats, the mahagatbandhan won 26, of which Congress has won seven. The tribal population voted in large numbers for Congress candidates and their sentiments should have been respected,” a senior-office bearer said. Former state Congress president Rameshwar Oraon, who has kept a low profile since his unceremonious exit, did not respond to TOI’s calls on Friday. However, sources close to him said: “Oraon is disappointed. He rued how he was informed about the party’s decision unilaterally and was not heard.” Oraon’s loyals have already started meeting senior office-bearers in New Delhi and have been demanding his reinstatement. Thakur, however, remained unfazed by the dissent brewing at home. “I will take the senior leaders and veteran karyakartas of the party along. My objective is to build a robust organization before the Lok Sabha polls,” he told TOI from New Delhi over phone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-congress-sees-red-over-turncoats-bagging-key-posts/articleshow/85698801.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The project, Advancing Tribal Livelihood and Self Reliance (ATLAS), aims to provide alternative livelihoods to such women by assisting them on the modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) based agricultural practices. JSLPS chief executive officer Nancy Sahay and head of Green Digital, Krishnan Pallasami had signed a non-financial memorandum of understanding for the purpose on Thursday. Talking to TOI about the project, Sahay said, “As per state government’s objective to provide dignified livelihood, we started ATLAS and will assist over 20,000 tribal women by engaging them in agriculture-based work through ICT to increase their earnings.” On the criteria of beneficiaries to be covered by the project, Sahay said, “All beneficiaries of Phulo Jhano Ashirvad Scheme, as well as those who are involved in the manufacturing and sale of alcoholic drinks like Hadiya, will be selected under the project. Digital Green will provide the beneficiaries with the latest technology and equipment.” Since ATLAS is a non-financial deal, JSLPS will not be paying any fee or consultancy amount to the NGO, she said. On the role of JSLPS in the project, Sahay said they will select the beneficiaries from across the state and provide training to them as required by ATLAS. “We are targeting for the empowerment of women who are part of self-help groups (SHG) but not able to increase their income substantially. Even those SHG members who are from the weakest economical background will be connected to the project and they can become self-reliant,” Sahay added. Meanwhile, Pallasami said, “We have data analysis on the companies which require agricultural produces as their raw materials and will be helping the women on the selection of the items. We will also help the beneficiaries over the selection of crops under the climatic condition and will be connecting them with the markets so that their livelihoods can be improved.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jslps-ties-up-with-ngo-to-help-tribal-women-generate-income/articleshow/85698695.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||World||Ida aims to hit New Orleans on Hurricane Katrina anniversary||NEW ORLEANS: Hurricane Ida struck Cuba on Friday and threatened to slam into Louisiana with devastating force over the weekend, prompting New Orleans' mayor to order everyone outside the protection of the city's levees to evacuate. Ida intensified rapidly Friday from a tropical storm to a hurricane with top winds of 80 mph (128 kph) as it crossed western Cuba. The National Hurricane Center predicted it would strengthen into an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane, with top winds of 140 mph (225 kph) before making landfall along the US Gulf Coast late Sunday. ``This will be a life-altering storm for those who aren't prepared,'' National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott said during a Friday news conference with Louisiana Gov. John Bell Edwards. The governor urged residents to quickly prepare, saying: ``By nightfall tomorrow night, you need to be where you intend to be to ride out the storm.'' Residents along Louisiana's coast braced for Ida to arrive on the exact date Hurricane Katrina devastated a large swath of the Gulf Coast exactly 16 years earlier. Capt. Ross Eichorn, a fishing guide on the coast about 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, said he fears warm Gulf waters will ``make a monster`` out of Ida. ``With a direct hit, ain't no telling what's going to be left if anything,'' Eichorn said. He added: ``Anybody that isn't concerned has got something wrong with them.'' A hurricane warning was issued for most of the Louisiana coast from Intracoastal City to the mouth of the Pearl River. A tropical storm warning was extended to the Mississippi-Alabama line. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell ordered the evacuation of everyone living outside the levee system that protects the area from flooding. She did not say how many people lived there, but urged residents with medical conditions and other special needs to get out early. Officials warned they plan to close floodgates Saturday afternoon on two highways near New Orleans, increasing the sense of urgency for those planning to flee. Officials decided against evacuating New Orleans hospitals. There's little room for their patients elsewhere, with hospitals from Texas to Florida already reeling from a spike in coronavirus patients, said Dr. Jennifer Avengo, the city's health director. President Joe Biden approved a federal emergency declaration for Louisiana ahead of the storm. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said FEMA plans to send nearly 150 medical personnel and almost 50 ambulances to the Gulf Coast to assist strained hospitals. Ida made its first landfall Friday afternoon on Cuba's southern Isle of Youth. The Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for its westernmost provinces, where forecasters said as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain could fall in places, possibly unleashing deadly flash floods and mudslides. An even greater danger will then begin over the Gulf, where forecasts were aligned in predicting Ida will strengthen very quickly into a major hurricane, reaching 120 mph (193 kph) before landfall in the Mississippi River delta late Sunday, the hurricane center said. If that forecast holds true, Ida would hit on the 16th anniversary of Katrina's landfall as a Category 3 storm with 125 mph (201 kph) winds near the riverside community of Buras in Plaquemines Parish, just down the Mississippi from New Orleans. Katrina is blamed for an estimated 1,800 deaths from the central Louisiana coast to around the Mississippi-Alabama state line. A massive storm surge scoured the shores and wiped houses off the map. In New Orleans, failures of federal levees led to catastrophic flooding. Water covered 80% of the city and many homes were swamped to the rooftops. Some victims drowned in their attics. The Superdome and New Orleans Convention Center became scenes of sweltering misery as tens of thousands were stranded without power or running water. Memories of Katrina still haunt many who scrambled to prepare for Ida on Friday, lining up for groceries, gas and ice, as well as sandbags that the city was offering. Traffic snarled at entrances to a New Orleans Costco, where dozens of cars were backed up at the gas pumps and shoppers wheeled out carts stacked with cases of bottled water and other essentials. Retired police officer Wondell Smith, who worked on the police force when Katrina hit, said he and his family were planning to stay, but were also getting ready to head farther inland if the forecasts worsened. He loaded water, bread and sandwich meat into his SUV. ``I know what that looks like,'' Smith said, referring to the potential devastation. ``This is my first time being home in 34 years of service,'' he added. ``And I want to be prepared.'' Saturday's preseason NFL game between the Arizona Cardinals and the Saints at the Superdome was first moved up seven hours to avoid the weather, and then canceled altogether. The hurricane center predicted the peak storm surge could reach 10 feet to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters) along with Louisiana coast, with a possible surge of 7 to 11 feet (2.1 to 3.4 meters) in the New Orleans area. ``Being east of this storm's track is not ideal,'' said Collin Arnold, New Orleans' director of homeland security and emergency preparedness. ``We're anticipating significant impacts,`` including prolonged power outages and significant street flooding, he said. By the time it reaches the central Gulf Coast Sunday, Ida could dump 8 to 16 inches (20 to 40 centimeters) of rain, with 20 inches (50 centimeters) in isolated areas, from southeast Louisiana to coastal Mississippi and Alabama through Monday morning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ida-aims-to-hit-new-orleans-on-hurricane-katrina-anniversary/articleshow/85704805.cms||---
---||World||Covid-19 'not developed' as biological weapon, says US intelligence community||WASHINGTON: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was "not developed" as a biological weapon, the US intelligence community has concluded in a report, with President Joe Biden reiterating the allegation that China continues to reject calls for transparency and withhold information about the origins of the virus. The Director of National Intelligence in a report, prepared at the direction of the president, on Friday said SARS-CoV-2 probably emerged and infected humans through an initial small-scale exposure that occurred no later than November 2019 with the first known cluster of Covid-19 cases arising in Wuhan, China in December 2019. However, there was no unanimity among the intelligence community (IC) on the origins of the coronavirus. “The virus was not developed as a biological weapon. Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered; however, two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way,” said the unclassified version of the report. The IC also assesses that China's officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of Covid-19 emerged, it said. “After examining all available intelligence reporting and other information, though, the IC remains divided on the most likely origin of Covid-19. All agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident,” the report said. Four IC elements and the National Intelligence Council assess with low confidence that the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus-a virus that probably would be more than 99 per cent similar to SARS-CoV-2. These analysts give weight to Chinese officials' lack of foreknowledge, the numerous vectors for natural exposure, and other factors, the report said. One IC element assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology. These analysts give weight to the inherently risky nature of work on coronaviruses, it said. “Analysts at three IC elements remain unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, with some analysts favouring natural origin, others a laboratory origin, and some seeing the hypotheses as equally likely. Variations in analytic views largely stem from differences in how agencies weigh intelligence reporting and scientific publications, and intelligence and scientific gaps,” the report said. Meanwhile, acknowledging the receipt of the report, Biden in a statement said his administration will do everything it can to trace the roots of this outbreak that has caused so much pain and death around the world, so that they can take every necessary precaution to prevent it from happening again. Critical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in China, "yet from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it", he said. To this day, China continues to reject calls for transparency and withhold information, even as the toll of this pandemic continue to rise, Biden alleged. According to Johns Hopkins university data, the deadly virus has so far infected 215,290,716 people and claimed 4,483,136 lives globally. The US is the worst-hit with a total of 38,682,072 infections and 636,565 deaths recorded so far. “The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them. Responsible nations do not shirk these kinds of responsibilities to the rest of the world. Pandemics do not respect international borders, and we all must better understand how Covid-19 came to be in order to prevent further pandemics,” Biden said. America will continue working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to fully share information and to cooperate with the World Health OrganiSation's Phase II evidence-based, expert-led determination into the origins of Covid-19 – including by providing access to all relevant data and evidence, he said. Biden said the US will also continue to press China to adhere to scientific norms and standards, including sharing information and data from the earliest days of the pandemic, protocols related to bio-safety, and information from animal populations. "We must have a full and transparent accounting of this global tragedy. Nothing less is acceptable,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/covid-19-not-developed-as-biological-weapon-says-us-intelligence-community/articleshow/85704895.cms||---

---||Vadodara||365-day mango feast from Vadodara||VADODARA: This news is sheer nectar for the die-hard mango fans who cannot get enough of the mango season every year. Thank mango farmer near Vadodara city, Ajit Thakor, who has answered your prayers and made the king of fruits truly season-less and round-the-year delight for Barodians. So much so, that Banyan City may soon acquire a new moniker as the new Mango City after turning into a huge mango bowl of the state in a matter of few years. New species of mangoes developed by Thakor are yielding fruits throughout the year. Even as this year’s season is over in the country, Thakor’s farm still has hundreds of mango trees bearing tonnes of lush green mangoes hanging at a height as low as three feet. Originally a cotton and tur dal farmer in Kajapur village near Por, Thakor switched to horticulture in 2000 as the other crops were not yielding much profit. Two decades down the line, Thakor today makes over Rs 50 lakh annually from his mango orchard where he has planted thousands of trees. “I wanted to do something so that people can have mangoes throughout the year. People eagerly wait for April when the season begins and by June markets run out of stock and still people like to have more, so I developed this species. In fact, when NRIs come during December and January, they too can relish these mangoes,” Thakor told TOI. The farmer learnt grafting from a man living in Tarsali area of Vadodara and since then, he has been experimenting by cross-grafting of different species of mangoes. Thakor has travelled extensively in Uttar Pradesh’s Malihabad, which is popular in northern India for its mangoes, and have brought saplings from there for grafting. “I worked on five species of which two species – Neelphonso and Rasulabad – are yielding high quality fruits,” he said. Neelphonso was originally developed by Navsari Agricultural University through cross-grafting of Neelam and Alphonso to develop it as an off-season specie. While the original Neelphonso is available for harvest in July and August, the one growing at Thakor’s farm can be harvested thrice a year. Reason? Thakor further cross-grafted it with other species. Thakor named Rasulabad after the village in Vadodara district from where he got the first sapling of the mango for cross-grafting of this specie. Trained under Thakor, many farmers in the village too, have seen exponential growth in their incomes in the past few years. “There was little or no income from cotton and tur dal farming, so Ajitbhai told me to learn to graft. Initially, I grafted 400 trees but seeing the growth in earnings, I expanded and today there is tremendous growth in our family income,” said Ramesh Thakor, another farmer from Kajapur. This year Ramesh is planning to completely switch to horticulture.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/365-day-mango-feast-from-vadodara/articleshow/85699556.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The case of the prosecution was that on May 28 last year at Bhagwati colony, Davorlim, Ismail Mulla alias Chuto and Sadiq Bellary with common intention initiated a quarrel with Javed Panwale and his friend deceased Muzahid Khan. Bail applicant Sadiq first assaulted Javed with slaps, then brought an iron rod, which he had kept in his scooter with the intention of assaulting him. Javed snatched the rod and hit Sadiq on the head with it. In the meantime, accused Ismail brought a knife and stabbed Muzahid Khan, who succumbed to the injuries while undergoing treatment. Judge Gauns observed that the very fact that the accused carried weapons while going to confront the deceased and also Javed, demonstrate their clear intention to use these weapons in the incident. Though the evidence on record does not show that the applicant caused hurt or the death of the deceased, stabbing the deceased by Ismail, ultimately caused the death. However, since Sadiq shared common intention with Mulla, the applicant is equally responsible for the act of Mulla of intentionally causing the death, it was mentioned while rejecting the bail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/court-denies-bail-to-murder-accused/articleshow/85700003.cms||---

Announcing the decision, All India Congress Committee (AICC) Goa in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao, said that the new committees need to be formed within a month’s time. The shake-up is part of the party’s preparations for the 2022 assembly elections. Rao wrote to state Congress president Girish Chodankar informing him that the AICC has dissolved all the block Congress committees (BCCs), including block presidents. While the district Congress committees (DCC) have been disbanded, the two district presidents have been asked to continue. “The DCCs and BCCs should be reconstituted within one-month period,” said Rao in his official communique to Chodankar. Though the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) has been left untouched, party functionaries expect changes to be made here too. “It is a good thing we can start from scratch. It is time to reorganise. I won’t say that I was expecting this, but something was in the air. Let us say this is the first of the actions towards rebuilding the party,” chairman for the Congress coordination committee, Ramakant Khalap, said. The dissolution of BCCs and DCCs has offered a renewed sense of optimism in the party camp. Sources said that the move has signaled the party leadership’s intent of effecting an overhaul in the party organisation ahead of polls. “The dissolution of the committees is a culmination of a long-drawn-out exercise that entailed an in-depth assessment of each block and district committee,” a senior party functionary aware of the exercise told TOI. A party general secretary said that the next step could be dissolution of the GPCC with the decision likely in the first week of September when Chidambaram along with Rao and the party observers will return to Goa. “The AICC observers had submitted a report that the blocks are only on paper. It is a positive situation for Congress and there will be a clamour for the positions, which will reactivate the workers,” said a senior party spokesperson.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-disbands-all-block-dist-committees-in-major-shake-up/articleshow/85700053.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Business||Berger Paints aims to become $1bn co by FY22||Kolkata: City-based Berger Paints has set a target to be over $1billion company by the end of this fiscal. The second largest paints company in India is aiming to clock a Rs 10,000crore revenue by 2023-24, its centenary year. Currently, its consolidated turnover is around Rs 6,800 crore. Following the company’s annual general meeting on Friday, Abhijit Roy, the MD and CEO of Berger Paints, pointed out that its Indian business will be a major growth driver for achieving its centenary goal. In the current fiscal itself, the company is eyeing Rs 8,000crore turnover as it hopes to achieve 18-19% value growth in the top line followed by 12% value growth in 2022-23 and 2023-24. The paints major is hoping an operating profit of around 17% on the top line of Rs 10,000 crore, which could be close to Rs 1,700 crore. “This financial year will largely contribute to our growth,” he added. He also made it clear that the high double-digit growth would be mostly organic. “We shall mostly grow organically. The main growth would be from the decorative segment, protective coating, where we are the market leader. Our construction chemicals segment is also growing rapidly,” Roy added. Currently, the decorative segment constitutes almost 80% of its top line, which is likely to remain the same for some time. Elaborating on its plan for construction chemicals business, Roy indicated that in the next few years, it wants to be in the top-three of the market. The Rs 9,000crore construction chemicals market is now led by Pidilite, followed by Asian Paints. There are a lot of mid-size players with Rs 500-600 turnover in this segment as well. Berger Paints now has 4%-4.5% market share in construction chemicals. The construction chemicals industry in eastern region is 15% of the country. On overseas operations of the Berger paints subsidiaries, Roy said that it is planning to enter new markets like France and Switzerland in Europe. The European operation of Berger will be under Bolix. Currently, Berger has a presence in Poland, the UK and in Russia. The Russian operation has now being brought under Bolix. “The Russian operation has more synergy with Bolix that is why it was now under it,” he added. Bolix has a turnover of Rs 350 crore. Box Panagarh ops in 2 yrs Berger Paints is hoping that its new unit at Panagarh in Burdwan district would start production in the next two years. The company has taken up 20 acres of land at Panagarh Industrial Park and is investing over Rs 100 crore there. It will be Berger’s one of the most advanced plants in the region. The company already has two plants in Bengal in Rishra and Howrah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/berger-paints-aims-to-become-1bn-co-by-fy22/articleshow/85700092.cms||---

Classes are going to be held on alternate days, there will be no lunching together, sharing of textbooks, meetings, study tours or sporting activities. The government has come out with a detailed SOP that tells colleges and schools what to do as they welcome students. Final year students post graduate courses and professional courses like engineering will have classes on all six days while first years will have online classes. As per the SOP, second year graduate students will attend college on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays while third year students will attend classes on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. For professional courses like BE and Btech, second year students will come on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays while third year students will come on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Faculty and staff should be vaccinated. Colleges should have quarantine facilities and tie up with nearest hospitals for students with symptoms. Guru Nanak College principal M G Raghunathan said, "We will go by the SOP but will be splitting the classes. If there is a class of 40, it will be split into two and two teachers will teach. We will tell science students to come one day and commerce students to come on another day." Shanaz Ahamed, principal of Justice Basheer Ahmed Sayeed College for Women, said reopening is good for the students because they will be able to clarify doubts. “But we may have to split the classes to maintain social distancing. We started the same way last year." Schools will see regular health checks as per the SOP. K Manoharan, principal of SBOA School, said “We have sent guidelines to parents about rules on dropping students at lunch time. Gates have been specified for each class. Teachers will monitor students during breaks.

In a guarded response to questions on recognition for Taliban, India on Friday said the situation was still evolving and that there was no clarity on “any entity” forming the government in Kabul. India, the US and other likeminded democracies agree there’s a need for as inclusive and as representative government as possible under the circumstances in Kabul. Afghanistan crisis: Live updatesThe responses come in the wake of bombers killing 170 people at Kabul airport on Thursday, giving rise to concerns in New Delhi and other world capitals over Afghanistan becoming a full-fledged terror hub, and raising doubts over Taliban’s control over events despite their condemning the blasts. The incidents could be a setback to Pakistan’s efforts to convince governments to recognise or accept the Taliban, all the more so as alleged perpetrators ISIS-Khorasan have roots in Pakistani Taliban. Interestingly enough, ISIS-K is seen to share a deadly rivalry with the Taliban.

Mujahid made the remarks during a wide-ranging interview withThe MEA warned against “jumping the gun” on the issue of recognition for Taliban. “The situation on the ground is uncertain. The prime concern is the security and safety of the people. Currently, there is a lack of clarity or no clarity about any entity forming a government in Kabul,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. “There have been a lot of stories going around about who will be represented in the government and whether the government will be inclusive, which is another question, and whether other elements of the Afghan polity will be represented in that,” added the official. India’s focus has been on evacuating its citizens who are stranded in Afghanistan, he said. “We continue to monitor the situation very carefully. It is an evolving situation,” he said at a media briefing.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid also said that the group, which now rules Afghanistan, considers India an important part of the region. “We desire good ties with all countries, including India, which is an important part of the region. Our desire is that India devise its policy as per the interests of Afghan people,” Mujahid was quoted as saying by a Pakistani channel.

The number of doses administered in August is already higher than June, when the state administered 10 lakh doses on a single day – June 21 — thanks to a special drive by the Centre. On the seven days ending August 27, the state administered 26.1 lakh doses, a number which was set to increase by the end of Friday. As on date, more than 3.9 crore doses have been administered in the state. The drive has covered more than 2.9 crore people, and of these, nearly 95 lakh have been fully inoculated (both doses). While Bengaluru was the priority so far, from September, the health department is planning a more equitable distribution of doses across districts. “The opening balance today (Friday) was around 26 lakh doses, and we should be able to cross one crore doses for the month,” health commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra said, adding that the state has received 84 lakh doses for August. Of the 3.9 crore doses administered, Chandra said, 52 lakh, or around 13% of the shots, were given at private facilities. More than 1.96 crore doses have been given to men and more than 1.94 crore to women. The government, as reported by TOI earlier, has set itself a daily target of five lakh doses a day, but has been stymied by supplies from the Centre. With available doses, the state has administered an average of 3.7 lakh doses on each day between August 21 and 27 (up to 12pm). Analysis of 32 weeks of the vaccination drive shows the overall daily average is around 1.7 lakh with around 12.2 lakh doses being administered per week. However, some weeks have seen a significantly lower number while there are also multiple weeks that have more than double this number. The lowest weekly coverage (1.2 lakh) was between January 23 and 29, and the highest (31.2 lakh) between June 19 and 25 — largely because of the single day spike recorded on June 21. “We are hopeful of getting more doses from September which will help us increase daily vaccinations further,” Chandra said. “The state has covered nearly 60% of the target population with the first dose and the strategy ahead is for equitable coverage of all districts.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-administers-record-83-lakh-shots-in-august-hopes-to-hit-1-crore/articleshow/85705020.cms||Chethan Kumar

---||Chandigarh||revised‘BJP and its associates want to sell off the entire nation’||Three days after the Haryana assembly passed Haryana Fair Compensation of Land Acquisition, Relief and Rehabilitation (Amendment) Bill, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) spokesperson and Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) member Rakesh Tikait on Friday said the Union and Haryana governments are bent upon selling off precious land to their own men. Speaking to Manvir Saini, Tikait elaborated upon SKM’s plans on several issues. What is your (SKM) reaction to the Bill related to amendment in fair compensation, relief and rehabilitation for land acquisition? They (Union and state governments) are identifying the best land and the BJP and its associates want to sell off the entire nation. BJP leaders will prepare project reports and the government would make land available to them. But we, as SKM, have an agenda to defend (our lands) strongly. Farmers will stand there to protect their lands with lathis. You have given the slogan of Operation Uttar Pradesh Fateh. How it is different from Mission Punjab, a slogan given by Gurnam Singh Charuni? SKM has given liberty to all its leaders to speak freely and to speak their mind. Everybody is working in tandem under the banner of SKM. And for the cause of farmers, he (Charuni) is doing his bit. As far as invitation is concerned, we have invited all. What turnout is expected from Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh for Muzaffarnagar rally? What are your plans for Uttar Pradesh election? I really have no idea. But, yes there would be an unprecedented turnout of farmers at the venue on the day. As far as focus is concerned, it would be MSP, withdrawal of the three ‘black laws’, release of sugarcane payment, loan waiver and other issues related to farmers. Besides, we shall also decide the further course of action regarding farmers’ agitation. Rest, let the model code of conduct come into place for the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, we shall let you know about our plans. As the agitation is growing old, dissent too is coming out against SKM. Recently you barred four farmer leaders in Tikri from participation in meetings of the morcha. We are going very strong. We have zero tolerance for those who violate the law of the land or speak against the Constitution. We don’t encourage individual opinions which could hurt the feelings of national patriots. That is why we have placed them under suspension and shall continue to take similar action. You coined a term Sarkaari Talibaani for government? What does that mean? They (government) coined words Khalistanti and Pakistani for us, especially for farmers from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Hence, we coined the term ‘Sarkaari Talibaani’, as they want to rule and occupy the country at gunpoint. If they are feeling bad now, they would realise how bad we must have felt (when called Khalistani and Pakistani). Let them have a relook into their allegations when they accuse us of getting foreign funding and calling us anti-nationals. Haryana government has started summoning farmers who have been named in farm agitation related 136 FIRs registered in the state. In all, 4.5 lakh people across the country have been served notices by various agencies across the country for participating in the farmers’ agitation. Such moves hardly deter the ongoing agitation. A lot of sacrifices have been made in these agitations against the Centre’s three contentious laws. Those who are afraid of action should not come. The agitation will go on. How long will the agitation continue? We have already said that the agitation will go on till the government withdraws the three laws and provides MSP security for farmers’ produce. If they don’t do it, we can continue this agitation for years now. We are in no hurry to return (from protest sites). All this is up to the government. Box Punjab farmers invited to mahapanchayat Rakesh Tikait, who addressed the rally attended by Punjab and Chandigarh farmers, along with BKU (Lakhowal) president Ajmer Singh Lakhowal and BKU (Haryana) president Rattan Mann, invited them all for the Rashtriya Kisan Mahapanachayat to be held at Muzzaffarnagar on September 5.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/revisedbjp-and-its-associates-want-to-sell-off-the-entire-nation/articleshow/85702669.cms||Manvir Saini

The children were left to fend for themselves after their parents died due to Covid over a year ago. The other children are five, three and two-years-old. A video of them begging for food, with the eldest sister carrying the infant in her arms, was shared widely on social media. Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan saw the video and ordered the administration to rescue them. All five are now at a shelter for children. Their father died in February last year and their mother in March. Their aunt kept them with her for a while but then left them with their grandfather in Bhind. The children may be given up for adoption, if their relatives give consent, said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/orphaned-by-covid-5-siblings-rescued-by-mp/articleshow/85705077.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||SKM national convention concludes with pledge to intensify struggle||Bathinda: The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha national convention concluded on Friday evening with a clarion call to expand and intensify the ongoing struggle against contentious farm laws, taking it to every village and corner of the country. The SKM reiterated two action plans of Bharat Bandh on September 25 and national mahapanchayat at Muzzafarnagar on September 5, to give momentum to protests which have been going on for over 9 months at Delhi borders. “Farmers have decided not to stop till the central government does not repeal the farms laws. They are ready even to keep on fighting till 2024 if the government so desires and the ultimate goal now is to see a government minus BJP,” said organising committee convener Ashish Mittal. Senior farmer leader Rakesh Tikait too echoed similar sentiments in Chandigarh. The nearly 2,000-odd delegates said nothing less than repeal of the three farm acts, legal guarantee of purchase of all agriculture produce at MSP of C2+50%, repeal of electricity bill and penalising farmers in air quality management, will be acceptable to them. They also raised slogans against communal attacks on minorities and sale of country’s natural assets and public sector to corporates and MNCs. Resolutions on these issues were approved with voice vote. Mittal said the changes being instituted will lead to wide increase in farmer debts, suicides and displacement from land. Assets, meant to ensure growth, provide employment and security to its people, like railways, power transmission lines, natural gas resources, telecom projects, food storage, insurance and banks are being sold, he said. This farmer struggle is not just a fight for survival, but save the country from being taken over completely by corporates, stated SKM.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/skm-national-convention-concludes-with-pledge-to-intensify-struggle/articleshow/85702701.cms||Neel Kamal

HC had earlier dismissed a case filed by Uke based on the same contentions. The petitioner contended that the stolen copy of his plea is in Fadnavis’ possession in various forms and hence, investigation can be done by use of reverse engineering technique. He had lodged a complaint with the Ajni police station in this regard, but since its cognizance was not taken, he filed a case in HC, making DCP Zone-4 as respondent on August 10. “We are of the view that there is no necessity of holding enquiry into the complaint filed by the petitioner, as there are no merits in the case,” a division bench of justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar said, before dismissing the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hc-dismisses-ukes-plea-alleging-fadnavis-used-pegasus-to-steal-docus/articleshow/85700764.cms||---

A decision to this effect was taken at the Shahjahanabad redevelopment corporation (SRDC) meeting on Thursday, said an official. The work to redevelop the historic 1.3km avenue was ongoing for the last two years, the progress of which was being monitored by Delhi High Court. The stretch, which is divided into four sections, is covered with 131 CCTV cameras. Sanjay Bhargav, member of committee supervising the project and head of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said 95-96% work was complete and the inauguration would be held in the evening of September 12. Some of the pending work include relocation of a few transformers, removal of illegal hoardings and signages and completion of a toilet complex, among others. Meanwhile, the CM will inaugurate cloverleaves of the Mayur Vihar Phase-I flyover on Delhi-Noida link road on Saturday. The move will benefit commuters travelling from Mayur Vihar Phase-I to Akshardham and from Noida to Mayur Vihar Phase-I as they will have an easy ride to these destinations after opening of the two loops. The agencies are likely to allow a limited number of approved rickshaws to ply on the stretch from September 1.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/new-chandni-chowk-may-be-inaugurated-on-sept-12/articleshow/85699716.cms||---
---||Delhi||Sonu Sood to be face of Delhi govt’s children mentorship plan||NEW DELHI: After a discussing lasting one and a half hours between Sonu Sood and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday, the CM announced that the actor had been made the brand ambassador of Delhi government’s “Desh Ke Mentor” programme, an initiative aimed at guiding students of classes IX to XII in government-run schools. “Sonu Sood has agreed to be the brand ambassador of our Desh Ke Mentor programme, which will be launched soon. I’m delighted to have him onboard. He has inspired lakhs through his selfless service. It is a matter of joy for us. His association with this initiative will help make the future of children brighter,” said Kejriwal. Sood said there was no political dimension to the meeting. “Politics was not discussed in the meeting. This (Desh Ke Mentor) is a bigger issue than that. I don’t think there can be a bigger issue. People always say, if you want to do good work then come into politics. It’s a wonderful field, but we did not discuss it,” he added. Kejriwal, whose AAP is the main opposition party in Punjab from where Sood hails, also did not comment on the speculation of the actor joining politics and, instead, stressed on his “inspiring” work. Besides Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia and AAP Punjab co-in-charge Raghav Chadha were also present in the meeting held at the CM’s residence. The actor appealed to people to step forward and support children’s education and take the nation towards a brighter tomorrow. The initiative would help students of Delhi government schools find a mentor, who would help them unlock their potential. Children would find answers to their career-related questions. The mentors would take out 10 minutes every week to guide the students. Praising the AAP government’s work in the field of education, Sood said, “I’m impressed by the transformation of Delhi government schools over the past years. High-quality education for all children, whether rich or poor, is the key to a brighter future for the country. We need to come together and do our share for nation building.” “Now, we want to make education a people’s revolution. When young people across the country join this revolution, no one will be able to stop India from becoming a global leader,” said Kejriwal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sood-to-be-face-of-govts-children-mentorship-plan/articleshow/85699754.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Delhi||Delhi: Schools are ready, parents not so much||NEW DELHI: Resumption of classes shouldn’t be a problem because schools plan to prevent crowding of students, said institution heads on Friday after the announcement that education institutions could reopen from September. Parents, however, weren’t too sure about there being no problems, while universities felt they needed to consult the stakeholders about a return to campus after the lengthy Covid-forced break. With parental consent a must, many schools aren’t certain about resuming from September 1. Suruchi Gandhi, principal, Bal Bharti School, Dwarka, said, “Less than half of the students have been attending the practical classes. So, we will have to see how many parents give their consent for their children returning to school. We could call different classes on different days and continue that rotation.” Gandhi, however, isn’t positive about asking the junior students back to classes yet. The expert committee said on Friday that children in classes VI to VIII could be called from September 8. A K Jha, principal, Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, too had similar expectations. “From experience I can say that in the initial days, few children will come. But when they see others going for classes, many will rejoin, particularly those appearing later for board exams,” said Jha. The budget private schools, most of which have classes up to VIII, have been demanding reopening of schools to get over their financial difficulties. The Action Committee Association of the bigger private schools also welcomed the decision. The Indian School principal Tania Joshi explained, “Children in classes VI to VIII are losing out on life skills and many now have Covid fatigue staying at home. It’s these considerations versus health concerns.” Joshi is certain that the students will spend fewer hours in school than earlier. That may be correct because education will now be a blend of online and offline lessons. Most schools have, in the past year, boosted their online infrastructure — high speed internet with enough bandwidth—to help the students have a better experience with online sessions. There is some parental resistance with Covid not fully conquered, but many are coming around. Fawad Ahmed Shamsi, whose daughter studies in JD Tytler School, said, “I read about experts saying Covid is becoming endemic in India, so I think it is okay to send the children to school. For a child’s self-development, the school environment is essential. We must learn to live with the corona infection.” Differing from Shamsi, Nidhi Gupta said, “Youngsters under the age of 18 years haven’t been vaccinated. What sort of protective cover will the government give our children? The decision to reopen schools needs to be reviewed.” Meanwhile, universities look likely to take more time to resume classes. Delhi University registrar Vikas Gupta said, “DU has a large number of students from outside Delhi, so we need to factor that in. We are thinking of first calling science students in all courses to return and complete their practicals. We will let colleges decide when and how they want to reopen.” Coaching centres too are happy, having remained closed for more than 16 months. “We welcome the decision of the government,” said Keshav Agarwal, president of Educators’ Society, an association of 300 coaching institutes. “But we expect there to be detailed guidelines and standard operating protocols because unlike schools, coaching institutes don’t have space and infrastructure.” Watch Parents remain wary as schools set to reopen||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/schools-are-ready-parents-not-so-much/articleshow/85699318.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Delhi||Ex-IPS officer held for abetting rape survivor’s suicide||LUCKNOW: Retired IPS officer Amitabh Thakur was arrested by Lucknow Police on Friday, 11 days after a rape survivor and her associate accused him and BSP MP Atul Rai, among others, for harassing them before the two tried to immolate themselves outside the Supreme Court. Both died during treatment. The woman, who had lodged a rape case against Rai in March 2019, and her associate succumbed to burn injuries later. Both Thakur and Rai have been booked for abetment to suicide on the basis of a report submitted by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed by the UP government. The FIR was lodged at Hazratganj police station on the instruction of UP DGP Mukul Goel on Friday afternoon. Thakur was arrested from his Gomtinagar residence around 4 pm but not before offering resistance to cops. He was produced before the CJM court, which sent him to judicial custody till September 9. Rai is already in Naini jail in the same case. In the FIR lodged by senior SI Daya Shankar Dwivedi, Thakur and Rai have been accused of abetment to suicide. Other charges include public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury, threatening any person to give false evidence, public servant framing incorrect record with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, punishment for criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy. The FIR mentions that on the basis of the two-member SIT report, it surfaced the victim had lodged a case of rape and dishonesty against Rai in 2019. Police had also filed a chargesheet. Thereafter, the accused got seven FIRs lodged against the woman. “It has also surfaced that a letter dated November 10 2020 was submitted to the then SSP Varanasi (Amit Pathak) by the woman in which she had alleged that Amitabh Thakur had taken money from BSP MP Atul Rai and now conspiring to frame false evidences in the court and also trying to tarnish her image which eventually forced her to commit self-immolation,” the FIR says. It further says the victim had also alleged that Thakur was circulating misleading facts and defiling her image by circulating audios linking her witnesses to criminals. After finding the contact number of Thakur, she made a call and asked why being an IPS officer, he was bothering about her case and how Rai got an internal report made by the police circle officer, Bhelupur, it said, adding that Thakur did not reply. As per the FIR, the woman further added in her letter to the then SSP Varanasi that she was fearing for her life and also the life of her associate in the case. “Despite knowing that our case is still in the court and the report of police circle officer is not the final report, Amitabh Thakur deliberately made the report public,” the FIR further quotes the victim’s letter. The FIR also states that on August 16, before taking the extreme step, the woman and her companion had live-streamed a video message on social media accusing Rai, then Varanasi SSP Amit Pathak, Thakur and other police and judicial officers of harassing them, forcing them to commit suicide which is also a dying declaration. The UP government has now attached Pathak to the DGP office.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ex-ips-officer-held-for-abetting-rape-survivors-suicide/articleshow/85699397.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

On Friday, the committee, which was supposed to release the round 1 admissions to seats under all India quota, deemed and central universities, said it will put the counselling on hold temporarily “in order to seek clarification from the Supreme Court in this regard”. On Thursday, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu, disallowed 10% quota for economically weaker sections (EWS) among forward castes in medical admissions under All India Quota (AIQ), saying it would take the total reservation beyond the Supreme Court-mandated cap of 50%. It also held that OBC quota for AIQ seats will be 27% as notified by the Union government, and not 50% as demanded by the DMK. The MCC, which is incharge on counselling for admissions to central/deemed university and all India quota seats of government colleges said, in view of the court order, legal opinion is being sought by from the apex court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-admissions-to-pg-dental-courses-put-on-hold/articleshow/85705113.cms||---

In another move, Beijing has also cracked down on what it described as a “chaotic” celebrity fan culture, imposing new restrictions on already tightly controlled content in China. The moves further clip the wings of Chinese tech behemoths such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings and have unnerved investors, hammering Chinese shares. China is framing rules to ban internet firms whose data is deemed to pose a potential security risk from listing abroad, a person familiar with the matter said. As China’s tech sector has grown in size and prominence, Beijing has become increasingly wary of its influence and the mountains of data it controls. In a move underlining that concern, Tianjin, a city of 14 million lying south of Beijing, told companies controlled by the municipality to migrate data from clouds run by private operators like Alibaba and Tencent to a staterun system by September 2022. The Cyberspace Administration of China said on Friday it was also tightening oversight of algorithms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/markets/ipo/china-targets-us-ipos-use-of-cloud-algorithms/articleshow/85707390.cms||---
