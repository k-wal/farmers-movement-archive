However, the law caught up with her on July 27 when city police picked her up from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. The arrested has been identified as Anuradha KS, a staffer at Kannamangala Gram Panchayat in Devanahalli. Police are trying to ascertain her role in the fire incident, which resulted in destruction of evidence related to a fund misappropriation case. Venkatesh Kumar, a waterman with the same GP, has also been arrested for joining hands with Anuradha, who has been with the gram panchayat for more than 10 years. Investigations revealed Anuradha visited temples in different places of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and UP. A few years ago, her family had gone on a similar pilgrimage and a travel agent from Varanasi had arranged the entire package. With the help of the same agent, Anuradha again embarked on the pilgrimage, but this time alone, police said. Anuradha used different modes of transport. While she travelled in a cab in AP and Telangana, she took a bus to Maharashtra and used different cabs to tour the state. She flew down to Rajasthan and then visited Gujarat. From Gujarat, she travelled in a train to Varanasi, police said. Trouble began on June 20 this year with Nagesh of Devanahalli filing a police complaint against Anuradha, accusing her of misusing at least Rs 9 lakh by creating fake documents. On June 22 night, the fire broke out in the GP building, destroying computers and other documents. CCTV cameras were damaged and the DVR gutted. ‘Aide confessed she hatched conspiracy’“Venkatesh confessed saying it was Anuradha who hatched the sabotage conspiracy. Anuradha and Venkatesh had set the GP office on fire with an intention of destroying the documents that could land her in trouble. Venkatesh explained how Anuradha had taught him to face cops and answer them if caught for the act,” an investigating officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) CK Baba said: “We can only say that prime suspects in the panchayat office fire case, Anuradha and Venkatesh, have been arrested. We can’t divulge any more information since the matter is under investigation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gp-staffer-visited-temples-in-6-states-to-stay-off-police-radar/articleshow/84932244.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Malnad received -13% rainfall compared to the normal in the first two months. Kodagu (-23%). For Chikkamagaluru, it was -14%, Shivamogga -9% and Hassan -4%. The situation did not improve much in July when Malnad region received -10% rainfall compared to the normal rainfall and Kodagu recorded -24%. Mysuru district too received deficit rainfall. In June and July, the district received -17% rainfall. Normal rainfall for the district for these two months is 220.6 mm, but this year the district got only 184.2mm. Despite the deficit rainfall, water level in major dams of the region is good this year. For example, as on Saturday, 36.4tmc ft water is available at KRS dam. It was 27.8 tmc ft on the same day last year. In Kabini dam, the level is 16.9 tmc ft when compared to 1.5 tmc ft last year, Hemavathi 34.3 tmc ft as opposed to 17.8 tmc ft ), and Lingamanakki 114.8 tmc ft as against 40.8 tmc ft.  “Instead of the entire month, we received rain in just two to three days. High intensity rain for a couple of days results in good inflow to dams,” said Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) senior consultant G Srinivas Reddy. “As per the forecast for August, we expect normal to above-normal rainfall,” he said. Rajya Raitha Sangha president Badagalapura Nagendra said the deficit rain affected farmers. “Many were forced to switch crops. We are not witnessing rain according to our traditional rain almanac (panchangam) which has affected the crop pattern,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/despite-rain-deficit-dam-water-levels-up/articleshow/84932259.cms||Shrinivasa M

They are seven from Central Silk Board to KR Puram, five from KR Puram to Hebbal and two from Hebbal to KIA. Officials said many of these FOBs that come in the way of Metro’s alignment are likely to be dismantled even though crores of rupees were spent on them to help commuters cross busy and accident-prone sections along ORR and Ballari Road. “Some of the FOBs may be removed or relocated if necessary for the elevated Metro line from Silk Board to KIA," said a BMRCL official. However, BMRCL is yet to take a formal decision. Chief public relations officer BL Yashwanth Chavan said: “We are working with contractors to assess the impact on FOBs.” BMRCL officials said they will allow non-Metro commuters to use its facilities at Phase 2 stations for free to ensure their safety. This means the general public can use stairs, escalators and elevators at Metro stations during operational hours to cross roads. “All stations will have non-Metro connectivity,” said Chavan. Pradeep K, a techie staying in Mahadevapura, said: “Many FOBs were constructed in accident-prone places. Metro construction will continue for another three-five years and it will be more difficult for pedestrians to cross busy roads during construction work. Instead of dismantling FOBs, BMRCL should redesign the structures and allow pedestrians to cross from one side to the other.” While Afcons Infrastructure Ltd. and Shankaranarayana Constructions Pvt. Ltd received the contract to construct ORR Metro (Silk Board-KR Puram), BMRCL is yet to finalise the KR Puram-KIA tender. At KR Puram, the Outer Ring Road Metro line is at a rail level of 8m from the ground and will run under Byappanahalli-Whitefield line, which will have a rail level of 16.4m.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/metro-work-may-affect-14-fobs-between-orr-kia/articleshow/84932268.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Berth pangs: Tightrope walk for Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai as aspirants’ list grows||BENGALURU: With a long list of ministerial aspirants, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has a mammoth task cut out when he takes up the cabinet expansion next week. He will have to weigh all options—caste, regional and factional equations. It will not be easy to balance everything and accommodate party loyalists, supporters of former CM BS Yediyurappa, migrant MLAs and members of anti-Yediyurappa faction. As barely 21 months will be left for the new ministers to show their performance before assembly polls, Bommai’s challenges will be bigger if the leadership wants him to reward some young faces and drop seniors who were controversial and non-performers in Yediyurappa’s cabinet. The number gameAt present, there are no ministers in Bommai’s cabinet and excluding the CM, his government could have at most 33. Going by this figure, he may want to keep three vacancies to tide over possible dissidence in future. Former Congress and JD(S) MLAs, who had helped BJP topple HD Kumaraswamy government in 2019, are expected to walk away with the lion’s share of the berths. A party source said the leadership may allow only eight migrants to be inducted this time. But it may not be a stand Yediyurappa himself would go with – after all, he has ‘given his word’ to them, the source added. This apart, Ramesh Jarkiholi, who led the rebel MLAs, has been lobbying hard to return to the cabinet after he resigned as water resources minister in March over the sex CD case. Caste conundrumIt also remains to be seen whether the party will accommodate MLAs from Panchamasali sub-sect of Lingayats – Basannagouda Patil Yatnal, Arvind Bellad and Murgesh Nirani, who had lobbied hard for the CM post besides Yediyurappa’s loyalist CC Patil. “If Yatnal is ignored, the rumblings in BJP are likely to only increase after the cabinet expansion since he has already started creating a fuss,’’ said a senior MLA. The leadership may want Bellad to be accommodated to groom him for the future though Bommai is said to be keen on his close aide Shankar Munenakopa to control his home district Dharwad. There are also ‘original’ BJP MLAs who they think are natural choices. This list includes V Sunil Kumar, GH Thippareddy, SA Ramdas, Abhay Patil, M Satish Reddy and Nehru Olekar. Not just ministers, there is also hectic lobbying to become deputy CMs following reports of possible appointment of five deputies to Bommai to balance caste equations. Yediyurappa’s cabinet had 11 Lingayats, seven Vokkaligas, four Kurubas, three from SC and two from ST. This composition had drawn flak over domination of Lingayats and Vokkaligas. There were seven ministers from Bengaluru and five from Belagavi district, but nearly 15 districts had no representation. The ruling party legislators had expressed reservations over lack of representation to certain regions, mainly Kalyana Karnataka. There was also objection to MLCs not elected by the people being made ministers (Laxman Savadi and CP Yogeeshwara).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/berth-pangs-tightrope-walk-for-bommai-as-aspirants-list-grows/articleshow/84932393.cms||ManuAiyappa Kanathanda

However, timely help from an autorickshaw driver and officials at Satellite bus stand on Mysuru Road helped her get back her money and documents which were in the bus that had already left for Mysuru. According to sources, Shashikala and her mother-in-law took a KSRTC bus from Mandya and reached Satellite bus stand by 9.30am. They hired an autorickshaw to Sanjay Gandhi hospital. The driver, Siddaraju, noticed Shashikala crying when the vehicle reached the hospital. When he heard that cash had been left behind, Siddaraju took a U-turn and sped towards the bus stand. The autorickshaw reached the bus station by 10.30am, but by that time the bus had already left for Mysuru. Siddaraju approached Lakshmegowda, a station officer at the bus stand, and informed him about the women’s plight. Lakshmegowda collected basic information about the bus and found it belonged to the Mandya division and collected the contact numbers of the driver and the conductor. “I called conductor Somalingappa and asked him to search for the valuables. The bus had already left Ramanagara by then. Somalingappa was unable to trace them. Later, I gave information about the seats the women had occupied while coming to Bengaluru. The conductor found a cover beneath the seat, which had money and the documents. Our staff handed it over to the woman's relatives in Mandya,” said Lakshmegowda. Medical reports collected through WhatsAppLakshmegowda collected medical reports through WhatsApp and dropped the women back at the hospital by 11.30am. “The woman was admitted for treatment after we received her medical reports through WhatsApp. A relative brought them their money later in the day,” Lakshmegowda added. The women and Siddaraju could not be reached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/auto-driver-officials-help-woman-get-back-50000-left-behind-in-bus/articleshow/84932410.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||Bengaluru||6 suburban stations to get better intermodal facilities; multi-level parking at Bengaluru, Cantonment||BENGALURU: Six upcoming suburban rail stations — Kengeri, KSR Bengaluru City, Bengaluru Cantonment, Lottegollahalli, Muthyala Nagar and Chikkabanavara — are likely to get better intermodal facilities, according to the detailed project report prepared by RITES. Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE) is executing the 148-km Bengaluru Suburban rail project. The four corridors are: Heelalige-Rajankunte (Kanaka), Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara (Mallige), KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli (Sampige) and Kengeri—Whitefield (Parijaata). “We are planning 57 new stations. In more than 60% of these stations passengers will be able to interchange with other modes of transport like Indian Railways and local Metro network,” said a K-RIDE official. Kengeri station is part of the Parijaata Line and will be connected to the upcoming Metro station. “A skywalk has been proposed to connect the proposed station with the Metro station and BMTC bus terminal, which are located 500m from Kengeri suburban station,” the DPR said. KSR Bengaluru City will be the interchange of two lines — Sampige and Parijaata. It is a major railway station in the city, serving long-distance trains. “A multi-level parking facility has been proposed in the existing car parking area at the station. The skywalk which connects the Kempegowda Interchange Metro station with Majestic bus terminus will be extended to the existing FoB, which links City Railway Metro station and KSR Bengaluru City railway station,” says the DPR. Bengaluru Cantonment station lies along the Parijaata corridor. Here, a multi-level parking facility is proposed at the station’s existing parking area. The FoB is likely to be extended to the parking area. Lottegollahalli is the interchange station of Sampige and Mallige corridors. “Access to the station has been proposed to be given from the Outer Ring Road with pick up and drop and parking for private vehicles,” says the DPR. Further, the plan is to link the south-side entries to the station with New BEL Road through pedestrian walkways. Muthyala Nagar is part of Sampige corridor. “This station will be accessible through 19th Cross Road on the west side and 1st A Cross Road from east. The existing RoB connecting Outer Ring Road provides access to the proposed station on the east side. On the west side, the pick/drop and auto/taxi stand along with parking have been proposed at the vacant land abutting the railway track. A pedestrian walkway has been proposed adjacent to the existing underpass to the station,” elaborates the DPR. Chikkabanavara is part of the Mallige line. This station is accessible through Hesarghatta Main Road from the west side and through some minor roads from the east. The access road on the west will be widened to 9m. The pickup drops, auto/taxi stand, car and two-wheeler parking have been proposed on the vacant land near the station on the west side. A bus bay has been proposed on Hesaraghatta Main Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/6-suburban-stations-to-get-better-intermodal-facilities-multi-level-parking-at-city-cantt/articleshow/84932411.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka to get 1 crore vaccination doses this month, says CM Basavaraj Bommai||NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: CM Basavaraj Bommai said on Saturday that the Centre has agreed to increase the monthly supply of Covid-19 vaccines to the state, from 63-64 lakh doses currently to 1 crore doses for the month of August. The state is gearing up to face a possible third wave of infections, while tightening border checks and surveillance as Covid cases surge in neighbouring Kerala. On the second day of his visit to Delhi after becoming CM, Bommai met Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya. Reiterating a demand made by ministers at the central level earlier too, Bommai sought 1.5 crore doses for the state to beef up the vaccination drive. However, the Union health minister told him that 1.5 crore doses would be tough to manage; efforts would be made to supply 1 crore doses for August and increase the quantity in later months. I hope about 1 crore doses will be supplied to the state so that 3-4 lakh vaccinations per day can be done in our state,” Bommai said. Bommai said Karnataka has been allocated Rs 800 crore from the Centre’s Covid emergency fund of Rs 23,000 crore. “Around 15% of it has already been released. The health minister has promised to release more to strengthen the state’s health infrastructure, in view of the anticipated third wave,” he said. The CM said he updated Mandaviya on the Covid situation in the state, especially the districts bordering Kerala. A central direction would be issued soon with regard to rising cases in the bordering districts of Kerala, Mandaviya is learned to have told Bommai. The CM also called on Union finance minister Nirmal Sitharaman and parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi in Delhi. Bommai said the Centre has agreed to give last year’s pending GST compensation of Rs 11,400 crore at the earliest. “The FM has agreed to give it in instalments,” he added. Bommai, who represents Karnataka in the GST Council, said the state had received a GST compensation of Rs 12,000 crore for the 2020-21 fiscal while Rs 11,400 crore is pending. The CM also sought early release of GST compensation of t Rs 18,000 crore for the current fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-to-get-1cr-vax-doses-in-aug-bommai/articleshow/84932435.cms||---

The constituency has nearly 60,000 voters who belong to the Muslim community, and on all three occasions, Bommai, despite being pitted against Sayyad Ajjampeer Khadri of the Congress, has managed to come up trumps. Political observers in Haveri district attributed Bommai’s popularity among the voters to his focus on inclusive development. In addition to sanctioning grants to Shaadi Mahal, Bommai has consistently worked towards the development of localities where the minority populace is concentrated – he has been particularly successful in ensuring development of irrigation facilities for betel farms, cultivated largely by Muslims in Shiggaon-Savanur. Despite being a member of the saffron party, Bommai cut his teeth in politics as a member of the Janata Parivar and his socialist leanings have held him in good stead among the people, cutting across lines of religion and caste. That Bommai enjoys considerable popularity among the dominant Panchamasali Lingayat community in Shiggaon despite being a Sadar Lingayat further illustrates his pan-social appeal. Of the 80,000 voters Veershaiva-Lingayat voters in Shiggaon-Savanur constituency, only 16,000 belong to Bommai’s sub-sect. Apart from the Veerashaiva-Lingayat and Muslim voters, the remaining part of the electorate comprises 40,000 Dalits and 24,000 members of the Kuruba community. Former president of Savanur Town Municipal Council Kalandar Ahmad Akkur said that the new CM had always shunned discriminatory practices in pursuing the development of the constituency. “He sanctioned funds to the tune of Rs 3 crore for the construction of eight Shaadi Mahals, approved development of two residential schools for students from minority community and even managed to restore the historic Attar building of the Savanur Nawabs. In addition to which, he has also developed the birthplace of Shishuvinal Sharif and Kanakadasa,” said Akkur. Veeresh Ajur, a prominent leader of the Panchamasali community in Shiggaon-Savanur, said that Bommai’s appeal transcended communities. “The many lift irrigation projects he has helped implement have transformed agriculture in the constituency, and among those farmers who have benefitted include those from the Panchamasali community. Consequently, voters cutting across lines of caste and religion have been supporting him all these years,” Ajur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/cms-popularity-in-shiggaon-cuts-across-caste-religion/articleshow/84932438.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

Nine persons have been arrested by the police. Led by additional superintendent of police (ASP) Ripunjay Kakoti, an oil tanker with a capacity of 30,000-kilolitre and bearing the registration number HR-61 D-9677 was seized during the operation. Tinsukia superintendent of police Debojit Deuri said, “We have apprehended nine people in connection with the racket. All of them are security personnels at the oil collection centres. Prima facie it seems there is a big nexus between some locals and oil security personnel. The gang is involved in stealing crude oil from OIL collecting centres. Thieves usually steals crude oil from underground pipelines. However, this gang stole crude oil directly from the collecting centre situated at Lankachi (Tinsukia).” Sources said that several oil pilferer gangs have been thriving in upper Assam for over a decade, which targets oil tankers carrying fuels. Every day hundreds of oil tankers loaded with petrol and diesel from the IOC oil refinery in Digboi and Oil India Limited refinery in Duliajan leaves for various destinations across the northeast. The tankers usually stop at roadside eateries located along the Moran-Sepon stretch on NH-37 between Dibrugarh and Sivasagar districts. According to sources, the gang, in connivance with some drivers and helpers, steal a certain amount of petrol or diesel from tankers and replace them with cheap solvent or kerosene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/tinsukia-police-bust-oil-pilferage-racket-nine-people-arrested/articleshow/84933603.cms||---

A patient of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, successfully underwent autologous stem cell transplantation, commonly known as BMT at the premier cancer care hospital here. “This is the first case of bone marrow transplant in a public sector hospital in the entire northeast. The patient is a 58-year-old man from Nalbari, who underwent the treatment at BBCI, involving multiple procedures starting on July 11. The patient achieved engraftment on July 29,” BBCI confirmed in a statement on Saturday morning. BBCI director Dr Amal Chandra Kataki explained that bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure wherein stem cells collected from the bone marrow are transplanted to the patient after appropriate conditioning treatment. “It can be autologous where a patient's own marrow stem cells are transplanted, or allogeneic, where another person’s stem cell, which is genetically matched with the patient, is used,” he said. Kataki said this highly advanced medical procedure is a team work requiring multiple specialties and infrastructure, and putting all things in one place is a tremendous achievement. A team of doctors, headed by the medical oncology department, with support from the department of pathology, carried out the transplantation. Lack of such affordable BMT facilities earlier forced hundreds of patients from Assam and other northeastern states to seek treatment outside of the region. “The cost of the transplantation procedure here is 60 to 70% lower than that of a private sector hospital in the country,” Kataki added, with a special mention of Dr Nabajyoti Choudhury, transfusion medicine specialist, who also offered technical support while collecting the stem cells. Dr Asif Iqbal, associate professor of the haemato-oncology division at BBCI, said that BMT involves multiple steps like mobilization (procedure to release the bone marrow stem cells into the blood), apheresis (procedure to extract the mobilized cells from the blood), conditioning (a lethal dose of chemotherapy that serves to eliminate the residual tumor cells), and finally transplant (infusion of the collected cells). Iqbal, who received training in BMT services at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer in Mumbai, said in 2019, more than 200 BMT cases were referred to other parts of the country from the northeast. He, however, said that the actual number of patients needing BMT in the region would be higher. Many of them could not bear the expenses of such procedures. Even then, due to the time-consuming process and expertise needed, the best hospitals in the country in Vellore and Mumbai can perform hardly 50 to 60 such transplants annually, Iqbal added. “There is a huge shortage of facilities where BMT is done in the country. In BBCI, we are now in a position to conduct one BMT every month and 12 in the entire year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/bbci-becomes-nes-first-public-sector-hosp-to-conduct-bone-marrow-transplant/articleshow/84933606.cms||---

Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level meeting on Saturday to review the Covid-19 situation in Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur. This followed a review by health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Friday. With over 80% active cases in these states in home isolation, the Centre is worried that in the absence of stringent monitoring, people from such households may mingle in the neighbourhoods and community, resulting in a wider spread. Read AlsoCovid-19: Cases top 40,000 for 5th day in a row, Kerala still driving surgeKerala reported more than 20,000 fresh Covid-19 cases for the fifth day running while the rising trend in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka continued, as India logged more than 42,000 new cases of the virus on Saturday. For the fifth straight day, India’s daily count stayed over the 40,000-mark as 42,052While some states — particularly Kerala and the north-eastern states — have been witnessing a surge in the last few weeks, contrary to the national average, the Centre has been insisting on micro-containment measures in clusters that are seeing a large number of cases to be able to contain the spread in localised geography.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); "Some states have clearly failed to do so (implement micro-level containment) despite the health ministry’s repeated advisories. Now the concern is that neighbouring states may also get impacted as cases are increasing rapidly in these particular states," a senior official said. Bhushan underlined that any laxity at this stage will result in deterioration of the situation in these districts. "The people in home isolation should be effectively monitored in such a manner to ensure that those who require hospitalisation are seamlessly transferred for timely clinical treatment," the Centre told the states.

Apart from the 46 districts, another 53 have positivity between 5% and 10%. The ministry also asked states not to lose sight of districts where the positivity rate is less than 10% so as to protect them and their population by focusing on saturation of vaccination coverage. The Centre has already asked states to conduct district-level sero-surveys to be able to assess the localised spread in detail and implement public health measures accordingly. The government also reiterated the need to vaccinate the elderly on a priority as they are most vulnerable to the infection. Besides, all non-essential travel should be avoided, it said.

---||India||HC pulls up NIA judge for not hearing bail plea for 6 months, sets date||NEW DELHI: A delay of six months in hearing the bail plea of a 60-year-old man jailed under the stringent UAPA law has prompted the Delhi high court to fix a date for the special judge to hear it. A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani took a dim view of the failure of the special NIA judge, Patiala House, to take up the bail plea filed in February this year, despite a direction by HC earlier to decide it expeditiously. The bench recorded its disapproval with the reason given by the NIA judge for not hearing the case virtually — namely the “voluminious” nature of case record. The special judge told the accused to wait till physical opening of court resumes. “It is observed that despite the directions issued by the single judge of this court, the bail application has remained pending before the special judge, NIA, Patiala House Courts, on the ground that since the record pertaining to the subject case is voluminous, it will only be possible to hear the bail application once physical hearings are resumed and not by video conferencing,” the bench noted in its order. The HC said, “We do not agree with the reasons ascribed by the special judge, NIA, for not hearing and deciding the appellant’s bail application, despite the same having remained pending before him since 04.02.2021 and in the teeth of the directions issued by the learned single Judge of this Court.” It directed the NIA judge to hear the bail application of accused Mohd Saleem on August 07 “without awaiting resumption of physical functioning of the courts” and dispose of the plea “expeditiously”. Saleem is an accused under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for being an alleged conduit in a hawala transaction to fund terrorism. Appearing for Saleem, advocates Tanveer Ahmed Mir and Prabhav Ralli had submitted that despite directions by the single judge, the bail plea of their 60-year-old client is not being taken up as the judge maintained that since the record of the case is voluminous, it will only be possible to hear the bail application once physical hearings are resumed and not by video-conferencing. As per the plea, Saleem has been in the custody since September 26, 2018. He was arrested along with others by the NIA in connection with an alleged terror funding module having links with Pakistan, as per the agency. The same bench had earlier flagged the problem of delay in trials of accused booked under the stringent UAPA, while hearing a plea filed by a man accused in the Batla House encounter and in jail since 2009. It had wondered what the duration of a UAPA trial should be before the courts step in to grant bail, noting that though the man has been imprisoned for 12 years, the trial is yet to be completed. Justices Mridul and Bhambhani had last month also castigated Delhi Police for “casually” invoking provisions of UAPA against three students who had protested against the enactment of the CAA and granted them bail under regular IPC provisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-pulls-up-nia-judge-for-not-hearing-bail-plea-for-6-months-sets-date/articleshow/84934143.cms||Abhinav Garg

Currently, Sengar is serving a life sentence for raping a minor girl in Unnao in 2017. The accident case pertains to an incident in which the girl’s two aunts died and she was seriously injured. The accident, in which a truck had collided with the car in which the girl and her aunts were travelling, had instantly led to a flaring of public sentiment and aroused suspicions of foul play. District and sessions judge Dharmesh Sharma took cognisance of the offences under IPC against truck driver Ashish Kumar Pal, Sengar and his eight alleged associates. “There are no grounds to suspect the fidelity, accuracy, and sincerity of the probe conducted by CBI,” the judge said. The girl’s uncle had lodged a complaint alleging that the collision was a result of a conspiracy hatched by Sengar and others to kill her. The CBI had filed a final report discarding the critical aspect of there existing a criminal conspiracy to commit murder or attempt to murder the girl and her family members. The court said the objections of the complainant read like an “engrossing thrilling story” but were based on “mere surmises and conjecture”. It said only a handful of people abide by road safety measures, while the majority are known for reckless and negligent driving and flouting traffic rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/court-backs-cbis-clean-chit-to-sengar-in-unnao-girls-car-crash/articleshow/84934647.cms||Usha Das
---||India||Kharif sowing hits ‘normal’ level as rainfall deficit dips||NEW DELHI: As the cumulative monsoon rainfall over the country touches almost ‘normal’ level with the deficit reduced to less than 1% on Saturday, the overall acreage of Kharif (summer-sown) crops in India crossed the ‘normal’ sown area threshold by over 8 lakh hectares. Though the acreage is still less than the sown area of last year’s corresponding period, the higher than ‘normal’ acreage is always considered good for the crop year as it shows the possibility of farm output in sync with the average of the last five years, specifically when India has consistently been reporting higher foodgrain production year after year since 2016-17. Agriculture ministry data show the acreage of Kharif crops was 848 lakh hectares as on Friday (July 30) compared to 840 lakh hectares of ‘normal’ acreage (five years average) of the corresponding period. The increase of acreage by nearly 1% is completely in sync with the distribution of rainfall in the country. The monsoon rainfall data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) show that the country had received more than normal rainfall in 12 out of the past 14 days since July 18. Analysis of sown area data shows that it is the same period when the country started reducing the acreage gap this year compared to 2020 and finally crossed the ‘normal’ threshold by nearly 1% on July 30 backed by high paced sowing of paddy, oilseeds, sugarcane and cotton during the period. Earlier deficit was mainly due to late arrival of monsoon in north-west India which had affected sowing in Punjab, Haryana and parts of western Uttar Pradesh. “If the pace of rainfall continues like what India had experienced post-July 13 when the monsoon covered the entire country, the overall acreage would definitely reach closer to the 2020 mark, if not more. There is the least probability of the acreage going down the ‘normal’ mark,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kharif-sowing-hits-normal-level-as-rainfall-deficit-dips/articleshow/84934791.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Of the possible 107 hours in the past two weeks, Parliament has functioned merely for 18 hours, wasting 89 hours because of ongoing disruptions due to the deadlock over the opposition demand for a discussion and inquiry into the Pegasus affair. According to government sources, more than Rs 133 crore have been wasted so far in the process with not much signs of a breakthrough as the Opposition remains firm on a debate on a subject which the government considers a “non-issue”. Since the Monsoon session commenced on July 19, Lok Sabha has functioned for about seven hours of possible 54. Rajya Sabha has functioned for 11 hours out of a possible 53. The opposition parties have made it clear that they will allow uninterrupted proceedings only if the government concedes to its demand of holding debate on the Pegasus controversy. However, the government has maintained that debate on issues like the Covid-19 crisis are more important and that Pegasus controversy is “hypothetical” and a “non-issue”. Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi had also said that opposition parties could seek more details on the Pegasus controversy from IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. Lok Sabha has passed five bills so far and the total time spent on discussing these bills was only 44 minutes. Rajya Sabha has so far passed three bills in this session and the total time spent was little over an hour. Unlike the ongoing impasse, the Budget session this year had witnessed record productivity even as initial few days were affected by disruptions. Lok Sabha’s productivity was 110%, while it was 90% for Rajya Sabha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parliament-worked-for-18-hours-out-of-107-in-2-weeks/articleshow/84935076.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||India||Districts hit by 2nd Covid wave may not see intense 3rd wave: ICMR||PUNE: Districts that were severely impacted by the second Covid wave may not see an equally intense third wave, an analysis by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said. Experts from the top science body said states should conduct district-level heterogeneity assessments — that include variations in spread and population — to plan public health measures based on local data. Samiran Panda, senior epidemiologist and head of ICMR’s Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division, said states like Maharashtra should look into district-level heterogeneity to formulate region and population-appropriate responses. “Talking about a third wave across the entire state may not be helpful as all districts didn’t experience the second wave uniformly. We need district-level infection control and management programmes,” he said. He said this also means that districts that didn’t experience an intense second wave may now have a significant number of vulnerable people. “It is essential to have vaccination saturation among priority groups in these districts. It’s also important to create an environment that’s not conducive for viral spread as such regions may see a third wave that takes off from the descending arm of the second,” he said. Maharashtra state task force member Shashank Joshi called for district-wise serosurveys, with particular focus on regions that were less affected during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/districts-hit-by-2nd-covid-wave-may-not-see-intense-3rd-wave-icmr/articleshow/84935176.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Both are rated at 100 lpm (litre per minute) capacity,” deputy commissioner Shrikant Balasaheb Suse told TOI.

The area has villages on the border with POK on its western flank. Nyoma is 180km east of Leh and forms the supply roadhead to villages in the Chushul and Indus sectors along the eastern part of LAC. Suse recently inspected the healthcare infrastructure in forward villages to take stock of their Covid preparedness. The administration is also weighing the option of setting up plants at Tangtse, the Chushul brigade headquarters and Khaltse, some 90km south of Leh. The new plants will ensure continued oxygen supply even in winter when road connectivity, especially with Nubra and Tangtse, become vulnerable to heavy snow and avalanches on the high passes – Khardung La and Chang La, respectively. Strict monitoring and medical planning by the district administration had averted oxygen shortage in Leh even though cases spurted during the second wave. The Ladakh administration had started work on augmenting oxygen supply right after the first wave had ebbed. Leh and Kargil has one oxygen plant each in the government sector. Leh has two more plants in the private sector. One plant for Zanskar sub-division of Kargil district was also under consideration, divisional commissioner Saugat Biswas had recently told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-lac-row-leh-boosts-oxygen-infrastructure-in-forward-areas/articleshow/84935318.cms||Sanjay Dutta

---||India||‘Not even 5% of India’s grasslands protected’||MUMBAI: Open grasslands are most often associated with African savannahs. But a new research shows that such open natural habitats are widespread in India — and poorly protected. Grasslands, scrub, and desert ecosystems make up 10% of the country’s total land area — or 319,674 sq km — but less than 5% of this habitat is under protection, a new study shows. A major portion of that protected area lies in just five parks, found the analysis by ecologists MD Madhusudan and AT Vanak. These are Rajasthan’s Desert National Park and Kailadevi Wildlife Sanctuary, the Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat, the Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve in Andhra Pradesh, and Bihar’s Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary. The lack of protection makes this habitat vulnerable, the researchers said. The study, which is in preprint, is part of an initiative to map and highlight India’s open natural ecosystems through open data tools. These habitats are mainly found in semi-arid regions in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, MP and Andhra Pradesh. They support pastoralist communities, provide fodder for millions of livestock, and host endangered species including the blackbuck and the great Indian bustard. Yet these landscapes have been neglected due to a historical focus on forests, a legacy of colonial administration, say researchers. “India has failed to recognise grasslands as a habitat,” says Vanak, a researcher with the Ashoka Trust for Ecology and the Environment. He notes that some of these open habitats are classified as “wastelands” in official records. “There’s a mistaken notion that anything without trees is barren,” he said. Such misconceptions make these ecosystems especially vulnerable to being converted to other uses, researchers said. They hope that their open data tool will help policymakers exclude these habitats when siting major projects. “Despite fragmentation, we still have large chunks of intact landscapes,” said Vanak. Ironically, these habitats may be most at risk from green energy projects such as the sprawling solar and wind parks being planned to meet the country’s low-carbon energy goals, said Madhusudan, an independent researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-even-5-of-indias-grasslands-protected/articleshow/84935596.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar

The government of Jammu & Kashmir signed an MoU with JSW Foundation (the social development arm of JSW Group) last week for the “conservation, restoration and maintenance” of two of its imperial gardens — Shalimar and Nishat Bagh — led by conservation architect Abha Narain Lambah. Planned as a 36-month restoration project, Lambah is steering a multidisciplinary team of historians, architects, conservationists and horticulturists to prepare a blueprint of the restoration work. Meanwhile a Unesco nomination dossier for all six imperial gardens in Kashmir — including Chashme Shahi and Pari Mahal Bagh in Srinagar, and Achabal and Verinag Bagh in Anantnag — was prepared by Lambah and submitted by the J&K government to the Centre in January this year for inclusion in the World Heritage List for 2021. Nishat Bagh is hailed for its twelve zodiac terraces, shaded avenues and visual axis connecting its terraces and water channels to the Dal lake“A project monitoring committee will be appointed with representation from the government of J&K as well as our foundation. With Abha’s help we will undertake detailed surveys to produce drawings; field research including material testing based on which, the actual restoration work will be undertaken. Work will first begin at Shalimar Bagh m followed by Nishat Bagh as a pilot project to demonstrate best practices for the conservation of these Mughal gardens,” informed Sangita Jindal, chairperson of JSW Foundation adding that the project seeks to engage local craftsmen. Built in the first half of the 17th century during the reigns of emperors Jahangir and Shahjahan, these ASI protected gardens — rooted in the Persian garden tradition that derived its form from Quranic descriptions of Jannat or paradise — were laid not as a backdrop or foreground to tombs and palaces but as open-air salons and cultural spaces for imperial audiences and courtly ceremonies. While 700 such “pleasure gardens” that had flowered across the valley — fed by mountain springs — were either abandoned, destroyed, transformed or vandalised over time, the six surviving gardens remained in continuous use for four centuries as a retreat where jaded visitors would come to regain their health, poets and painters would find inspiration, scholars would joust and families still gather for picnics. The most exemplary of the imperial gardens are the two picked for the pilot project. The Shalimar Bagh — on the far end of the Dal Lake and in the lap of the Zabarwan mountains — remains emperor Shahjahan’s first garden commissioned in 1619 that later inspired the Shalimar gardens in Lahore and Delhi. Nishat Bagh on the other hand was a more private garden than its neighbour, the Shalimar Bagh, which was also used for holding royal durbars. Built not by imperial command but for a Mughal aristocrat in 1634, Nishat Bagh is hailed for its complex twelve zodiac terraces, shaded avenues and visual axis connecting its terraces and water channels to the placid Dal lake. Lambah, who has breathed life into many of India’s medieval mosques, temples, palaces and forts to Mumbai's Victorian buildings, stressed the need to sustain the historic features of the Mughal Gardens such as its abshars or stone fountains, authentic Kashmiri flora, painted ceilings, artworks and unique hydrology that celebrated the valley’s abundance of water with theatrical displays of reflective pools, floating pavilions, gushing fountains, and chini khanas. “There is a need to restore the planting patterns to the original species of Kashmiri Mughal flora and indigenous planting traditions,” added Lambah, hoping that the conservation initiative would “re-engage the local community’s pride” in their cultural heritage. The nomination dossier for the Mughal Gardens for a UNESCO World heritage tag further outlines how Kashmir’s rich cluster of imperial gardens created a new paradigm where gardens were no longer subservient to buildings as the ‘chahar bagh’ emerged out of a walled enclosure to embrace the natural setting. “Together, the six gardens, represent the confluence of indigenous pre-Islamic beliefs and cultivation practices, developments in the Shahmiri period, Persian influences through travel, emissaries, artists, engineers and intermarriage. Together, they revolutionized the source and deployment of water and inspired subsequent gardens across the realm and beyond,” reads the 15-page executive summary with historical narrative, maps, drawings and notes on each garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-eyes-unesco-tag-with-mughal-gardens-facelift/articleshow/84935677.cms||Mohua Das

The move, part of measures to increase pandemicrelated surveillance at entry points, follows reports of a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the neighbouring states. “It does not matter if a person travelling from these two states has taken the first vaccine dose or both jabs. The person is supposed to carry a Covid negative report, not older than 72 hours, to enter Karnataka,” said a senior official of the health department. The revised travel guidelines, issued by additional chief secretary (health) Jawaid Akhtar, make it clear that the rule applies to all passengers, including those arriving by flights originating from the two states. Airlines have been asked to issue boarding passes to only people carrying negative RT-PCR certificates. Railway and bus officials have also been requested to enforce the same.

Only constitutional functionaries, healthcare workers and children aged below 2 years are exempted from the test rule. Travellers with a family or medical emergency will be swabbed on arrival and their contact details will be taken, according to the guidelines. “The spread of Covid-19 during the second phase of the pandemic was attributed to interstate movement of people. While north Karnataka districts such as Belagavi saw higher cases following the arrival of people from Maharashtra, coastal districts, including Dakshina Kannada, saw more cases because of movement from Kerala,” said another senior health official. “Bengaluru, which witnesses heavy movement of people from these states, bore the brunt of the second wave.

Currently, its weekly tally is 2,750, with the daily Covid count being in the range of 400-450. Overall, the city has recorded more than 12.2 lakh cases and 15,873 deaths. What about daily visitors?A large number of students travel to Karnataka regularly. Considering this fact, the state government has made some changes to its new rule of producing a negative RT-PCR report. While ruling out a complete exemption for these daily travellers, the revised circular says: “It is mandatory for students and others visiting Karnataka daily for education or business to undergo an RT-PCR test once in 15 days and possess the negative report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rt-pcr-ve-must-for-maha-ker-travellers/articleshow/84936133.cms||---

In a 700-word statement that began with the word “Alvida”, Supriyo said he was “resigning from being an MP too (obviously)” and would hand over his official New Delhi “home” within a month. He left clear indications that his decision to quit was partly due to his removal as a Union minister and that he had broached the issue of his resignation with both Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda “several times in the last few days”. “The question is, ‘Why am I leaving politics?’ Is it linked to losing the cabinet berth? Yes, it is, even if somewhat,” Supriyo said, adding that it was imperative for him to address the issue. He said he would not broach the topic again with Shah or Nadda as he did not want them to feel that he was trying to “bargain”. He did not specifically state his future course of action. At one point he said “it isn’t imperative that one has to be in politics to do social work”, and at another he said he needs to “collect himself for a while”. But he had told friends on several occasions that he was a “one-team-player, be it Mohun Bagan or BJP”. Supriyo did not respond to TOI queries but Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said the party “can’t react” in the absence of a formal intimation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-losing-cabinet-berth-babul-says-alvida-politics/articleshow/84936598.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||India||Danish’s body was mutilated in Taliban custody: Officials||NEW DELHI: The body of Danish Siddiqui, a Pulitzer Prizewinning photojournalist who was killed in Afghanistan last month, was badly mutilated while in the custody of the Taliban, officials said. The revelation comes amid concern that the fighting in Afghanistan has become increasingly brutal as peace talks have stalled. Siddiqui, 38, was killed when Afghan commandos he had accompanied to Spin Boldak were ambushed. Initial photographs from the scene showed his body with multiple wounds but fully intact. But when the body was transferred to a hospital in Kandahar, it had been badly mutilated, according to two Indian and two Afghan officials there. The NYT reviewed multiple photographs that showed Siddiqui’s body had been mutilated. An official said the body had nearly a dozen bullet wounds and that there were tire marks on Siddiqui’s face and chest.  A health official in Kandahar said Siddiqui’s face was unrecognisable, adding that he could not determine exactly what had been done to the body. However, a Taliban spokesman denied any wrongdoing on the part of the insurgents, saying they were under orders to treat bodies with respect. “Danish always chose to be on the front lines so that abuses and atrocities could not remain hidden,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, the south Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “The brutality with which Taliban fighters punished Danish proves the abuses that he was documenting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/danishs-body-was-mutilated-in-taliban-custody-officials/articleshow/84936711.cms||---

The court held that there was no evidence to show that the accused had any sexual intention. It also observed thatthere was no evidence that he had persistently followed the minor or accosted her in an isolated place. It said there was no cogent evidence to establish that the accused used criminal force with intention to outrage the modesty of the minor. “Considering the evidence on record, I find that the prosecution has not been able to bring evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has committed acts as alleged. Hence, the accused is entitled for benefit of doubt and subsequently for his acquittal,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/holding-minors-hand-not-sexual-harassment-pocso-court/articleshow/84936829.cms||---
---||Patna||6 months on, 39 lakh people fully vaccinated in Bihar||PATNA: Over 79 lakh doses of Covid vaccines have been administered in the state in 30 days since the launch of ‘six crore vaccination in six months’ drive by the government on July 1. According to a rough estimate, of 2.42 crore vaccine doses administered in the state since the nationwide launch of the drive on January 16, the month of July alone accounted for 33% vaccination. The state expects to get over 86 lakh vaccine doses in August to further intensify its drive. Among 2.42 crore people who were vaccinated in the state till Saturday morning, 2.03 crore had received their first shots and 39 lakh second shots. Month-wise figures show that maximum vaccination was done in July. Health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said they were moving in the right direction and with right spirit as far as vaccination is concerned. “We are thankful to all the officials and staff involved in this drive. We are also thankful to the people of Bihar for their support and participation. Vaccine hesitancy was a big challenge earlier. However, things have changed now and people are coming forward to take their jabs,” Amrit said. He added all districts have planned their strategy according to their requirement and there was no shortage of vaccines in the state. “We are getting the required doses from the Centre,” Amrit said, adding over 86 lakh vaccine doses have been sought for August. Asked about vaccination done far in Bihar so far, Amrit said initially the focus was on worst-affected areas and urban localities. “After completing vaccination in these areas, we shifted the focus to blocks. Even manpower involved in the vaccination process is moved accordingly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/6-months-on-39-lakh-people-fully-vaccinated-in-bihar/articleshow/84927910.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: East-West Metro rake rolls in under Sealdah, busiest surburban rly station||KOLKATA: History was made on Saturday as the first rake rolled into the Metro station coming up 17m below Sealdah, the busiest suburban railway station, paving the way for the East-West corridor’s 2.3km extension beyond Phoolbagan. When this seventh station is added to East-West Metro by the year-end, commuters will be able to travel 10km in 20 minutes. Continuous trails should start towards the end of August. The corridor currently operates along the 7km between Sector V and Phoolbagan. It will eventually run 16km till Howrah Maidan. “We aim to commission the Sealdah extension by December,” Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said on Saturday. Just before 3pm, Joshi, along with Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) MD Manas Sarkar and senior officials, boarded the rake at Phoolbagan. The BEML-make train sped at 65kmph till the crossover, but slowed to 15kmph along the last 300m to the Seadah platform since the signalling system at the station’s mouth is still in its nascent stage “It’s a milestone for us. This is the first time a Metro train has chugged into a railway station in Kolkata,” said KMRC’s director, projects, N C Karmali. “The other railway station along the East-West corridor is Howrah station, which houses the country’s deepest Metro station at 30m,” said KMRC chief engineer Biswanath Dewanjee. But trials at Howrah station and the rest of the corridor, from Sealdah till the Howrah Maidan terminal, won’t begin until next year. The integrated trials till Sealdah, a pre-requisite for getting mandatory clearance from the Independent Safety Assessor (ISA), will go on for three months, following which Metro Railway will apply to Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) for its nod. Metro Railway is confident the Sealdah extension will add meaningful rider count to the under-used East-West line. “Sealdah is a suburban railway hub with 8 lakh to 10 lakh daily passenger count in normal times. At least 40,000 commuters should use East-West Metro, which will take them to Sector V at a very low cost,” said Joshi. The authorities are bracing for much hard work in the run up to the commissioning. Along with the trials inside the east-bound tunnel, the west-bound one will continue to function as a shaft (opening) for winding up tunnel boring machine (TBM) Urvi, which finished digging on May 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/east-west-metro-rake-rolls-in-under-sealdah-busiest-surburban-rly-station/articleshow/84931673.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

TDP leader N Ramakrishna Reddy said, “We have reports by the sub-collector, assistant director of mines in Vijayawada, and district forest officer who ordered immediate halt to the illegal mining activities. A committee was supposed to be constituted to ascertain the extent of deforestation. But nothing has happened so far,” Reddy alleged. Later in the day, TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu visited Devineni’s house in Gollapudi and offered support to his family.

---||Vadodara||Lost woman reunited with family in Maharashtra two years after she went missing||VADODARA: A woman found over two years back near Chotila was united with her family based in Nandurbar in Maharashtra thanks to the efforts of the Dahod district administration and an NGO. But by the time this happened, the woman had lost her father who was making desperate attempts to find her. The woman who was around 25-year-old was found moving around in Chotila two years ago. She did not speak and since no details could be obtained from her, she was handed over to Abhayam team after calling the 181 helpline. The woman was eventually sent to the Mangal Mandir Manav Seva Parivar in Bagodara, Ahmedabad. The NGO made several efforts, but could not gather any information regarding the woman. Simultaneously it began treatment of the woman who was having a learning disability. About two weeks ago, the woman started speaking a bit. After a lot of efforts volunteers could get names of three villages from the woman. “We started using this information to trace the native place of the girl. The language she was speaking was also like that spoken by people in and around Dahod,” said Dinesh Lathiya from the NGO. The girl eventually said that she was from Karmadi. It was in this effort that the NGO contacted Dahod collector Dr Harshit Gosavi. Officials could not find any village in Dahod, but came to know that there was a village with a similar name near Ratlam in the neighbouring state of Madhya Pradesh. While most would have relayed this information to the NGO and stopped work as the girl was not from their district, officials from Dahod visited the village near Ratlam. While it came to light that the woman was not from the village near Ratlam, the residents there told officials that a village with a similar name existed near Nandurbar in Maharashtra. The team then went to this village called Kalmadi near Nandurbar. To their delight, it came to light that the woman was from Kalmadi. “The woman was pronouncing Kalmadi as Karmadi and this had led to the confusion. The Dahod collector and officials there did not give up and ensured that she reached her home even if it was not in their district,” said Lathiya. But as fate would have it, the woman’s father died before she could be found. Lathiya said that the father had made several efforts to locate her, but failed. He died near Gondal and the body was taken to Kalmadi for last rites. Lathiya added that the family members used to work in cotton farms for a living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/lost-woman-reunited-with-family-in-maha-after-2-years/articleshow/84930030.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fish prices shoot up as local bheri supplies dry up after cyclone, flood||KOLKATA: The city’s retail fish markets have seen an unusual gap between demand and supply, with the flow of supplies from Bengal’s numerous bheris and rivers drying up due to the cyclone in May and the flood. Fish sellers of Kolkata are now overwhelmingly dependent on supplies from Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The demand-supply gap and costlier diesel have pushed up the prices of the regular varieties by Rs 150 to Rs 200. “Most of the fisheries were washed out due to Yaas and the massive rainfall which followed the cyclone. Thus, the supply of fish from the fisheries and rivers has dwindled to a negligible amount, widening the demand-supply gap and pushing the prices up. Costlier diesel has kept pushing the prices further,” said Maqbul Islam of Howrah wholesale fish market. This is the time when supply of various varieties, including tangra, topse, pabda and hilsa, surges significantly, pulling prices down. But the vagaries of weather have hit fishermen hard. “In most of the bheris, we have started from scratch, right from fish seedlings. It will take at least a year to restart supply to markets,” said Shankar Ghosh, a fishery operator in East Midnapore. “The demand-supply gap is here to stay for some time with our production suffering a jolt. But we are trying to nurture a few unaffected bheris to keep the supply line alive,” said Bengal’s fisheries minister Akhil Giri. The fishery department has helped suppliers optimise the supply from Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. “We are tired of eating the same rohu and katla, though their prices are shockingly high. But other varieties are scarce now. And even if they are available, the prices are beyond our affordability. Mostly, we are eating egg and chicken,” said Anurag Guchhait, a banker who lives at Chetla. The supply line from Canning now plays a pivotal role in meeting the demand in the retail fish markets across the city. “We have managed to maintain the supply line despite constraints. But costlier diesel has pushed prices up,” said Chandan Maity, president, fishermen association of Gosaba and Basanti. The dearth of hilsa and other sea fish is also affecting the prices. The availability of hilsa around this time always cools off prices of other varieties. But the supply of hilsa remains extremely erratic and scanty compared to other seasons. “The bekti which should have been Rs 400 a kg is selling at Rs 650-Rs 700 a kg. Parshe, which should not exceed Rs 500, is selling at Rs 600-Rs 650,” said Amar Das, a fish trader at Lake Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fish-prices-shoot-up-as-local-bheri-supplies-dry-up-after-cyclone-flood/articleshow/84931630.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Vijayawada||After Covid, fuel price hike adds to burden of lorry owners in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: While the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the transport sector, particularly road transport, the steep hike in fuel price comes as a double blow to lorry owners across the state. According to the Andhra Pradesh Lorry Owners Association (APLOA), at least 15% of lorry owners across the state have become bankrupt since the outbreak of the pandemic, with many others likely to follow suit if the situation does not improve. General secretary of APLOA, Y V Eswar Rao, said the situation has become grim and survival in the business is under serious threat. “We have been surviving on the six-month loan moratorium given by the Union government as part of pandemic relief measures, but it is not sufficient for us to sustain in the changed market scenario,” he said. Rao observed that there has been a shift in freight transport from road to railways, especially during the lockdown, which has continued in the post-lockdown period as well. The road transport sector has lost a sizeable amount of its business to the railways, with the shift in business from road to railways creating a gap in demand and supply, he added. “With demand remaining low we are not able to increase prices in accordance with fuel price hikes. But at the same time, we are also not able to bear the mounting burden of the hike, which is eating away at our profit margins,” said Rao. Small players, particularly, with just one or two vehicles have been facing severe distress as they are unable to pay EMIs on their loans, Rao said, adding that several lorry owners have been pushed into bankruptcy after financial institutions seized their vehicles by declaring them as non-performing assets (NPAs). President of the Krishna district lorry owners association Tummala Lakshmana Swamy said from the 40,000 heavy vehicles that used to ply in the district, the number has come down to a little over 30,000. Indicative of the distress in the sector, he pointed out that not a single heavy vehicle was bought in the district since the onset of the pandemic. Now, in order to be able to sustain themselves in the business, lorry owners have decided to cut back on miscellaneous costs. Lorry owners will not pay depreciation costs of freight especially in case of agricultural produce. They have also decided to pass on the loading, unloading, parking, weigh bridge and clerical charges to freight owners. Further, they have also resolved to charge extra for a waiting period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/after-covid-fuel-price-hike-adds-to-burden-of-lorry-owners/articleshow/84931828.cms||Srikanth Aluri

However, the north-coastal districts of Visakhapatnam,Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are yet to record an appreciable amount of rainfall. The southwest monsoon covered the entire state onJune 10, five days after it arrived over the Rayalaseema region. From June 1 to July 21, Andhra Pradesh recorded 298 mm of rain as against the normal of 222 mm. Three districts, however, recorded deficient rainfall. Among the 13 districts, Krishna recorded the highest rainfall of 456.6 mm as against the normal of 314 mm. i.e. an excess of 45%, while Visakhapatnam recorded the highest deficient rainfall of 13%. The district recorded 257.5 mm of rain against the normal 297.6 mm. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the Rayalaseema region of Anantapur, Chittoor, Kadapa and Kurnool, recorded 297 mm of rain against a normal of 163.5 mm from June 1 to July 31. The region recorded rainfall over 82% above the normal. Coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) and Yanam, comprising nine districts and part of Puducherry, received 298.8 mm of rainfall against the normal of 263.1 mm, 14% in excess till July 31. Vizianagaram (11%) and Srikakulam (6%) recorded deficient rainfall. Westerly winds are prevailing over many parts of Andhra Pradesh. The southwest monsoon is on a break over north-coastal Andhra Pradesh and is likely to revive only after the formation of a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal. The IMD has predicted that Andhra Pradesh may receive below normal rainfall between August 1 and 5. It may be recalled that Andhra Pradesh received a record rainfall during the southwest monsoon in 2020, the highest in the past three decades. As against the average rainfall of 51.4 cm, the state received a cumulative rainfall of 73.8 cm in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/june-july-bring-34-excess-rain-to-ap-northern-dists-wait-for-share/articleshow/84931907.cms||Nalla.Babu

Jain Lal, 25, son of late Yesudas and Little Flower of Ponvila; Sajumon, 26, son of Madhukumar and Santha of Kottamam; and Vineeth, 21, son of Vijayan and Devi of Venkavila, were found hanging in their bedrooms. Jain Lal’s relatives said he was a BTech graduate who was searching for jobs. He was also attending coaching classes for the Public Service Commission exam. His maternal uncle Selvaraj said Jain was upset over not being able to secure a job even after completing his graduation a few years ago. All his friends had already managed to find jobs. His father Yesudas had died 14 years ago. He was raised by his mother Little Flower, who worked at a milk society at Ponvila. He has no siblings. Sajumon was a painting labourer. According to his relatives, he had gone to work on Friday too. As usual, he went to sleep after dinner on Friday night but was found hanging in his bedroom on Saturday morning. He is survived by his parents and a sister Soumyamol T. The third death was reported on Saturday afternoon. Vineeth, an ITI student, was also undergoing training to attend the military recruitment rally. It was his sister Vineesha who found him hanging in his bedroom. The police said the deceased were not known to each other. It could be a mere coincidence that they chose to end their lives in a similar way on the same day. The families of Sajumon and Vineeth are clueless regarding the possible reasons that could have driven them to opt for suicide. In another suspected case of suicide, the body of a man who allegedly jumped into the Vamanapuram river from Karett under Venjarammood police station limits on Tuesday night was recovered from the river bank at Kanichod on Saturday. He was identified to be Abhilash a resident of Nellanad who worked as a lab assistant.

Incidentally, the CAG report for 2018-19 has mentioned that the state government accepted the huge revenue loss from April 2018 to February 2019. Talking to the media after getting the second shot of Sputnik vaccine on Saturday, leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said the RJD committee would go into every detail of the report. “We will then seek reply from the government on financial irregularities,” he added. Tejashwi alleged that he had been tipped off about “bada ghotala” (big scams) during the NDA rule as mentioned in the CAG report. “But, we want to do some leg work first and then raise questions on the issue,” he pointed out. Taking a dig at CM Nitish Kumar, the RJD leader said the people of the state were fed up with him and wanted to get rid of what he described as “misrule”. “Bihar ki janata Nitish Kumar ji se ub chali hai,” he said. When asked about nomination of a new JD(U) national president, Tejashwi said though it is that party’s internal matter, but a good sign to frequently change the person on the post. He, however, said such an exercise would not help the JD(U) regain its political strength. The former deputy CM also questioned the sanctity of nomination of Upendra Kushwaha as the JD(U) parliamentary board chairman. “As I have been told that there is no provision for nomination of JD(U)’s parliamentary board chairman other than the national president,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-sets-up-committee-to-analyse-cag-report/articleshow/84929546.cms||Ramashankar

As many as 78,992 samples were tested to detect the 2,058 new cases, translating to a case positivity rate of 2.6%. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level meeting on Saturday to review the Covid situation in 10 states, including Andhra Pradesh. These states are either reporting a rise in the daily infection numbers or case positivity rate. The 10 states were advised to undertake intensive containment and active surveillance in clusters reporting higher number of cases. They were asked to undertake regular reviews and follow-up action for implementation of ECRP-II — Covid-19 emergency response and health system preparedness package. The major focus of the preparedness package would be on the augmentation of existing health infrastructure, particularly in rural areas and for paediatric Covid-19 cases. Under ECRP-II, the Union government would allocate Rs 418 crore (60% share of the total plan) to Andhra Pradesh, while the state government has to expend Rs 278 crore, totalling to Rs 696 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/positivity-rate-dips-to-2-6-in-ap/articleshow/84932108.cms||---

The Maoist action was part of their ongoing martyrdom week (July 28-August 3) being observed in Bihar and other states. As per the ministry of home affairs, Jamui falls under the category of most-affected 25 districts affected by left wing extremism (LWE) in the country. Police sources said the Maoists allegedly threatened the station master, Vinay Kumar, to blow up the halt if the train services were not stopped immediately. Sources said train services on both Up and Dn track were immediately stopped and remained disrupted for a few hours after the incident. They said Himgiri Express (02332) remained stranded at Jamui station and Tata-Chhapra Express (08181) at Jhajha station. The sources said armed Maoists kept Kumar and few other railway staff hostage for at least half an hour before leaving the station. Kumar later informed the Jhajha control room about the incident. After receiving the information, the CRPF unit for railway track patrolling and demining along with railway protection force, government rail police and Jamui police personnel were immediately mobilised and sent toward the Chaura halt with demining teams. A massive combing and area domination operation was launched simultaneously. The tracks and nearby areas of the halt were thoroughly inspected and sanitized by security personnel as per the standard operating procedure before resuming the train services. ADG (operation) Sushil Mansingh Khopde told TOI over phone that information about only one suspect reaching the halt was received. “He threatened the station master to stop train movements or he will blow up the halt,” he said. Khopde said there was no prior intelligence input about movement of armed Maoist cadres in the area and the modus operandi was not of the Reds. “Maoists leave behind posters, pamphlets and messages. They contact journalists or other persons and take responsibilities for any crime they commit. Here, nothing such happened,” he said. “I am neither denying nor accepting anything if Maoists were involved or not. Investigations are going on to ascertain things,” he said, adding the incident disrupted train services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoists-take-station-master-hostage-lay-siege-to-chaura-halt-in-jamui/articleshow/84929316.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Craftsman aims for record books with miniature arts||VISAKHAPATNAM: Small is beautiful, says S Chinnayachari, sitting in his artisan’s nook at his home in Etikoppaka. The village is renowned for its wooden toys. And Chinnayachari is one of the most accomplished micro artisans, crafting micro miniatures. He is now aiming to get into the Guinness of Records. Chinnayachari wanted to do something different from his family profession of making wooden toys and that led to a fascination for miniatures arts. Inspired by Willard Wigan, the man who made millions from miniature art, Chinnayachari created his first miniature art when he was 32. Twelve years later, the 42-year-old is exploring different possibilities in the world of micro-miniature. “I have crafted over 15 miniatures in the last decade. Among all miniatures, Golden Taj Mahal (0.10-mm X0.20-mm) set on a strand of human hair has given a lot of satisfaction. It took five days to craft the Taj Mahal miniature,” said Chinnayachari. The 1.11-mm X 0.70-mm Buddha, set on a poppy stem, is the latest from Chinnayachari. The 1.2-mm Ram- Sita Pattabhishekam, set on half poppy seed, and 1.2 mm miniature wooden chess board are some of the marvels he has created. “It took me years to master the art. It takes days to create each miniature object. The tools are made by me and resemble those used for carving wood,” he said. “I didn’t want to be one among many. I wanted to go beyond that to craft miniatures on strands of human hair and a few others. I experimented and challenged myself every time that gave me space and push to hone my skills,” said Chinnayachari. “Sometimes my eyes would hurt looking through the magnifying glass for hours at stretch. But, my passion for crafting miniatures made me more patient and professional. I have received many national awards, including the Indian Book of Records, Limca Book of Records and an award from the President of India. Now I am aiming to make a mark in the Guinness Book of Records for my miniature works globally,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/craftsman-aims-for-record-books-with-miniature-arts/articleshow/84932228.cms||Nalla.Babu

Addressing a webinar on ‘Equity and Inclusion in Education’ organised by Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) on the occasion of completion of one year of the National Education Policy (NEP)-2020, Ramavath observed, “The pandemic has been serving as a catalytic agent for enhancement of the dropout rate, especially among the students from the marginalised communities. It has only been widening the knowledge gap between the haves and have nots.” Ramavath pointed out that the NEP-2020 aims at bridging this gap by adopting differential strategy for meeting the needs of the marginalised classes. “All the stakeholders of education system will have to take special care of the disadvantaged groups with a view to ensuring all-round development of the country,” he said. CUSB’s law faculty member, Kumari Neetu, explained the theme of the webinar and said that equity and inclusion stands for ensuring justice to all. “NEP lays special emphasis on the vulnerability of the marginalised classes and pleads for targeted attention and support for students from these unprivileged sections of the society,” she said. Senior faculty members of the school of law and governance Pawan Kumar Mishra, P K Das, S P Srivastava and Anant Prakash Narayan participated in the webinar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-has-affected-educational-sector-expert/articleshow/84928088.cms||B K Mishra

Being initiated on a public private partnership (PPP) model, this project will enable visitors to enjoy the beauty of the forest area between two hills from the height of over 260 mt.” As Shah and Yogi are also likely to stay in Varanasi and visit KV Dham (Corridor) project area after returning from Mirzapur, the officials intensified preparations in Varanasi. Divisional commissioner Varanasi Deepak Agrawal said that the home minister and CM are expected to visit KV Temple to offer prayers and inspect the progress of KV Dham project.

Katihar Sadar SDPO Amarkant Jha on Saturday told TOI over the phone that police suspect former ward councillor Tuntun Srivastava and his two sons Guddu and Sunny Srivastava hatched a conspiracy to kill Paswan, who had thrashed Guddu and Sunny hardly fortnight back. “Tuntun used to win from ward number 16 of Katihar town before Paswan, who was elected for two consecutive terms,” he said. “They are evading arrest. They are also among the 12 accused named in the murder case,” he said. The SDPO said Manisha Srivastava (28), who was arrested with her mother Kumkum Devi (55) the next day of the murder, is the cousin of Guddu and Sunny. Jha said the former mayor frequently visited Manisha’s house. Guddu and Sunny knew about it. “Paswan was shot dead immediately after he had parked his bike in front of Manisha’s residence. Police suspect Manisha’s role in passing the information to Guddu and Sunny about Paswan’s visit to her house that night,” he said. The SDPO said technical investigation, including call detail records and analysis of the four cellphones, including one each of Manisha and her mother, will further reveal the truth. In reply to a query, he said eight persons were still evading arrest. “Police would soon move the court to pray for the arrest warrant against them so that further process of their property attachment could be taken up afterwards to force them to surrender,” he said. Jha said intensive raids were going on to nab the other accused and trace the shooters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/katihar-cops-suspect-role-of-ex-councillor/articleshow/84929585.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Patna||Will demand for caste-based Census bring Tejashwi Yadav closer to Nitish?||PATNA: For the first time in the last four years, there is unanimity of perception both in the BJP and its bete noir the RJD that the otherwise ice-cold and tense relationship between CM Nitish Kumar and leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has started thawing out. This follows Nitish’s decision on Friday to lead an all-party delegation of the state MLAs to Delhi for talks with PM Narendra Modi to plead for the caste-based general Census in the country -- something that the Centre has already spelt out in Parliament that it was not possible. The BJP has been maintaining that it favoured a Census of poor people, but not a caste-based one. Nitish, who has repeatedly said he and his party JD(U) favoured the caste-based Census, took the decision after Tejashwi, along with the legislature party leaders of the opposition parties, called on him in his assembly chamber on Friday. Their purpose was to make Nitish agree to the opposition’s demand that he should lead an all-party delegation to PM Modi to apprise him of their concerns and also about the unanimous resolutions adopted by the House for a caste-based Census twice, in 2019 and 2020. Nitish would write a formal letter to PM Modi on August 2 seeking an appointment for the delegation meeting, but the political circles are already agog about the political impact of his decision. Observers see in it a sure sign of Nitish, Tejashwi, RJD and other opposition parties coming closer. They have also been reading the signs of likely political realignment in the near or distant future, or even after the results of the UP assembly elections next year. “The ball is in the court of Nitish. He has to clarify his position; if he is with the OBC and EBC sections, or with the BJP that is opposed to the interests of the OBC and EBC groups,” state RJD spokesman Chitranjan Gagan said, adding: “Tejashwi has also opened an alternative for him. The CM can go for the caste-based population count in the state with its own resources, like in Karnataka.” Officially, the Bihar BJP is unfazed by the new development. “Anyone, and any social or political group, can put its demand before the PM. Until Parliament decides on holding a caste-based Census, nothing can be done,” state BJP spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel said. “The caste-based Census was held for the first time in 1931. No Census could be held in 1941.In 1951, when the demand surfaced, the then Union home minister Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel opposed it, saying it will disrupt the social fabric,” Patel added. However, as the Bihar BJP sources said, the party has been stymied by the new development. “The distance between Nitish and Tejashwi has narrowed. It also shows that Nitish and Tejashwi have started ‘talking beak to beak, if not listening to each other ear to ear’. That tense relation between them will no longer be seen now,” a state BJP source said. Nitish and Tejashwi were together precisely after four years, since Nitish dismantled the grand alliance government in July 2017 to form the NDA government with BJP, again. There was also a bonhomie between them, as “they talked in an amiable atmosphere, and they also kept smiling.” “The BJP central leadership wants coordination in the state among the NDA partners. They will not like to see Nitish going to the other side, if the 2024 parliamentary elections have to be won in the state. Any confusion in the Bihar NDA will also immediately impact the UP elections,” the BJP source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/will-demand-for-caste-based-census-bring-tejas-closer-to-nitish/articleshow/84931479.cms||Abhay Singh

Only one project is at the tender stage. The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is implementing the nearly Rs 1,000 crore project through the special purpose vehicle—Greater Visakhapatnam Smart City Corporation Limited. The GVMC has already completed projects such as City Operations Cetnre, smart classrooms, solar street lighting, retrofitting of schools and parks, development of open spaces, etc. Heritage conservation projects at Town Hall and Old Municipal Office are nearing completion. Reminders of the rich heritage of the city, the buildings have now almost faded into obscurity. The GVMC is developing the structures with about Rs 15 crore. Under the smart city initiative, the GVMC has taken up several projects in convergence with the VMRDA such as renovation of the VMRDA (Vuda) Park and Indoor Sports Arena in MVP Colony. The GVMC is planning to inaugurate several projects such as the two heritage projects, VMRDA Park, multi-level car parking facility in Jagadamba Junction, etc. The nearly Rs 180 crore ‘System Integrator to Implement Smart City Solutions’ stands out among the projects. The GVMC developed the City Operations Cetnre under this initiative, which is integrated with smart poles installed across the city. Each smart pole comprises cameras capable of capturing high definition remote directional and zoom control video surveillance, environmental sensors, Wi-Fi hotspots, emergency call system, public announcement speakers, lamps, etc. The City Operations Cetnre, which primarily serves as an e-governance centre, would double up as a disaster management centre during emergencies. The GVMC has also focused on revamping schools into smart campuses by providing ICT infrastructure, digital classrooms, and renovating buildings under this initiative. Superintending engineer (Smart City), GVMC, M Vinay Kumar said, “Several projects are already complete, while a few are nearing completion. The GVMC is currently executing projects like ‘smart streets’. The corporation wants to complete all projects as early as possible,” said Vinay Kumar. Special lanes for pedestrians, accessible public transportation stops and environment-friendly measures are some components of the ‘smart roads’ project, which is being implemented with about Rs 120 crore. While the Union government provides Rs 500 for the smart city project for each selected city, the state government will release an equal amount as matching grant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/smart-city-works-in-vizag-head-towards-completion/articleshow/84931883.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Though the incident took place on Friday, it came to light on Saturday. The deceased were identified as P Keerthi (13) and her friend A Anjal, both students of class 8 at a residential school in Vizianagaram district. The duo had been staying in their hometown Kotakonda for the past few months due to closure of schools as part of Covid-19 containment measures. Both girls had gone to the well on Friday evening for a bath. While drawing water from the well, they accidentally fell inside. Since the well is located on outskirts of the village, no one was around at the time of accident. Their bodies were later found in the waters. Locals managed to retrieve the bodies and alerted the police. While some locals raised doubts over the deaths, police ruled out the possibility of suicide or murder and said the girls had accidentally fallen into the well and drowned. A case has been registered under section 174 of CrPC (unnatural death) and the bodies shifted to the government hospital for postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/two-class-8-students-drown-in-well/articleshow/84932033.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Parents upset with schools over poor marks||Nagpur: CBSE schools’ worst fears have come true with parents venting ire over how their kids scored lower-than-expected marks, something which principals say is connected to the marks tabulation policy. Ever since the results were declared on Friday afternoon, many teachers have been getting messages in schools groups about how the scores could have been higher.Few schools held virtual/physical meetings with parents on Saturday to discuss the issue. “Parents are, quite naturally, upset over the results,” said a senior schoolteacher. “But the cause for concern is that everyone feels the school did something which resulted in them getting lower scores, but frankly the entire process was very transparent. We had just a data entry operator-type of role to play in it,” the teacher said.TOI had reported in June about how schools are worried about parents’ backlash over the marks tabulation policy. On Saturday again, TOI published a report about how schools and students were unhappy over the results and felt that many will appear for the physical exam. This exam will begin from August 16 and go on till September 16.Adding to the anxiety of students was the fact that over a thousand schools across the country are still awaiting their results. As per sources, around five schools in Vidarbha have not yet got their results.CBSE in its statement issued on Friday said the results are from those schools that are new and do not have academic history for reference. Around 65,000 students have been affected of which a couple of hundred are from Vidarbha. But it’s not only new schools facing these problems. “Schools which were not able to upload data to the CBSE’s online portal because of technical issues are also included,” a senior academic said. “The software accepts data within certain parameters. This led to technical issues and now results of the entire school are being put on hold,” said the academic.However, CBSE has assured schools of processing the results on a priority basis. As per a board official, “results will be declared before August 5” of all schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-upset-with-schools-over-poor-marks/articleshow/84934112.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

In a press statement issued on Saturday, health minister Mangal Pandey said Gaya, Kaimur, Munger, Aurangabad, Nawada, Rohtas and Jamui districts had witnessed the maximum number of malaria cases in the last three years. “June is observed as the anti-malaria month every year to create awareness about the disease among the people and encourage them to adopt proper steps to check its growth. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane or DDT is also sprayed in the affected areas till October,” the minister added. The health department is also focusing on timely check-ups and tests so that the people suffering from malaria receive proper treatment. “Accredited social health activists have been roped in to encourage people to get themselves tested and take medicines,” Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/7-districts-witness-80-malaria-cases/articleshow/84929325.cms||Sheezan Nezami

From greeting each other for the bond of friendship to tying wrist bands and reunions, people have made plans to make the best of the day as it coincides with Sunday as well. Going to cafes, restaurants and parks with friends to catch up on long-lasting memories will definitely be a part of the celebrations. However, with Covid-19 pandemic still hovering, people have planned to be cautious while celebrating the day without missing out on any of the joy and happiness. Ankit Ranjan, a resident of Bailey Road, has planned to celebrate the day with his parents. “Who said friendship is just limited to people of your age? The pandemic has opened my eyes. I now believe that my real friends are my parents and the ones I’m most comfortable with. We will watch movies together and party at home.” “I miss going out with my friends to cafes, parks and have conversations about our daily lives. It may seem like a small thing, but we are certainly missing it. Hence, I will just spend time by calling my friends and remembering the old good days,” said Gautam Singh of Kankarbagh. Khushi Singh of Gola Road plans to write handwritten letters to her friends. “Instead of sending the same old texts with no sense of affirmation, I will write about the experiences with my friends that have played a huge part in my life. This definitely is going to be an extra effort on my part, but it is going to be worth it.” Eateries, on the other hand, have also geared up to serve visitors. “Since it’s Friendship Day, we have decided to change the decorations so the customers can feel comfortable,” said Rajesh Kumar, owner of a restaurant at Patliputra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youths-gear-up-to-celebrate-friendship-day-today/articleshow/84929769.cms||---

More than 360 buses for seven districts -- Gaya, Nalanda, Nawada, Jamui, Sheikhpura, Lakhisarai and Jehanabad — have shifted their operation to the ISBT. According to sources, over 3,000 buses can operate from the ISBT daily. CM Nitish Kumar had inaugurated the ISBT in September last year, but buses started plying from there in June this year. The district administration officials said altogether 1320 buses operated from the ISBT till 5pm on Saturday. DPRO Pramod Kumar said in a statement that contrary to the facilities at Mithapur bus stand, the ISBT has most public amenities, including toilets, drinking water, help desk, 10 closed-circuit television cameras, 60 security guards and other measures in place. However, several bus operators protested at Mithapur bus stand in the morning, saying there were problems in shifting to the ISBT. Bihar Motor Transport Federation district president Chandan Singh said: “We are being compelled to relocate. Bairiya is way too far from the airport and major railway stations of the city. There’s less space and literally nothing better compared to Mithapur bus stand.” Mukesh Yadav, a bus owner, told this newspaper, “Why shift to an unsafe space? There’s no police station there. It is also close to residential area, which simply adds to the insecurity of our passengers. Even the drivers and conductors aren’t offered any staying space there.” Bittu, a bus conductor, was also unhappy with the officials as he thought it unfair to the passengers in general. “Mithapur bus stand is being blamed for waterlogging. Why don’t the authorities carry the necessary work to get rid of the problem, instead of asking us to shift somewhere else?” Another bus driver said, “The government’s offer of better facilities at Bairiya is the same like we were promised before shifting to Mithapur from Hardinge Park. Did our conditions improve? No. Then how can we trust them when we already know the truth. Mithapur bus stand remained crowded despite having three exit gates. The new bus stand has only one entry and one exit points.” Gajendra Kumar, a shopkeeper watching in despair while the buses left Mithapur for good, told this newspaper: “The area is being vacated and our life will be miserable. After being here for over 20 years, I’ll have to look for another job to feed my family. It’s disheartening to face this situation, especially during the Covid time. Why the government never thinks about people like us?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/buses-shifted-to-isbt-from-mithapur-stand/articleshow/84928160.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Covid ups risk of unregistered chit funds in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: While the prevalent unregistered chit fund schemes always held the risk of getting cheated in Andhra Pradesh, the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the volatility of these monthly investment scheme with the state recording four instances of such schemes going bankrupt in July. On July 21, police booked a man for allegedly cheating people to the tune of Rs 4 crore in an unregistered chit fund scheme at Satyanarayapuram in Vijayawada. Prior to that, a businessman was arrested in Prakasam district for duping around 20 people who contributed towards the chit on July 12. In all four cases, the common cause for the collapse of unregistered chit fund scheme happens to be Covid-19. In the Satyanarayanapuram case, cops point out that the accused R Balaji, a resident of Srinagar Colony, was trustworthy in handling the chit fund scheme for past two decades as employees, pensioners and daily wagers consistently contributed. Balaji was well-known for giving loans for the past two decades and gained people’s trust. However, he went bankrupt during Covid-19 resulting in him burning through the chit funds to meet his own expenses. Andhra Pradesh stands number one in the country in terms of number of households participating in unregistered chit fund schemes, according to a survey conducted by the Institute of Financial Management and Research (IFMR). The survey found that over 14 lakh households are participating in Andhra Pradesh and 96% of them believed that participation in such operations was ‘safe’. Unregistered chit funds in the state have been traditionally common where these funds are usually run by a closed group of relatives, friends and neighbours, running purely on personal trust. However, the cases registered under the Andhra Pradesh Chit Fund Act, 1972, so far indicate that a lot of money stands at stake for middle-income people as the unregistered money transactions under the scheme have left them in the lurch as even the courts could not help due to lack of evidence. The suicide attempt of Maddi Sridevi (35), who allegedly lost Rs 10.16 lakh in an unregistered chit fund system in Eluru, West Godavari, is a case in point to how the courts could not help in solving her issue due to lack of evidence. Sridevi pawned her jewellery and invested all savings towards her daughter’s education into the chit fund, ultimately losing it all two years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-ups-risk-of-unregistered-chit-funds/articleshow/84932150.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

A BSc third year student, she had gone to the university to appear in an examination. Police, who claimed that she had hanged herself, have sent the body for postmortem and initiated investigations. However, her father has rejected the suicide theory and demanded a thorough probe into the incident. After getting the information, vice-chancellor Prof Rajesh Singh reached the spot along with the varsity administrative officials. He has assured the family of the deceased and the police of full cooperation in the matter. In a statement, the university administration expressed grief over the death of the girl. “The VC held a meeting with the varsity officials to organize a day of counselling every week for UG, PG and PhD students to manage their stress level and boost confidence,” the release added. Reports said that the student Priyanka, daughter of Vinod Kumar, a resident of Shivpur in Shahbazganj, came to the University on Saturday to write her home science examination. Around 2pm, when an employee of the varsity went into the store, he saw the girl’s body hanging from the ceiling with the ‘dupatta’. Priyanka’s father, however, rejected the suicide theory. He told the reporters that Priyanka had not committed suicide as she was alright when she left home for the university with her brother Manish. “I want a through probe into the matter so that truth could be revealed. I don’t understand how she reached the store room instead of giving exam. She was absolutely fine when she was at home and left for the university,” he told the reporters. Priyanka was the youngest among her siblings, a brother and three sisters. Inspector Cantt Sudhir Singh said, “The reason behind the suicide is not clear.

By refurbishing the house of Aparna, SPC has facilitated a safe shelter for the family, apart from ensuring a better learning atmosphere for their friend. The student police cadets of the school along with some teachers and police personnel associated with SPC jointly put in efforts to revamp the house which lacked basic amenities, including electricity, a safe door, and windows. “Aparna, who is a bright student, was not regular in attending online classes. The class teacher who noticed her absence observed that she does not have the basic facilities to attend the online class. She was living in a ramshackle house even without a power connection. In order to attend her classes, she had to go to her neighbour’s house to charge the mobile. When we realised her difficulties, we thought of providing a helping hand to the family,” said Sreenu Sreedhar, CPO, SPC. In connection with the initiative, the SPC unit along with teachers and police personnel refurbished the dilapidated house by completing electrification works, painting, and fixing strong doors and windows. They succeeded in completing the work in two weeks. “All, including PTA, teachers and police personnel cooperated with us. The students were excited to join the initiative. Considering the pandemic situation, we could only ensure the participation of a few students. Many well-wishers also supported us by providing free services. We were also able to secure a power connection within a few hours after the completion of wiring," said Sreenu. The money for the revamping was pooled from the pockets of teachers and police personnel associated with the school SPC. Nearly Rs 25,000 was spent on making a safe home for the student. The wiring was done free of cost by the school’s electrician while the painting work was led by a civil police officer with student police cadets and teachers also joining to paint and clean the house. “When our teacher mentioned the condition of the house, we readily accepted to do something to improve her life. Now we feel extremely proud that we could contribute to the betterment of our friend and her family," said Dhanuja, a cadet. Five months ago, when Aparna along with her mother and her brother moved to the dilapidated house at Perumbahzthoor they never thought that they would be able to set up a safe shelter. “I never expected such a kind gesture from my friends, and teachers. Now, we feel safe and I am happy that I could attend my online classes regularly," Aparna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/spc-unit-renovates-schoolmates-house/articleshow/84932278.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid vaccines need ‘smart’ labels to show heat damage, say experts||MUMBAI: The Chinese Covid-19 vaccine has an unlikely USP over others: A tiny label that can monitor heat damage. The label, better known as vaccine vial monitor, has been a part of mass vaccination such as polio drives in India because it has a heat-sensitive chemical that tells health workers if a vial was stored correctly or damaged due to exposure to heat. It is the easiest way to find out if the cold chain to store certain vaccines was maintained or not. However, Covid vaccines available in India don't have vaccine vial monitors, which would add around Rs 5 a vial. “As India steps up vaccination, especially in rural parts, the vaccine vial monitor would be the best tool to indicate if a vial is usable or not,” said Dr Sunil Khaparde, former central health ministry official who was associated with the Pulse Polio drive in the initial days. Vaccinators in India are trained to check the ‘bindi’ mark before giving vaccines to children. In 1998, VVMs were first used in the oral polio vaccine and Dr Khaparde said he believes they played a role in helping eradicate polio. “While India had 1,934 cases in 1998, the use of VVMs coincided with a drop since 1999 when 1,126 cases were reported,” said Dr Khaparde. On July 14, Temptime, the American company licensed by the World Health Organisation to manufacture VVMs, wrote to India’s health minister Mansukh Mandaviya about using VVM for Covid vaccines available in India. “The people of India have benefited from the use of VVM in the universal immunization programme for over 20 years. VVM’s ability to indicate heat damage to vaccines, is a critical enabling tool in the immunization programme,” said the letter. At the moment, the World Health Organisation has not made it mandatory for Covid vaccines to have VVMs. “It is preferred, but not mandatory as per the WHO norms,” said a doctor from the state health department. Most governments currently are focused on getting vaccines and not on VVMs, he added. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said at present Covid vaccines have to be used within four hours of opening the vial. “With such a recommendation, there is no fear of heat affecting the vaccine stability,” she said. Each vial can vaccinate 10 to 20 people as per the manufacturer. “VVM applied to Covid vaccines will make it far easier to re-distribute vaccines from areas of low to high utilization/demand, by referring to the VVM, supply chain managers can be confident that the vaccine has, to-date, been stored appropriately, facilitating the acceptance of vaccine shipments both across and within states,” said the Temptime letter to Mandaviya. According to the letter, the overall cost impact of VVM is just 0.3% of the Covid-19 vaccine vial cost. “Hence, the cost impact of VVM is minimal as compared to the benefits,” the letter concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-vaccines-need-smart-labels-to-show-heat-damage-say-experts/articleshow/84936157.cms||---

Speaking about the plan, director, public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao, said, “We might implement this plan in future. People need to take all precautions and take vaccine to prevent the spread of the virus. The second wave is still active in the state and the number of cases are high in at least nine districts, including Khammam, Nalgonda, Karimnagar, GHMC and Peddapalli. The Delta variant is highly infectious. People should wear masks, both inside the house and while going out.” The official also cited the example of Kusumanchi village, where a spurt of cases was reported recently. Positive patients were found roaming about freely instead of being in isolation. “We are currently seeing outbreaks in Mancherial, GHMC, Peddapalli among others. We have a responsibility to see that it does not turn into the third wave,” the official added. On the two cases of Delta Plus variant found in Hyderabad in mid-May, the official said the two patients were safe and all their contacts were traced and tested. However, none of the contacts was found positive. The issue was also raised in the Parliament to which the Centre said that the two cases were detected at the airport and were of transit passengers. Meanwhile, even as the second wave is yet to see an ebb in the state, the health department started preparations to face the third wave. “We have prepared 26,000 oxygen beds apart from maintaining paediatric wards in all district hospitals. Additionally, all hospitals with 100 beds and more have been mandated to have oxygen generation plants by August 31,” the official added. Over 12L missed 2nd dose in T Over 12 lakh people in the state had missed the second dose of Covid vaccine in July. As a result, it has been decided to give priority to second dose vaccination in the next two weeks and the first dose would come to a halt. The state has been able to give second dose to only 30 per cent of those who took the first dose. So far 33.79 lakh people have been administered the second dose out of the 1.12 crore people who have taken the first dose. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-mulls-vax-pass-for-entry-to-malls-cinemas/articleshow/84934263.cms||Amrita Didyala

She clung on to a piece of wooden log that came her way in the strong currents even as she was swept away into the flooded Yamuna. She was rescued 25-km away in Hamirpur by some boatmen, who luckily heard her cries for help and pulled her out of the river. She was later reunited with her family by the police. A resident of Lichi Ka Dera, Sharda Nagar, the woman had gone to her fields when she fell in a swollen Kilandar nullah on Thursday evening. After falling into the stream, she was swept away following a strong current that took her to the Yamuna river. Despite her cries for help, nobody was around to rescue her. Luckily, she saw a wooden log of ‘babul’ tree floating and caught hold of it in order to remain afloat in the river. On Friday morning, her rigorous cries attracted local boatmen, who rescued brought her to the river bank. Soon, the boatmen in Manki village under Kurara police in Hamirpur district alerted village watchman Ramsajeevan, who informed Haraulipur Police outpost in-charge Bharat Yadav. The latter admitted the woman to a hospital and informed the woman’s son Rahul, daughter Vinita in Jalaun, who rushed to the hospital. After a brief investigation, the police handed the woman to her family members. Talking to reporters at her home, Jai Devi, who was yet to recover from the trauma, said that she could not believe how she escaped from the jaws of death. Haraulipur police outpost in-charge Bharat Yadav on Saturday said, “It was nothing but God’s miracle. No one can be harmed with whom God is present.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/woman-clings-on-to-a-wooden-log-survives-16-hour-ordeal-in-yamuna/articleshow/84935265.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The judge handed out the sentences under the Contempt of Courts Act for violating the court orders issued in respect of 383 acres of land belonging to Mohammed Sirajuddin and nine others of Maheswaram mandal in Rangareddy district. The land was sought to be converted into a reserve forest by dispossessing the owners of their property. Despite advice from the forest settlement officer that the action of the revenue and forest officials was not feasible and despite a court order to either acquire the land or return the same to the owners, the officials had failed to do so inviting contempt of court charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/senior-ias-ifs-officers-get-6-mnth-jail-for-contempt/articleshow/84934304.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Fencer Bhavani Devi’s Olympic debut rains stardust on combat sport||On July 26, the alarm woke Belapur's Prishaa Chhetri at 5 am instead of 5.45 am. Groggy-eyed yet excited, the 13-year-old national-level fencer grabbed the remote, pressed record and watched her masked superhero Bhavani Devi tear down her Tunisian opponent with "awesome counter-attacks" at the Games in Tokyo. Like Bhavani, India's first and only fencer to compete in the Olympics, fangirl Prishaa too wields a sabre--one of three fencing weapons that resembles a blunted steel sword but watching her idol's sabre lose to a top-ranking French player in the next round didn't blunt the impact for the teen who encountered something unprecedented during online school that morning. Sporty classmates who get Olympics notifications on their phones, asked the athlete if she really played fencing--a sport that her friends and fellow Indians otherwise mistake for "something to do with gardening".  That's the effect of Bhavani Devi, say fencing coaches in the city who have been seeing a spike in the number of enquiries since the Chennai-born, Italy-trained athlete made it into the Olympic shortlist earlier this year. If Matunga-based techie-turned-passionate-fencing-coach Periyaswamy Sivan now has 40 admissions on the "waiting list", Kandivli's karate-black-belt-turned-Mumbai's-first-fencing-coach Kedar Dhawle, has been getting a week's worth of calls daily from as far as Delhi and Karnataka ever since Bhavani Devi became the face of a recent detergent ad. This new glamour dust spells hope for coaches who sound battle-weary from introducing fencing--one of the oldest fixtures in the Olympics since the Games began in 1896--to the average Mumbaikar as "talwar baazi" (swordfighting) since the early 2000s.  "We should probably start calling it 'talwar baazi' here," says an exasperated Periyaswamy citing that fencing assimilates more easily in Bhavani Devi's home state, TN, where it goes by 'vaal veechu', the name of a native martial art involving flexible blades. Back in 2008, when physical education teacher Periyaswamy's taekwondo coach introduced him to the European sport that has three categories--sabre, epee and foil--each with different rules, target areas and weapons, it took the Tamilian slum-dweller four years to understand the intricate game. Soon, armed with bamboo sticks instead of the Olympic standard of expensive electronic blades that were not locally available at the time, Periyaswamy would demonstrate the lunges, squats and jabs of the alien sport in colleges and housing societies for free for three years to enlist interest. "Is it a safe sport?" wary principals would ask but his assurances about the swords being blunted would not keep them from turning down his requests for a permanent space for the fencing arena known as 'piste'--a 14-metre-long, Rs 4-lakh-odd strip made up of aluminium plates weighing over 100 kgs. "Many of the athletes who fetch medals are girls," says coach Anand Waghmare whose dream of grooming his medal-gobbling Dharavi-based foil fencer Vaibhavi Ingale into "the next Bhavani Devi" was temporarily ruptured by the pandemic-induced shutdown.  "Tell me which sport has government support?" says a cynical Kedar Dhawle who would use thin iron rods as stand-ins for sabres when he imported fencing into the city in 2003 after stumbling upon it in Satara's Wai. "She used to be very shy. Now she's more open and focused," says Jaya about Prishaa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fencer-bhavani-devis-olympic-debut-rains-stardust-on-combat-sport/articleshow/84936175.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

The city's different vegetable markets revealed that the price of bottle gourd, bitter gourd, brinjal, lady’s finger, capsicum, tomato, drumstick and green leaves, including spinach and coriander, has almost doubled. Capsicum, lady’s finger, cauliflower, carrot and cucumber are being sold at Rs 80 per kg which was earlier available at Rs 60 per kg at the retail market. Garlic is also being sold at almost double the rate at Rs 120 per kg. Aman, a vendor at wholesale vegetable market in Niranjanpur Sabji Mandi, told TOI, "Due to incessant rainfall across the state causing landslides in the hills, several roads have been cut off. This has affected the transportation of vegetables." Vegetable sellers, Balakrishna and Sitaram, said that they are now transporting it from far-off places. “Most of the retailers are bringing the vegetable stock from neighbouring states. Hikes in fuel prices have also hit the transportation chain." Usha Rawat, a homemaker from Nehru Colony, said, "These vegetables are used daily for preparation of food items. We are facing a lot of difficulties at home due to the hike. Now, we are purchasing vegetables in small quantities." Similarly, fruits like pomegranate, blackberry, banana and coconut have also become expensive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/prices-of-vegetables-fruits-go-up-as-heavy-rain-cuts-off-supply-lines/articleshow/84926049.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee
---||Allahabad||Ganga-Yamuna swell in Prayagraj, cause flood-like situation||Prayagraj: With parts of Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan receiving heavy rainfall during the past ten days, river Ganga and Yamuna have started to swell at various locations in the Prayagraj district. With the rise in water level, those living beside the banks of these rivers have started shifting their belongings. As the floodwater has started inundating several of the low-lying areas of Phaphamau, Salori, Daraganj, Jhunsi etc., concerns among people living in these areas have increased as the water level of Ganga-Yamuna is rising steadily. Although the rivers are swelling rapidly, the water level is far below the danger level which stands at 84.71 meters. As per the data received from the flood control department, the water level of river Ganga at Phaphamau (as of July 29) was 78.47 mts, which increased by 26 cm in the next 24 hours and was recorded at 78.73 mts. The river kept on swelling and the water level at the same point was recorded as 78.85 on Saturday. Likewise, the river Yamuna is also on the rise, and the water level is increasing at a much faster rate as compared to Ganga. At Naini, the river has increased by 60 cms in the past 48 hours. The water level of Yamuna at Naini was 75.92 mts on July 29 which increased to 76.18 mts on July 30 and 76.78 mts on Saturday. Similarly, the level of water of river Ganga at Chatnaag (around Three kilometres downstream of Sangam, the confluence of Ganga-Yamuna and mythical Saraswati) too is increasing. The water level of Ganga at Chatnaag was 75.39mts on July 29 which increased to 75.70 on July 30 and increased by 72cm in the next 24 hours. On Saturday, the water level was 76.42mts. Because of the rise in water in both the rivers, a large area of the bank of the Sangam area has been submerged in floodwater. According to the information received from the irrigation department, 191697 cusecs of water was released from Kanpur on Friday. At the same time, 108506 cusecs of water have been released from Haridwar. Irrigation department officials said that Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh are receiving continuous rains, due to which the water level is increasing rapidly in Prayagraj. Due to the rapid rise in water level, floodwater and erosion of the banks have intensified in Phaphamau, Jhunsi, Chhatnag, Daraganj areas. “We are also keeping a close vigil on the amount of rainfall in Rajasthan, Uttrakhand and Madhya Pradesh which can also have an impact on the volume of water in Yamuna and Ganga”, said the executive engineer of the flood control department, Brijesh Kumar Verma. With the apprehension that the flood situation in the district including many of the localities of the urban limits could become grim in the coming days, the district administration and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have intensified their vigil on several of the localities of the city located near the banks of river Ganga and Yamuna. The areas included Daraganj, Nagwasuki, Baghada, Chhota Baghada, Salori, Rasulabad etc which has been largely affected by the floods in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ganga-yamuna-swell-in-prayagraj-cause-flood-like-situation/articleshow/84935293.cms||---

The couple did not take possession without completion of internal work and reimbursements. They moved Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in 2018. Ruling in their favour, the commission said, “Opponents are hereby directed that before handing over possession of the flat to complainants to complete entire internal work of the flat as per agreement and in respect of alternations made in the flat as agreed in between complainants and opponent and also complete work of all amenities to be given to society members as per agreement.” It also directed the developer to hand over occupation certificate in respect of flat to complainants and to give certificate from competent authority in respect of area of flat and alternations made. The break-up of compensation includes reimbursement towards interest the bank charged on housing loan, rent costs, compensation for delayed possession and for mental pain and agony.

The latest incident took place at Niloufer Hospital where final year student, Dr Vishnu Vardhan Reddy, was attacked by attendants of a patient allegedly for honking at them as they were blocking the exit of the ICU building. Niloufer superintendent Dr Murali Krishna lodged a compliant with the Nampally police. In his complaint, the superintendent stated: “Dr Vishnu Vardhan Reddy, final year post graduate of paediatric department, was assaulted by attendants of patient Md Shafuddin on the hospital premises in the intensive care building ground floor. Requesting for necessary action against the accused.” As per the complaint, the incident took place around 2 pm. The accused started abusing the doctor when he honked signalling at them to clear the way. The attendants opened the car door, hit the doctor in the face and tore his shirt. A female attendant also used abusive language against Reddy. TOI’s attempts to reach Dr Reddy or the family involved in the incident for their comments failed to yield any result. This comes close on the heels of the previous incident reported from the Government Chest Hospital where a junior doctor was assaulted, leading to unrest among the medical fraternity and boycott of duties. “We constantly work in fear of losing the confidence of the patient’s attendants and what consequences we will have to bear. If the public treats us this way, despite us working for 36 hours at a stretch and under stressful conditions, it’ll lead to trauma,” said a female junior doctor from the hospital. Meanwhile, members of the Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) said that these repeated incidents have led to many doctors slipping into depression. “Many doctors are now facing mental health issues due to the tremendous workload and shoddy treatment meted out to them by patients’ attendants,” said Dr Dharmula Sagar, president TJUDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/niloufer-jr-doc-assaulted-by-patients-kin/articleshow/84934365.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Telangana bars reg of farmland less than 20 guntas||HYDERABAD: The Telangana municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) department has told the registration and stamps department not to register farmland or plots below 20 guntas (2,000 square metres). The move comes after officials realised some property developers were registering open plots in illegal layouts in the name of ‘farm plots’. Unauthorised layout registration was banned by the state government in September 2020. Sources said developers hit upon this idea after making efforts to sell undivided share of land in unapproved layouts and unregistered venture projects with Telangana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) to gullible buyers. The developers were trying to take advantage of the fact that one does not need a layout copy to register agricultural land. “Besides stopping registration of farm plots below 20 guntas, we have also asked the registration department to insist on the layout copy if a farm plot abuts a new road,” MA&UD department principal secretary Arvind Kumar told STOI. He said the decision to stop registration of plots in unauthorised layouts had paid dividends and the government was able to control illegal ventures across the state. The government banned registration of non-agriculture properties not having either a layout copy in case of open plots or a sanctioned plan in case of buildings. Following this decision, thousands of layouts, which were developed without seeking approvals from the civic bodies, were stuck as layouts and plots could not be regularised under the layout regularisation scheme (LRS). Soon after banning illegal plots, 25 lakh applications were filed under the LRS, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-bars-reg-of-farmland-less-than-20-guntas/articleshow/84934421.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Music teacher Sandeep Ranade creates app to help the disabled hit the right notes||PUNE: As a music teacher and classical singer, notes are important for Sandeep Ranade. So, when one of his students repeatedly failed to get a couple of notes right, he anguished over it for months before realising it was a "representative of a much bigger problem". So, he thought of an app that could help one to hit the right notes. "I needed something that would tell my students, ‘You’re just a little bit flat here, a little sharp there.’ But I did not find any app anywhere close to what I wanted," said Ranade, a disciple of Pandit Jasraj. So, without any background in designing mobile apps, Ranade, a software engineer by training, set out to build one. To begin with, he built modules around human characteristics, which would enable the app to adjust to the mood of the singer. "First of all, I wanted to ensure that the sound was absolutely right. For this I had to sample instruments and synthesise some of the sound." Gradually, he went on to include ten instruments like the swarmandal, tanpura, surpeti, harmonium, piano, violin, ghungroo, tabla, shaker, manjira and others. "With all the ten instruments playing at once, there was a need for a conductor-level artificial intelligence (AI), which would ensure that all these instruments play in symphony. There are now 40 to 50 kinds of AI in the app. It took me three-and-a-half years to build it," said Ranade. "I gave my student a version of the app. She used it for two weeks and from a score of 5%, she went to a consistent 80%," he said. "Then I thought if this helps one person it might help others as well. So, I named the app NaadSadhana and published it on the App store," he said. To give the app a test run, he recorded a song "Na Corona Karo," which soon became a viral hit. "What was interesting was that most people thought that I was accompanied by musicians when it was just software," he said. In June this year, the app won the Apple Design Award for innovation in music, technology and design. But Ranade is not yet ready to rest on his laurels. "I want to include a few other instruments like pakhawaj, ghatam, guitar, congo, bongo, intelligent drums etc in the app. Currently, the app supports 150 ragas," he said. For him, one of the most satisfying aspects of developing the app was making it disabled-friendly. "One day, Amar Jain, a visually-challenged lawyer emailed me, saying he could not use the app because it was not fully accessible for people like him. So, I spent a month rethinking and doing a lot of testing blindfolded and introduced features like auditory and visual cues to guide those with disabilities. He was very happy with it and even recorded a song with the app," Ranade said. "I did what anybody should be doing because music should be available to all and having different abilities should not be a barrier to music," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/music-teacher-creates-app-to-help-the-disabled-hit-the-right-notes/articleshow/84934429.cms||Avijit Chatterjee
---||Mumbai||Man arrested for Virar bank robbery bid defrauded ex-employer of Rs 27 lakh||MUMBAI: Anil Dubey (35), who was nabbed after attempting to rob ICICI Bank Virar branch and ended up killing the deputy manager and injuring the cashier on Thursday, had defrauded his former employer, a private bank in Naigaon, where he was branch head. Valiv police in Vasai (E) on Friday filed a case under Indian Penal Code sections 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) for alleged misappropriation of bank funds to the tune of around Rs 27 lakh. Dubey is in Virar police custody till August 6. He had attempted to loot cash and valuables worth over Rs 3 cror from ICICI Bank, where he was earlier employed, on Thursday. The bank is in Manvelpada, outside Virar railway station. He killed deputy manager Yogita Vartak (34) and injured the cashier, Shraddha Devrukhkar (32), when they tried to foil the robbery. He got caught by passers-by while trying to flee after Devrukhkar activated the security alarm and called for help. Police said Dubey had failed to report to work around a week before the attempted heist on Thursday, after misappropriation of funds came to light during an audit. An explanation on missing funds was sought from Dubey by the bank. After Thursday’s incident, the bank sacked him and filed a case with Valiv police. Dubey had joined the Naigaon bank in August last year. Before that he worked with ICICI Virar branch for around 18 months. Police said they will seek his custody for interrogation on misappropriated funds. Dubey told Virar police he was in a major financial crunch after taking loans of over Rs 1 crore. A Nalasopara resident, who lives with wife and son, Dubey had a lavish lifestyle. Police said he does not have a past criminal record. On Thursday, he had hoped to threaten the two women and flee with the loot. Dubey had spoken to Vartak hours before the crime. He entered the bank around 8pm, threatened the women and took away the cash and valuables. He assaulted Vartak with a razor and killed her. He injured Devrukhkar with the razor and fled. Devrukhkar raised an alarm and alerted passers-by, who helped nab Dubey. Devrukhkar, who was operated early on Friday for neck injuries, has been moved to Lilavati hospital by her bank.

Officials said the victim received a phone call from a fake insurance executive informing that if he takes insurance policies, he would get Rs 80 lakh bonus. The victim, after paying the premium, received insurance policies. After several months, the victim found that the phone of the person who sold him the policies was switched off. Later, a few persons called him at different occasion and said that he would be paid a bonus on his insurance policies. The accused made him pay money to earn the bonus money. Based on the complaint given by victim, the accused was arrested. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/insurance-conman-held-in-ghaziabad/articleshow/84934438.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Local data crucial if third Covid-19 wave hits, says ICMR||PUNE: Districts those were severely impacted by the second Covid-19 wave may not see an equally intense third wave, an analysis by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said. Experts from the top science body said states should now use district-level heterogeneity assessments — that include variations in spread and populations — to plan tailored public health measures for different regions. “All districts in Maharashtra did not experience the second wave uniformly,” said Samiran Panda, head of the ICMR’s Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division. “It is the need of the hour to examine the possibility of a third wave by considering key biological and behavioural parameters.” Panda said states like Maharashtra should look into district-level heterogeneity to formulate region and population-appropriate measures. “Talking about a ‘third wave’ across the entire state may not be helpful as all districts did not experience the second wave uniformly. So, we need district-level infection control and management programmes,” he said. He said this also means that districts that didn’t experience an intense second wave may now have a significant number of people who are vulnerable. It’s then crucial to ramp up measures like vaccine coverage in these at-risk regions, he added. “It is essential to have vaccine saturation among priority groups in these districts. It’s also important to create an environment that’s not conducive for viral spread as such regions may see a third wave that seamlessly takes off from the descending arm of the second,” he said. Maharashtra state task force member Shashank Joshi called for district-wise serosurveys, with particular focus on regions that were less affected during the second wave. “We should have this data. The public health department is already working on collecting the information,” Joshi said. He, however, said it’s impossible to say when a third wave will come as surge depends on behaviour, vaccination coverage in densely populated regions and level of restrictions. “Dynamics of the wave for local geographies are different and fundamentally, the virus does not follow simple mathematics, which is why there is a degree of unpredictability,” Joshi said. He added that while ICMR’s analysis appears plausible and logical, an outlier is the Variant of Concern. “We cannot under-estimate Delta at all,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/local-data-crucial-if-third-wave-hits-icmr/articleshow/84934405.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Of the 1,200-odd active cases in these villages, however, only 100 patients needed to be admitted to Covid care centres while a majority of them are asymptomatic and in home isolation. Besides, most villagers have received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine and the ZP is pushing vaccination further. A village that has 10 or more active Covid cases is categorized as a hotspot village in the district. Each village has 10-15 active cases, mostly asymptomatic, hence the situation is under control, said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the ZP. The number of hotspot villages had come down to 88 in the second week of June. Currently, there are 109 hotspot villages across 13 tehsils of the district. ZP officials said violation of social distancing norms could be a major contributory factor. Rural Pune is still under level 4 restrictions, with hotels, restaurants and eateries not permitted to have dine-in yet. All tourist spots are closed since the last two weeks to contain the spread of the virus. “We are conducting around 70,000 tests in a week — the highest in any district in the state. The aim is to identify Covid patients early, provide treatment and contain the spread,” Prasad said. Health officials pointed to violation of Covid regulations. “At many bazaar towns, non-essential shops are functioning. There is no control on crowd and no social distancing,” said a senior health official. Another official said people were still gathering in large number at tourists spots in the district. “Many shopkeepers in big villages are not adhering to social distancing norms. This has resulted in increase in Covid cases. We will conduct meetings with them to appraise them about social distancing norms,” Shradchandra Mali, block development officer of the Junnar, said. The number of Covid-19 hotspot villages in rural Pune stood at 186 in the first week of June. The tally had reached 397 on May 19. The rural area comprises 13 tehsils and 14 municipal councils. On April 28, the number of hotspot villages had increased to 465, which was the highest since the outbreak of the contagion last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-than-100-hotspot-villages-in-dist-most-detections-asymptomatic/articleshow/84934436.cms||Sandip Dighe

The child left behind a suicide note, written on a page from his school copy, seeking forgiveness from his parents for spending the money.“Sorry Ma, please don’t cry,” the Class 6 boy wrote. Chhatarpur SP Sachin Sharma said they are yet to take the parents’ statements. Authorisation of parents is mandatory for purchases done by anyone below 18 years of age, the SP said, adding: “The role of the gaming app is also a part of our investigations.” The cyber cell is examining the phone, and experts in Bhopal will also inspect it. The child’s mother works in the pathology department of Chhatarpur government hospital, and his father is also a pathologist. On Friday, the mother received a message regarding a transaction of Rs 1,500 on her phone, and spoke to the child about it. A little later, the boy’s elder sister found him hanging in a room. The suicide note went viral, triggering a wave of emotion in the state. MP Parents’ Association president Kamal Vishwakarma demanded a ban on such games.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sorry-ma-boy-spends-rs-40000-on-online-game-kills-self/articleshow/84936864.cms||---

The Noida Authority has decided to develop a park for children in every residential sector to encourage them to play outside. For this, a meeting with the sector RWAs will be held next week and suggestions will be invited, officials said. The horticulture department will develop these parks, which will have a cricket pitch, a basketball court and cycling and walking tracks. In the absence of play areas for children, residents have long been demanding dedicated outdoor play spaces for children, particularly those who are older. “Given the requirement, CEO Ritu Maheshwari has approved the development of one park for each residential sector of the city,” said Indu Prakash, OSD to the Noida Authority. The parks will be developed in coordination with the sector RWAs as they know best the requirements of their sectors. “We will send a letter to all RWAs next week inviting suggestions, including identifying the land or area in their sector, which can be developed into a park for older children. After their response, we will submit the details to the CEO for an approval,” said Prakash. According to officials, the parks will have a central area of grass with plants on the edges, cricket pitch or ground for football, along with walkways and cycle tracks where required. “Even basketball, volleyball or badminton courts can be developed depending on the available space. All such details will be finalised once we collate the list of parks for older children,” the OSD added. While big parks may have more facilities, the aim is to provide a space for older children for their physical growth and activity. And children have lauded the Authority’s initiative. “I welcome this move as soon we are going to get a place of our own in the neighbourhood,” said Mohit Kumar, a resident of Sector 62.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/all-residential-sectors-in-noida-to-soon-have-parks-for-children/articleshow/84921350.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

On Saturday, the region recorded 1,022 new cases of Covid-19 as against 976 recoveries. A report released by district health office said 587 cases were recorded in the rural and cantonment areas on Saturday, while the PCMC and PMC limits added 175 and 260 new patients, respectively. Among the discharges, 335 patients were declared cured in the PMC limits, 129 in the PCMC areas and 512 in the rural parts in the last 24 hours. With this, the tally of positive cases has increased above 10.85 lakh in PMR, while its total discharges reached 10.57 lakh. The region tested 22,321 samples for the infection on Saturday. This pushed the tally of sample testing over 62 lakh. The PMC and rural areas tested over 8,400 samples each, while over 5,400 tests were conducted in the PCMC limits in the last 24 hours. PMR recorded 14 more deaths due to Covid-19 on Saturday. While six patients died in the PMC limits, seven deaths were reported in the rural areas and one patient died in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas. Prevailing curbs to stay for now The Pune Municipal Corporation on Saturday said the prevailing restrictions will continue in its limits for now, pouring cold water on traders’ hope of some relaxations from this week.

---||Pune||Encroachment on slopes, deforestation to blame for landslides in Maharashtra: Experts||Pune: Excessive deforestation, cutting of hill slopes for agriculture and developmental projects combined with heavy rainfall have increased the fragility of the Western Ghats, leading to an increase in landslides in Western Maharashtra and Konkan regions, said senior geologists of the Geological Survey of India (GSI). The recent landslides, in Taliye village in Raigad and Satara districts, which claimed over 130 lives, have once again compelled the authorities to study the geological factors to find the reason behind the landslides. The experts have suggested a comprehensive investigation of these regions to identify ways to prevent landslides in the future. Arvind Kumar Singh, deputy director general, GSI, Maharashtra unit in Pune, told TOI, “The increase in encroachments on natural hill slopes for farming or expansion of habitation, deforestation and other anthropogenic reasons have added to the increased frequency of landslide occurrences in the past few decades, particularly in Western Maharashtra and Konkan regions.” “If we study the history of Pune, Satara, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, which are home to many forts of the Maratha Empire, we will not find reference to massive landslides because the human habitat was at that time only limited to designated places/ locations. Forests were maintained like a ‘sanctum sanctorum’. There was no disturbance to the natural slope of the hill and flow of water. However, this changed over the decades. Human habitat has increased tremendously at such places. That is why we are now facing the issue of landslides in the region,” said Sekhar Sarkar, former deputy director general (central region), GSI, who has visited the region several times in the past. Sarkar, who carried out a detailed investigation of the Malin landslide in 2014 in Pune, said, “In northeast, people have been staying on hills for generations together. Their understanding of the geographical aspects is much deeper. But, in Maharashtra, we came across a lack of knowledge among villagers living in hilly regions. To overcome this issue, we need to create basic awareness about geological and geographical changes that develop / take place on hills due to various reasons. Only then they would make conscious effort to move or shift to safer locations in future.” “Over 28,000sqkm area in landslide-prone western Maharashtra has been covered by the GSI under the National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Programme (NLSM) to classify susceptible areas in accordance with their potential to generate landslides. In addition, a comprehensive landslide inventory covering more than 1,000 incidences has also been prepared. Out of the total aerial coverage, nearly 5% area shows high potential to generate landslide, and over 30% additional area shows moderate possibility of creation of landslide,” said three geologists from the GSI. According to Singh, one needs to understand that the area that gets affected need not necessarily be categorised into high or moderate landslide susceptibility zones. “This is because the effect of landslide activity can be felt in areas that are outside of such zones but are in the path of the runout of the landslide incidences. Incidents at Jui (2005) village in Raigad district, Malin (2014) in Pune district and recent incident at Taliye in Raigad district are prominent examples of such cases,” he added. About recent increase in landslide activity, Singh said that the old and historic record of the landslide is far from being complete and usually only those incidents causing harm to human population are recorded. “As a result, it is difficult to establish the quantified relationship between incidences and the triggering factor, especially rainfall,” he added Following the recent landslide incidents, the GSI has sent two teams of geologists for rapid geological assessment of the affected areas. “The teams are currently in the field and are collecting field data necessary to assess the cause of incidences and to identify immediate short-term measures to reduce further risk. There are plans to cover 15 villages in the first phase of the work. The inferences of these studies will be shared with the district authorities concerned,” added Singh. Retired GSI geologist Sudha Vaddadi, said, “The state government should form a dedicated committee of geologists to review landslide-prone villages at least twice a year. This exercise will certainly help respective district administration to take measures in advance. Currently, we are acting only after the incident. Also, permission of geologists should be made mandatory before launching any developmental projects in hilly regions or districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/encroachment-on-slopes-deforestation-to-blame-for-landslides-in-maharashtra-experts/articleshow/84936211.cms||Sandip Dighe

The July caseload in the state — despite talk of the “thick tail” of the second Covid wave — is almost a third of the 6.57 lakh cases registered in March. But it is Mumbai, a hot spot during both the Covid-19 waves, that had a low Covid scoreboard in July. The July tally (12,557) is lower than the January tally (16,310), which is now accepted as the period between the two Covid waves. At present, Mumbai’s daily tally and death count make up for about 5% of the state’s daily caseload and fatalities. On Saturday, the city tally of 345 accounted for 4.9% of Maharashtra’s tally of 6,959. Mumbai registered nine deaths, or 4% of the state’s Saturday toll of 225. In July, there was a significant drop in the number of deaths. In the state, 10,846 deaths were registered as against 26,601 in June. In Mumbai, 438 deaths were counted in July, way higher than the pre-second wave figure of 123 deaths in February. Officials said May and June reported higher number of deaths compared to July due to the data reconciliation exercise that started in mid-May and ended in July. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) for this month is nearly 4%. The total caseload of the state rose to 63 lakh on Saturday, of which 7.34 lakh cases were in Mumbai. The Covid-19 fatalities also climbed to 1,32,791 of which 15,889 were in Mumbai. The continuous decline in the daily detections in Mumbai has pushed it down to the seventh spot in terms of the active cases in the state. Smaller districts like Satara, Sangli and Ahmednagar have more active cases than Mumbai. BMC officials remain wary of saying that the second wave is over. “The predicted third wave is less than a month away. How can we relax enough to say that the second wave is over?” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “Our vigil continues like before,” he added. Every day, close to 35,000 tests are conducted and wards with the highest cases are closely monitored. “We know that parts of the D ward (Malabar Hill), K West, K East, R South and R Central are still witnessing cases,” said Kakani. The BMC analysis showed 91% of the positive cases live in buildings and steps are being taken accordingly. A BMC doctor said Covid-appropriate behaviour, especially use of masks, is fast dropping in the city. “At this rate, the festive season later this month could be accompanied by a rise in cases,” he added. State officials said that while metro cities like Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune, which were driving the Covid graph during the peak, have reported a decline in cases, smaller districts like Satara, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar and Sangli continue to add cases. With the cases plateauing, there has been a demand for opening up more sectors in the state just like Delhi, which was one of the worst-affected during the second wave. Minister Aaditya Thackeray said that as per doctors there was another variant at play in Delhi where the cases shot up quickly and came down with the same speed. “For Maharashtra the thick tail has remained for over three months now. We are being painfully slow and cautious in opening up,” said Thackeray while speaking at an online event on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/tale-of-two-tails-in-mumbai-city-12557-cases-in-july-against-the-16310-in-january/articleshow/84940827.cms||Malathy Iyer

Neri said that the state government will protect the interest of the Mhadei, but added that an united fight has to be put up. Replying to the demands, Neri said that the state government will constitute a technical advisory committee under the WRD chief engineer, which will function with the help of the central water commission and will consist of experts. The study will be conducted on the Bicholim, Chapora, Valvanti, Mhadei and Khandepar rivers, among others. The state will install an automatic early warning system in rural areas as the authorities are not able to reach out to these areas in the eventuality of a flood hitting at night. There is a disaster management authority in place, but it is still difficult to reach out to rural areas at night, he said. Neri said that the state has funds to put things in place, but the state still has to approach the Centre to mitigate the flooding issue in these rivers. He also said that wherever required desilting of dams can be taken up. The WRD minister said that the rivers have changed their behaviour. He also said that this year the state received 15 days’ rain in two days, which was indicative of global climate change. Speaking on the Mhadei issue, Neri said that every government is facing challenges and that every government has protected the river’s interest, despite which the public is apprehensive. “They have put a lot of effort to divert the Mhadei, but failed as the state government is alert,” he said. “We cannot sell rivers, tradition or culture. The Mhadei will be protected with the grace of god and the Mhadei will not be lost. We will fight and the people of Goa will fight. We have conviction to fight till our interest is protected,” Neri said. Neri said that the cabinet approved the Goa State Water Policy, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-study-catchment-areas-to-address-flooding-issue/articleshow/84934620.cms||---

But now, the presence of mostly elderly people, lack of electricity and water supply were more evident. Entry of tourists was banned at the hamlet from June because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This affected the income of families, who would offer lodging and food facilities to tourists. The elderly persons of the hamlet said that most of the youths had migrated to the urban areas in search of employment, leaving not more than 50-60 people, most of them senior citizens, to look after the homes. “We are totally dependent on whatever amount our children send us. At least we could earn something when tourists would visit,” said Baban Sawant (57), a resident, whose family is living at Udhewadi for the past five generations. He added that they would themselves drink water from the fort reservoirs, but would bring the tourists bottled water, which was now lying unused. He added that the village houses had solar panels because of which they had working light and could recharge their cellphones. Another resident Nakabai Umbre (60) said that she had never used LPG for cooking, nor had she watched TV programmes. The lack of medical facilities is another disadvantage for them, she said. “When my pregnant daughter needed urgent medical attention four years ago, we had no choice but to transport her to the nearest hospital in Lonavla. She delivered her baby midway, before reaching the hospital,” she said. Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Pune zilla parishad, said there were at least seven such hamlets in the district, which were quite remote and had difficult terrain to provide basic facilities to. “We are trying to work things out with the forest department for the roads, electricity and the water supply,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-power-water-supply-and-health-centre-accessibility-at-remote-hamlet/articleshow/84934521.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Talking to media persons after addressing the party’s ‘Brahmin Sammelan’ in Mathura’s Govardhan, Misra said that no one can “forget what happened with Brahmins during the Samajwadi Party regime”. He said their situation under the SP regime was “very similar to now, as they were being harassed, insulted and killed for raising their voices against the BJP”. “Not only Brahmins, Dalits, too, are being threatened and harassed by the present BJP reign,” Misra said. Referring to the Hathras girl’s rape case, Misra said it was just one example of “how the government did not allow the family to cremate the body of their daughter”. The BSP general secretary said they (the Yogi government) even gave “a caste-ist twist to the encounter killing of gangster Vikas Dubey”. “Several Brahmins were targeted by the ruling party in Kanpur and nearby areas in connection with this incident,” he said, adding that their aim is to create fear among the community with an intent to force them to leave the state. Maintaining that Brahmins should unite and not let their votes get divided on the basis of their gotras, Misra said a united “Brahmin force” can dictate terms as one gets their due on the basis of their strength – “Jiski jitni taiyyari… utni uski hissedari (one’s preparation determines one’s participation)”. In the 2007 assembly elections, the BSP had given tickets to 80 Brahmins, of which 45 won the polls. A number of Brahmins were also made cabinet ministers. “We constitute 13% of the population in the state,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/brahmins-faced-as-much-torture-during-sp-regime-as-they-face-under-yogi-rule-bsp/articleshow/84930675.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The health department in Kasganj district has in a major crackdown terminated the services of at least 85 ambulance drivers and 80 EMTs for refusing to end their strike. It has also started appointing private drivers and tasking drivers of other departments to take charge of the government-run ambulance service. Dr Anil Kumar, chief medical officer of Kasganj district, said, “The ambulance drivers and EMTs didn’t resume their duties despite repeated requests. The services of the protestors who intend to remain off duty have been terminated. They were putting the lives of patients needing emergency healthcare at risk.” According to the health department officials, the private company tasked by the state government for the operation of the primary ambulance service has also started hiring new ambulance drivers and EMTs across the state. The recruitment process will be completed in the next two days. Meanwhile, Kasganj district president of the Ambulance Drivers' Association, Akhilesh Kumar said, “Ambulance staffers worked under life-threatening conditions during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. In return, we are being slapped with FIRs and sacked. We are determined to protest until our demands are met. State leadership has given a call to gather for a larger protest in Lucknow. I have reached Lucknow with more than 200 ambulance drivers and EMTs from Kasganj. Our colleagues from other districts are on their way.” District president of the Firozabad Ambulance Drivers' Association Sanjeev Kumar said, “Under pressure of the district authorities, we had ended our strike on Friday. Some of the drivers and EMTs have joined duty. We are not forcing anyone to join the protest.” He has reached Lucknow with 20 colleagues. So far, 12,000 ambulance drivers and EMTs from different districts have reached the state capital. The number is likely to increase to 22,000 by Sunday afternoon, he added. Two primary ambulance services of the Uttar Pradesh government — 102 (delivery of pregnant women) and 108 (emergency service) — came to a grinding halt on July 25-26 midnight as the ambulance drivers across the state went on an indefinite strike. Till now, GVK EMRI (Emergency Management and Research Institute) was operating the advanced life support system (ALS), 108, and 102 ambulance services in the state. Now, the responsibility of the ALS ambulance service has been given to Ziqitza Health Care. The ALS ambulance drivers launched a protest against the changes in their employment conditions and payment following the handover of the ambulance service tender to a different company. The general ambulance drivers (102 and 108 emergency service) have also joined them in a show of solidarity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ambulance-strike-drivers-med-technicians-begin-to-assemble-in-lucknow-for-massive-protest/articleshow/84930737.cms||Deepak Lavania

He allegedly misbehaved and hurled abuses on being stopped by the temple authorities. Later, the lawmaker apologised to the authorities for his "bad behaviour". The incident occurred in full public view with many now sharing its video online. In one such purported clip, the MP, Dharmendra Kashyap, can be seen trying to throw his weight around and then creating a ruckus with locals taking strong offence. The temple authorities have informed the matter to the Almora district magistrate. A written complaint will be sent on Sunday. Bhagwan Bhatt, the manager of the temple management committee, said, "The MP entered the temple to offer prayers. It was 6pm and the temple was about to close for 'darshan' for the day. When we made him aware of the temple rules, he started misbehaving." Govind Gopal, the committee's vice-president, said, "Today's incident inside the temple premises is highly condemnable. A person claiming to be an MP cannot behave like this." The MP was unavailable for any comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bjp-mp-creates-ruckus-inside-almora-temple-apologises-later/articleshow/84930721.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Good supply, second-dosers sent July jab count soaring||PUNE: The month of July saw the highest number of Covid vaccinations in Pune district, with over 17.83 lakh shots recorded, health department data has shown. A large number of second-dose beneficiaries — within the massive 18-44 group — certainly helped boost count but they had become eligible for the next shot only by the last week of July. Officials said vaccine availability was also a key factor. From 5.43 lakh doses administered in May in the district, the count more than tripled in July. In June, the district had administered nearly 15.29 lakh shots. The Covid vaccine drive for those over 60 and 45 (with underlying conditions) began on March 1. The drive to cover everyone over 45 began on April 1. All above 18 became eligible from May 1, but severe supply shortages had impacted coverage at the time, despite a major chunk of the population opening up for vaccination. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle said, “Compared to May, civic sites got double the number of Covishield doses in July and over three lakh more doses compared to June. Apart from availability at civic sites, doses bought directly by private hospitals pushed up vaccinations in July.” Deshmukh said nearly 700 civic sites in the district were operational in July, compared to the nearly 400 in June. “On almost all days of July, the district had more than 600 vaccination sites. Contribution from private hospitals to the drive in July was around 25%, which was much less in June because there were fewer private sites at the time,” he said. Another district official said, “Daily jab count crossed one lakh at least twice in July and went past 90,000 on a couple of days. We also received some big vaccine batches in July. The most recent, 2.12 lakh doses, was the highest ever received on a single day. So on good days, average daily vaccination in July was 80,000, compared to 50,000 per day in June.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/good-supply-second-dosers-sent-july-jab-count-soaring/articleshow/84934599.cms||Neha Madaan

Basic education department officials have blamed the Covid-19 pandemic for the delay in supply of books to the students. According to basic education department records, 2.48 lakh students are enrolled in primary (Class I-V) and upper primary (Class VI-VIII) schools in Agra district. On the basis of this, around 15 lakh books of different subjects were ordered. Earlier, the state government had set a target for the basic education department and publishers to ensure that all the books were distributed among students by April 30. District president of the primary school teacher's association Brajesh Dixit said, “Books for the current session have not been delivered in the schools so far. Following the Covid-19 situation, schools are not holding classes in the premises. Classes are held online but few students are attending them. Without books, students are not taking any interest in their studies. Basic education department officials have been informed about this.” Additional director (basic education) Mahesh Chand said, “Covid-19 situation has caused a delay in distribution of books to the students. We have sent notices to the publishers for delay in supply of course books.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/4-months-into-new-session-agra-primary-school-kids-await-textbooks/articleshow/84930775.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Pune||Pune: Hospitals seeing very few new Covid admissions||PUNE: Several private hospitals in Pune are now reporting single-digit daily Covid-19 admissions. Hospital administrators TOI spoke to said the low number of admissions — one unit reported as low as three Covid patients a day — has been the trend for the past couple of weeks. According to health department data, Covid bed occupancy in Pune (non-oxygen beds) dropped this week to 25%, from 34% last week. "There are hardly any Covid patients at our hospital," said HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital. "There are around eight patients in the ICU ward and 10-12 in the general ward. Most ICU patients have been discharged. We have seen a 95% drop in daily admissions, with hardly a few daily patients," he said. Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of the Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical Hospital and Research Center, said, "We have just about 18 Covid patients undergoing treatment, with barely two to three admissions a day. A fortnight ago, the number of daily admissions was more than 30. Daily Covid admissions have indeed dropped over the last few days." Lalwani said vaccine coverage in Pune may be reducing the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations. "Vaccination is showing its benefits now. Mortality too in fully vaccinated people is very low, and may be seen only in those who have severe comorbidities. Also, most who get Covid after full vaccination (14 days after both doses) are reporting only mucosal disease, such as rhinitis or slight fever, and nothing as severe as lung infection," he said. Dr Kapil Zirpe, a member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “Overall, SARS-CoV-2 cases have been dropping in Pune, which has translated into a significant drop in Covid admissions at hospitals. Daily admissions in our hospital are now down to two or four. The second wave's graph is dipping, with the number of deaths also reducing. We have hardly had any deaths in the hospital over the last few weeks."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-seeing-very-few-new-covid-admissions/articleshow/84934637.cms||Neha Madaan

Sanjay Tayde-Patil, founder-president of MESTA said such a unilateral decision will create further fissures between all stakeholders. Tayde-Patil, who was in city on Saturday, said MESTA will meet education department officials and vehemently oppose any move to implement the fee cut decision. “The question really is that how will the state government implement the fee cut decision? As per law, the state does not have power to determine our fee structure,” said Tayde-Patil. “They are well aware of this fact but have still decided to push for it purely as part of vote bank politics,” said Tayde-Patil. When asked what about those parents who are facing financial difficulties due to Covid-19, Tayde-Patil said there was a need to understand the school’s side too. “Many of our members voluntarily slashed 25% fee and even offered full scholarship to those who lost a parent. But the government has chosen to overlook all these things,” said Tayde-Patil. He added that the state’s decision, regardless of how it is to be implemented, it won’t stand in the court of law. Tayde-Patil said, “There is a dearth of people who seem to understand the law. Before making such announcements, should they not announce which legal route they will take to achieve it?” Also on MESTA’s radar is Nagpur deputy director of education Vaishali Jamdar who had recently issued a letter asking schools to cut fee by 25%. “In what capacity did Jamdar issue such a letter, considering the fact that the state education minister minister herself is asking for 15% cut. Is the DDE bigger than the minister? MESTA will demand that Jamdar issue a clarification by Tuesday evening over the issue, failing which we will aggressively campaign for her suspension,” said Tayde-Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/15-fee-cut-decision-unacceptable-schools-association/articleshow/84934638.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

T Nandhakumar, an M.Phil student at Salem Periyar University, who is studying about villages, said “A stone slab that the people worship in Kothaimangalam near Palani is proof that trade had taken place through this area,” he said. The stone slab of traders’ guild is embossed with things that were traded such as pepper, cinnamon, sandalwood - mostly fragrant items found in the forest. It is well known and established through archaeological findings that Thandikudi in Palani hills was once part of the grand trade route known as Peruvazhi, which extended though the western ghats connecting present day Kochi, Palakkad, Udulumalai, Palani and the coastal town of Poompuhar from where traders exported their produce.“It is also known that there were many merchants guilds or associations that operated on this route. There were those that traded pearls, salt, grains, millets and agricultural produce. The guilds had different names,” he added. “This particular stone slab may belong to one such traders’ guild which dealt with agricultural produce. These trade guilds are said to have operated between the 9th and 12th century AD,” he said. He said the guild inscription contains a sickle, trident, a sword, horse and plough along with the produce. This stone slab is worshipped as a deity by the people in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ancient-traders-guild-stone-being-worshipped-as-deity/articleshow/84934635.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad byelection: It’s BJP’s Ram mandir versus TRS’ sop opera||HYDERABAD: BJP is playing the emotive Ram Mandir card to counter TRS’ sops and schemes to woo voters ahead of the crucial bypoll to the Huzurabad assembly constituency. The 5,000-disciplined army of BJP and its frontal organisations are raising the Ram Mandir issue. Panna Pramukhs, each of whom has the target of connecting with 60 voters, are silently taking the slogan to the electorate that “a vote for the lotus symbol is equivalent to contributing a brick in the construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.” BJP claims the response has been good from the people as a majority of them have been raising hands when asked by Panna Pramukhs how many of them had contributed money during the public donation collection done by Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for construction of Ram Mandir and offering them another opportunity to add to their good deeds. “TRS is depending on money to win the election. BJP’s slogan is to meet every voter at least once. It is up to the voters to decide whether they want to do ‘punyam’ (good deeds, good karma) by voting for BJP which is constructing the Ram Mandir or account for ‘paapam’ (sin) by voting against lotus,” BJP’s Huzurabad in-charge and former MP AP Jithender Reddy told TOI. Backward classes welfare minister Gangula Kamalakar, who is leading TRS charge in Huzurabad, said BJP has always tried to polarise voters on religious lines. “The issue of Ram Mandir is not new as BJP tried to use it in earlier elections too. But people of Telangana have been voting for development and welfare schemes of TRS government and K Chandrasekhar Rao’s promise of transforming the state into Bangaru Telangana,” he said. However, the minister hastened to add that they would soon come out with a counter strategy against the saffron party’s Hindutva card. Another senior TRS leader said people know that the KCR government has been spending on temples, including Yadagirigutta, enhanced the honorarium of archakas, muessins and imams. It has given land for cemeteries to the Christian community in and around Greater Hyderabad, in tune with its secular ideology, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/its-bjps-ram-mandir-versus-trs-sop-opera-in-huzurabad/articleshow/84932572.cms||Roushan Ali

However, smaller temples and village temples which also see large crowds during this period have been exempted from this rule.S Ganeshan of Anna Nagar says that monitoring of crowds should also be done strictly in Madurai’s commercial hub, the major streets around the temple. The festival season could cause a surge in Covid cases again, he warned. Roads around Sree Meenakshi temple such as East Masi Street, Navabath Kana street, Mahal Vadampokki Street, South Masi Street and South Avani Moola streets comprise a commercial hub. Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association secretary Ashraf Tayub said there were about 3,000 textile shops in the streets and they had vaccinated up to 80% staff. “People come with their masks drawn down, but we politely tell them to wear it properly,’’ said Sundaram, a salesperson. Large crowds are also seen in South Aavani Moola Street which has jewellery shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-entry-to-major-temples-but-shops-see-big-crowds/articleshow/84934661.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Three held in Noida for job racket, ‘duping’ Mumbai youth of Rs 1.4 lakh||MUMBAI: Pydhonie police arrested two men and a woman in Noida and brought them to Mumbai on Saturday in connection with an alleged job racket. The accused had allegedly contacted the complainant, a graduate, over the phone, pretending to be employees of a job portal, collected his details, promised an online training session for the “job with a leading private bank” and cheated him of Rs 1.4 lakh. Those arrested include Kailashchand Ramchand (29), Satish Singh (27) and Gita Singh (27), all graduates. The trio was produced before Sewree court which sent them in police custody till August 9. While investigating the cheating case which allegedly took place in April, police teams were sent to New Delhi and Noida. With the arrest of the three, police seized 14 mobile phones, eight SIM cards, three laptops, 25 debit and ATM cards, two PAN cards, six Aadhaar cards, 14 bank letters, three identity cards, four bank passbooks, nine cheque books and Rs 8,600 from them. Following the complaint, zonal DCP Rajiv Jain formed a team led by senior inspector Subhash Dudhgaokar to nab the perpetrators. “The complainant was looking for a job. He received a call from a person who claimed to be an executive of a job-providing portal. When the complainant showed an interest in getting a job, the caller sent an email to him. During investigation, we found that it was a fake website that looked like a genuine one with a few words changed,” said an officer. Some days after he submitted his details to the portal, the victim received an email from the fictitious bank offering him a job. He was told to pay Rs 1.4 lakh for training and verification of documents to the company. Later, on realising he had been duped,he lodged a police complaint. Investigators began a probe with the mobile numbers of the callers, collected call detail records and location. They also collected information about the bank account where the money was transferred. Investigators have found the accused had bought a domain name for a website that appeared like the job portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-held-in-noida-for-job-racket-duping-mumbai-youth-of-rs-1-4l/articleshow/84936282.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Nagpur||Testing further drops, docs not asking all for Covid tests||Nagpur: Even as state health minister Rajesh Tope had appealed to increase RT-PCR test in certain districts earlier this month, the district’s testing has further plummeted to just over 21% to 30% from what it was at the peak of second wave. The daily testing touched a low of 3,117 RT-PCR and RAT tests on July 26, though the figures were close to or over 10,000 till the start of this month. Though a few number of people are testing positive due to which the number of high-risk close contact too is down, doctors said they are not straight away prescribing Covid tests to symptomatic people suffering from seasonal flu or viral fever. Instead, they said patients are showing symptoms akin to dengue, dengue-like illness, typhoid and even acute gastroenteritis. Respiratory complaints are not seen much in patients and most asked to take a Covid test are generally testing negative. In the last seven days, over 42,000 tests were done. Of these, only 72 tested positive for a positivity rate of 0.01%. Dr Rajkumar Rathi, a pathologist, said if people having fever or viral symptoms get cured in a couple of days, they don’t prefer Covid tests. “Even those who take a test are not found positive. Some even check for H1N1 which too is negative,” he said, adding that this has been seen for the last two weeks. Medical microbiologist Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed said healthy individuals won’t get themselves tested unless they have any symptoms. “When district’s cases were higher, around 40 to 50 persons per positive case used to easily get tested. With single digit positive cases, contact tracing figures are low,” he said. Both Dr Rathi and Dr Ahmed said patients under pre-operative care and travellers are the ones taking tests. Paediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charade said respiratory complaints are less. “Symptoms of high grade fever, bodyache, headache, vomiting look more of dengue or dengue-like illness. Only one or two members in a family are falling sick which is unlike Covid-19. If weakness, SPO2 drops, and fever is seen, we do prescribe Covid test for kids which turns out negative. Fever, cough cold with loss of smell and taste are generally taken strong evidence for Covid testing,” he said. Dr Charade said the rainy season, increased functions and street food are behind typhoid and acute gastroenteritis cases. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said there was no slowdown from the civic body’s side. “We did same number of testing last weekend and this. Many of those tested are among high-risk close contacts, some found loitering on streets during restrictions and some are suspected. But their numbers are too low as compared to earlier weeks. We can’t make it compulsory for all,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/testing-further-drops-docs-not-asking-all-for-covid-tests/articleshow/84932600.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Be it Dalitha Bandhu, distribution of sheep, fishing nets and mopeds, new ration cards, Aasara pensions to new beneficiaries among others, Eatala during his ‘praja deevena’ padayatra has been telling the voters that all these benefits were coming to them because of him. “My resignation has resulted in more benefits coming your way. Take whatever is being offered to you by the ruling TRS but vote for me,” Rajender said during his padayatra in Jammikunta mandal a few days ago. However, TRS leader P Kaushik Reddy condemned Eatala’s claims and said that Dalit Empowerment Scheme was announced in the state budget in March itself, much before Eatala’s ouster from the cabinet. Reddy said the welfare schemes are being implemented since the last few years. “Eatala is trying to take credit for the schemes as he knows he cannot retain Huzurabad seat,” he said. Meanwhile, Eatala has been admitted to a corporate hospital in Jubilee Hills for mild cold, exhaustion and knee pain. He has tested negative for Covid-19. He is stable and receiving symptomatic treatment and will undergo a procedure for knee pain, according to Eatala’s office. —Roushan Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-takes-credit-for-welfare-schemes-in-state/articleshow/84932581.cms||Roushan Ali

The district has 5,687 active patients who are in institutional quarantine. Of these, only 3.6% are in the ICUs and about 7.5% are on medical oxygen-support (non-ICU). The district’s positivity rate and fatality rates are 5.5% and 2.06%, respectively. The administration is conducting around 15,000 daily Covid tests. “The current spread of the infection is due to overcrowding at social events like weddings and funerals. Some restaurants are allowing extra diners. We are acting against violators,” said Bhosale. He said the administration was continuing with its policy of mandatory institutional quarantine for even asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic Covid patients. The five talukas of Sangamner, Parner, Pathardi, Shevgoan and Shrigonda are the hotspots in the district. More than 80% of the patients in these talukas are unvaccinated, said Prakash Lalge, Parner health officer. Some of Ahmednagar’s neighbouring districts like Nashik and Beed are on the alert after the rise in cases in Ahmednagar. Beed will test people coming from Ahmednagar to Asthi, Patoda and Shirur talukas, which share its border. Nashik’s Sinnar taluka is also being monitored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-critical-case-count-low-in-ahmednagar-despite-surge/articleshow/84934700.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The 15-day exhibition, Aadya Kala, showcases rare and primitive art pieces that give a distinctive appeal to Telangana’s rich history of folklore. From about 240 musical instruments to manuscripts dating back to some 300 years, the exhibition gives a peek into the rich culture of Adivasis from the remotest regions in Telangana. TOI’s visit to the exhibition on Saturday revealed that the manuscripts comprise a detailed story written in Brahmi script. Some manuscripts were written on camel bones, while elephants’ thigh bones were used for inscriptions. “The objective of these manuscripts back then was to make the written words last longer, for they thought that it should withstand the wear and tear of ages and get passed on to the next generation,” said Prof Jayadhir Tirumala Rao, who has been instrumental in reviving the lost art. He added: “Similarly, this exhibition is also an attempt at spreading awareness among the present generation about the past.” The organisers said that the goal of the exhibition was not purely to look at the instruments as something from the past but to work towards their resurgence and perpetuation. Writings on paper scrolls and cloth and metal depicted several topics of history, janapada folk tales, village revenue records, Ayurveda, Unani, events pertaining to Adivasi families, etc. The exhibition will be open to public between July 31 and August 15, from 11 am to 6 pm pm at the State Art Gallery in Madhapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/300-yr-old-manuscript-a-big-draw-at-exhibition/articleshow/84934666.cms||Moulika.KV

Further, according to the findings of the third sero survey by directorate of public health and preventive medicine, seropositivity in the district is about 79%. Experts say high seropositivity can indicate higher percentage of population having developed antibodies to Covid-19. However, health officials and experts have urged the public to not let their guard down.Compared to the previous serosurveys in the district, this time the seropositivity has shown a drastic rise. The district ranks third overall in the state in this regard behind Chennai (82%) and Virudhunagar (84%). “The results of the serosurvey are definitely encouraging. However, even if we consider that 20-40% of the population is yet to develop antibodies to Covid-19, in absolute numbers that would mean lakhs and crores of people being susceptible. Hence, public or officials should not become complacent,” said Dr K Kolandasamy, former director of public health. Wearing masks, ensuring proper ventilation, maintaining social distance, hand hygiene and vaccination are still very much required in preventing the spread.According to the data from the survey, barring Sivagangai, nine southern districts ranked in the top ten in terms of sero positivity in the state. Experts attribute the high sero positivity to high number of Covid-19 cases reported during the second wave in these districts. “Virudhunagar is an industrial area and has a high movement of people. Further, it also has many small villages together unlike in some other districts. These could be factors leading to high sero positivity being reported,” said Dr Kolandasamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-on-alert-despite-decline-in-cases-good-serosurvey-results/articleshow/84934668.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Delhi||Blot on growth map: How Delhi's Naraina village shrank into the alleys of darkness||NEW DELHI: Ensconced in the sylvan lap of the central Ridge, Naraina village is often ignored by a traveller on Ring Road. The village is one of the closest to the Prime Minister’s Office, right in the middle of sprawling central Delhi, but in sharp contrast to the glitz surrounding it, the urbanised village is a development blackspot. Narrow bylanes from the four-lane Ring Road led to the chaos that is Naraina — clusters of haphazard, multi-storey houses, some constructed on plots as small as 25 square yards, endless series of electric wires overhead, some of them even at arm’s distance from the windows and balconies. Most of the village lanes are so narrow that cars cannot approach them. Heaps of garbage lying until the municipal corporation clears them obstruct the main entrance to the village. The village, believed to have been founded around 1300, wasn’t such a nightmare over a century ago. Spread across 2,900 acres framed by wooded areas, which now form the Ridge, Naraina was a flourishing village of happy agriculturists whose income came mainly from carrot crops. Naraina’s destiny took a fateful turn when the British decided to shift the capital of India from Calcutta to New Delhi in 1911. The British acquired nearly half of the village land to establish Delhi Cantonment. The secluded village turned overnight into a patch of premium land. As the capital of the newly independent country expanded, the authorities lustily eyed the land in the village. “The land acquisition at throwaway prices continued after Independence as the new government established industrial and planned residential areas. The neighbourhood flourished and the shrinking village shrank by the day,” said businessman Aditya Tanwar. Decades later, the villagers feel the pinch of that period every day. “People who settled in the colonies and flats constructed on land acquired from us treat the villagers like second-class citizens and they think that they are better than us, rustic folks,” said Anil Kumar Tanwar, a village resident who won the gold medal in kabaddi in the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing, China. Many households in the village do not yet get tap water. With the population going up, there are new needs. People want a healthcare centre, park, community hall, a playground for kids and freedom from the choked sewage lines. “The village has shrunk but the families are growing. Earlier, landholdings were divided among brothers, now floors are divided among brothers and our children will have to divide the rooms on a floor,” rued Paras Tyagi, social activist and founder of NGO CYCLE India, which seeks implementation of public policy. “Because the village is lal dora, people don’t need approval of municipal authorities to construct houses. But the government too does not have clear cut plans on constructions in the village. This must change. The generous village that gave up its land for the development of the capital deserves a better deal.” Naraina’s villagers feel that the draft Master Plan Delhi 2041 ignores the capital’s urbanised villages. “MPD21 stressed on comprehensive plans to develop the villages, but nothing materialised,” said Tyagi. “The draft MPD41 does not even talk about such an approach.” The villagers want a vision for the development of the capital’s villages incorporated into the new master plan and projects executed on a priority by the civic authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/blot-on-growth-map-how-naraina-shrank-into-the-alleys-of-darkness/articleshow/84932589.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Meerut||Delhi student on way to exam electrocuted on flooded UP road, FIR against power dept||MUZAFFARNAGAR: A student from Delhi, on his way to his BEd exam in UP’s Shamli, died after he was electrocuted when he accidentally touched an electric pole on a flooded road, perhaps for balance. When his family took up the case with the power department, they allegedly said the power supply had been cut off when he died and they were not responsible. The family managed to get a hold of CCTV footage from a shop on the street, shared it on social media and now, an FIR has been registered against the power department. Nilesh Kumar, 22, lived at Shahdara in Delhi and worked at a private company. But he wanted to become a teacher and had enrolled for a BEd course at a college in Shamli, where had put up at his uncle’s house. He was going to get married in December. On Wednesday, he was hurrying to his college, wading through flooded roads after a spell of heavy rain. In the purported CCTV clip, he is seen sloshing through the road when he suddenly touches an electric pole, possibly for support. He shakes violently and, in seconds, collapses on the inundated road. He died on the spot. “Initially, the power department denied he was electrocuted, saying that the power supply had been cut off at the time of his death,” Nilesh’s uncle Parveen Kumar Sachdeva said. “We looked for CCTV footage from around the area. A shop across the road had cameras. The footage clearly showed what had happened. We released it online. It was then that power officials agreed to address our concerns.” The family filed a complaint with the police. “On the basis of the complaint, an FIR was registered against the power department for causing death by negligence,” Shamli SHO Pankaj Kumar Tyagi said. The power department, meanwhile, announced compensation for the family. Power department sub-divisional officer Brijmohan Soni told TOI, “The family will get Rs 5 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/delhi-student-on-way-to-exam-electrocuted-on-flooded-up-road-fir-against-power-dept/articleshow/84930866.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Goa||Portion of dilapidated building in Margao collapses, none hurt||MARGAO: A portion of an old run-down building, Casa Menezes, located near Gandhi market in Margao, collapsed in the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. No casualties were reported. A part of the rear side of the building came crashing down on the kitchen and washroom of a hotel on its ground floor, while also damaging a part of the building, Guru Ashish, located next to it. The upper floors of the dilapidated building are usually used by migrant labourers and the homeless as shelter during the night. As the building becomes uninhabitable during the rain on account of waterlogged floors and leaking roofs, there were no occupants in the building at the time of the mishap. Sources said that a major tragedy was averted as the incident occurred during the night. “The hotel on the ground floor is patronised by a large number of customers. One can only imagine what could have happened had the incident occurred during day time,” a resident of the area said. Salcete mamlatdar Prataprao Gaunker visited the site and directed the shop owners of the building to shut their units even as police cordoned the area. Chief officer of Margao Municipal Council (MMC) Agnelo Fernandes later issued an order under provisions contained in the Goa Municipalities Act 1968 directing the owner of Casa Menezes building to vacate the entire building with immediate effect as “there is every possibility of collapse of the remaining part, thereby causing loss of human lives and property.” The building owner has also been directed to submit a structural stability certificate of the building and to carry out repairs to or secure the structure within 30 days. The owners and occupants of the adjoining building, Guru Ashish, have also been directed by the MMC, by a separate order, to vacate all the shops and flats in the building with immediate effect and to submit a similar structural stability certificate of the building within 7 days. Following the incident the Shadow Council for Margao demanded a “review and reassessment of the dilapidated and dangerous structures and buildings in the city followed by appropriate action”. “A list of around 22 unsafe structures was prepared by MMC around nine years ago. When we got access to the list In 2014, we had charged that selected buildings where interests of real estate developers lay were conveniently figuring in that list, while several other structures in much worse conditions were excluded,” Savio Coutinho, convener of the Shadow Council said. The building structure that collapsed, too, didn’t figure in the list, he said. Chief officer Fernandes also couldn’t confirm if the collapsed building was among the ones declared unsafe by the MMC. “I will have to check the records,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/portion-of-dilapidated-bldg-in-margao-collapses-none-hurt/articleshow/84934780.cms||---
---||Delhi||Manual scavenging: HC urged to involve Centre in petition||New Delhi: Following the Centre’s comments that no deaths occurred due to manual scavenging, a petitioner whose PIL on the issue is before the Delhi high court has urged the court to take notice.In an application, the petitioner has sought to make Centre a party to his petition on ensuring compliance of the 2013 law on manual scavengers to prevent loss of lives due to manual cleaning of sewers and septic tanks.The application referred to the recent statement of minister of state for social justice and empowerment, Ramdas Athawale, during the 254th session of Rajya Sabha that “no such deaths have been reported due to manual scavenging” in the last five years.Advocate and social activist Amit Sahni in his main petition had sought directions to Delhi government to ensure strict compliance of the 2013 law on manual scavengers. It is likely to come up for hearing next week.“The Union of India is responsible both for making the policy of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 and its implementation, thereafter in every state and UT which makes up the Union of India a necessary party to this petition,” Sahni’s latest plea said.It claimed that the answer given by the MoS before the Upper House of the Parliament is “not only false and misleading, but shows utter insensitivity and apathy” towards the departed souls of the manual scavengers, their families and others who are still into this work. The application further said that the ministry concerned had earlier in February this year submitted that “340 deaths have been caused due to manual scavenging during the last five years”, which contradicts the stand now taken to the unstarred question raised in the Upper House.Besides Delhi government, the high court had earlier asked municipal bodies, DJB, Delhi Cantonment Board and PWD to file their affidavits to the petition. The court had remarked the government spends so much money on election advertisements and it should spend some amount on sensitising people about manual scavenging as so many people die due to this practice every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/manual-scavenging-hc-urged-to-involve-centre-in-petition/articleshow/84932608.cms||---

Constables have urged the government to formulate the new promotions rules at the earliest. DMK had announced that special sub-inspector promotions will be given to head constables, who have completed 20 years of service, by reducing five years of service for the promotion. Many have completed 20 years of service in the department and are keenly awaiting the announcement. Police sources said that once recruited as a grade two police constable, it used to take 10 years to be promoted as grade one police constable. It will take another five years to become head constable. After 10 years of service, one is eligible to be promoted as special sub-inspector of police. While 2002 batch police constables are nearing 20 years service, police personnel recruited in 1999 and 1997 are awaiting promotions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cops-await-dmks-poll-promise-on-promotions/articleshow/84934693.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Govt to procure anti-drone systems for Gadchiroli||Nagpur: Close on the heels of Maoists stepping up use of drones for air surveillance, the state government is learnt to expedite the purchase procedure for anti-drone systems for Gadchiroli and Gondia. Naxal range DIG Sandip Patil said the drone jammers would be used to blunt out the rebels’ plan to use them for their surveillance or various strategic usages. “Our system would be good enough to disrupt their (Maoists) drones’ signals and frequency wavelengths. We will bring their drones down,” Patil said, adding police are cautious now to thwart any plans of the Maoists’ during the ongoing ‘naxal Saptah’ or martyrs’ week between July 28 and August 3 every year. Last year in September, mysterious drones in airspace over some south Gadchiroli police stations had left the cops guessing. Repeated sightings of drones over Jarawandi, Gatta, Burgi, Hedri, Koti and Kotmi police stations had kept the cops on toes. Police had also fired on one of the drones when it had come too close to the police station. Intelligence and security experts feel the drones sighted in Gadchiroli were used by some operator who was technically sound and skilled in handling such gadgets. Though Maoists have never accepted the use of drones, they had in the past blamed Chhattishgarh police for having dropped explosives on tribal on the pretext of anti-Maoist operations. Though the Maoists’ use of drone has remained a suspense so far for the security agencies, experts feel the rebels are trying to collect information regarding the strategic locations of the police stations, their interiors and strengths and loopholes apart from security positions. “More than attacking, Maoists are now using drones for police station surveillance and planning purposes only,” said a senior official of security agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-to-procure-anti-drone-systems-for-gadchiroli/articleshow/84934694.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||World||Covid: Delta pushes weekly cases to 4 million||Mushrooming outbreaks of the Delta variant prompted China and Australia to impose stricter Covid-19 curbs on Saturday, as the WHO urged the world to contain the mutation before it turns into something deadlier and draws out the pandemic. First detected in India, the strain has now reached 132 countries and territories. “Delta is a warning: it’s a warning that the virus is evolving but it is also a call to action that we need to move now before more dangerous variants emerge,” the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan said. Worldwide, Covid infections are once again on the upswing, with the WHO announcing an 80% average increase over the past four weeks in five of the health agency’s six regions, a jump largely fuelled by the Delta variant. WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. said that nearly four million new infections had been reported to the WHO in the past week, and the organisation expected the world to surpass 200 million total known cases in the next two weeks. However, the totals are underestimates, because countries often undercount cases — sometimes by very large margins. The known global death toll of roughly 4.2 million is assumed to be similarly skewed. Things are still not as bad as they were not long ago; more than 500,000 new cases are being recorded daily, compared with more than 800,000 three months ago, according to data by Johns Hopkins University. China’s most serious surge of coronavirus infections in months spread to two more areas Saturday — Fujian province and the megacity of Chongqing — in an outbreak that now spans 14 provinces. More than 200 cases have been linked to an original Delta cluster in Nanjing city where nine cleaners at an international airport tested positive. “The main strain circulating at present is the Delta variant... which poses an even greater challenge to virus prevention and control work,” said Mi Feng, spokesman for China’s National Health Commission. The nation where the disease first emerged has rushed to prevent the highly transmissible strain from taking root by putting over one million people under lockdown and reinstituting mass testing campaigns. In Australia, where only about 14% of the population is jabbed, the third-largest city of Brisbane and other parts of Queensland state entered a snap lockdown Saturday as a cluster of the Delta variant produced six new cases. Thailand and Malaysia announced record Covid-19 infections on Saturday, mostly driven by the Delta variant. Malaysia, one of the hotspots of the disease, reported 17,786 cases on Saturday, a record high. More than 100 people gathered in Kuala Lumpur calling on PM Muhyiddin Yassin to quit. Thailand also reported a daily record high of 18,912 new Covid infections, bringing its total cases to 597,287. The country also reported 178 new deaths, also a daily record. The government said Delta accounted for over 60% of the cases in the country and 80% of the cases in Bangkok.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covid-delta-pushes-weekly-cases-to-4-million/articleshow/84937047.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court wants action against fraudulent arbitrators||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has asked the state government if it can come out with a comprehensive policy to end the fraudulent practice of self-appointed arbitrators in property disputes, which is now assuming the proportion of a “menace”. The high court witnessed several petitions earlier this week complaining about the passing of arbitration awards and eviction from property. The appointments of arbitrators were without any high court order and the execution or their awards are without any endorsement from the civil courts concerned. When the group of petitions came up for hearing on Friday, Justice Nikhil Kariel expressed concern and told the public prosecutor, “This is reaching the stage where people will start questioning the legal process altogether. How do we take care of this menace? This is taking place not even in remote areas like Panchmahal, but in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, right under our noses. We don’t know what will happen in remote areas. So kindly look into it.” The court reiterated that it would come down heavily on the perpetrators of such illegalities. The lawyers, who joined the court proceedings as representatives of such self-appointed arbitrators, also conceded that they had nothing to defend on technicality. The judge made it clear that the court would come down hard on even those lawyers practising in the high court and found in practising such illegalities. “As far as the arbitrators are concerned, I want the state government to take serious steps against them so that they do not repeat the act in the future. If any regular advocate intends to support these arbitrators, we will take care of him also. This is disturbing,” Justice Kariel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-wants-action-against-fraudulent-arbitrators/articleshow/84932655.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: PWD checks potholes after heavy rains, road caves in below IIT flyover||NEW DELHI: A big portion of the busy intersection below the IIT flyover caved in on Saturday morning, forcing traffic police to immediately barricade the segment and divert traffic. Officials of the Public Works Department later said the gaping hole measured around 40 ft long and 15 ft deep, with the cave-in occurring when their teams were inspecting potholes on the roads in the morning. “In the wake of the heavy rains of the past few days, our staff was conducting a survey of roads on Saturday morning,” said a PWD official. “They spotted a pothole at the IIT flyover intersection. When compacted, a huge chunk of the road suddenly collapsed. We immediately approached the traffic police and requested them to cordon off the affected portion of the road. Suspecting a leakage in a water pipeline, we called up Delhi Jal Board officials and enquired if this was a possibility. We could have filled the hole immediately, but until the cause is ascertained, we won’t do it.” The official added, “After verification at the cave-in site, the DJB officials detected some leakage in the water supply line and said this could have been happening or a long time, explaining the deep cavity below the road. They immediately stopped the water supply and carried out repair exercises. The work continued till Saturday late at night. In the meantime, we have made arrangements to have the sunken portion filled with construction material as soon as the pipeline repair is completed. We should be able to open the road again by Sunday morning.” As soon as the road collapsed, Delhi traffic police diverted vehicles coming from Adchini to Katwarai Sarai instead of going straight towards AIIMS on the Aurobindo Marg. They also urged commuters to avoid this stretch on social media. The police tweet said, “Traffic going from Adhchini to IIT has been diverted from Adhchini to Katwaria Sarai after a portion of a road near IIT red light caved in.” A traffic police officer claimed, “Our staff swung into action as soon as the issue was reported. Still, it resulted in traffic congestion and we had to deploy additional staff to deal with the situation and to divert the traffic. The traffic was heavy on the stretch till night as DJB worked to repair the problem after cordoning off the entire portion. We will open the road only when the situation normalises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pwd-checks-potholes-after-heavy-rains-road-caves-in-below-iit-flyover/articleshow/84932626.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nagpur||Covid-19: July best month for Vid since peak of first wave||Nagpur: With 3,070 new cases, 4,523 recoveries and only 74 deaths reported in 31 days — July has been so far the best month on all Covid related parameters for Vidarbha region. On standards like test positivity rate (TPR) and recovery rate, the overall conditions improved even since first wave of Covid-19. Experts said this is the best time to introduce relaxations. The most important positive indicator of the month is lowest deaths since June 2020. In 11 districts of Vidarbha, 74 deaths were reported in the month. Zero death toll was reported for five times in July. Yavatmal reported no death for the entire month while Nagpur reported zero deaths at least 11 times in the month. Death toll reduced significantly in second half of the month. “Reducing death toll indicates that patients are reaching hospital in time and getting good treatment. This also signifies early detection of the positive patients. It’s happening all over Vidarbha because authorities are still conducting contact tracing in good numbers,” said a senior official from Nagpur divisional health department. All 11 districts in Vidarbha together maintained the number of daily tests around 18,000 per day despite a very few new cases were being reported. As contact tracing was not enough to achieve this number, authorities resorted to measures like mobile testing, random testing at the marketplaces, and rapid antigen tests at public places. In districts like Akola and Buldhana, district administration conducted testing camps at weekly markets. Though restrictions continued officially at marketplaces, schools partially reopened in rural Vidarbha in July. Public transport buses also started witnessing the school rush. Still, the increase in number of new cases was not remarkable in last week of the July. “What we are seeing in July are wonderful flat lines in curve of new cases and deaths. Open up now. We won’t have better graph than this,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. The test positivity rate in all 11 districts in Vidarbha is less than the 1%. Districts like Bhandara, Gondia, Yavatmal and Nagpur have less than 0.5% positivity. Another important parameter is growth rate of new cases. Covid-19 cases are growing at literally zero rate in 5 Vidarbha districts while remaining six districts have about 0.2% growth rate. Overall, all 11 districts in Vidarbha are at the bottom line when it comes to the comparative analysis of the Covid-19 conditions in Maharashtra. Availability of vaccines is another positive factor of this month. Vaccination continued in all 11 districts throughout the month. Doctors said that vaccination will play the most important role in next two months to decide the fate of projected third wave. “Vaccination provides a very good protection against hospitalization and oxygen requirements. It’s proved through various studies. Increasing the pace of vaccination in next two months can delay or diminish the third wave,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. Overall, only 586 patients are under treatment in Vidarbha region as on July 31. The number was not so less even a year before when the first wave was just building up. With 70% of them in home isolation, a very few are admitted in hospitals. Especially, oxygen beds are mainly unoccupied. Low hospitalization is the important positive factor of the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-july-best-month-for-vid-since-peak-of-first-wave/articleshow/84932652.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Bareilly||Filed away as accident, Uttar Pradesh man’s death turns out to be cold-blooded murder-for-hire||BAREILLY: Abdul Kalam’s blood-splattered body was found lying by a road at Baddi in Himachal Pradesh on Friday last week. It seemed certain it was an accident and his family buried his body at his village, Laxmipur, in UP’s Budaun on Monday. But while going over CCTV footage, in which they expected to witness a crash or accident, they saw two men taking Abdul away on a bike and then, after a while, returning without him. A second autopsy found a bullet in his neck, which had been missed the first time. He had been murdered. Abdul, 27, was a carpenter. There was little to do at sleepy Laxmipur and Baddi, as a pharmaceutical hub, meant good business. He teamed up with a relative from Badaun, Mohammad Shamshul, 30, and set up shop in Baddi. That’s where he had been living. “His head was badly crushed when the body was found,” Baddi ASP Vivek Chahal told TOI. “There seemed to be a penetrating injury in the head but the first autopsy (conducted on July 23) could not say why.” They concluded he may have been hit by something in an accident or rocks may have come crashing down the hills through which the road passes. But they found evidence of neither. Working their way backwards, they started going over CCTV footage from nearby areas. “A petrol pump was close to the site where Abdul’s body was found,” Chahal said. “Their footage from July 22 night showed three men on a bike, among them Abdul, going towards the site. Later, when they were seen riding back, Abdul wasn’t with them.” The timeline matched Abdul’s time of death. But it wouldn't alone prove Abdul had been killed. First, the cops identified the two men — Mohammad Shahid, 21, and Mohammad Faizan, 23 — who were neighbours of Abdul’s family in Budaun. What were they doing 500km away at Baddi? “When we went to their village to question them, they were absconding,” Chahal said. Meanwhile, Abdul’s body was exhumed on Friday. “The second autopsy found a bullet in his neck,” Chahal added. “It was enough proof and we launched a manhunt. Shahid was located in Chandigarh and Faizan at another place in Haryana. When they were questioned, they said they had been hired by Shamshul to kill Abdul.” Shamshul, police said, owed Abdul money. Unwilling to deal with the ongoing dispute over that, he got him killed. “He was arrested from Budaun,” the district’s SSP Sankalp Sharma told TOI. An FIR has been registered against Shamshul, Shahid and Faizan for murder. Charges of criminal conspiracy and causing disappearance of evidence may be added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/filed-away-as-accident-up-mans-death-turns-out-to-be-cold-blooded-murder-for-hire/articleshow/84930883.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Go ahead and implement it but in all the 119 assembly constituencies and not just the poll bound Huzurnagar. The Congress will also support you if the situation warrants you to sell Pragathi Bhavan and secretariat land to raise funds for implementation of Dalitha Bandhu,” said Revanth Reddy. Referring to KCR’s statement that no one can stop him from implementing any scheme once he has decided to do it, Revanth said that KCR had cheated the SCs on his promise of appointing a Dalit as the chief minister and failed to fulfil his poll promise of distributing three acres land. “Without fulfilling the promises made in the past, KCR has now come out with a new scheme, Dalitha Bandhu,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-to-kcr-implement-dalitha-bandhu-across-t/articleshow/84932613.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The landslides occurred at Mirgaon, Ambeghar, Humbrali and Dokawale villages in Satara, killing 46 people, while three, including a nine-year-old child, are still missing. “The villages, in the backwater areas of Koyna dam received 766mm rainfall in 24 hours, on the day of the landslides. About 16TMC water was generated in the areas in this short period. In fact, Pune consumes this much water in a year. It shows the severity of the situation there on the fateful day,” Rao told TOI on Friday. Commenting on the line of action, Rao said that they have planned to rehabilitate these villages to safer locations after consultation with them. “We had a discussion with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday in Pune. It has been decided to carry out permanent rehabilitation of these villages at the earliest. About 23 such villages are listed in Pune district as well,” Rao added. Shekhar Singh, Satara district collector, told TOI over the phone, “We have not come across any human interference on the hills, where landslides took place. We are awaiting results of the survey being carried out by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) experts at the site. At present, our priority is to create temporary accommodation facilities for the affected villagers. Currently, they are living in schools and temples in nearby villages.” Raigad district collector Nidhi Choudhary did not respond to phone calls or text messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/excessive-rainfall-over-24hrs-main-reason-for-satara-landslides-div-commissioner/articleshow/84936301.cms||Sandip Dighe

While speaking at the event, the revenue minister said, “This was the soil that had been trodden upon by the Marudhu Pandiar brothers and Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar. The region is not developed like other parts of the state because Muthuramalingam Thevar Aiya was against the state.” Dr N Sethuraman, founder of the All-India Muvender Munnani Kazhagam, has said the minister’s speech is highly condemnable. He should seek pardon for his speech against the late leader. It is the DMK, which has been representing the Thiruchuzhi constituency ever since it was created.

Farmers whose fields lie along the river banks fear that in the coming days, they will see more destruction of their crops as the swollen Ganga sweeps away large tracts of land and top fertile soil. Farmers have blamed the massive soil erosion to the absence of embankments they have been demanding for years. Piyush Baliyan, junior engineer at the irrigation department, confirmed, “ The Ganga is flowing with over one lakh cusec of water in Bijnor for the last three days. Its water level has risen following incessant rainfall in hills and plains.” Every monsoon, the raging Ganga becomes a threat to the 25 villages, including Daibalgarh, Gauspur, Kauharpur, Rawali and Brahmpuri, located on its banks, eroding agricultural lands and damaging crops. As Bijendra Singh of Rawali village put it , “Our very existence is at risk. The Ganga has been rising for the last three days. We have been demanding construction of an embankment for the past several decades but to no avail.” Ram Baabu, executive engineer of the irrigation department, said, “The Centre had approved a Rs 61-crore project to erect studs along the Ganga to curb land erosion but the funds are yet to be okayed. Besides, we had prepared projects worth Rs 2 crore to repair old embankments along other rivers in the district but only Rs 20 lakh was sanctioned.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bijnor-farmers-suffer-as-swollen-ganga-destroys-land-crops/articleshow/84930891.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Kochi||‘There were bids to influence probes’||KOCHI: Outgoing Customs commissioner (preventive) Sumit Kumar, who led the agency during the investigations into various sensational cases, including the Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case, held a farewell news conference in Kochi on Saturday and said that there were attempts influence the probes and the department did not budge under pressure. He criticized the inquiry against the central agencies and said that he answers to the Union finance ministry and not the Kerala government. “I don’t report to the chief minister. I report to the Union finance minister, who has been very supportive. There is no question of any pressure on me,” Kumar said. The commissioner also denied allegations that the Union government was using the Customs as a tool against Kerala. “Ruling parties will come and go. The allegations against us are nonsense. They launched contempt of court proceedings against me, it has not reached anywhere. They moved a privilege motion against me in the assembly. They lodged an FIR against the Enforcement Directorate and the Kerala high court quashed it. All the steps that were taken by whoever in charge have gone nowhere,” he said. Even as he said that there were attempts to influence the Customs probe, including into the controversial gold smuggling case, he did not name any politician or political party. He said that threats to intimidate him were made even during his previous postings. “We are not concerned with political parties but persons. If you are a person, no matter how high you are, you are not above law. No constitutional position grants you immunity from the law of the land. National interest and national security is our priority. Parties or companies are not relevant. The law does not discriminate between an ordinary offender and an offender sitting in high position,” he said. He said that laxity on the part of the Kerala police was a fact. “There was attack on DRI. Many FIRs were lodged. There was attack on our team in November. Another attack happened in January. There was an attempt on me. There have been a number of cases of snatching (smugglers and smuggled gold). Everybody who we have caught have some ‘political links’, which we are looking into… there are very good police officers in Kerala but institutionally what they have delivered?,” he said. Regarding the alleged phone call from the Kerala CM’s office to release the diplomatic baggage, he said that it was a hypothetical question as the bag was never released. He said show cause notice in currency smuggling case was also being issued. Kumar had earlier given the nod to initiate prosecution proceedings in the gold smuggling case as well. Kumar has been transferred to the Bhiwandi GST and Central Excise unit in Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/there-were-bids-to-influence-probes/articleshow/84930933.cms||---

Managements pointed out that last year, despite holding online classes continuously, many private schools were unable to collect even 50% of the fees. “It has not been made mandatory that 85% of the fees must be paid. In fact, concession has also been given to let parents pay 75% of the fees if they are in financial distress. But, even paying 75% fees has not been made mandatory. At the same time, schools have been prohibited from taking any action against any student if they had not paid the fees, or even try to pressurize parents to pay fees,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). Private schools fear that such an order would lead to further financial disarray for the schools which were already struggling to collect fees last year. “Once again if parents are also allowed to pay in instalments, they will only look to delay paying fees as much as possible. Even some parents who are able to afford the fees did not pay last year or paid late as some others had not paid the fees. Schools are only left to struggle to pay taxes, salaries of teachers etc., on their own without collecting any fees,” said the principal of a private matriculation school in Madurai. In the last year, many private schools across the state have even been forced to shut down as well. “Government school teachers are getting their salaries as usual. But, private school teachers like us have had our salaries cut drastically despite long working hours for online classes. Schools give the excuse of not being able to collect fees for cutting salaries. Last year, many private school teachers had to resign or were even forced to convince parents to pay the fees so that they could get salary,” said an English teacher working at a private matriculation school. The state government had also not announced any special welfare measures or financial assistance for private schools or private school teachers throughout the Covid-19 pandemic so far. “The court order would at least give 50% benefit to the bigger matriculation and CBSE schools. It is feared that smaller primary and nursery schools may not be able to secure even 5% of the fees from parents,” said Arumugam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-order-on-fees-fails-to-cheer-pvt-schools/articleshow/84934753.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

So far, people used to wait under some shade outside the station till their turn came for inquiry or while waiting for the case to be recorded, in the absence of a waiting area.City police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha told TOI that waiting areas have been made ready in at least 50% of the 25 police stations. “Sometimes it will take a while for the police to conduct an inquiry or to record FIR. People need to wait outside the police station. They can wait in the waiting area which will have drinking water facility, a fan and required number of chairs,” he said.All police stations have a reception with a front desk person. In order to make the stations people-friendly, mostly women police personnel have been preferred at the reception, the commissioner said. A police officer from the Keerathurai station said since it was a newly-constructed building there is ample space and a portion has been allocated for the waiting area. “We ensure that people wait and prevent crowding outside the station. At least 8-10 people can sit at a time,” he said.Officials from the Koodalpudur station said that a tin-sheet roofed waiting area has been created outside the station building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/police-stations-in-madurai-city-get-waiting-areas-for-public/articleshow/84934737.cms||V Devanathan

---||Goa||Goa: Day after Vishwajit Rane’s U-turn, Covid victims’ kin recall oxygen shortage||PANAJI: The government’s bold assertion on the floor of the House that no deaths occured due to oxygen shortages during the peak of the second Covid wave has rekindled anger and frustration among families of those who died. From being racked with guilt and struggling to sleep, those left behind were still struggling to come to terms with their loss when they came across health minister Vishwajit Rane’s cold denial in the legislative assembly. W D’Souza, from a village in South Goa, said he saw many people breathe their laboured last breath in the first fortnight of May while he tended to his mother at GMC. “I have seen people dying due to lack of oxygen. It was really sad. The doctors asked us to use stretchers and trolleys to bring as many as seven oxygen cylinders from the ground floor,” he told TOI. His mother passed away, despite doctors telling him that she was getting better. Guilt and anger overwhelm him in waves, as he recalls the time he spent by his mother’s bedside at GMC. His stay at GMC coincided with the peak of the second wave, when at least 75 Covid fatalities were reported on a single day. “I still can’t sleep at night. Those were the worst days of my life,” said D’Souza after a long pause. “I keep recollecting her memories, and it seems this pain will last forever, and now, the government is denying it.” He isn’t the only one. “My uncle died because his family could not get a replacement oxygen cylinder on time. Now that the government says that nobody died, I feel frustrated,” said Rajesh Kalangutkar from Ponda. Kalangutkar said that the loss of his uncle, the only earning member in the family, remains like a fresh wound for the extended family. Saligao resident Ashley Delaney remembers patients and doctors scrambling for oxygen. “After about two weeks, the doctors had begun to give up. I saw their helplessness when they said their pleas were falling on deaf ears. You feel helpless too,” he said. Delaney, whose own father-in-law underwent treatment at GMC, spent his spare hours there assisting other patients with food and oxygen supplies. As one of the many faceless volunteers during the second Covid-19 wave, he got an unfiltered view of the challenges at GMC, most critically the oxygen shortage. From the start of May, doctors at GMC were repeatedly flagging the shortage of oxygen supplies to the directorate of health services, Scoop Oxygen — that had a monopoly over oxygen supply to the hospital — and even the chief minister’s office. The SOS calls would usually begin around 11pm, and would continue till 6am. The flow of medical oxygen through the main pipeline would dip in wards 145, 142, 148 and 123, prompting doctors, relatives and attendants to frantically search for oxygen cylinders. On May 11, Rane held a press conference to announce that 26 Covid-19 patients died between 2am and 6am at GMC during the second wave due to a drop in oxygen supply. He had called for a high court probe into the deaths and the drop in oxygen supply, and had also written to chief minister Pramod Sawant asking for at least four 5,000-litre oxygen tanks or a large 20,000-litre oxygen tank to be installed at GMC. On May 15, a 20,000-litre oxygen tank was installed. “If there was no problem in oxygen supply, why did the government install such a huge capacity oxygen tank? And what was the need for resident doctors to hook up two to three patients on to one oxygen cylinder?” asked a senior doctor who was posted at GMC during the crisis. Doctors said the state government was hiding behind a technicality while denying the deaths due to oxygen shortage. Doctors said the death certificates mention acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac arrest, acute pneumonia or Covid-19 as the official cause of death, with no mention of asphyxia or respiratory arrest being made. “We have recordings of calls from the official GMC line where doctors were themselves telling us they are running out of oxygen. Were GMC doctors lying on the official landline of GMC?,” asked Shruti Chaturvedi, who started the Covid Care Goa initiative. “I remember my father-inlaw survived for two extra weeks because he got an oxygen cylinder from a person who had just expired. It was clear that medical oxygen was not enough,” said Delaney.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/day-after-ranes-u-turn-covid-victims-kin-recall-o2-shortage/articleshow/84934804.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Chennai||66.2% of people in Tamil Nadu have Covid antibodies||CHENNAI: As Covid-19 cases in Tamil Nadu crossed 25 lakh earlier this month, at least 66.2% of the population or two out of every three people in the state had developed antibodies against the virus, shows a serosurvey conducted by the state health department. The third cross-sectional serosurvey conducted between June and July covering 26,610 samples revealed nearly double the seropositivity compared to the rate prevailing at the end of the first wave in October 2020. The increase was because either more people were infected or more had got vaccine shots, officials said. The survey results released by health minister Ma Subramanian on Saturday showed that among those tested, 17,624 had IgG antibodies against the virus. A recent survey by Indian Council for Medical Research also showed seropositivity of 69.2% among 1,258 people tested in the state. Nationally, it was 67.6%. While Chennai had 82% seropositivity, Virudhunagar district recorded the highest seroprevalance of 84% and Erode lowest at 37%. The survey was conducted by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine in 888 clusters across the state. Each of these clusters had 30 people representing a village (in rural areas) or a street in (urban areas). Blood samples were tested at six referral labs of the directorate in Chennai, Trichy, Madurai. Coimbatore, Tirunelveli and Salem. “It is good to see that more than three-fifths of the population have some protection. It a huge jump from what we saw in 2020,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. During phase-1, the seropositivity was 32%. It declined to 29% at the beginning of the second wave in April. Although the overall seroprevalence in the state had increased by nearly 34 percentage points compared to phase-1, the growth wasn’t uniform across districts. While Chennai had 82% seropositivity, Coimbatore and Erode had a seropositivity of 43% and 37%. “This explains why these two western districts continue to report the highest number of cases per million every day. In absolute numbers, densely populated Chennai reports more than Erode,” said director of public health Dr TS Selvavinayagam, who led the survey. Erode, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Nagapattinam (46%) and Namakkal (47%) were the five districts with less than 50% seropositivity. Eleven other districts recorded 70% to 79% rate. The biggest jump in seropositivity, compared to phase-1 survey in 2020, was reported by Dindugul. The district, which reported presence of antibodies in 28% of its population, has reported an increase of 45 percentage points to 73%. The lowest increase was in Coimbatore (21 percentage points), Erode (20 percentage points) and Perambalur (9 percentage points). According to officials, the high seropositivity in Tamil Nadu during the second wave was because of two reasons. “The second wave was fierce. The state reported more than 36,000 cases a day. Apart from those who tested positive, there could have been many more who were asymptomatic,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. In addition, the vaccination drive has also been intense. By the time the survey began on June 10, 97.6 lakh people in TN had received at least one vaccine dose. “This leaves us with two goals to ensure districts with lesser prevalence increase vaccination coverage and make sure people in districts with higher prevalence don’t let their guard down,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/66-2-of-people-in-tn-have-covid-antibodies/articleshow/84932712.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||Nagpur||Gadkari for classification of hospitals to resolve excess bill disputes||Nagpur: To sort out the contentious issue of excess billing by some private hospitals, Union minister Nitin Gadkari has suggested classifying hospitals into different categories depending on their facilities and investments. He feels if rates are fixed as per classification of hospitals in A, B, C and D categories, it would significantly reduce their conflict with the patients. Gadkari was speaking at a function organized by TOI to felicitate doctors and frontline workers — Times Leading Lights — on Saturday. District collector R Vimala was also present on the occasion. While flaying hospitals against whom patients had lodged complaints with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) over excess billing, Gadkari also acknowledged that it wasn’t possible for all hospitals to charge uniform rates. The Union minister said that earning money is not an offence, “but it should not be by exploiting patients”. “No inquiry should be initiated against hospitals flouting norms during peak of Covid-19 as then it would adversely affect their functioning. Action can be taken later. The collector and NMC commissioner should discuss and sort out all the disputes so that patients don’t suffer,” said Gadkari. Applauding the contribution of doctors, nurses and other para-medical staff along with police, security personnel and others, the minister said they worked overtime to save lives of thousands of patients during the last one and half year of the pandemic. Warning citizens to prepare for projected third wave, Gadkari called on the collector and other officials to make efforts for increasing beds in the city and availability of oxygen. “Rather than opening new hospitals, which would require huge staff and machinery, the administration should allow existing ones to augment their infrastructure in terms of beds and other facilities. We need to have at least 10,000 beds in the city. We are also increasing beds at AIIMS here to 1,000.” While asking the administration to speed up the vaccination process, the cabinet minister sought cooperation from NGOs and tackling vaccine hesitancy. “A big campaign is needed to achieve 100% vaccination. We also need to create special facilities for the children. Essential drugs like Remdesivir and Amphotericin B were produced at Genetek Life Sciences plant in Wardha. Similarly, even children’s medicines could be produced there. Think for the best and prepare for the worst,” he said. Focus on airport modernization, Mihan: Gadkari to CM Nitin Gadkari urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to personally pay attention to the Nagpur airport modernization project which is in limbo after the state government cancelled the tender awarded to GMR. He also sought the CM’s attention to the Mihan project. Gadkari said there wasn’t any need to appoint another consultant (Delloite) for providing a privatization road map after it was earlier done when the tender was allotted to GMR during the tenure of former CM Devendra Fadnavis. ‘Farmers’ issues discussed with Pawar’ The Union minister said he recently met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar to discuss various issues related to farmers, including the ongoing strike. Speculations of a secret meeting between the two were rife in the political circles. He also met West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, but discussions mainly revolved around road projects in her state. Stating that the current Parliament session was at a standstill since the beginning due to non-cooperation from opposition benches over Pegasus issue, he said the NDA government was ready to discuss all issues on floor of the house and all party leaders need to find out a way through dialogue to resume smooth functioning of both houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-for-classification-of-hospitals-to-resolve-excess-bill-disputes/articleshow/84932722.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

She was convicted on July 24 by the special sessions court for MP & MLA cases at Nampally and also fined Rs 10,000. The MP had filed an appeal against the trial court order before the high court. Her counsel Zeeshan Adnan Mahmood argued before the high court that the only basis for conviction as per the trial court judgment was the alleged confession made by an accused in the presence of the police which as per the law laid down by the Supreme Court was inadmissible evidence. Mahmood also claimed that apart from the alleged confession there was no other evidence on record linking her to the accused or to the alleged offence. It was also contended that Section 188 of IPC was added to Section 171-B by the investigation officer only to exercise powers under Section 155 (2) and as the trial court had already acquitted her of the offence under Section 188, the connected case was devoid of any basis. The judge suspended the sentence and posted the case for final hearing. The suspension of sentence would be in operation till the disposal of her appeal before the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-trs-mps-jail-sentence/articleshow/84932708.cms||---

Police, however, said that this was a matter under verification. Police said that a ballistic examination of the firearm held on Saturday found it to be a 7.62mm country-made pistol. The source and how the accused procured the pistol were being investigated. Ernakulam rural SP K Karthick said that people were being interrogated and teams would be sent to other states. The case pertains to the death of Manasa who was shot down by Rakhil P (32) of Melur in Kannur at a house near the college where she was doing her house surgency. Rakhil had then shot himself. According to official sources, a friend of the shooter from Kannur has given a statement that he had accompanied the accused to Bihar from where they had procured the pistol. Police said that he claimed that they had been in Bihar for 10 to 15 days in July. However, police are yet to verify whether he knew about his murder plans. Officials said that the veracity of his statement was also being verified. It seems like he had taken the trip to Bihar days after he gave assurance to Kannur police that he would not try to contact the woman again. A special investigation team led by Karthick was probing the case. A four-member team is camping in Kannur as part of the investigation. Inquest proceedings were held at a private hospital in Kothamangalam on Saturday morning and later the bodies were taken to Government Medical College, Kalamassery, where autopsies were held.

CO Anil Kumar Yadav said, “Based on the family’s complaint, an FIR was registered against five identified — Salman, Faizan, Arshad, Shanu and Dilkhush — and one unidentified person under sections 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and appropriate sections of the Anti-Conversion Law and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.” “Police teams have been deployed to trace the missing girl, while effort is on to nab the accused, at the earliest,” added the CO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-20-abducted-forced-to-change-religion-in-moradabad-case-registered/articleshow/84930919.cms||Maria Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Kala Rana to step in from Bangkok for Kala Jathedi||NEW DELHI: The dramatic arrest of gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi seems more like part of a well-scripted plan by the brass of an alliance of top gangsters of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan who are all lodged in jail, to control the underworld in north India, sources believe. The vacuum created by Jathedi will be filled by Virender Pratap alias Kala Rana, who is based in Bangkok and has been tasked to handle the syndicate's operations from outside India. The rest will operate from jail and run a group of around 700 shooters and henchmen. TOI had first reported about such an alliance in the making in May. Sources in an intelligence agency perceived the arrest as something similar to the case of gangster Jitender Gogi, who was arrested by the Special Cell team last year days after the then police commissioner had taken charge. Gogi began to operate from jail upon his arrest and not only made extortion calls, but also managed the daring escape of his deputy, Kuldeep Fajja, from Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital while in police custody. Fajja was subsequently shot dead by another team. Sources saw a parallel with Jathedi going to jail and the alliance partners, Lawrence Bishnoi, Raju Basodi, Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, Kali Rajpoot and Sampat Nehra, all operating from behind bars. As a source claimed, “The alliance aims to indulge in extortion, drugs and illegal arms trafficking, land grabbing and target killings in collaboration with partners in Mexico, Italy and Thailand. Their targets are Bollywood celebrities, Punjabi singers and actors and businessmen from Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana.” The Special Cell has been tipped off about the alliance having approached international drug trafficker Amandeep Multani, who is connected with Mexican drug cartels, for a collaboration last year. Multani was arrested by the US Drug Enforcement Agency in April, leading to a halt in the alliance's operations. The second international contact has been identified as one Monty from the UK who has links with an Italian mafia outfit. While Monty masquerades as a social media handler, he is learnt to be deeply involved in the expansion plans of the alliance. "Wrestler Sushil Kumar was also a part of this nexus until he fell out with Jathedi and joined Neeraj Bawana. Sushil Kumar provided them with contacts for land settlement and extortion,” alleged a police insider. Some other men like Sube Gurjar of Haryana and the slain Anandpal's henchmen are also part of this alliance. Apart from Kala Rana, police have identified a few international members of this alliance such as Satyenderjeet Singh alias Goldi Brar of Canada. “The criminal alliance has been functioning in a well-organised manner and has emerged as a name synonymous with gangland terror in the four major north Indian states,” revealed an anti-terror wing officer. The Special Cell had recently filed an FIR under MCOCA to crack down on this newly forged alliance and had taken jailed gangsters like Bishnoi and Nehra on remand. About Nehra, an officer recalled that he was earlier arrested for hatching a plot to kill actor Salman Khan for which he had conducted a recce of his residence. Several other celebrities are on this alliance's radar, the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rana-to-step-in-from-bangkok-for-jathedi/articleshow/84932699.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Hyderabad||Abolish OBC creamy layer too, VHR urges PM||Hyderabad: The Congress has demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should ensure that the provision of creamy layer was removed from the 27% quota for OBCs at the national level. Former convenor of the Parliamentary Forum of OBC MPs, V Hanumantha Rao (VHR) of the Congress, in his letter to the PM said, “Your government has announced 27% reservations to OBCs and 10% for economically weaker sections (EWS) for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses under the all India quota. But until Rs 8 lakh creamy layer stipulation is removed, justice will continue to evade OBCs.” While welcoming induction of several OBCs in the Union cabinet recently, he said that just as there was no creamy layer for OBCs to get a ministerial berth, there should be no such curbs in education and employment sectors either. He also sought extension of the OBC quota benefits in jobs and education for Muslims at the national level as there were many in the community who were below poverty line among the OBCs. He made it clear that Congress was not against the 10% EWS reservations. The Congress government led by the then prime minister PV Narasimha Rao had implemented the Mandal Commission reservations for OBCs in 1993. Despite the Supreme Court quashing the reservations in IITs, IIMs and medical education fields, the reservations bill was introduced in Parliament, he said. “The Parliamentary Forum of OBC MPs played a vital role in building consensus for passing the reservations bill in Parliament then. As the convenor of Parliamentary Forum of OBC MPs along with 82 MPs, I had met you and requested to remove the creamy layer stipulation. Since then, we have been repeatedly requesting for its removal. When there is no creamy layer stipulation for SCs, and STs, why has it been made applicable to OBCs,” Rao said. The reservations of SCs and STs remain intact even if the quota was not filled up. Under backlogs, the job opportunities for them were provided at a later stage. Whereas for OBCs, the non-filled reserved government jobs are given away to other upper-class candidates, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/abolish-obc-creamy-layer-too-vhr-urges-pm/articleshow/84932690.cms||---

Confirming the action against the duo, principal Dr Arvind Trivedi told TOI that they were punished on the recommendation of the medical college’s anti-ragging committee after 15 days of investigation. According to well-placed college sources, the girl’s father, in his complaint lodged to the principal in the first week of July, had stated that seniors used to force his daughter to get up any time of the day that had disturbed her sleep. Besides, his daughter was harassed and asked to finish the assignments of seniors, like completing their practical notebooks in a given time, which resulted in his daughter going into depression, alleged the father. Though the college authorities are tight-lipped on the question of what kind of raging it was, the principal said during their investigation, the committee found the two seniors guilty. They were handed down the punishment on Friday. “They made a mistake and got punished. It will send a strong message among the students against the menace of ragging. Raging is a crime,” added Dr Trivedi. However, it's not for the first time when the medical college’s reputation is tarnished by a ragging incident. In August 2019, six senior students were suspended by the college administration for ragging their juniors. Similarly, in 2018, a ragging incident was reported, following which the medical college had rusticated 51 students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-girl-students-at-saharanpur-medical-college-suspended-for-a-fortnight-on-ragging-charges/articleshow/84930941.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Delhi||Woman accomplice of gangster Kala Jathedi also held||NEW DELHI: A day after the arrest of gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi, Delhi Police announced on Saturday that it had arrested his woman accomplice too. While Jathedi carried a bounty of Rs 6 lakh for his capture, Ajmer Police had announced a Rs 10,000 reward for the apprehension of Anuradha Chaudhary alias Madam Minz for her alleged involvement in three cases of extortion and possession of firearms in Nagaur district of Rajasthan. Sandeep, 37, belongs to Jathedi village in Haryana’s Sonipat while Chaudhary, 37, is a native of Sikar in Rajasthan. Chaudhary was earlier an associate of the slain interstate gangster, Anandpal Singh, but on his death in an encounter in 2017, had joined the Lawrence Bishnoi-Jathedi faction, police said. The woman gangster, the cops claimed, was synonymous with terror in the business communities of Nagaur, Sikar, Didwana and other places. She is known to have fired from an AK-47 rifle as a tactic for intimidating her victims. Chaudhary is implicated in 12 criminal involvements in Rajasthan. Two cases were filed against her in Nagaur’s Kuchaman City police station in August 2020 and January this year and the third at Gotan police station, also in January. “We are sending a team to New Delhi to interrogate Chaudhary in these cases,” said S Sengathir, Ajmer range IG, on Saturday. Sikar police revealed that the woman, who claimed to have an MBA and MPhil degrees and once worked with a brokerage firm, had jumped bail last August. According to Delhi Police special commissioner Neeraj Thakur, after Chaudhary joined him, they got fake identities made as husband-wife and constantly shifted bases across different states to evade detection by police. Jathedi hadn’t fled the country as was believed earlier, but the story of his flight from India was created by his syndicate after his escape from police custody in Faridabad last year. Jathedi grew a beard, wore a turban and went around in the guise of a Sikh. Using an international number for encrypted internet chat platforms, Jathedi tried to create the impression that he was in Dubai and Bangkok. However, his cover was blown when his accomplices were arrested and interrogated. Thakur said, “A team led by DCP Manishi Chandra and inspector Vikram Dahiya first traced Jathedi to Goa and then to MP, Bihar, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand.” The pursuers finally got footage showing the gangster in Chaudhary’s company. On July 30, he was apprehended at the toll plaza in Saharanpur. A PX-3 pistol and a 0.38 bore revolver were recovered from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-accomplice-of-gangster-also-held/articleshow/84932734.cms||---

The injured Duraisamy, 59, has wounds on his chest while Haribaskar, 20, injured his left hand. Locals had sighted the movement of a leopard-like animal near the hillock on the Aangiyam – Koneripatti road around 3pm. Haribaskar said he went to the hillock to take selfie with the animal and was attacked by it. On hearing the noise, Duraisamy, who was grazing cows nearby, rushed to the spot but also came under the animal’s attack.Villagers came to their rescue and rushed them to the primary health centre at Thathaingarpettai. Later, they were referred to the government hospital in Namakkal.“Going by the injuries and pugmarks, it looks like a case of leopard attack. Teams with forest department staff are camping in the area to identify the animal,” said district forest officer (DFO) D Sujatha. The forest department officials said that about 30 employees of the department launched surveillance in the area with the help of surveillance cameras.Sujatha also said that there was no precedence of leopard movement in the area. “Even if it was a leopard, it might have come from some other area. If we don’t disturb it, it will leave the area,” she said. Trichy rural police have deployed night patrol teams and cautioned people in the area against venturing out at night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-tries-to-take-selfie-with-leopard-2-injured/articleshow/84934847.cms||---
---||Goa||In second wave, 92% of Goa Covid deaths hadn’t got single vaccine dose||PANAJI: More than 90% of Covid-19 deaths in Goa over the past three months have been among the unvaccinated. In a strong indication of vaccine effectiveness especially after both doses, statistics with the health department indicate that 92.3% of all persons who succumbed to Covid-19 in government and private hospitals during the second wave had not taken even a single dose of the vaccine. Of the 2168 Covid-19 deaths between April 24 to July 27, it has been found that 99.5% (2,000 persons) of the deaths were among the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated population. The partially vaccinated accounted for 7.2% (157 persons) of the deaths and fully vaccinated only 0.51% (11 persons). Although the vaccination for younger age groups began late this year, the health department found that the deceased included senior citizens, for whom vaccinatio had begun on March 1 but hadn’t received a single dose of the vaccine. The data covers deaths in both public and private hospitals. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI that the statistics are proof that vaccination is “highly effective”. “This data is the biggest proof for everybody, and that’s why we need to take the vaccine. The pandemic has affected everything from business to schools and work. Vaccination is one of the quickest ways for us to be able to go back to our normal lives,” he said. With reports that the third wave could hit the country by September, Betodkar said that vaccination will prevent people from getting sick and developing complications from Covid-19. “Every day, there are 10-20 hospital admissions and around two deaths, a majority of which are among the unvaccinated. We don’t want anybody to die when we have vaccines,” he said. From Measles to TB, there are several good examples of the role vaccination has played in protecting the population over decades. “The most recent example is polio. We could eradicate it only through vaccination. Here too (polio) there are minimum side effects and the vaccine is being given to children below five years of age,” he said. He appealed to the people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. “There’s no reason to hesitate and think negatively about the vaccine when there are so many positive results. Our statistics are proof of this,” he said. Meanwhile, the state came close but has fallen short of meeting its target of administering the first dose of the vaccine to 100% of the eligible population by July 31. On Saturday 1,57,203 persons (13%) were unvaccinated. A total of 22.6% of the population is fully vaccinated, 64.2% partially vaccinated and 86.8% have taken at least a one dose of the vaccine as on July 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-2nd-wave-92-of-goa-covid-deaths-hadnt-got-single-vax-dose/articleshow/84934870.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Pune||Pune: Social organisations help rain-affected residents of remote villages in Bhor||PUNE: Various social organisations from Bhor tehsil and Pune city have collaborated to help residents of 12 remote villages that have been cut off due to landslides after the recent heavy spell of rain. The villages are located near the backwaters of Neera Devghar dam in Bhor tehsil. The volunteers walked over 15 km on muddy roads carrying essential items such as medicines, solar lamps, grocery, packets of grains, mobile power bank and kerosene cans. Rajendra Jadhav, sub-divisional officer of Bhor, said, “Reaching these villages is a challenging task so we had appealed to the social organisations and NGOs for help. Over the last five days, 50 volunteers have been delivering essential items to them.” The villages have road access only via Varandha Ghat, which has been closed due to multiple landslides that occurred on July 22 and 23. “Over 30 small and big landslides have been taken place at multiple locations in the ghat section. So, we were unable to deliver food grain and other items to the villages,” added Jadhav. Four teams from the public works department have been clearing the debris with the help of 12 earth movers, said Jadhav. Rajeev Kelkar, president and founder of Bhor-based NGO Dhruv Pratishthan, said, “The villagers are poor and don’t have even basic grocery items. We delivered groceries in one-kilogram packs to them. Since most of them don’t have LPG connection, we have given them kerosene for cooking.” Sachin Deshmukh, member of Sahyadri rescue foundation at Bhor, said, “In total, 25 volunteers have been delivering food to the villages for the last two days.” Another volunteer Vijay Jadhav said the villagers don’t have electricity for the last one week and there is no mobile connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/social-orgs-help-rain-affected-residents-of-remote-villages-in-bhor/articleshow/84936320.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Meerut||Hattrick girl played with tree branches back home||HARIDWAR/MEERUT: When Vandana Katariya was a child, she was told her love for sports was unbecoming of a girl. So, she would sneak away, forage for tree branches and practise her moves, away from the prying eyes of disapproving elders in Uttarakhand’s Roshnabad village. But Vandana found one defender when everyone else around her wanted her to drop her passion -- her father. When he died three months ago, she couldn’t make it home. She had to keep training. On Saturday, she became India’s first woman to score a hattrick at the Olympics and part of India’s first women’s hockey team to make it to the quarter-finals. “We are nine siblings. Grandmother would ask her to pay attention to household chores and learn how to cook, not waste time playing,” her elder brother Shekhar, 36, told TOI. Those in her village didn’t like the idea of a girl joining boys in sports either. “But father supported her. He was the only one to do so.” Their father, Nahar Singh Kataria, had been a wrestler himself. At the foothills of the Shivalik hills, Roshnabad was practically off the map when Vandana was growing up. In 2000, Roshnabad gots its own stadium. “It changed the life of local girls, including Vandana,” said Manish Pal, a local sports enthusiast. But it was kho-kho that got Vandana into her first organised sports event. “She played division-level kho-kho with her elder sister Reena,” Haridwar district sports officer SK Dobhal told TOI. “Around 2001, local hockey coach Krishna Kumar recruited many girls to form a women’s hockey team. Vandana was one of them.” Kumar’s son Ravi said, “We’d train together every evening. She was in Class III or IV then. She’d keep playing kho-kho whenever she could. Dad told her one day that if she wanted to make a name, she had to focus on hockey … In fact, her sister Reena, who won a medal at the 2010 National Games, was also trained by dad.” Vandana was playing at a school tournament in Roshnabad when Meerut-based coach Pradeep Chinyoti spotted her. “I encouraged her to move to Meerut and train. In the three years she spent here (2003 to 2006) before moving to Lucknow, I saw she had great speed. And she never missed practice,” he told TOI. “Her family wasn’t too happy she had moved away. Only her father backed her. Her hard work got her into the national juniors’ team.” She was at the Lucknow Sports College then. She worked her way up and made it to the national women’s team. Since then, she has played more than 200 international matches. When news of her feat broke on Saturday, her village burst into celebrations. Crackers went off, songs were sung and the village that once wanted her to stop playing was proud of her. “Father always said she would make Roshnabad famous,” Shekhar said. “When he died, she wanted to drop everything (she was training for the Olympics in Bengaluru then) and come home. But we told her what father would have — stay, focus and bring us a medal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hattrick-girl-played-with-tree-branches-back-home/articleshow/84930986.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Kochi||Kerala: Now, Pathanamthitta diocese offers sops for large families||KOTTAYAM: Close on the heels of Pala diocese of the Syro Malankara Catholic Church, the Pathanamthitta diocese of the Church has also announced sops for large families to encourage child birth. In a circular issued on Saturday, bishop Samuel Mar Irenios not only urged the members of the diocese but all people cutting across religions to encourage child birth. Those couples belonging to the diocese who have four or more children have been offered a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000. The diocese is also offering free medical service related to the birth from the fourth child onwards. The individuals from such families will be given priority for jobs in the institutions of the diocese. Children of these families will be given priority during admissions in the educational institutions of the diocese. The diocese has also announced the appointment of a priest and a nun as spiritual guides for such large families. The bishop will also spend time with such families once every year. It was also decided to start a pro-life ministry under the family apostolate of the diocese to prepare couples for having more children. The bishop has cited the low population of Pathanamthitta district as a grave issue in the circular. As a result of the negative population growth of the district the elders live isolated, rooms in houses remain vacant and the households have lost the presence of children. When 859 people stays on an average in a square kilometre in the state, its only 453 in Pathanamthitta, says the bishop in the circular. In such a situation one needs to encourage child birth, he says. He also criticised the population control measures of the government which resulted in the reduction of the humans resources of the district. Agricultural lands turned into forest as there are none to farm. Wild animals which are a nuisance to humans started moving freely in these lands. Pathanamthitta has turned into a district which is facing threat to its very existence due to its low population growth, said the bishop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-pthitta-diocese-offers-sops-for-large-families/articleshow/84930987.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Verdict in Raju Vs Jagan bail case on Aug 25||Hyderabad: Principal special judge BR Madhusudhan Rao of the CBI courts in Hyderabad on Friday reserved his judgment to August 25 in a petition filed by YSRC rebel MP K Raghu Rama Krishna Raju who was seeking the cancellation of bail given to AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy eight years ago in the quid pro quo case. Though CBI took time twice to convey its latest stand on the issue, it could not do so because it did not receive any latest instructions from its higher authorities in Delhi. Its counsel said this in the court on Friday while seeking some more time to convey their stand in the form of written submissions. S Sri Venkatesh, counsel for Raju, opposed the plea and said that they do not approve of the dodging ways of the probe agency. Raju’s principal contention in his plea is that Jagan through his decisions in administration is acting in a manner that is intimidatory and the witnesses cited by the prosecution may feel intimidated to depose against him in the quid pro quo case. “The appointment of several accused in the case in key positions of the government is one such step,” he said. Jagan’s counsel opposed the plea of Raju tooth and nail and described his bail cancellation plea as one that has no relevance to the case or to the facts. The counsel said that Raju started this campaign against Jagan only after the party sought a summary ouster of Raju from Parliament by way of disqualification because he became a tool in the machinations of YSRC’s rivals and was acting in a way that was inimical to the interests of the party. Jagan also branded Raju as an evader of huge loans and an accused in CBI cases related to defrauding banks. The judge too made it clear that he would not give any more time to the CBI to convey its stand. The CBI counsel took some time and reverted to the court saying that they have not received instructions. He said they would prefer to maintain a non-committal stand taken earlier, leaving it to the discretion and decision of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/verdict-in-raju-vs-jagan-bail-case-on-aug-25/articleshow/84932766.cms||---

Gujarat’s civil aviation department will construct an extra shed atop the existing water aerodrome operations centre on the riverfront to ensure smooth flying. The seaplane service is currently suspended and is expected to resume in September, said sources. Explaining the need for an observation post, an official said seaplane operations are based on Visual Flight Rules (VFR). It simply means that the aircraft operates in visual meteorological conditions, during clear weather. Clouds, precipitation, low visibility, and adverse weather are impediments, said sources. “The water aerodrome already has an aircraft monitoring station equipped with a weather monitor, beacon, landing-T and windsock. However, the height at which it is currently is not suitable to monitor bird movement. Therefore, at the same site, an elevated cabin is to come up to monitor aircraft movements. It will require an investment of Rs 10 lakh,” said the source. A tender was recently floated to invite bidders for the construction of the new station. The Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Systems (CNS) and related monitoring will continue to take place from the Air Traffic Controller at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad. Well-placed sources said a 2-acre plot has been identified to set up a water aerodrome at Shetrunjay dam near Palitana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/soon-seaplane-monitoring-station-on-riverfront/articleshow/84932768.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A public health expert said the seropositivity of 67% cannot be considered for the whole district because the sampling was done in only 32 clusters. Out of 960 samples lifted, 639 people showed antibodies in the laboratory tests. In all, 30 samples each were taken from the 32 clusters. Citing the prevalence of herd immunity, the collector said that incidence of third wave may not be a threat to the population. “If we increase vaccination, we will be safe. Out of the total targeted population of 22 lakh, we have covered 7 lakh either through first dose or second dose. When we cover two-third of the population, there will not be much problem with less requirement of oxygen and reduction of mortality,” said the collector. Trichy district has 8lakh people under-18. The district has covered 1.65 lakh people with two doses, he said. The health department will be giving more attention to areas where cases surfaced suddenly after a gap. Samples will also be lifted from areas where the public gather more. The public health department has been advised to lift 5,000 samples after a mild increase in cases in the past two days. The number of samples lifted so far was 4,000 to 4,200. The positivity rate touched 2.2 on Friday from 1.9 of Thursday. MGMGH dean Dr K Vanitha said the hospital will be ready with 2,000 beds to handle a third wave if it happens. Construction work on a pressure swing absorption oxygen plant that can produce 1,000 litres a minute has been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/third-wave-may-not-be-a-big-threat-says-trichy-collector/articleshow/84934860.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Capitalising on the surge in patronage, Air India Express has increased the number of services and private carrier IndiGo announced a new service between Trichy and Doha under the air transport bubble agreement. Air India Express, which was operating a weekly flight on this route on Friday, has planned to launch an additional service every Wednesday. Meanwhile, Indigo has announced a Trichy-Doha weekly service every Saturday. From a weekly service, the demand for Trichy-Doha flight service has increased to three services per week. The new services will start operating in the coming week.The demand for a flight service between Trichy and Doha has been high for the past few years as a significant number of people from the central districts of the state are travelling to Qatar for work. But, the connectivity between Trichy and Doha was materialised only after the lockdown in August 2020. According to aviation experts, following the travel relaxations, companies in Qatar have demanded workers to report for work, which has led to an increase in the number of people travelling from Trichy to Doha. The passenger and cargo statistics support the demand for a regular service in place of the temporary services.“Earlier, people were travelling to Chennai and Bengaluru for flight connectivity to Doha. Now, the surge in services to Qatar has proved the potential of Trichy airport. This will pave the way for regular commercial connectivity,” H Ubaidullah, an aviation analyst, said.Besides the passenger movement, the surge in services will also help the exporters ship more perishable goods to Qatar as each of the flight services may accommodate 3-4 MT of cargo. Since August 2020, around 58 services were operated between Trichy and Doha till July 2021. In the recent weeks, there was around 90-95% load in the service to Doha. “The temporary services are scheduled periodically but the movement of passengers has certainly improved compared to the passengers’ movement in April and May,” airport director S Dharmaraj told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/airlines-capitalise-on-qatar-easing-travel-curbs-increase-trichy-doha-services/articleshow/84934881.cms||Deepak Karthik

It was alleged that Qureshi (24) was gunned down at his shop on Linking Road at Rajan’s behest. However, CBI found no evidence to link him to the crime. This is among 71 cases CBI took over after Rajan was deported to India in 2015. The FIR was lodged at Khar police station in 1999 on the basis of the information furnished by witness Riyajuddin Shaikh against three unknown persons. After the probe, a chargesheet was filed against accused, Ramesh Rane, Sunil Shirke and Suhas alias Satish Adkar. During pendency of trial, Rane and Shirke were reported to be killed in a police encounter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-rajan-link-to-99-murder-cbi-report-in-mumbai/articleshow/84936350.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kochi||Is police mediation the right step forward?||Kochi: All Manasa wanted from Rakhil whom she met on Instagram was to leave her alone. When this request reached the Kannur police, a senior officer mediated to settle the issue. Nearly a month later, both the youngsters are now dead. This is not the first time that a jilted lover has turned killer after such a ‘settlement’. Police mediating in disputes involving love affairs is not uncommon in Kerala. A senior police officer involved claims that neither Manasa nor her father was interested in filing an FIR. Even if they had registered a case, it would have only speeded up the events that followed, he says. While some experts say that police should stick to the law and immediately register a case instead mediating in such issues, others say that what needs to be discussed is the ways on how improve the mediation process since the authority the police carry can be helpful. Senior psychiatrist Dr CJ John says that such meetings with police can become a good platform to direct those in need, towards a professional consultation. “A police officer involved in such a mediation should be able to identify if there is even a slight chance of one of the parties involved having a mental health issue. If so, then it is advisable that they catalyse some sort of a professional consultation. It doesn’t mean that all problems would be solved by that but it is very important that such an expert help is provided,” said Dr John. He said that that ideally policemen, at least at the Station House Officer level and above, should be given basic training on how to deal with such situations when they take up good Samaritan roles. Meanwhile, Advocate Sandhya Raju, managing director, Centre for Constitutional Rights, Research and Advocacy, said that it is high time that police encourage victims to register a case and proceed legally. “The role of police is to maintain law and order. Nobody can predict whether such a person is going to stalk the woman or not in the future. Deterring complainants is a common practice. Even in cases where FIRs are registered, there are instances of them being not properly followed up. The complainant requires protection and she is looking for help from the police. If they had registered an FIR in this particular case, what happened could have been avoided. Women are reluctant to go for legal remedies as the system is not favourable to them. This reluctance is being misused by many,” she said adding that a long term solution lies in sensitising boys at a young age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/is-police-mediation-the-right-step-forward/articleshow/84931011.cms||---

Vasna police filed the case against Pratik Pal on Friday, based on the complaint lodged by Jayesh Chavda, a resident of Jivraj Park. Chavda said he was a regular customer of the workshop, where he met Pal. Chavda said Pal told him that he sold and bought old vehicles. Pal, a resident of Vastral, urged Chavda to invest in his business and promised him good returns. As Chavda had become friendly with Pal, he agreed to invest. On January 6 last year, Chavda gave Pal Rs 1 lakh to buy vehicles. Pal then told Chavda he had earned a profit of Rs 20,000. In March, Chavda invested again and did so regularly. Chavda said Pal had assured him that he would return all the money in a week but did not keep his word. Chavda said that he had to recover, Rs13.05 lakh from Pal of which he had received only Rs 3.70 lakh in instalments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/used-car-biz-man-cheated-of-rs-9-lakh/articleshow/84932790.cms||---

On July 30, it was a happy reunion with his family which had given up hopes on Pullaiah as they were clueless about his whereabouts in the last four decades. Pullaiah has since turned a beggar and always been wandering going from one place to another. Three months ago, Pullaiah was found near a heap of garbage on Khammam-Warangal road by social worker Annam Srinivas of Annam Seva Foundation. He had an unkempt look with long hair and was loitering around. Pullaiah was taken to the home run by the foundation, given a bath and provided new set of clothes. “When we slowly started asking him about his background, he opened up and told us that he was a runaway,” Srinivas said. Having located the address of his sisters in old Nalgonda town going by the information he gave, Srinivas brought him to meet his family. Pullaiah was the only son of his parents and he has two sisters. Nalgonda DIG AV Ranganath lauded the efforts of Srinivas for taking the homeless man into his care and locating his family. Pullaiah was handed over to his sister Renuka and brother-in-law Kashaiah in the presence of Ranganath. “He left us several years ago. We are glad to have him back,” Renuka said. Pullaiah’s parents had died a few years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/40-yrs-on-runaway-nalgonda-man-reunited-with-family/articleshow/84932769.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Despite having a pass percentage of 99.23, the state was way behind other states. The state has a lion’s share in all competitive examinations like Olympiads, NTSE, IITs and NEET, but poor result has come as a shocker for many. Notably, none of the states has secured 100% results barring four Union territories–Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Pondicherry and Daman & Diu. Manyschools in the state which has claimed that gross mismatch in what they hadsent and what has appeared in the results. Over 20 parents, whose wards werestudying in Samrat Public School, Ajmer, have registered an official complaintthat their wards have got way fewer marks than they had received in schools. Mili Sharma, daughter of Kavish Sharma, got 68% in Class 12 Commerce. “My score in Class 11 was 75% and in Class 10 was 68%. My aggregate score is 68% which is way less than what the school has submitted,” said Sharma. This is not the case in isolation. Several schools are facing the complaint fromstudents over poor scores. VaidehiSingh of Maharaja Sawai Bhawani Singh School said that mismatch is obvious asthe board has cleared in the rules that they will moderate marks. “I doubt that board has made any mistake in results and they have followed the equal formula for all. Still, if we have any parents not satisfied with the result, we will call them and explain the process,” said Singh. Questioning the methodology, Damodar Goyal, a senior educationist, said that these are “machine made” results and not performance based. “The formula is completely unrealistic, irrelevant to the year and with so many brackets. Marks supplied by the school have been recalibrated by the computer and therefore in a number of cases either the marks have been shrinked or inflated to fit them in pre-programmed brackets,” said Goyal, who warned that these results will be remembered as historical. He demanded that CBSE should clarify those secured 100% marks before the public. Experts said that CBSE issued notices to 565 schools over awarding extra internal marks did damage to state schools. Most schools revised the marks under pressure from the CBSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cbse-assessment-formula-hits-raj-ranking-in-class-12/articleshow/84934878.cms||---
---||Nagpur||All stakeholders in new panel formed to regulate pathology labs||Nagpur: The Maharashtra government has finally formed a new committee to frame rules and regulations for pathology and microbiology laboratories in the state. The panel that was formed earlier in May-end this year had no representation of practising pathologists and microbiologists. After the fraternity created an uproar — TOI had reported the issue — the state dissolved that panel. The newly-formed panel has representation of all stakeholders, right from doctors to technicians, paramedics, consumers and officials. State commissioner (health services) and mission director, Commissionerate of Health Services, will be the statuary president of the 21-member panel. Deputy director of health services will be the member secretary. The panel will comprise 10 government officials and nine non-government members. Welcoming the state government’s decision, Dr Sandip Yadav, president of Maharashtra Association of Pathologists and Microbiolgists, said that the new panel has covered all stakeholders of the clinical laboratory related work. “I am looking forward to presenting pleas of practising pathologists pleas,” he said. Sandip Zade, president of medical laboratory Technologists Association which has its headquarters in Nagpur, will be a member from the city on this committee. “Technologists play the most important role in the laboratory work. It’s good that the state will be considering views from all of us,” he said. The non-government members of the panel include clinical biochemists, microbiologists, lab analyists and paramedics. Dr Shantaj Deshbhratar, general secretary of Maharashtra Union of Secular Teachers (MUST) will represent the general public in this panel. As far as practising doctors of modern medicines are concerned, three senior doctors from pathology department of three government medical colleges in state will be nominated on behalf of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). The 10-member committee formed earlier to formulate guidelines for control and regulation of medical laboratories in May this year neither had representation from pathologists nor a member of Maharashtra Medical Council. TOI has reported about this issue after practicing pathologists raised objections. On July 8, the state dissolved this panel. Since then, formation of a comprehensive all inclusive panel was pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-stakeholders-in-new-panel-formed-to-regulate-pathology-labs/articleshow/84932787.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Several trees collapsed onto rooftops damaging houses during the cyclone. Compensation for fallen trees is applicable only if any damage is caused to human life or property,due to the tree fall and such cases are taken up by the revenue department, CM Pramod Sawant said in a tabled reply during the monsoon assembly session. No relaxation was provided in the rules for transportation of fallen trees due to the cyclone. “A transit pass is mandatory for transportation of felled treesas per Goa Preservation of Trees Act, 1984,” the reply stated. Two people were killed, scores injured and over 200 houses destroyed as tropical Cyclone Tauktae passed by the Goa coast with fierce winds, heavy rain and gusts up to 100kmph, leaving a trail of devastation across the state.Much of the state was plunged into darkness. Many parts also lost mobile connectivity. The cyclone snapped telephone lines, disrupted flights and road and rail movement, as over 500 trees were uprooted, blocking access to major parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-600-trees-fell-to-tauktae/articleshow/84934901.cms||---

Passing the onus to the central government, Sharma said the government was in touch with the Indian Medical Council for Research (ICMR) and seeking their guidance for the same. “Even the central government has not opened schools run by them. The decision will be taken keeping the health of our children in mind,” said Sharma. Experts said unless most parents are inoculated and vaccines for children are introduced, the state should reopen schools in a staggered manner. The committee will reach out to schools and parents in the next round of meetings. The principal and the controller of Sawai Man Singh Medical College, Dr Sudhir Bhandari, echoed Sharma’s concern by stating that he did not see any reason to start schools for the next 2-3 months. Citing the surge in cases in Maharashtra and Kerala, he said, “Both the states are registering close to 20,000 cases daily. Our state was hit by the second wave almost one-and-a-half months after both the states had seen the peak in the second wave,” said Bhandari, who argued the state would have been more confident had the situation in Maharashtra and Kerala been better. Experts also said two indigenous vaccine candidates – Covaxin and Zydus Cadila — for children are expected to be in use by the end of August providing protection to the children and the adolescents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-timeframe-has-been-set-for-school-reopening/articleshow/84934883.cms||---

Sources said in the first phase under the non-fare revenue ideas scheme (NINFRIS), authorities have placed 50 foot-operated sanitiser dispensers in Trichy, Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai and Villupuram railway stations. A private hygiene products distributor had sponsored the dispensers and sanitisers. While the firm will directly maintain the dispensers in Trichy Junction, those in other junctions will be maintained by the railways. Ticket booking centres, canteen, subways and exit points were covered by the dispensers. “Apart from bearing the cost of the dispenser and sanitiser, the firm will pay a sum as per the norms for advertising their products as stickers in the dispenser. Railways is not investing any money on this initiative,” said a railway source. The model suggested by senior divisional commercial manager Dr I Senthil Kumar will operate on an agreement basis for a year, and may be extended based on the outcome, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-railway-division-ties-up-with-firm-to-install-sanitiser-dispensers/articleshow/84934903.cms||---

The survey was conducted in the national park and its buffer zone between July 22 and 25 this year. With this, the total reptile and amphibian fauna of Silent Valley has become 55 species each. Wayanad bush frog, leaping frogs, cricket frogs, Malabar vine snake and common house gecko were among the commonly observed species. An important observation recorded from the survey was the reduced presence of torrent frogs (dancing frogs) of the genus Micrixalus. Even in parts of Kerala like Wayanad their numbers seem to have reduced post the 2018 and 2019 floods. Of the species recorded in the survey, 14 amphibian species including Ponmudi bush frog belong to the international union for conservation of nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species. The purple frog, which has potential to be the state amphibian of Kerala, was recorded from many parts of the Silent Valley. . These animals are great biological indicators that can shed light into the changing climate and environment. The survey was conducted by Silent Valley Division in association with the NGO Aranyakam Nature Foundation. Several volunteers from Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Kerala Forest Research Institute, Calicut University and Forestry College participated in the survey. The survey team comprises Wildlife Warden (Silent Valley division) Narendra Nath Veluri, chairman of Aranyakam Nature Foundation Dr P S Easa and assistant wildlife wardens V Ajayaghosh and A Ashalatha, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/14-endangered-amphibian-species-found-in-silent-valley/articleshow/84931031.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa industry shut, but mining engineering students shine from Rajasthan to Australia||PANAJI: The mining engineering programme at Goa Engineering College (GEC) may have appeared to hit a roadblock two years ago, when admissions had to be stopped due to a dip in enrolments following the Supreme Court mandated shutdown of local mining operations. This, however, this did not deter students who were already pursuing the programme. Many graduates of the course — the only one of its kind in Goa — have managed to make a mark in the industry within India and abroad in a short time. What’s more, the programme has helped contribute many women to a profession that is traditionally viewed as male-dominated. Hailing from Valpoi, Sattari, Yogeshwari Rane stands out. An alumna of the 2015 batch of GEC’s mining engineering programme, Rane has become the first female in the Indian mining industry to have obtained a first class mines manager competency certificate (FCMMCC) in the unrestricted category. Having cleared the national-level exam conducted by the directorate general of mines safety, Dhanbad, she now works as the head of planning and development at Vedanta’s mine in Kayad, Rajasthan, GEC officials said. But Rane isn’t an exception. Aruna Sankatala from Vasco, now mines manager at Tata Steel, has cleared the FCMMCC exam in restricted category, joining an elite group of women in the mining industry. The list of such achievers doesn’t end there. Another student, Ridhi Gaunker, functions as senior mining engineer at Vedanta’s mining operations department in Goa, while Priya Pandey — who went on to pursue an MTech in mining engineering from the prestigious IIT, Dhanbad — has now received her appointment order from Australian Mines as mining engineer. “The students’ achievements have been outstanding,” said GEC principal, Rajesh B Lohani. Incidentally, women in India were permitted to work in underground mines only from 2019 following a landmark decision by the central government. The four-year mining engineering degree programme was introduced at GEC from 2011-12. The department was started as a collaboration between the state government and Sesa Goa. It was the first public private partnership (PPP) model in the education sector in Goa, forged under the director of technical education, Vivek Kamat. “In a course that is conventionally considered suitable for boys, many girls took admissions, graduated with flying colours and also assumed leadership roles in the mining industry,” head of the department Ulhas Sawaiker, said. It is heartening to see around 10 girls passing out from the mining department in last six years, faculty members said. Many male graduates from the programme at GEC too have cleared the FCMMCC. Proposal to restart admission to mining course:A proposal before the state government has sought revival of the mining engineering programme at Goa College of Engineering (GEC), Farmagudi, admissions to which had been suspended over two years ago. Officials now feel that as the mining industry everywhere is picking up, the time is ripe to resume admissions to the programme at GEC again. “The department of mining engineering has state-of-the-art infrastructure, laboratory facilities and a well-qualified faculty. A proposal has been submitted to the government to restart the admissions to the course as students may avail the financial assistance provided by the government for technical education. There may be few seats available under the sponsorship category from mining companies,” GEC officials said. The recent auctioning of the coal blocks and iron deposits have increased the chances of high growth in the mining sector, including employability. Besides this, the state is in the process of forming a mining corporation to allow revival of iron ore mining activities in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/local-industry-shut-but-mining-engg-students-shine-from-raj-to-oz/articleshow/84934905.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

She underwent a posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), a surgery designed to prevent the motion at the targeted segment of the spine.Orla (name changed) from Atlanta, who is a jewellery designer, was admitted to SMS Hospital 21 days ago with unbearable back and leg pain (sciatica), which she had been suffering for two long years. SMS Hospital neurosurgeons examined her and she underwent a surgery on July 26. She is now on the recovery path and doctors say she would be discharged on Sunday. “I have been coming to India for quite a few years as a jewellery designer. I had Covid during my stay here and recovered. I had problems with my back and sought help from SMS doctors,” she said, adding that she was just amazed with the facilities and care that she received. She added that she had consulted doctors of other hospitals but SMS doctors diagnosed her problem of back pain, which she had been facing for two years.“She opted for SMS Hospital for the elective surgery. It is the result of the state-of-the-art infrastructure we are developing with world class facilities for catering medical tourism,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. SMS Medical College informed the US embassy about her getting admitted to the hospital for surgery. “Earlier too, foreign nationals were brought to the hospital but in emergency situations. Probably, it is the first such case in which an American national got admitted for a planned or elective surgery,” said Dr Rajesh Sharma, superintendent, SMS Hospital. Before getting admitted to SMS Hospital, Orla had consulted some other private facilities. “When we examined her, we found that she had problem called L 4-L 5 spondylolisthesis, for which spine surgery was advised,” said Dr Rashim Kataria, professor (neurosurgery) SMS Hospital, who performed the surgery, under the supervision of Dr Devendra Purohit, head of the department (neurosurgery). The cost of the operation at SMS Hospital was around Rs 40,000 to 50,000, including the cost of the implant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/us-citizen-undergoes-spinal-surgery-in-sms-hosp/articleshow/84934902.cms||---

We have no choice,” says Jeetendra Sonawne in angst. A chef in a premium hotel of the city, his salary these days ranges from Rs2,500 to Rs4,000 a month. Before the lockdown, it was Rs18,000 and was enough to make two ends meet, he says. Jeetendra and his other colleagues in the hotel now wait for the government to ease Covid restrictions. They hope allowing hotels to operate for longer hours may help getting them their old wages back. Sources in the hospitality business say bigger hotels are the worst hit. Their losses are more due to the higher scale of operations. The staff TOI talked to had their moderate wages further cut down, now threatening their survival. Many in their 40s, little they had saved for a rainy day. With the pandemic bringing a drastic cut in their pay, many have dipped into their provident fund (PF) or pawned gold even for small needs. “Once I withdrew Rs10,000 from the PF account and later took Rs5,000. There was no other option, I had to pay the pending rent,” says Jeetendra. Originally from Bhusawal, Jeetendra has been living in Nagpur for the last 10 years working in the same hotel. Roshan Salve, Jeetendra’s colleague in the kitchen, says there are hardly any guests these days. Less work has reduced the number of working days also. The wages are paid for the days worked. Roshan has two children and his wife does not work. “I ended up withdrawing Rs70,000 last year. There was a medical emergency. There is no other saving,” he said. Ataullah Shaikh used to get a little over Rs12,000 in the hotel, now reduced to less than half. Shaikh had also applied for a withdrawal from the PF account, but the case could not be processed as his Aadhaar number was not updated in the records. Shaikh has put his kid in a government school from a private institute earlier. “My wife makes soft toys and also works as casual worker sometimes. This helps us manage the show,” he says. Shaikh’s colleague Dhananjay Kanfade said his family is surviving on loans secured against gold. His parents in the village are also sending money to meet the expenses. A worker in a resto lounge, requesting not to be named, said, “I used to live in a one bedroom flat. Unable to pay the rent, we have now shifted to a single room as paying guest.” The 28-year-old lives with his wife. Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association, said, “Smaller hotels can break-even with 25% occupancy. A large premium hotel needs at least 70%. Occupancy should come from conference halls and banquets too. Due to the scale of operations, losses are also massive, leading fund crunch.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hotel-staff-pushed-to-the-edge-by-covid-lockdown/articleshow/84932829.cms||Shishir Arya

The department is undertaking a third-party inspection of these structures—whether they exist or have been put to other use. The agency has also been asked to geo-tag toilets of homes of beneficiaries using a special mobile application along with their Aadhaar card details. Describing the process, senior state officials said the appointed agency will be asked to measure each toilet block constructed to see if they conform to standards. A senior official told TOI that the central Swachch Bharat Mission (SBM) had sought similar audit reports from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh over issues of missing subsidized toilets, half-constructed and neglected toilets, lack of water in toilets, and open defecation “A critical aspect of this audit is that the agency has to see whether these toilets in cities and towns have water connections,” adds the official. The mobile application has been developed to upload photographs of constructed toilets and for geo-tagging purposes. “The data will be accessed in real time over a portal and will be updated once a month,” adds the state UD official. On whether the data could be accessed by the public, the official confirmed that there is no such plan to put the data in the public domain. “The data is solely for internal audit purposes. The government will have to take a call on whether it wants this data to be public,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/toilet-ek-audit-katha/articleshow/84932825.cms||---

Elaborating on the development, Jaipur Airport director J S Balhara said, "during these two months, there will be no difference in the operations as it is the observation period. Once the group takes over in October, they will bring forth the changes. We have already undertaken major infrastructure projects at the airport during the last few years which enable Jaipur airport to better handle the increasing number of passengers."

FDA Nagpur now intends to step up sampling of the available drugs, especially those of the secondary line of treatment for Covid, with the racketeers eyeing gains during the anticipated forthcoming third wave. The department is also set to step up it’s vigilance on the availability of suspicious brands of such drugs linked to Covid treatment. Last week, the state FDA laboratory had declared the test results of an array of different types of drugs, ranging from immunity boosters like Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C), chewable Zinc tablets, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic combination Acenez SP, Prednisolone Sodium phosphate with steroidal functions, which were used earlier used exhaustively during Covid phase. The findings have led to major concern among the rank and file of FDA which now aims to increase vigilance actions. Asst commissioner (in-charge), drugs, PM Ballal said unscrupulous manufacturers of drugs and medicines may look for an opportunity. “Sales and purchases must be accompanied with bills and corresponding records of the transactions mentioning details as per the law,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/spurious-immunity-boosters-covid-drugs-under-fda-eye/articleshow/84932864.cms||Soumitra Bose

In the end, however, it turned out to be the second wettest after July 2019. It was one prolonged spell that produced 122% more rain than the normal of 471mm. But the monsoon graph dipped drastically during the other half, as the rest of the 17 days produced only 233.5mm of rain. The extremely heavy rainfall for a fortnight that left a scar in the memories of flood victims is part of climate change dynamics, meteorologists say . “Erratic rainfall with prolonged active or break spells are bad for agriculture, drinking water and water harvesting systems,” meteorologist M R Ramesh Kumar said. On Saturday, the monthly total rain touched 1,280.8mm, as compared to 1315.4mm in July 2019, while 1,068.9mm rain is normal for July. In July 2013, the peak month of the season had produced a record 1,387.8mm rainfall. Eighty-two percent of the average rainfall in July was from July 10-23. Valpoi recorded the highest 24-hour rainfall of 296mm as per available data of the past 12 years. Pernem recorded 294mm in July 2012,” IMD scientist Rahul M, said. Overall, the monsoon has witnessed a 1% deficit across India, but Goa had an excess of 14% till July 31. The systems which bring copious rainfall into central and northern India were absent, Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/too-much-yet-too-little-of-july-rain-reflects-climate-change-dynamics/articleshow/84934942.cms||Paul Fernandes

The release from Panshet dam has been started for power generation. The dam will release water in the river if the inflow of water in the reservoir goes up,” said Popat Shelar, sub-divisional engineer in the irrigation department. Data released by the irrigation department showed that the catchments of all the four dams, Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar, recorded a drop in the rainfall on Saturday. In fact, Khadakwasla did not record any rainfall throughout the day, while Panshet and Varasgaon received 5mm and 7mm rainfall, respectively, on Saturday.

The comment comes barely a year after Goa police stated that the infamous Santa Cruz shootout was the fallout of a rivalry between two gangs — Boom Boom, led by Imran Bepari, and Bang Bang, led by Zenito Cardozo — trying to establish their supremacy over each other. Last June, Santa Cruz witnessed a shootout in a battle between the Boom Boom and Bang Bang gangs“No incident has been reported of criminal gangs operating in Goa, and no such case has been reported so far,” Sawant said in a written reply to the legislative assembly. The gangwar claims were made by Old Goa police in a reply filed before the principal district and sessions court, Panaji, to oppose an anticipatory bail application filed by Cardozo. Sawant said that as a preventive measure, round-the clock patrolling is maintained by Goa police through PCR vans, highway patrol vans, motorcycles, foot patrolling, etc. Similarly, informants too share information of such crimes and criminals so as to initiate appropriate action against such criminals, he said. The chief minister said that there is no case registered at any police station against organised crimes. “No such type of FIR has been reported,” he said. When asked for details of the number of gangsters arrested with their names, addresses, and type of crime committed, apart from the number of weapons confiscated from them and action initiated against them, Sawant said, “No such case has been reported by Goa police in the past 5 years”. Replying to a question with regards to areawise details of the number of citizens attacked/looted by gangsters in shootings over the past five years, the chief minister again said, “No such incident has been reported by Goa police in the past five years.” The chief minister said that intelligence is collected and all staff — especially those deployed at border checkposts — have been directed to keep strict vigil on the inflow of illegal weapons to the state, and if anyone is found with illegal weapons, the same must be attached immediately and action initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-criminal-gangs-operating-in-state-claims-cm-in-house/articleshow/84934970.cms||Murari Shetye

On July 27, TOI had highlighted how the number of active cases in Beed district had again increased after reaching a record low after May 25. Ashti, Patoda, Shirur and Georai talukas are currently the major hotspots. The authorities believe that public movement from these talukas to the neighbouring district is responsible for the fresh surge. Acting Beed district collector Tushar Thombare said all roads — including national, state and district highways — connecting the four talukas to Ahmednagar would have checkpoints at the border points. “Teams comprising personnel from the police department, district administration, health department and Zilla Parishad have been asked to man these checkpoints round the clock with focus on Covid testing of travelers using rapid-antigen testing. Any violation of the orders would attract punishment under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, among other legislations,” he said. Beed district had 1,705 active Covid cases on Friday — the highest among eight districts of Marathwada. It reported 198 new cases by Saturday afternoon. Beed district guardian minister Dhananjay Munde had held a review meeting on Friday and had sought tough measures to reduce the district’s Covid positivity rate.

---||Nagpur||NMC lays off 700 HCWs from Covid work||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Saturday relieved 700 doctors, nurses, technicians and other healthcare workers (HCW) engaged in Covid work. The decision comes on a day when the city registered double digit positive cases after 13 days, on Saturday. This is likely to affect vaccination and testing. The civic body had recruited 1,127 HCWs — 550 eight months ago and 577 in April specially for Covid work. There were 14 general physicians, anaesthetics, 89 MBBS doctors, 184 Ayush doctors, 614 nurses, 26 pharmacists, 86 technicians, 97 ward boys, 12 store offices and three hospital managers. The total salaries per month was around Rs 3 crore. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI that the Central government used to bear the cost under the National Health Mission (NHM). “These HCW were engaged in Covid hospitals of NMC, GMCH, IGGMCH, Shalinitai Meghe Hospital, testing centres, vaccination etc. The government directed us to relieve the staff as cases are very less. Accordingly, we relieved the staff on Friday and Saturday,” he said. Dr Chilkar added that the around 400 who have been retained are being paid on an everyday basis. “Around 500 staff is working in vaccination including 400 engaged on temporary basis for pandemic under NHM. We have asked them to continue work on daily wage basis,” he said. Some of these staff had gone on a flash strike a few days ago protesting against daily wage system. The NMC is having its own 600 HCWs most of who are paid by the Centre under National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). Dr Chilkar said the NMC will do its best to avoid any impact on vaccination, testing and in Covid Hospitals. “Government has sought details staff required for third wave. Therefore, there is nothing to worry after relieved around 700 staff,” he said. When NMC recruited staff during the first wave, many doctors, nurses and other staff had refused to work for a specific time period. Meanwhile, on Saturday, 17 persons tested positive from 6,542 tests in the city. The number was the highest in a day after 18 days. Seven cases were from the rural. The 24 district recorded was the highest in a day after 21 days. 25 cases were on July 10. District has record no deaths for the last four days.

---||Goa||Goa government extends curfew till August 9, CM Pramod Sawant mulls further ease in curbs||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday said that the state government has decided to extend the curfew by another week till August 9 to control the spread of Covid-19. “We will see if we can give some more relaxation to the curfew. Orders will be issue by the authorities,” Sawant told TOI. Sawant said that the positivity rate has declined by to 1.92%. In the past couple of days, the number of Covid cases reported in the state is between 90 to 150. The chief minister had said that academic institutions will be permitted to resume classroom teaching only after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issues specific guidelines and after consulting with the Centre. The state government has sought permission from the Centre to give teaching and non-teaching staff the second vaccine dose after a gap of 30 days. Last Sunday, the state government had extended the curfew till 7am on August 2 with one additional relaxation — permitting schools to conduct exams. However, the state government has still not permitted recommencing physical classes. As per the existing curfew order, casinos, auditoriums, community halls or similar places, river cruises, water parks, entertainment parks, spas, massage parlours, cinema halls, theatres, multiplexes and entertainment zones within shopping malls are closed. During the last curfew extension on July 11, as part of the relaxations, the government had allowed gyms and swimming pools to open with 50% capacity from July 12. Indoor and outdoor sports complexes were also allowed to operate, but without spectators. On June 20, the state government allowed the opening of shops in shopping malls and fish markets. On June 12, the state had allowed panchayat and municipal markets to open. From June 14, the state government started slowly relaxing restrictions and allowing economic activities to restart in the state. Curfew was first imposed on May 9 after the state witnessed a surge of Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-extends-curfew-till-aug-9-cm-mulls-further-ease-in-curbs/articleshow/84935083.cms||---

---||Delhi||CBSE keeps truncated syllabi, but splits it; experts don’t approve step||NEW DELHI: The batch of students that will appear for the board exams next year will have the same syllabus that was truncated last year. This time, CBSE has also divided it into two terms as per the new assessment policy. However, teachers have pointed out issues in the division for some subjects like maths. Many schools have also already covered topics that are now part of the second term. For the 2022 board exams, the first term will end in November-December and the other in March- April. There will also be three periodic tests, student enrichment, portfolio and practical work, speaking-listening activities along with projects. Pointing out anomalies in the syllabus division, Keshav Agarwal, president of Educators Society, said, “For Class XI mathematics, calculus has been placed in term 1, which includes trigonometric limits, whereas trigonometry has been included in the second term. Trigonometric limits cannot be taught without teaching trigonometry. It is like teaching a child the word Apple without introducing the English alphabet.” Educators Society is an association of around 300 coaching classes. Agarwal said that most of the inverse trigonometry had been deleted from Class XII maths syllabus, but questions pertaining to differentiation and integration had been retained. For that, students need to learn about inverse trigonometry. “Also in three-dimensional geometry, they have deleted angles between planes, but there are many questions that require this concept and the student has to be ultimately taught the topic,” he added. While for Class XII Economics, two big chapters — national income and determination of income — have been designated for term 2. A private school teacher said, “The second term is shorter and national income requires a lot of practice. It would have been better to include the topic in the second term.” For humanities subjects, teachers said the division was not an issue. “A chapter I have already taught is now part of the second term. But it will be easier to complete the syllabus for the shorter term now,” said Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School who teaches political science. For English, Joshi said that the division had been done appropriately for both classes X and XII.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbse-keeps-truncated-syllabi-but-splits-it-experts-dont-approve-step/articleshow/84935112.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Pune||Maharashtra reports its first Zika virus case, 50-year-old Belsar village woman tests positive||PUNE: Maharashtra officially confirmed its first Zika virus case — a mosquito-borne viral infection — on Saturday. The blood sample of a 50-year-old woman, a resident of Belsar village (Purandar taluka) in Pune district, tested positive for Zika-chikungunya co-infection at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), a premier virus research laboratory, here late on Friday. Her blood sample was drawn as a part of the routine surveillance to rule out mosquito-borne illnesses after some of the villagers showed dengue/chikungunya-like symptoms in Belsar and Parinche villages in Purandar taluka from early July. Zika virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito, mainly Aedes aegypti, which is also the vector for dengue and chikungunya. After the detection of the first Zika virus case in Maharashtra, the state surveillance machinery has intensified the fever surveillance in seven other surrounding villages, including Belsar (Purandar), where the woman resides with her family members, to contain the disease. “The woman is a homemaker with no travel history. She had onset of symptoms on July 14. The symptoms included fever, joint pain, headache, and eye and body pain. She has completely recovered and has no symptoms now. None of her family members have any symptoms either,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said. The ICMR-NIV's preliminary investigations suggested a mixed outbreak of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika with the dominance of chikungunya in Belsar village. “Human Zika virus case has been reported for the first time from Maharashtra. The results warrant in-depth investigations for Zika virus in this region,” Priya Abraham, director, ICMR-NIV, stated in her preliminary Zika investigation report. The virus detection has once again reinforced the importance of fever surveillance to pick up viral diseases. “A team of ICMR-NIV visited Belsare and Parinche villages on July 27-29 after blood samples of three villagers, drawn as a part of the fever surveillance, tested positive for chikungunya on July 16,” Awate said. The team collected blood samples of another 51 villagers against suspicion of chikungunya. The samples were tested for chikungunya, dengue and Zika virus using the real-time RTPCR test at the ICMR-NIV. “Among the 41 of the 51 samples for which all results are available, the blood samples from 25 cases were positive for chikungunya. Three were positive for dengue and one sample was positive for the Zika as well as chikungunya,” the ICMR-NIV report stated. ICMR-NIV entomology team visited Belsar, Shivri, Supe (Khurd) and Mashiras to detect the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in and around the patients’ houses. Vector studies revealed that all the visited areas were positive for the presence of Aedes aegypti larvae. The vector breeding was mainly encountered in plastic drums. All the positive containers (having larvae of Aedes aegypti) were outside the houses. “Besides, traders from Kerala come to these villages to purchase pomegranate regularly. Farmers also send their harvest or fruits to Kerala markets. We suspect that (the Zika virus) might have come from there. Our investigation is still on,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the Zilla Parishad. Kerala started reporting cases of Zika virus from early July this year. The southern state has registered 61 Zika cases this year, so far. The first case of the Zika virus was reported in India in 2017 in Gujarat and was later found in Tamil Nadu. Large outbreaks occurred in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in late 2018. Dhiraj Jagatap, the deputy sarpanch of Belsar village, said, “The number of fever patients in the village has increased in the last two weeks. Every year, we report a sizable number of dengue and chikungunya cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-reports-its-first-zika-virus-case-50-yr-old-belsar-village-woman-tests-positive/articleshow/84936408.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Sawant’s move to shift part of the blame for the Benaulim gangrape onto the parents of the survivor, and the promise of a mere Rs 2 lakh compensation for flood damaged homes indicates that the government does not understand people’s plight, AAP said. “Health minister Vishwajeet Rane, has tried to be one up on the chief minister on insensitive statements by saying that no Goans died due to oxygen shortage,” AAP Goa convenor Rahul Mhambre said. AAP said that Rane’s claim was the “most shocking” and an insult to those who died of Covid-19. Mhambre said that despite three rape cases being registered over the last three days, the chief minister did not announce a single step to make women feel more confident and comfortable in Goa. “He has continuously been hiding behind his statement on detection, but the fact of the matter is what preventive measures have been put in place to protect Goan women, apart from sexist statements like asking women to stay indoors?” Mhambre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-is-out-of-sync-with-reality-sorrows-of-goans-aap/articleshow/84935138.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The complainant, mother of 8, had told cops that the man had attacked the child in June 2020 and she had come home crying. However, in court she denied giving such a statement to the police. The man had claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case as the child’s family wanted to grab his flat. His plea for bail was earlier rejected by the court. “..Advocate for the accused rightly submits that there is no direct evidence at all against the accused from the mouth of complainant (mother) and the girl. There is no single mark of fresh injury or fresh tear on the body of victim. The medical officer has agreed that there is no evidence of physical assault on the body of victim,” the special POCSO Act court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-80-year-old-acquitted-in-sexual-assault-case/articleshow/84936419.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||People awaiting 1st dose also get priority in Aurangabad city||Aurangabad The local civic body has modified its daily vaccination plan with people waiting for the first dose also getting vaccinated on a priority along with the beneficiaries waiting for the second dose. As per the latest practice, each vaccination site has been asked to administer both doses through on-spot registration, unlike in the past when the first dose was delivered only on a token basis after mandatory online registration. On July 24, TOI carried a report quoting experts, who stressed on the need to also prioritize giving the first dose of vaccine even during the dearth of vaccine supply.Dr Neeta Padalkar, the health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), on Saturday said vaccination involving the first dose can lead towards the target of achieving maximum possible herd immunity. “We are witnessing satisfactory response from citizens for both the doses. We aim to give the vaccine to 100% of population using a single dose at least in a quick period,” she said. As per official data, the municipal limits of Aurangabad have witnessed a total of 5.8 lakh vaccinations till Friday, including 1.69 lakh citizens, who have received both doses. Dr Santosh Ranjalkar, the president of the Aurangabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said the first dose of Covid vaccine should continue to get priority in future too. “Having some antibodies present in the body due to the first dose is always better when the state government is mulling to lift almost all Covid-related restrictions,” he said.Meanwhile, the supply of vaccines was by and large regular in Aurangabad in the past 48-hours as compared to earlier acute shortage of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/people-awaiting-1st-dose-also-get-priority-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/84929166.cms||---
---||Goa||Ensure no sale deeds for enemy properties: Govt||Panaji: In a bid to protect enemy properties in Goa, the state government has directed the collectors of both districts to ensure that no sale deed or conveyance deed is registered for such holdings. Spread over five talukas, the estimated value of the 229 enemy properties in Goa is Rs 100 crore. “Directions are issued to both the collectors regarding erection of a notice board in all properties identified as enemy property, and also to ensure that no sale deed or any kind of conveyance deed is registered with regard to properties under the custodian of enemy property,” chief minister Pramod Sawant, said. Enemy properties are those whose survey numbers are registered in the names of Goans who migrated to Pakistan decades ago. After these Goans accepted Pakistani citizenship and India declared Pakistan an enemy state around 1965, their properties were declared enemy properties. On September 11, 1965, a central government notification stated that all immoveable properties in India belonging to, or held, or managed on behalf of Pakistani nationals, were to be treated as enemy properties, and that control over them was to be vested in the custodian of enemy property. Matters pertaining to enemy property are dealt with under the Enemy Property Act, 1968, and Enemy Property Rules, 2015. Legal experts say there should be a mechanism in place for citizens who have changed their nationality in order to claim their property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ensure-no-sale-deeds-for-enemy-properties-govt/articleshow/84935111.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Nagpur||Covid down, NMC plans new projects, cost cuts, completing works||Nagpur: With Covid-19 cases plummeting, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is planning new development projects, measures to reduce expenditure and clear pending works. The civic body has planned construction of 650 flats for economically weaker section (EWS) at a cost of just Rs8-9 lakh, along with subsidy and loan under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Covid cases have been below 30 since the beginning of the month, and in single digits in last eight days. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “We did not get time to look into new development projects or expedite pending works etc while containing Covid-19 cases, preventing deaths and vaccinating more and more people on priority. Fortunately, we are able to get back to routine works from beginning of May. Various new projects have been planned and ongoing works expedited.” Radhakrishnan said, “We planned flat scheme for EWS under PMAY at Wanjara. We plan to make available 30 sq m flat at Rs8-9 lakh. In private sector, this would cost Rs13-15 lakh.” The civic chief added a meeting has been held with officials of various banks for financial closure. “We will submit a proposal to the government seeking subsidy of Rs2.5 lakh. Beneficiary will have to bear Rs1.5-2.5 lakh. Remaining Rs4 lakh will be in the form of a loan. This is very crucial for success of the project. We will get beneficiaries and it will be convenient for them if we facilitate loan before beginning construction. Also, NMC will be able to complete construction fast with these funds.” Though the scheme was implemented by the government in 2014, NMC is yet to develop a single scheme. If successful, NMC’s scheme will be the cheapest among those by government agencies. Unable to cut costs, the civic chief and his team are now concentrating on new budget, where they plan to prevent creation of new liabilities. “Budgetary provision is made for each and every work in respective heads. There is a head known as ‘addutt’ in budget. Works cannot be planned above budgetary provision in the head. There was a system of showing disbursement from ‘addutt’ to works if no money is left in respective head. This was creating liability and fuelling financial crisis. I made it mandatory to propose works as per money available in respective head. I also ensured naming of works for amount available in ‘addutt’. These measures are likely to improve NMC’s finances,” he said. NMC has been able to clear hurdles and restart construction of Metro Mall. The civic body started negotiations with private agencies and clear long pending disputes related to advertisement hoardings, which is likely to generate some revenue. NMC also started tendering process for appointing an agency for conducting survey to increase revenue from advertisements. The process of preparing new development plan of the city has also been expedited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-down-nmc-plans-new-projects-cost-cuts-completing-works/articleshow/84933171.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The young wrestler, Vaishnavi Thube, was riding a scooter and her sister-in-law, a civil engineer, was riding pillion when the incident occurred. The police are yet to locate rhe SUV (sports utility vehicle) driver, a businessman from Hadapsar. Thube, also a judoka preparing for competitive examinations, told TOI on Saturday, “My sister-in-law, Pranjal Chattar, and I were going to a competitive examination coaching class in Swargate. The SUV came from the rear and when its driver tried to overtake our scooter, the vehicle grazed the left leg of my sister-in-law. When I told the SUV driver to drive slowly, he abused me. When the SUV stopped at the traffic signal at Fatimanagar Chowk, I asked him why he misbehaved with me.” Thube said, “The SUV driver alighted from the vehicle with a stick and hit me five to six times with it before I could react. My left forearm got fractured and my shoulder got dislocated.” The wrestler said, “The driver’s wife also misbehaved with me and my sister-in-law for intervening in the dispute. They were in the process of speeding away, but I stopped the SUV and raised an alarm for help. I clicked his photo and that of his wife and his vehicle. The incident threw vehicular traffic out of gear and passers-by caught hold of the SUV driver. We allowed him to go after he pleaded that he had to hospitalise his ailing son.” She said, “There was severe pain in my left hand and shoulder a few minutes later. I rushed to a nearby private hospital. The doctor told me after the examination that my forearm had fractured, and my shoulder was dislocated. After seeking treatment, I visited the Bhairobanala police chowki and registered an FIR against the SUV driver and his wife.” Thube said, “I had addressed the SUV driver as ‘uncle’, but he abused me. We appealed to him to be polite and refrain from humiliating women in a public place. But he told us it makes no difference to him if a person is male or female. We asked him to tender an apology, but he refused. Had he apologised, I would not have registered the complaint against him,” she said. Senior inspector Deepak Lagad from the Wanowrie police said, “The SUV driver’s acts of misbehaving with a woman and brutally attacking her with a stick were wrong. We have got his name and address. He would be arrested, and his vehicle would be seized.” Sub-inspector Bhushan Potwade, who is investigating the case, said, “A police team visited the driver’s residence at Hadapsar, but he was not found. We have booked the driver and his wife on the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/attacked-by-suv-driver-woman-wrestler-suffers-forearm-fracture/articleshow/84936416.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Lagad was interviewed by Joe Grabowski of the ‘National Geographic Explorer’, Canada, in a virtual event organised by the International Rangers Foundation. In an interview with TOI’s Rahul Gayakwad, Lagad talked about her journey as a forester and her direct experiences with leopards.“Representing my nation on an international platform was a proud moment. I always wanted to crack the competitive exams and even tried for two years — but I could not succeed. I wrote the forest exam and got selected. Now, after all my forest-related experiences, I feel I was meant for this job. It has become my passion,” she said.“This year, in June, I completed three years as a range forest officer. They say the first experience is always special. Mine was of a leopard rescue just seven days after I joined as the RFO. In the month of June, we got a call about a leopard caught in a wire trap in the hilly area of Shelarwadi village in Ratnagiri. When I visited the place along with my team, it was already dark. Taking the rescue cage to the top of the hill while it was raining heavily was almost impossible. Therefore, our team stayed there the entire night keeping an eye on the situation. In the morning, the team took the cage to the spot and we were able to catch the animal.”She was also once attacked by a leopard. “On May 29, 2019, we received a call that a cashew collecting woman had been attacked by a leopard in the Niwali village of Ratnagiri. The villagers said the leopard was on a tree some 500m away. We were, however, unaware of the leopard’s movement prior to that. While carrying out the recce on foot, I was leading. Suddenly, the leopard pounced on me from the bush. The animal’s canines sank into my right thigh, and the claws caught my left leg. Other foresters helped shoo away the leopard and I was saved. The leopard was caught later. I, meanwhile, was under treatment for one-and-a-half months. So far, I have rescued 27 leopards. Later in 2020, I received the Van Durga award from the Exploring Womanhood foundation for my work as an RFO.”Talking about increasing human-animal conflicts, Lagad said said, “Humans know their boundaries, but animals don’t. I feel educating schoolchildren creates a good impact. If we properly educate the villagers, only then can sustainable development take place and man-animal conflicts can be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/van-durga-awardee-priyanka-lagad-shares-her-experiences-on-world-rangers-day/articleshow/84929173.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Water supply to Khobrawaddo and Sauntavaddo wards in Calangute, popularly known as Baga, had been disrupted after the public works department (PWD) water pipeline and other private connecting-pipes were broken after the road sunk at various places along the popular Baga road due to the recent heavy rain. Water supply was disrupted completely for nearly two weeks because of the broken pipes. However, water supply in some areas near the Ronil-Tito’s lane junction is yet to be restored. Agitated locals and activists took to social media to highlight what they termed as shoddy work on the sewerage pipeline network, the sinking roads and the breakdown in water supply. Calangute constituency forum (CCF) president Premanand Divkar said that even though water supply has been restored, water is available only on alternate days. “The pipeline will break again because of the shoddy work on the sewerage network. This problem has been going on for the past four years and will continue for some more years because the sewerage pipeline was laid without giving proper thought. The chambers were not built as per specifications, which is why they’re sinking and when they sink, the sewerage pipeline starts sinking and the mud all around sinks which in turn breaks the water pipes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/water-supply-partially-restored-in-baga-sarpanch/articleshow/84935165.cms||---

Super chlorination is doubling the chlorination process in wells in the villages, which are used for drinking water. Water quality inspector Suresh Jadhav of the ZP said under the guidance of ZP CEO Leena Bansod and deputy CEO Ishadin Shelkande, they have been undertaking various programmes in the rural areas to ensure people get safe and clean drinking water.As part of this, more than three thousand water tanks in ZP schools, ashram shalas, Anangawadis and other water tanks, apart from hand-pumps in villages were cleaned recently. The residents have been informed about the importance of drinking clean water. This exercise of cleaning water tanks has been taken up every year ahead of the monsoon for the past four years.The gram panchayats have also been instructed to ensure there is no leakage in pipelines carrying the drinking water from water tanks to various households as the contaminated water could enter the pipes through leakages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gram-panchayats-instructed-to-take-up-super-chlorination-work/articleshow/84929228.cms||Santosh Sonawane

While the work was supposed to be completed by the end of 2019, it got extended due to the Covid outbreak.Medical officials of the civil hospital said once the MCH building on the premises of Nashik Civil hospital is ready, they could set up more beds for treating Covid patients either in the new facility or shift some existing wards to the new facility to accommodate Covid patients.He told TOI that if the building construction work was completed at the designated time, the health machinery would not need to check for the availability of beds in other government facilities.“A good amount of work is pending of the 100-bed MCH building. I have also instructed the officials concerned to start slapping fine on the contractor if the work continues to be delayed in the future,” he said.Though Covid cases have reduced across Nashik, the district administration is making efforts to ensure all the facilities are in place to tackle the flow of patients during the third wave.On this backdrop, setting up oxygen plants at various government hospitals, availability of ventilators, ensuring availability of paediatrics, etc are being checked at every place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/speed-up-work-on-mch-building-civil-surgeon/articleshow/84929201.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Senior inspector Sardar Patil said on Saturday, “The couple left for some work, leaving their children at home. The thief walked into their residence on finding the children alone at home. He asked them to switch on the television and stole cash and chain, collectively valued at Rs 50,000, by breaking open the cupboard locks and fled on a bike.” Patil said, “The theft came to light after the children’s mother reached home and found the cupboard locks broken, clothes and household goods ransacked and cash and her mangalsutra stolen.” “After Vishlavat asked her elder daughter who had visited their place, the girl told her that a stranger visited them and committed the theft,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/thief-steals-cash-chain-on-finding-kids-alone-at-home/articleshow/84935180.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Rs 20 cr swindled in AP through fake aliases||Hyderabad: Taken aback by the audacity of some employees of treasury and medical and health departments for allegedly swallowing more than Rs 20 crore by creating non-existent persons as fake employees and fake pensioners from two districts in Andhra Pradesh, state Lokayukta Justice P Lakshmana Reddy has directed the finance department’s principal secretary and DG of vigilance and enforcement to verify whether similar frauds took place in other districts too. The judge gave this interim order after going through the preliminary enquiry reports of the authorities. The case was adjourned to October 5. The Lokayukta went through vernacular media reports and obtained preliminary reports which confirmed irregularities pertaining to fake health employees in Chintapalli of Visakhapatnam district and fake pensions from Rajamundry in East Godavari. After noticing that the officials have launched criminal prosecution against errant employees, Justice Lakshmana Reddy said mere departmental proceedings would not be sufficient to control the corrupt. “It is essential to send the corrupt elements behind bars after securing their convictions through effective prosecution. Slap section 409 of IPC on them,” the Lokayukta said, asking the prosecutors to take steps to conduct prosecution in a foolproof manner. The officials and staff of medical and health and treasury departments connived and created 61 dummy employees that exist only on paper even as the accused officials were unlawfully drawing salaries in their names for the last several years. A separate head of account at Chintapalli sub-treasury office was created for the purpose. Hinting at the involvement of higher officials in the scam, the judge spoke about the contents of the interim reports before him that pointed towards budget releases being obtained in excess of actual need and alleged release of such funds to various primary health centres in Chintapalli division. The judge also noted the fact that the accused in the case tried to erase evidence of fraudulent bills by resorting to destruction of records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-20-cr-swindled-in-ap-through-fake-aliases/articleshow/84934185.cms||---

He challenged UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to state clearly if BJP will deny tickets to such legislators in ensuing polls to t state assembly. Speaking to reporters, Owaisi demanded the Centre launch an inquiry into the Pegasus or at least allow a debate in Parliament over the issue. “When inquiries are being done on the Pegasus-phone hacking issue in Israel and France, why is the Modi-government scared to even constitute a commission to inquire into it?” Owaisi questioned. The AIMIM president also lashed out at PM Narendra Modi for his perceived silence on the issue of “China sitting in Indian territory.” “Why doesn’t the Modi government lead a delegation of MPs and journalists to Depsang, Gogra, Hot Spring and Demchok to show that these are still under control. But the reality is that the Chinese soldiers continue to be in control of our territory...,” Owaisi alleged. The AIMIM president also lambasted the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh and Centre for allegedly neglecting the health sector. “There are four lakh acutely malnourished children in UP, severe shortage of doctors and specialists in public, community health centres and sub-centres. The Modi-government had filed an affidavit in Supreme Court in 2020 stating international experience shows that any coercion to have a certain number of children is counter productive and leads to demographic distortions,” he said. Owaisi also demanded the Centre give jobs to crores who lost jobs due to the alleged mismanagement of the second wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asad-will-bjp-deny-tickets-to-mlas-with-more-than-two-kids/articleshow/84934134.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports its first Zika virus case in 50-year-old Pune woman||Maharashtra officially confirmed its first case of Zika virus a mosquito-borne viral infection on Saturday. A blood sample of the 50-year-old resident of Belsar village (Purandar taluka) in Pune district tested positive for Zika-chikungunya co-infection at Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) in Pune late on Friday. The sample was drawn as part of routine surveillance to rule out mosquito-borne illnesses after some villagers showed dengue/chikungunya-like symptoms in Belsar and Parinche villages in Purandar taluka from early July. After detection of Zika, the state surveillance machinery intensified fever surveillance in seven surrounding villages, including Belsar (Purandar), where the woman resides with her family. “The housewife has no travel history. She had the onset of symptoms on July 14. She completely recovered and has no symptoms now. No family member has any symptoms too,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said. ICMR-NIV’s preliminary investigations suggested a mixed outbreak of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, with the dominance of chikungunya in Belsar. “Human Zika virus case is reported for the first time from Maharashtra. The results warrant in-depth investigations for Zika virus in this region,” Priya Abraham, director, ICMR-NIV, stated in her preliminary report. The virus detection once again reinforced the importance of fever surveillance to pick up viral diseases. “A team of ICMR-NIV visited Belsare and Parinche villages on July 27-29 after blood samples of three villagers, drawn as part of the fever surveillance, tested positive for chikungunya on July 16,” Awate said. The team collected samples of 51 villagers against suspicion of chikungunya. “Among 41 of the samples for which all results are available, the blood samples from 25 cases were positive for chikungunya. Three were positive for dengue and one sample was positive for Zika and chikungunya,” the ICMR-NIV report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-reports-its-first-zika-virus-case-in-50-year-old-pune-woman/articleshow/84935251.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Surat||Sacked employee threatens to kill his former boss, demands Rs 2 crore||Surat: A man who was sacked for alleged malpractice was arrested on Saturday for allegedly threatening to kill his former employer, a construction contractor, and trying to extort Rs 2 crore from him. Police arrested Vijay Sutariya, a resident of Mota Varachha, for allegedly threatening to kill his former employer Vijay Virani, of Katargam. Sutariya was booked by Katargam police under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 384 (extortion) and 387 (In order to the committing of extortion put any person in fear of death or of grievous hurt). Investigation revealed that Virani’s firm undertakes government construction work in different states. Sutariya was employed by Virani. However, on finding that Sutariya was selling construction raw material to other traders without his knowledge, Virani sacked him in 2019. “Initially, Sutariya demanded money and threatened Virani with complaints to government offices and the vigilance department. But Virani refused to entertain his threats. So, Sutariya threatened him to kill if he did not pay Rs 2 crore,” said B D Gohil, police inspector, Katargam police station. Sutariya also went to Virani’s office and clicked pictures and recorded videos there. He then shared the videos and photos with the labour contractor working with Virani in Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/sacked-employee-threatens-to-kill-his-former-boss-demands-rs-2-crore/articleshow/84930424.cms||---

Police seized 166 cards and equipment used for cloning from Nedelaku Valentine Evonut (38). Police were on patrol when they spotted him moving about suspiciously in an ATM kiosk at Lokhandwala Complex, Andheri. When police questioned him, he gave evasive responses. Officers searched him and found nine cards, none of which belonged to him. He was hauled to the police station and questioned. Evonut told officers he had been stealing data from cards inserted by unsuspecting people at ATM kiosks. Of the 166 cards found on him, 72 were cloned. In June 2021, Evonut allegedly misappropriated Rs60,000 from a woman after cloning her card and using it online. The woman was home when she received a text from her bank about money being debited from her account. She lodged a police complaint. “We seized three laptops, card-swiping reader devices, two currency counting machines, four cellphones, eight USB connected hidden cameras, memory cards and card cloning equipment collectively valued at Rs 2.09 lakh from Evonut,” said an official. Evonut was earlier booked at Dahisar, D N Nagar, Vinoba Bhave Nagar, Dombivli, MRA Marg, Bandra and Navghar (Mulund) police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/romanian-arrested-for-cloning-atm-cards-in-mumbai/articleshow/84936443.cms||---

---||Nashik||Kalwan SDH gets 10 oxygen concentrators, 2 ventilators||Nashik: The Kalwan Sub District Hospital (SDH) has received 10 oxygen concentrators from two private organisations through their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. Anant Pawar, the medical superintendent of Kalwan SDH, said that apart from the oxygen concentrators, the Kalwan SDH has also been presented with two ventilators and two BiPAP machines. The equipment, given by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Accenture, will be useful for Kalwan SDH to treat Covid patients during the expected third wave. He said the role of Kalwan resident Amit Kothavade, who also works at the state Covid control cell, has been remarkable in getting the oxygen concentrators and other medical equipment for the 100-bed SDH. The aim is to ensure new modern medical equipment brings down the load on the existing health machinery and a robust medical system at the taluka place would save ailing patients from the trips to the district headquarters for treatment, he said. Even earlier, the Covid patients of the district have benefited from the modern equipment at the SDH, which were procured through proper co-ordination of the administration with various departments and organisations, he said Ahead of the expected third wave of Covid, which is likely to affect children more, a special paediatric Covid unit of 20 beds will be set up at the SDH. He said the work of the special paediatric unit was fast underway and it will be open in a matter of a few days. An oxygen line to all the 100 beds in the hospital has already been put in place. All efforts are being taken by the Kalwan SDH officials and sub-divisional officer Vikas Meena to provide the best medical treatment and facilities to patients in Kalwan taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kalwan-sdh-gets-10-oxygen-concentrators-2-ventilators/articleshow/84929278.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: 17 villages in Parner taluka opt for voluntary 10-day lockdown||NASHIK: As many as 17 villages in the Parner taluka of Ahmednagar district have opted for 10 days of voluntary lockdown that started on Friday evening. Sakur — a market and business hub that has been witnessing a steady rise in the number of Covid cases — and other villages around it have taken this decision to curb the spread of the disease. “After district collector R B Bhosle and Ahmednagar Zilla Parishad CEO Rajendra Kshirsagar visited the area, we unanimously decided to shut down the village to protect ourselves from the infection,” said Shankarrao Khemnar, the sarpanch of Sakur village. These 16 villages have been collectively registering at least 30-35 daily cases for some time now. On July 29, the number shot up to 63, prompting the administration and elected representatives to discuss the gravity of the situation. “At present, it would not be right to officially lock down the entire area, as people should now take the responsibility of protecting themselves and the community. The elected representatives in the area have come up with the idea of a voluntary lockdown. This is a good solution,” said collector RB Bhosale. A meeting of citizens, traders and shopkeepers’ association was recently held and the 10-day lockdown was announced beginning Friday evening. It will end at 5 am on August 9. “All shops and establishments will remain closed. Everyone has voluntarily supported the call. Only medical stores would remain open till 5 pm every day,” said Khemnar, who is also the chairman of Sangamner Agriculture Produce Market Committee. Agricultural activities will continue, though shops related to the same will not open. Milk collection will also be carried out in the morning and evening. However, there will be no public meetings or gatherings during the period, the sarpanch said. The lockdown would also be followed in the smaller villages that depend on Sakur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/17-villages-in-parner-taluka-opt-for-voluntary-10-day-lockdown/articleshow/84929312.cms||---
---||Delhi||Stephen’s doctor murder: CBI’s Rs 7 lakh reward for accused||NEW DELHI: “Forgetting you is not happening, and forgetting me — I won’t let that happen..(sic),” Dr Suyash Gupta had scribbled in his notebook a few days before he allegedly stabbed a fellow doctor, Shashwat Pandey, two dozen times for rejecting his advances. Four years later, the dialogue from a Hindi movie still haunts the investigators who have been on the elusive Gupta’s trail since the murder. Pandey (then 26), a final-year radio diagnosis student, was found murdered inside the CT scan lab of St Stephen’s Hospital in August 2017 with over 20 stab wounds. The case was initially being probed by Delhi Police, but was transferred to the CBI in August 2018. Last year, the CBI had filed a chargesheet in the case while keeping the investigation "open". The agency has now declared a reward of Rs 7 lakh for the arrest of the bisexual doctor, Suyash Gupta, and sought public’s help in tracing him. Over the years, cops have been able to gather details of some VoIP calls allegedly made by Gupta to his acquaintances, but there is no proof of his whereabouts. His immediate escape was to Nepal, it was believed. Initially, the two were very good friends, said a cop who investigated the case in the beginning. However, the trouble in paradise started when Pandey became friends with a nurse and stopped spending time with Gupta. The hospital staff, including nurses, have narrated in their statements as to how Gupta would often turn violent. Pandey had made multiple complaints to the administration about the harassment he was facing. Just a month before the murder, Gupta had stopped Pandey from performing a CT-guided biopsy procedure on a patient, which was followed by an altercation. Gupta was subsequently suspended and an inquiry initiated against him. He was also not allowed on the campus following the incident. Towards the end, Gupta had become “over-possessive” following which Pandey had begun to distance himself, sources said. Gupta would turn up at Pandey’s flat in Karol Bagh at odd hours and create ruckus in front of friends. A barrage of calls and SMSs followed not just to Pandey but also to his family members. Soon, the threats began to flow in and ultimately Gupta resorted to killing Pandey, say cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stephens-doc-murder-cbis-rs-7-lakh-reward-for-accused/articleshow/84933271.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Mumbai||One lakh-plus citizens get jabs in Mumbai again; 55 lakh have got 1 shot so far||MUMBAI: For two days in a row, more than a lakh citizens got vaccinated in Mumbai. On Saturday, 1.01 lakh people took the jabs, 70,213 of which were taken at BMC-run centres for free. So far, 17.7 lakh people are fully vaccinated in Mumbai while 54.5 lakh have got one shot. “We received two lakh vaccines a couple of days back that helped boost the numbers on Friday and Saturday,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. BMC officials said the stocks are adequate enough for Monday as well. Kakani said the BMC had received more vaccines in July than in June. “The June supply was more than the supply in May. We are hence hopeful that we will get more vaccines in August so that we can vaccinate the maximum number of people,” said Kakani. The BMC can vaccinate up to 1.5 lakh people a day, but the supply has been erratic, leading to a few days when the free vaccine drive is cancelled. Meanwhile, the state government update said that 6,76,208 people got vaccinated on Friday. Of these, 3.4 lakh beneficiaries were in the 18-44 age group while 3.1 lakh were over 45 years of age. Maharashtra has over 1 crore people who are fully vaccinated, the highest for any state in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/1l-plus-citizens-get-jabs-in-mumbai-city-again-55l-have-got-1-shot-so-far/articleshow/84935952.cms||---
---||Mumbai||50 years of a golden run: How Mumbai pulled off a big win without its stars||MUMBAI: For 12 years from 1958-59, Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy, but in 1970-71, their stars – Ajit Wadekar, Dilip Sardesai, Sunil Gavaskar, Ashok Mankad and Eknath Solkar – were out in the Caribbean on national duty, and the team led by Sudhir Naik was full of rookies. But they pulled off what TOI described at the time as ‘perhaps its greatest triumph’, which now completes 50 years. The young Bombay team (as it was known then) downed a formidable Chandu Borde-led Maharashtra in a thrilling final from April 2-7 at Brabourne stadium. Maharashtra started celebrations at the end of Day 4. As it turned out, the celebrations were premature. In the first innings, Bombay made 287, with Ramnath Parkar scoring 108, sharing a 143-run stand for fourth wicket with Ajit Naik (42) after the hosts, opting to bat first, slipped to 12 for 3. For Maharashtra, leg-spinner Nicky Saldanha took 6-66. He top-scored with 50 as Maharashtra were out for 230. In the second innings, Mumbai looked in trouble when Naik, Parkar and Ajit were out early. A 99-run partnership for fourth wicket between Vijay Bhosle (55) and Mahesh Sampat (60), followed by a 33-run cameo by Milind Rege, pulled them out of the woods. Mumbai were all out for 196, with left-arm spinner Vitthal Joshi taking 5-62. Chasing 254 in the fourth innings, Maharashtra were 144 for 5 going into the fifth and final day. So sure were Maharashtra of their victory, “they had put champagne on ice”, Sudhir Naik told TOI. “Everyone was sure they’d win. I heard they’d booked a hall at the Taj for a celebration. All officials of MCA (Maharashtra Cricket Association) had arrived in Bombay, anticipating a win. Though they’d got out for their lowest score that season in the first innings, they never thought they wouldn’t get past 250 in the second.” But Maharashtra folded up for 205, with left-arm spinner Paddy Shivalkar taking 6 for 56 and pacer Abdul Ismail 3 for 17. Until then, only one team from each zone would qualify for Ranji knockouts, and in the West Zone always the fight was between Bombay and Maharashtra, both strong teams. Mumbai would mostly narrowly edge out Maharashtra, so just before the 1971-71 season, Maharashtra had requested two teams be allowed from every zone, to which BCCI agreed. As it happened, “that year, Maharashtra became zonal champions, and Bombay was No 2! But we managed to qualify because of their proposal,” Naik said. Still, Naik was aware of Maharashtra’s strength. “They were in great form. From the first match till the semis, they didn’t score less than 450. In the quarterfinal they scored 550-odd. In the semis against Rajasthan, they got 650-plus. They had stalwarts like Borde, Madhu Gupte, Chetan Chauhan and Hemant Kanitkar. At least two of them used to get big hundreds in every game. But in the final, they failed. They couldn’t score more than 250 on a good wicket. In the league stage, we’d lost to them despite having a full-strength team. They had three all-rounders in Saldanha, Joshi and leggie Sanjay Kirtane, all good middle-order batsmen. If the top order failed, they’d get runs,” said Naik. “And we were all young — our average age was 24. Most of our players were in their first Ranji season. Our average experience was three seasons. This was the best of Mumbai’s 41 Ranji triumphs.” Bombay found unlikely heroes in the final. “While it was a team effort, in the first innings, Shivalkar and Atul Mehta (scoring 37 each) added 68 for the 9th wicket, which made the difference. In the second, Bhosle and Sampat’s partnership was critical,” Naik added. Naik knew that for Bombay to win, they had to get Borde early. “He scored 48 and 51. He was going great guns in the first innings when I told Ajit Naik to bowl a short-pitched line to him from round the wicket. I placed my best fielder, Ramnath Parkar near the square-leg umpire. I told Shivalkar too to bowl a tight line to him. When he couldn’t get runs for 2-3 overs, Borde got upset and ended up hooking a short ball to Parkar. I had an intuition he’d end up playing that shot,” Naik said. In the second innings, Rege took a brilliant catch in the slips to get rid of Borde. That catch made a headline in TOI. The 48-run win meant there was no interruption in Mumbai’s victories, which continued unbroken till 1972-73, a record 15 times. Bombay’s tactics impressed the greats. “Vijay Merchant was doing radio commentary. He called me a shrewd captain.

---||Shimla||More landslides in Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh-Manali link blocked||SHIMLA: Reports of landslides continue to roll in from several parts of Himachal Pradesh. Chandigarh-Manali National Highway was blocked near Pandoh in Mandi district due to landslides at 7 Mile and 4 Mile areas. Falling boulders damaged two vehicles but fortunately no loss of life was reported in the incident. According to Indian Meteorological Department, rainfall for July was 289.1 mm with departure from normal rainfall (273.0 mm) of 6%. In the state, highest rainfall of 309.3mm (7%) in July was recorded in 2005. Another incident of landslide in NH-305 at Khanag area of Anni sub-division in Kullu district was reported due to which the traffic was blocked. Authorities had pressed men and machinery into service to reopen the blocked roads. In Kinnaur, landslide was reported in Plingi Nichar road. In Chamba district, landslide triggered rockslide at Panela Zero Point of Sarotha nullah due to which police officials have advised the commuters not to take this route to reach Chamba. Incessant rainfall in many parts of state has made the hilly roads marshy and slippery. The poor visibility amid fog also makes the driving risky, so authorities have requested the drivers to drive carefully and to switch on foglights for safety of everyone. In Lahail-Spiti district, NH-505 was blocked near Batal due to rockslides. The district administration is working on clearing the road and officials said it will take about 3-4 hours to clear the road. Those who are travelling to Gramphu-Batal-Chandertal-Lossar-Kaza road were advised to avoid taking this route. According to Indian Meteorological Department, out of the 12 districts, Kullu received large excess rainfall in July, Hamirpur and Kangra received excess rainfall, Bilaspur, Kinnaur, Mandi, Shimla, Sirmaur, Una and Solan received normal rainfall, and Chamba and Lahaul-Spiti received deficient rainfall. Total numbers of three active wet spells of monsoon currents arrived in Himachal Pradesh which gave light to moderate rainfall over most of the days. Disaster Events In July- July 12-13: Heavy rain and landslide at various places in Kangra district July 19-20: Heavy rain and landslide at various places in Chamba (Balogi) & Kangra (Dehra) July 25: Landslide at Batseri, Sangla in Kinnaur, resulting into the death of 9 persons, including 8 tourists July 27-28: Heavy rain and landslide at various places in Chamba, Kullu and Lahaul-Spiti resulting into death of around 12 persons July 30: Heavy rain and landslide near Ponta Sahib on NH-707 Night Travel BannedMANALI: With frequent spells of rains triggering landslides along the Chandigarh-Manali national highway between Kullu and Mandi, both Mandi and Kullu district administrations have ordered to keep the highway closed during night time till further orders. Kullu DC Ashutosh Garg said the NHAI project director stated that the stretch between Mandi and Pandoh was experiencing rockslides due to rains and night travel was not advisable. “Mandi DC has also issued orders not to allow traffic movement on the highway after 8pm,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/more-landslides-in-himachal-chd-manali-link-blocked/articleshow/84933241.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Some colleges to prepare UG merit lists on percentile||KOLKATA: Many colleges in the city have decided to prepare the merit list for undergraduate candidates based on the percentile system, instead of the individual percentages, which principals feel will create a level playing field for all applicants. The institutes took this decision as both CISCE and CBSE awarded a deluge of marks to their Class XII students, while the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education brought down the number of students in the 90%-99% bracket. Principals feel it would be difficult to admit students based solely on their Class XII final marks. Some principals have decided to wait till all the applications are submitted by August 20 and then, scrutinize them and decide on the method to prepare the merit lists. The percentile system gives an idea of an applicant’s position on a merit list, compared to other candidates. The percentile is calculated by dividing the number of applicants who have scored less than him/her by the total number of candidates and then, multiplying the number by 100. So, if 100 people take a test and 99 score less or equal to a particular student, then his/her percentile is 99. “Our college will prepare the merit list, based on the percentile system so that applicants know where they stand in comparison to others. It will give an equal opportunity to all,” said Siuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne College. Although there was a jump in the pass percentage of HS this year, only 9,013 candidates scored 90% and above. Last year, 31,000 HS students were in this group, giving them a clear edge over those from CISCE and CBSE. This time, those scoring between 60% and 69% have increased by almost 56,000. CISCE and CBSE this year marked their students liberally with a deluge of 90%. “The system to evaluate Class XII students by the various boards is not scientific and creates a disparity, which will go against HS students,” said Partha Pratim Roy, secretary of Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association, which even wrote to the education minister, pointing out this aspect. Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration, one of the most sought-after institutes for commerce in the city, will also prepare the merit list, based on the percentile system, to do away with any disparity. “Sometimes, students with a difference of one mark or even half-a-mark get different grades, which can make a big difference during college admission. The percentile system can eliminate such disparities,” said an official of the college. Many colleges will take a final decision after all the applications come in. “We have decided to take a final decision on how we will calculate after August 20. Our aim is to provide a level playing field to all applicants,” said Asok Mukhopadhyay, principal at Seth Anandram Jaipuria College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-colleges-to-prepare-ug-merit-lists-on-percentile/articleshow/84933430.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The Chandigarh-Manali highway was blocked near Pandoh in Mandi since Friday night. A jeep parked on the highway was also damaged here. Many tourist buses had also been stranded for hours until the debris was cleared in the afternoon on Saturday. The Mandi-Kullu bypass road via Kataula was also blocked following the landslide but the road was opened to traffic on Saturday morning. Given the dangerous conditions due to landslides, the administration has ordered to keep the highway closed for all types of vehicles in the night time. Kullu deputy commissioner Ashutosh Garg said the national highway authority of India project director has stated that the stretch between Mandi and Pandoh was experiencing rockslides due to rains and night travel was not advisable. “Mandi deputy commissioner has also issued orders not to allow traffic movement on the highway after 8pm. Taking precautionary measures, I have also ordered that vehicles will not be allowed on the national highway NH-3 from 8pm to 6am till further orders,” he said. The DC said vehicles plying on the route can be diverted via Kandi-Kataula bypass road. The frequent blocking of the Mandi-Kullu section of the highway is annoying the commuters.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Not allowed to raise issues in assembly, say BJP MLAs||NEW DELHI: Leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and other BJP MLAs on Saturday said that they would meet the President and the Lok Sabha Speaker because they were allegedly “not allowed to raise issues related to Delhi’s problems in the assembly despite giving advance notices.” The BJP functionaries claimed that it amounted to “bypassing the established parliamentary rules.” In a press conference, the MLAs said they had given notices for discussion on health, Covid, hospitals, transport situation, DTC scam, schools and colleges, irregularity in free ration distribution, non-release of pension to senior citizens, and waterlogging, but all the notices were rejected. “We had demanded the monsoon session be of 10 days instead of two days, but our demand was rejected,” said Bidhuri, adding that even notices on several issues sent as per rules were rejected. Bidhuri accused the AAP government of ignoring the opposition. “Before the commencement of the House, a business advisory committee meeting is convened to decide the agenda of the session. But no such meeting was held,” he said. The leader of the opposition claimed that during the monsoon session, two bills were tabled in the assembly but their copies were not sent to members in advance. “We thought we would discuss the possibility of a third Covid wave and ways to tackle it, but that too did not happen,” Bidhuri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-allowed-to-raise-issues-in-assembly-say-bjp-mlas/articleshow/84933304.cms||---

The committee is expected to submit its report around August 15, but it has urged the state government to take immediate measures of legal aid and compensation to the farmers. The committee was formed by the assembly speaker to look into excesses committed allegedly by Delhi Police, especially on or after January 26, and also by Haryana police on November 26, 2020, when farmers were heading for Delhi. The committee has listened to farmers and recorded their statements in many districts of the state. Many cases were registered at different police stations in Delhi on January 26 against protesting farmers. Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and Sanyukt Kisan Morcha too have set up panels of lawyers too contest the cases of booked farmers. All the booked farmers have already got bails in cases which are at different stages in Delhi courts. Committee head MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid said they had been listening to the grievances of aggrieved farmers, who were protesting against farm laws for over eight months on the borders of Delhi. “We have recommended immediate legal aid and compensation for aggrieved farmers. Now it is up to the state government on how it provides assistance, may be by forming a panel of advocates or in some other way, and also how it compensates farmers who faced onslaught of Delhi Police,” he said. Apart from Vaid, MLAs Saravjit Kaur Manuke, Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra, Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa and Kulbir Singh Zira are members of committee which started meeting farmers from Moga on June 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-mlas-panel-suggests-legal-aid-compensation-for-farmers-facing-jan-26-cases/articleshow/84933330.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||Delhi: Covishield 1st dose back from Monday||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said that 1 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in Delhi so far. This includes 74 lakh first doses and almost 50% of the eligible population of Delhi have been vaccinated with at least one dose. Over 26 lakh people are fully vaccinated. Kejriwal stated that Delhi had the capacity to administer three lakh doses a day but was unable to do so because of the shortage of vaccine stocks. The first dose of Covishield was not available in Delhi government facilities since July 22 because the government restricted the use of Covishield for the first dose till July 31 due to stock shortage. An official said that from Monday, Covishield would be available for the first dose also, but only around 25% of the Covishield stock would be used for the first dose. In a press conference, Kejriwal said Delhi’s vaccination programme had achieved an important milestone. “Today, we have reached the 1 crore mark, we have administered over 1 crore doses in Delhi since the start of the vaccination drive. Roughly, 2 crore people live in Delhi, of which 1.5 crore are 18+ and thus eligible for getting the vaccine. So about 50% of the population have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine,” he stated. “As per the stock of doses we are receiving, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are putting in their best throughout the day and night to vaccinate the people of the city. The people of Delhi as well are very enthusiastic about getting vaccinated and are coming forward to get their shots,” the CM added. For the milestone, he congratulated all the people who have been involved in Delhi’s vaccination programme. Kejriwal further said: “At present, we administer only up to 70,000 doses each day because there’s a huge lack of vaccines. If we can get sufficient stocks, we possess the infrastructure and setup to administer 3 lakh vaccine doses a day. But we are unable to do so because we do not have enough vaccines. We are in constant touch with the central government, and I hope that Delhi, along with other states of the country, will soon start receiving adequate stocks from the Centre.” The CM appealed to people who have not received the vaccines yet to get it immediately. Since July 12, only 20% of Covaxin's stock are being used for the first dose in Delhi due to shortage of supply. “There is a huge gap in the first and second dose numbers. It is significant to get those who have received the first dose to get the second dose also, so that they are fully vaccinated,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covishield-1st-dose-back-from-monday/articleshow/84933394.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Chandigarh||HP police books SJF chief on sedition charges||Shimla: A day after pre-recorded voice calls were made to many people in Himachal Pradesh allegedly by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US-based self-styled chief of the banned pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), Himachal Pradesh police has booked him under sedition charges. A case has been registered on Saturday at state cyber crime police station, Shimla, for offences punishable under sections 124 (sedition against state), 153-A (act prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 506 (intimidation), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, besides under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and the IT Act, 2000. On Friday morning, many journalists received the recorded call from different numbers in which a message was given to the Himachal government that on August 15, they will not allow Jai Ram Thakur to hoist Indian tricolour. The message further stated that Himachal Pradesh was part of Punjab and they were seeking referendum in Punjab and once they liberate Punjab, they will make sure that they take over Himachal areas which were part of Punjab. A statement issued by police sad that case has been registered against one Gurpatwant Singh Pannun based on recorded audio clip received on mobile by many journalists and citizens of Himachal Pradesh. The threat received through alleged audio clip from Pannun is under investigation to mitigate any terrorist activity propagated by pro-Khalistani outfits, it added. The police stated that preliminary investigation revealed that alleged Pannun was associated with pro-Khalistani outfit named ‘Sikhs for Justice’ (SFJ), which is banned by the Government of India under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for anti-India activities on July 10, 2019. This organization is based at overseas with their network in various places in the US and other foreign countries, it added. The statement said the investigation conducted so far has revealed that these threat audio clips have been received on the mobiles of many journalists and citizens of Himachal Pradesh through international numbers/VOIP (voice over internet protocol). The investigation in this regards is underway to identify the origination of caller. The voice spectrography of the alleged audio clip will be conducted in due course of time to fix criminality of accused. This investigation has national and international ramifications. Therefore, the police is seeking cooperation from various central agencies to crack down the case and to bring accused to justice, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hp-police-books-sjf-chief-on-sedition-charges/articleshow/84933369.cms||---

The resolution was passed in the first working committee held at a private hotel in city on Saturday. “Every day, the state records heinous crimes against women indicating that the present government doesn’t have any control on the law and order situation in the state,” said Dr Alka Mundra, while talking to the mediapersons. In her address, she said that BJP is the only party that provides equal opportunity to women. "The social welfare schemes of PM Narendra Modi are greatly benefiting the women in the country and the state. It has paved way for real empowerment of the women in the country," said Mundra. The Morcha has done three months of planning to raise women issues in the state. They will hold a series of protests and demonstrations against the state government in every district. State BJP president Satish Poonia, who was present in the programme, said that every woman party activist should popularise the schemes of PM Modi in order to spread its benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-mahila-morcha-plans-series-of-stirs-against-govt/articleshow/84935437.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Covid spike in Ahmednagar, but critical patients fewer||NASHIK: The spike in Covid cases in Ahmednagar district notwithstanding, the number of critical patients is still low, said district collector Rajendra Bhosale. Currently, the district has 5,687 active Covid patients — all in mandatory institutional quarantine. Of them, only 3.6% are in the ICUs and about 7.5% are on medical oxygen-support (however, not in ICUs). The district’s positivity rate and fatality rates are 5.5% and 2.06%, respectively. The administration is conducting around 15,000 daily Covid tests. Bhosale told TOI the administration is continuing with its policy — started during the second wave of the pandemic — of mandatory institutional quarantine of even the asymptomatic and or mildly symptomatic Covid patients. “The current spread of the infection is due to overcrowding at social events like weddings, funerals, etc. Even some of the restaurants are allowing more diners than the number stipulated. We have started cracking the whip on such violators,” said Bhosale. “Recently, we registered a case, for overcrowding, against the bride, the groom, their parents as well as the owner of the wedding venue in the Shevgaon taluka. The venue was also sealed,” he added. The five talukas of Sangamner, Parner, Pathardi, Shevgoan and Shrigonda are the hotspots in the district. A bulk of the positive cases in the district are being reported from these talukas. Dr Prakash Lalge, the taluka health officer of Parner, said more than 80% of the patients in the taluka are those who are not vaccinated yet. “Patients who have contracted the infection despite vaccination are either asymptomatic or are mildly symptomatic,” he said. So far, over 11.4 lakh beneficiaries, including healthcare and frontline workers, have been vaccinated in Ahmednagar. “A large section of the beneficiaries is yet to be vaccinated in the district and the administration’s priority is to vaccinate as many beneficiaries as possible before the third wave hits,” added the district collector. Meanwhile, some of Ahmednagar’s neighouring districts like Nashik and Beed are on an alert following the rise in the number of cases in Ahmednagar. Beed Zilla Parishad CEO Ajit Kumbhar said the Asthi, Patoda and Shirur talukas share border with Ahmednagar. “We have decided that from early next week, the health authorities of these talukas will test people coming in from Ahmednagar for Covid. This is essential since cases are rising in Ahmednagar and there is a movement of people between the two districts,” said Kumbhar. Nashik district civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat too said the district health authorities are closely monitoring the Covid situation in the Sinnar taluka of the district that borders Ahmednagar. “We are extremely vigilant since there is a constant movement of people between Nashik and Ahmednagar on a daily basis,” said Thorat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/low-critical-patient-count-tempers-ahmednagar-covid-spike-collector/articleshow/84929507.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Delhi||Two Delhi civic bodies okay selling of packed food on e-carts||NEW DELHI: A new policy on issuing of health trade licences for selling packaged food on battery operated carts has been approved by South Delhi Municipal Corporation. The civic body has agreed to issue two licences in each municipal ward to begin with, subject to an NOC from Delhi traffic police or the land owning agency. In case there are more applicants than two per ward, the selection will be finalised through a lottery system, stated the proposal passed in the standing committee on Thursday. “Priority will be given to the economically weaker sections or families whose earning members have passed away due to Covid,” the plan stated. “The e-carts will be allowed to operate from 7am to 10pm and the owner has to ensure that there would be no congestion in the area due to their carts. The size of the vehicle should not be more than 6x6 feet and must have provision for a GPS device.” The carts will be restricted to public land/areas to ensure no congestion. The registration fees for the services would be Rs 10,000, while Rs 21,000 will be the annual license fee. The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has approved a similar policy in its house meeting on Thursday to encourage entrepreneurship. As per the EDMC’s finalised policy, no e-cart will park at any place for more than 30 minutes. Their operational hours will be from 8am to 8pm. The civic body has also specified certain technical conditions to run the facility such as the e-cart must be registered under Delhi Transport Department for the commercial/vending activity of sale of packed food items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-corpns-okay-selling-of-packed-food-on-e-carts/articleshow/84934974.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||After court order, SDMC gets nod for 37 CNG BS-IV vehicles||New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), after pursuing the matter in the court, has finally received permission to engage 37 BS-IV compliant CNG vehicles/trucks for various purposes. “After the Supreme Court’s order, Delhi government’s transport department has registered these vehicles recently. Now, we will engage them after fabrication/modification. These were bought under the Centre’s Urban Development Scheme,” said an SDMC official. The official stated that the engagement of these low-capacity vehicles would simplify maintenance and sanitation work in the area, while for their uninterrupted use, drivers would be hired on contract through the GeM portal. “We have asked the maintenance department to engage these vehicles for several uses. Also, there is a shortage of drivers to operate other vehicles too. We have asked the zonal offices to submit their demands, based on which we will jointly hire the required workforce on a contractual-basis through agencies registered on the government portal,” the official added. The matter of shortage of drivers was also raised in the standing committee on Thursday. In 2018-19, the civic body had purchased around 65 such vehicles with BS-IV compliance. “While half of these vehicles were registered and engaged immediately after purchase, 37 of them could not be registered, as the guidelines for BS-VI-compliant vehicles were released in April 2020. This has persuaded us to follow up the matter in the court, and last year, the Supreme Court passed an order in this regard. Since we were lacking clarity, we again filed a petition in the court in April 2021,” said the official. Later the ASG wrote to the ministry of road, transport and highways, in which it was stated that the vehicles that were registered on e-VAHAN portal before post March 2020 could be registered by the transport department, even if these were BS IV-compliant, the official added. The information was shared at the standing committee meeting as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-court-order-sdmc-gets-nod-for-37-cng-bs-iv-vehicles/articleshow/84933429.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Chandigarh||Martyrdom of Udham Singh observed as anti- imperialism day at farm protest sites||Bathinda: The protesting farmers observed the 81st martyrdom of freedom fighter Udham Singh at all the protest sites, at Delhi borders and at various places across Punjab as ‘anti-imperialism day’. Floral tributes were paid to the freedom fighter after recalling his contribution in the freedom struggle. Belonging to Sunam in Punjab, Udham Singh was hanged in Pentonville prison on July 31, 1940 for assassinating Michael O’ Dwyer at Caxton hall, London on March 13, 1940. Farmers said they get inspiration from the heroics of Udham Singh apart from Bhagat Singh, Kartar Singh Sarabha and many more. The speakers highlighted the life struggle and sacrifices of Udham Singh, as he fought against imperialism. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stated some attempts again are being made by BJP and its allies to defame the farmers movement in newer ways by portraying protesting farmers as ayyashjeevi (debauched). Anti-farmer forces have attempted foisting numerous labels on the protesting farmers calling them as separatists, Khalistanis, protestors sponsored by opposition political parties, anti-social elements and anti-nationals, asserted SKM. “It is only the fear and weakness of the anti-farmer forces that is being showcased here in these condemnable maligning campaigns,” said SKM. SKM said the Delhi assembly has passed a resolution seeking the repeal of the three central farm laws. The resolution criticised the Union government for not agreeing to the farmers’ demand so far despite so many months of peaceful protests and asked the Prime Minister to re-initiate talks with the protesting unions. A delegation of leaders from various political parties has met the President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking his intervention to form a joint parliamentary panel to look into the matter of hundreds of deaths during the farmers’ struggle. These parties are contesting the government’s claim that it has no record of any farmer deaths in the ongoing movement and are demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the deaths. The parties also reportedly appealed to the President to ask the Centre to allow discussion on the farm laws in the Parliament and Narendra Modi must listen to it, said SKM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/martyrdom-of-udham-singh-observed-as-anti-imperialism-day-at-farm-protest-sites/articleshow/84933428.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Families near Yamuna rush to safe level||NEW DELHI: Sarvesh Kumar was busy tending to his okra and taro crops on the Yamuna floodplain on Friday morning when he noticed the water level was higher than usual. A couple of hours later, Civil Defence Volunteers were at his doorstep, asking the 40-year-old to vacate his hut in the low-lying location near Sonia Vihar after the Yamuna crossed the danger level of 205.33 metres. Though the water receded to below the danger level on Saturday, more than 100 families, most of them vegetable growers on the floodplain, were living in makeshift tents. Many others too had begun packing their belongings, knowing they too would be asked to move to safer grounds. Kumar and his ilk suffer this season problem when the river mars their standing crops within hours and delays any planting for months altogether. “It is impossible to earn by selling vegetables during this period,” grumbled Neelam, 32, while tapping the Delhi Jal Board tanker for potable water at Sonia Vihar where 400 tents have been put up by the district administration for people affected by the overflowing water. She added, “Our current crop is now worthless and we can grow the next crop only in September.” Dhruv Pal, 60, who rushed to higher ground with 29 family members and relatives, hasn’t ever got used to living in temporary accommodations despite having to undergo the trial every year. “It is very difficult with children around and they don’t understand what is happening. And what is more, if the river rises quickly, we end up leaving behind clothes and household items that we never get back. Our shacks also get damaged, even break down at times,” said Pal. These days, the jhuggis install solar panels for power to run fans, lights and charge phones. So, while the tents at Sonia Vihar don’t have temporary electricity connections, an array of solar panels lay atilt outside each tent. Farmer Ram Babu put the cost of the solar panels at Rs 3,500-5,000 and they are the first to be saved when the river water reaches the huts. “Proper electricity connections are impossible on the floodplain and we have learnt to live like this,” shrugged Babu. In addition to Sonia Vihar, tents are also being set up, among other places, at Shahdara and Shastri Park. A government official said the process to relocate more families to higher ground was halted on Saturday when the river receded. “However, in the expectation that the water will rise again, we have set up tents in some other locations too,” the official said. “When the families are displaced in this manner, it is a full-time commitment for us and we need to provide them with all resources.” The level of the Yamuna touched 205.5m at 5pm on Friday before it began going down gradually as the water discharged from the Hathnikund barrage diminished in volume. By 1am on Saturday, it had come down to 205.44m and five hours later to 205.2m and then to a safer 205.01m at 8am. The danger level is 205.33m. Near Geeta Colony and Yamuna Bazaar close to Kashmere Gate, other families were also preparing for an imminent flood-like peril in the coming days. Rohit Das, a daily-wage earner living in Yamuna Bazaar, said that after learning about the rise in the water level, he had asked his family to start packing in case they had to shift. He explained, “While we don’t live directly on the riverbank, the water still reaches our jhuggi every year. Sometimes, we hardly have any time to grab the basic necessities and reach safe ground. This time, we know we can be displaced soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/families-near-yamuna-rush-to-safe-level/articleshow/84933475.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to villagers, on hearing the gun shot from the nearby forest, they rushed to the spot and found the two brothers hunting the animal with a gun, he added. The animal was reportedly killed on the spot, however actual reason of death and fatal injury would be clear only after receipt of the postmortem report.

---||Jaipur||Popularity of Gehlot among MLAs high, Maken told in meet||Jaipur: Even as Congress MLAs and leaders expressed unhappiness over some ministers’ style of functioning during their one-on-one interaction with AICC general secretary Ajay Maken in the past three days, the popularity of chief minister Ashok Gehlot continued to be high.Maken’s one-on-one meeting with the MLAs was also to assess the popularity of the chief minister and to assess the extent of anti-incumbency to the government. But to Maken’s surprise, majority of MLAs had a high regard and praise for the chief minister. Ever since the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020, Gehlot has been single handedly running the show from the CM’s residence. “One could say it is the concentration of power in the chief minister, but the CM has been consulting everyone through video conference and has been ascertaining our views,” said an MLA. From Covid management to budget announcement implementation, the MLAs are found to be happy with the chief minister, according to sources. They appreciated the way the chief minister accommodated their demands for the constituencies in the budget. Whether it is schools, colleges, roads, CHCs, PHCs, the chief minister had surprised everyone and even surpassed their expectations, said an MLA. Maken acknowledged this while speaking to the mediapersons.“There are projects and schemes in plenty which had even surprised the opposition,” said another MLA. Once the announcements were made, there were doubts over the execution. But even in the times of Covid and revenue loss, the chief minister continued monitoring and started implementing the announcements, he said. An elated MLA of the Gehlot camp said, “Not only the chief minister enjoys full confidence of the high command, but that of the MLAs too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/popularity-of-gehlot-among-mlas-high-maken-told-in-meet/articleshow/84935471.cms||---

---||Goa||India U-23 has talent, now we need to prepare a team: Stimac||Panaji: Igor Stimac has been left in no doubt that the India under-23 squad is brimming with talent. The national coach has seen many of these players impress with the senior team. Akash Mishra, Suresh Singh and Apuia recently made their debuts; Amarjit Singh was handpicked for midfield duties by Stimac for his first international assignment. Then there is goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh. Had it not been for injuries and Covid-19, Ashish Rai and Rahul KP would have had the honour too. It’s an enviable list. “There are talented (under-23) players,” Stimac told TOI. “But to make a team out of this talent takes time and that is something we don’t have. We will see how we proceed.” The qualifiers for next year’s AFC U-23 Asian Cup in Uzbekistan will be played between October 23 and 31, 2021, with 11 group winners and four best second-placed teams sealing their qualification. India are in group E with hosts UAE, Oman and Kyrgyz Republic. “The tournament will be played inside seven days which means three games in quick succession. The players have to be ready and fit. The biggest issue is that we don’t have enough time to prepare the players in a proper way before the games, with all the difficulties,” said Stimac. The first difficulty, of course, is Covid-19 which restricts the team from playing friendlies. The qualifiers will be played outside the Fifa international window, so the All India Football Federation (AIFF) will be at the mercy of clubs for release of players for long camps. “We are trying to adjust our schedules so that we can somehow get the best out of this under-23 team,” said Stimac. “The national team duty is to get the best players. I hope the clubs will be understanding. I know many players will be very important to their club coaches (during pre-season) but we all need to find a way.” There is a possibility that the much-delayed SAFF Cup will be played during the October 4-12 international window, either in Nepal or Maldives. Should that happen, it will possibly provide an opportunity for Stimac to throw more under-23 players into the equation. “We don’t know yet (about the team composition). Honestly, we had meetings with FSDL, trying to find solutions. The ISL season starts November 19 and with quarantine measures, it's difficult to find a proper way to execute everything. “Right now, the biggest problems for us are the quarantine measures. Going out (of the bubble) and coming back means players have to be quarantined. That’s what we are trying to solve,” said Stimac. The AIFF has approached several countries for two friendlies during the international window in September. According to initial plans, the camp will start from August 18. “We are planning to start in mid August. We need to start working at least 10-14 days before the friendlies in September. But I also need to tell you now that it's really difficult to find opponents in Asia “We are having lots of difficulties. I will be happy if we go according to the plan to play two friendly games in September, two in October, under-23 tournament and (another) camp in November,” said Stimac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-u-23-has-talent-now-we-need-to-prepare-a-team-stimac/articleshow/84957790.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Aurangabad||Collector’s office mentions Khaire, Dhoot as MPs||Aurangabad: Even two years after the general elections, Aurangabad district administration’s website continues to mention Chandrakant Khaire as Aurangabad MP and Rajkumar Dhoot as Rajya Sabha MP. In 2019 general elections, Imtiaz Jaleel was elected as Lok Sabha MP from Aurangabad by defeating four-time MP Chandrakant Khaire with a margin of 4,492 votes. Last year, Dr. Bhagwat Karad was elected as Rajya Sabha MP in March 2020. In the recent union cabinet expansion, Karad has been appointed as minister of state for finance. The DPDC section reads, ‘Chandrakant Khaire is member of parliament of Aurangabad constituency’. In the following paragraph it reads, ‘Rajkumar Dhoot Member of Rajya Sabha selected Aurangabad as nodal district for MPLADS and funds are made available by the governments to Aurangabad district from 2002-2003’. Dhoot did not contest RS elections after his term ended in early 2020. The failure of district administration in updating the name of the MPs in the section describing members of District Planning and Development Committee (DPDC) and, at the same time, promptly updating Sunil Chavan taking over as district collector and Subhash Desai taking charge as district guardian minister along with their photos, has raised many eyebrows. A senior revenue official said that NIC’s team should have made appropriate changes and refused to elaborate further. When contacted, Jaleel said, “It seems that the administration still has a section of officials who are yet to accept that this constituency has elected a new MP two years back.” He said that though it is a petty thing, but should be addressed by the administration at the earliest. BJP district president Sanjay Kenekar said, “DPDC has been hijacked by members by Shiv Sena, Congress, NCP. It is being used fund bank for limited politicians. Everything being done is aimed at the upcoming municipal corporation elections.” He demanded that names of people’s representatives should be prominently mentioned, without any discrimination, on the district administration’s website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/collectors-office-mentions-khaire-dhoot-as-mps/articleshow/84931521.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Harsimrat reiterated the demand for repeal of farm laws in the light of the protests by farmers at the borders of Delhi for over eight months. She said she had approached leaders from the Congress, TMC & DMK to raise issues together but it was sad that no one bothered to show up.

---||Hyderabad||Lifestyle change, bad postures a pain for many||Hyderabad: Wrong postures, long hours, little exercise and missing sunlight during work from home has led to what doctors now dub as ‘epidemic within the pandemic’ of rising bone-related problems. Complaints relating to pain in the neck, spine, lower back, hip joints, knees, ankles and wrist have become common, according to doctors. “A lot of people have not realised the impact that pandemic-induced change in daily lifestyle has had on their health. Many are working for prolonged hours sitting on the bed or on the floor. We are seeing at least 5 cases of severe back and neck pain due to wrong posture, and in some cases structural change is also seen,” said Dr BVS Raju, consultant neurosurgeon and spine surgeon, Aster Prime Hospital. Cases in the city’s IT belt seem to have gone up several times over. “As compared to 4-5 patients in a week, we are seeing around four cases every day now. Investigations would generally show they are low on Vitamin D3 and calcium, but it would still not add up to all the complaints. Cases have increased in the last six months,” said Dr Sai Laxman Anne, head of department orthopaedic surgery, KIMS Kondapur. She also pointed out that lack of ergonomic sitting facility at home combined with how people ignore sitting properly unlike in an office setting added to the problem. Dr R A Purnachandra Tejaswi, consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Yashoda Hospitals, added: “Staying at home and not needing to travel to work has also meant weight gain in many people leading to knee and hip joint problems. Prolonged usage of keyboards has led to many professionals turning up with wrist pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.” While most complaints are from people in the 30-50 years category, the elderly are also trooping in with bone issues as many have been inactive and are developing osteoporosis, doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lifestyle-change-bad-postures-a-pain-for-many/articleshow/84933504.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Worli police playground to house rehab buildings for BDD chawl tenants in Mumbai||MUMBAI: NGO Citispace has paved the way for construction of permanent rehab buildings on the police playground which is part of Worli BDD chawls. A plot of the same size, accessible by a public road, has been approved by the NGO for relocation of the police playground in the same vicinity. The Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority is the nodal agency for the project. “We had a zoom meeting with Mhada officials and lawyers. We have agreed to shifting of the playground/recreation ground in the same vicinity where the open space is accessible by public road. We have specifically said there must be no access from the buildings as it is a BMC open space. We have also said the fencing must be spatial and not a concrete wall; the BMC’s logo and signs must be prominently displayed. No one should feel inhibited in accessing the ground,” said Nayana Kathpalia, co-founder, Citispace (which is now integrated with NGO Nagar). The BDD chawl redevelopment project will be relaunched Sunday. The bhoomipujan, albeit a second time, will be done by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at Jambhoori Maidan. The last time the bhoomipujan was performed by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in 2017 and since then the project has simply lapsed. The Worli BDD chawls are part of Shiv Sena leader and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray’s assembly constituency and with civic polls slated for February 2022, this is a prestigious project for the party. Mhada officials said work to lay the foundation for two permanent buildings will begin soon. BMC does not allow excavation in rains, but Mhada officials said they’ll use borewell machines for piling work. “At Worli, 1,120 tenements in 14 chawls have been surveyed and 958 declared as ‘eligible’. The eligibility process is underway for others. Once completed, they will be shifted to transit buildings in the vicinity,” said a senior Mhada official. The two buildings will be 40-storey high and will have no basement. There will be a separate parking tower at Worli. In all, 32 buildings are to be built over eight years. The first two are expected to be ready in three years, said officials. At Naigaum, Dadar, survey of tenants is yet to begin. At N M Joshi Marg, survey has been done for 10 chawls and 274 tenants have been given transit accommodation. BJP MLA Sunil Rane who was part of the Empowered Committee for the BDD redevelopment project said there is no clarity on the new plan. “The new plan has not been disclosed to the people. There is no clarity on how many tenants are to be shifted in how many phases. What is the need for a second bhoomipujan if you are not able to explain the discrepancy in the first plan?” Rane asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/worli-police-playground-to-house-rehab-bldgs-for-bdd-chawl-tenants-in-mumbai/articleshow/84936476.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Rewilding centre in Pilibhit to check man-animal conflict, help big cats return to the wild||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh will soon get a ‘rewilding centre’ in Pilibhit to help stray carnivores, which get deviated from their natural behaviour for a brief period of time, to get normalised before being released in the wild again. This is for the first time that a state government has approved such a centre. Previous governments had proposed such centres but the plan could not take off. Each centre will cost around Rs 5 crore. The fund will be provided through state CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority). The state government is waiting for central approval for the use of CAMPA fund for the purpose. The centre will only be meant for big carnivores like tigers and leopards. In a state like UP, where at least 10 incidents of man-animal conflict are reported every year, rewilding centre will help conserve the population of big cats. The centre will come up in a vast area within the Pilibhit forest which has considerable leopard and tiger population. It will not be a brick and a mortar structure and fencing will be done to seclude the centre from the rest of the forest. A control room will keep an eye on the behaviour of the big cats. The idea is to not bring the deviant feline outside forest, if it is healthy and fit to survive in the wild but let it go back to its natural behaviour by staying within the forest. Chief conservator of forest, eco-development, Neeraj Kumar, said: “The centre could have more than one carnivores depending on the rescue.” Few months ago, four tiger cubs were rescued from the forests in UP after their mother died. Currently, the cubs are in Lucknow zoo and the rewilding centre will come in handy in such a situation. The felines in the wild stray out of the forest due to varied reasons and most of them are prone to man-animal conflict. With the boundary of the forest shrinking and human habitations widening, the chances of man-animal conflict are higher. Since leopards exist on the periphery of the forests and tigers inhabit the core of the jungle, man-leopard conflicts are higher. Not every big cat that enters into a conflict with humans is a threat. Given the dearth of resources, however, all that are rescued are put in zoos. Rewilding centre will function as a reform centre for those animals which had a conflict with men but are healthy and fit to survive in the wild. Most of the carnivores, rescued and sheltered in zoos, get used to humans around. They may lose the natural instinct to survive in the wild. The state government is also planning to set up four rescue centres, one each in Meerut, Chitrakoot, Pilibhit and Maharajganj. “Each centre will house 18 animals and come up on the forest land,” the chief conservator of forest said. Land has been identified keeping in view safety issues like the area should fall within the forest, should not be flood-prone and away from noise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rewilding-centre-to-check-man-animal-conflict-help-big-cats-return-to-the-wild/articleshow/84935519.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Goa||BJP state gen secy condemns ‘rowdy’ behaviour in House||Margao: BJP state general secretary Damodar Naik on Saturday accused the opposition MLAs, who rushed in to the well of the House during the concluding session of the three-day assembly session on Friday, of resorting to “rowdyism” and condemned their behaviour. “With their unbecoming behaviour in the House, they have caused embarrassment to Goans. Their act of flinging caps and books at the Speaker amounts to nothing but dadagiri,” Naik said while addressing a press conference at the party’s South Goa district office, Margao. The opposition MLAs had created ruckus in the House before staging a walk out protesting the more than 11 bills taken up for passing and the Speaker’s rejection of their demand for referring the bills to a select committee for scrutiny. Naik also criticised some opposition MLAs for addressing the chief minister and the speaker in an inappropriate manner during the proceedings of the House. “The dignity of the chair should be respected,” he said. The Fatorda MLA further lauded the chief minister for introducing the Goa Bhoomiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021, which he said would benefit a large number of people who were unable to obtain land ownership rights for their dwellings despite having occupied the house for years. The bill envisages providing a mechanism to give ownership rights to self-occupied dwelling units for those occupying them for the last 30 years. “There are a large number of people staying in forest land, on Alwara properties and other such lands for years, but without having ownership rights. The bill seeks to do away with the hardships faced by these landless people. This is among the major land reforms initiated by this government and needs to be applauded,” Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-state-gen-secy-condemns-rowdy-behaviour-in-house/articleshow/84935593.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi-NCR breaching ozone limits more often, says study||NEW DELHI: Ground-level ozone — a highly reactive gas that is particularly dangerous for those with respiratory conditions and asthma — is becoming more widespread in Delhi and the rest of National Capital Region. The number of days when ozone limits were beyond the permissible standards through the year has also increased, found a new analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). The CSE report found that the eight-hourly standard for ground-level ozone exceeded limits in at least one station in Delhi on 290 days in 2020. This is up by 30 days compared with 2019 and 26 days more than 2018. This year, the report shows that the city has already recorded 169 days of exceedance, an increase of 21 days for the same period last year. While earlier it was believed the gas was generally predominant during the summers, forming out of an interaction between gases in the presence of sunlight, the study found high ozone levels even during the monsoon and winter. “Ozone is now a round-the-year problem requiring urgent attention of clean air programmes,” said CSE executive director Anumita Roychowdhury, who led the study. “The risk from it is often not well understood, as the current regulatory practice of spatially averaging the data from all monitoring stations blunts the curve, and underestimates the magnitude of threat from the worst affected locations and also during different seasons,” she adds. Not only are some parts of the city breaching the standard daily, but several locations have now also begun showing increasingly high readings, indicating wider distribution of the risk. Last year, there were 30% more days when six or more stations exceeded the standard as compared to 2019. The study says in the first half of 2021, 108 days have been registered where six or more stations have exceeded the standard — higher than in the same period in previous years. Unlike PM2.5, PM10 or NO2, which have 24-hour standards, ozone instead has eight-hour standards and one-hour standards, owing to how dangerous the gas can be in a short span of time. The eight hour-standards of ozone are 100 micrograms per cubic metre, while the hourly standard is 180 micrograms per cubic metre. The study also found in terms of ozone hotspots, south Delhi and Lutyens’ Delhi and north Delhi recorded a high number of days where ozone was breaching the daily standards. In south Delhi, Dr K S Shooting Range (233 days), Siri Fort (150 days), Nehru Nagar (174 days), and Sri Aurobindo Marg (126 days) have more than 120 days where standards were exceeded in 2020. They made up four of the top five most polluted spots within Delhi. In central Delhi, J L N Stadium (116 days) and National Stadium (82 days) had relatively high numbers of exceedance days, while Sonia Vihar in north Delhi recorded 142 days where the standards were exceeded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-ncr-breaching-ozone-limits-more-often-says-study/articleshow/84933554.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The victim was being blackmailed by her boyfriend, who claimed to have her intimate photos and videos which he threatened to post on social media, the deceased’s mother stated in her police complaint. “The deceased Nikita Parmar was a college student. The accused Ahmed Abbas Masih, 25, was arrested yesterday evening for blackmail and abetment of suicide under Section 306 of IPC,” said PSI Pinalben Chaudhary of rural police station of Himatnagar. “The girl feared that her reputation would be ruined once the accused uploaded her private photos on social media. Masih was forcing her to have a physical relationship with him,” Pinalben said. The police have recovered the objectionable photos and videos from Masih’s mobile. Masih had divorced his first wife and was in an extramarital relationship with another woman of the village before he came in contact with Parmar. Sources said that he had married for the second time and was living with his family. Still, Masih was in touch with Parmar and managed to trap her.

Transporters said that though the fuel prices that were about Rs 60 per litre, have reached to about Rs 97 per litre, the fares for transportation have barely been increased in the same proportion, making it almost impossible to sustain. Until date, the truckers are made to pay for the loading and unloading of goods at both the ends. The loading as well as unloading of goods, depending on the material, varies from Rs 100 per tonne to Rs 240 per tonne. For a minimum of 12 tonnes of goods, truck owner ends up paying anything between Rs 1,200 to Rs 2,880 for uploading and equal amount for unloading the goods at the delivery point. Aurangabad goods transporter association president Fayyaz Khan, citing the recent decision taken by the association, said, “Our decision has been taken on the lines of the decision taken by All India Motor Transport Congress, New Delhi. Steep fuel prices clubbed with ever increasing number of taxes on each transport vehicle, has compelled us to take the decision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/transporters-wont-pay-unloading-cost/articleshow/84931523.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The driver has been arrested. The owner of the truck is absconding.According to Jaimal Rathore, divisional consumer protocol officer Udaipur, the tanker was transporting the chemical on fake documents. The chemical was filled in Jhabua district in Madhya Pradesh and was meant to be transported to Jind in Haryana. Twenty thousand litre of chemicals found in the diesel tanker being transported was supposed to be used as an additive in other oil to be used as a substitute for high speed diesel, he said.The inflation in price of petroleum products has paved the way for spurious fuel products which are sold at lower rates and mostly used in long distance vehicles and auto rickshaws. In a similar raid on Thursday, a team raided an establishment at Eklingpura in Udaipur and confiscated 4,400 litre of spurious diesel which was sold to the drivers for Rs 50-55 per litre.

Sampla was to meet Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Baljit Singh Daduwal at the gurdwara and listen to grievances of the people from scheduled castes community there. Before that protesters also stopped Sampla in Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda district of Punjab. From there, Sampla tried to visit Dadu village but could not and had to cancel event at gurdwara. Speaking to TOI, Daduwal said, “Vijay Sampla is on a constitutional post and does not belong to any party. He was to visit the gurdwara to listen to grievances of SCs but some persons from Badals-led Shiromani Akali Dal in the garb of farmers opposed Sampla and not allowed him to reach the village. Because of this problems of SCs could not be heard.” Sampla told TOI: “It was unconstitutional. It seems they stopped me on political consideration but I was to go there only to listen to the members from SCs to know about their grievances. The police have identified 21 persons and 600-700 could not be identified. Earlier, some persons stopped me from visiting Phaphre Bhaike village in Mansa of Punjab. All this should stop.” The case has been registered at Kalanwali police station under various sections of the Disaster Management Act and the SC/ST Act, apart from for acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, obstructing public servant, obstruction in public way and criminal intimidation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sc-panel-chief-faces-protest-case-against-700-at-kalanwali-in-sirsa/articleshow/84933547.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Lucknow||Half of Uttar Pradesh kids didn’t use e-learning tools: Study||Case 1: “We don’t get to play games or do extracurricular activities like dancing or swimming. Besides studies, we used to participate in so many activities. We played basketball, danced, visited the library, and spent time with friends. All this is no longer possible in remote learning,” says a 16-year-old girl. Case 2: “We faced a lot of difficulties and had to make many compromises this year. More efforts need to be made to make online teaching better,” says a parent of a 12 year-old child in UP. LUCKNOW: Nearly half of schoolgoing children in Uttar Pradesh didn’t use any remote learning tool since the closure of schools due to lack of awareness about learning content or resources, as reported by 68% adolescents and 83% parents of children in the age group of 5-13 years. The findings were the part of a rapid assessment by Unicef on learning during school closure in view of Covid pandemic. During the study conducted in August-September last year, most parents, adolescents and teachers felt that students’ learning and overall progress was slower as compared to the times when they used to go to school. At least 84% respondents said the children were learning less or significantly less while 79% said the children were lagging behind. More adolescents (56%), as compared to children in primary and junior classes (41% of aged 5-13), were found to be using remote learning tools, mainly driven by the us of reading material, textbooks and YouTube. While 69% adolescents enrolled in government schools had access to remote learning as against 38% children in the age group of 5-13 years. When it comes to private schools, almost an equal number of adolescents (48%) and children of junior classes (46%) were found using remote learning materials. The urban-rural divide continues to separate the state educationally. The study shows both adolescents (71%) and children in 5-13 years (51%) from urban UP used learning materials in comparison to their counterparts in rural areas where 54% adolescents and only 39% children (5-13 years) had access to remote learning. Of those who took up remote learning, 47% used WhatsApp followed by home visits by teachers (according to 30% respondents). The study also looked into key challenges faced by the families. While 40% families said high internet recharge costs posed as a hurdle in learning, 31% said affording a device for learning was a challenge. Another 17% respondents said they failed to use remote learning for the want of school textbooks. Unicef’s education specialist for UP, Ritwik Patra, said: “The study suggests not much learning happened during the period. This year, with our support, the government launched the concept of mohalla classes for better outreach.” The study was conducted on 1,100 respondents including 454 parents of children aged 5-13, 312 adolescents (14-18 age group), and 47 parents of adolescents, 201 government school teachers and 87 marginalised population, including migrant families. On its part, the government created teacher-student WhatsApp groups covering over 90% schools under Mission ‘Prerna ki e-Pathshala’ It created learning content on DIKSHA and developed TV programmes for telecast on Doordarshan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/half-of-up-kids-didnt-use-e-learning-tools-study/articleshow/84935569.cms||Isha Jain

---||Ahmedabad||SC ire: Gujarat government to say no relaxations over fire safety directions||GANDHINAGAR: Facing ire of the Supreme Court over its decision to grant relaxation for compliance of various guidelines of the GDCR (General development control regulations) till March 2022, the Gujarat government is set to clarify before the apex court that the relaxations are limited to securing building use (BU) permission only and that the government does not intend to relax any fire safety norms for hospitals and other premises. A key officer close to the development confirmed that the state government has decided to clarify in the Supreme Court that it has not relaxed any norms for fire safety directions including mandatory requirement of ensuring fire safety before taking BU permission. “After the July 8 order of the urban development department, extending compliance for BU permission to March 31, 2022, some confusion has arisen regarding fire safety compliance. The government has decided to clarify the matter in the SC. GoG is taking all possible measures to ensure fire safety in the state following Supreme Court directions,’’ sources said. The state government has also directed all concerned authorities not to take any action against anyone for failing to comply with GDCR guidelines. The urban development & urban housing department had issued a circular through which the government announced relaxations in compliance of GDCR norms by three months. The regulations were relaxed in March 2020 and again in March 2021, the relaxations were further extended up to December 31, 2022. The order said that due to the pandemic, delay in survey and other works caused the need of giving relaxations in compliance of GDCR. The circular passed by the urban development department, reads, “The buildings that do not have valid building use permission or in breach of building use permissions or have violated development control regulations ... the owners/occupiers of such buildings shall immediately take corrective measures to comply with the GDCR and shall comply with within three months period starting from today till the last day of end of the applicability of the Gujarat epidemic diseases, Covid-19 regulations, 2020” (here till 31-03-2021). The circular further said, “While all the municipal corporations, municipalities, urban development authorities/area development authorities shall take proactive appropriate measures ... no coercive action shall be taken against such buildings for breach of development control regulations from today till three months from the last day applicability of the Gujarat epidemic diseases, Covid 19 regulations 2020 so under the new directions the government relaxed till 31st March 2022.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sc-ire-guj-to-say-no-laxity-over-fire/articleshow/84933677.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Hyderabad||Two of 14 rare artefacts set to be returned by Oz’s nat’l gallery from erstwhile Hyd||Hyderabad: Two of the 14 antique and rare works of arts that the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) has proposed to return to India belong to the erstwhile princely state of Hyderabad. These priceless objects were stolen out of the country over a period of time. The two Hyderabadi antique pieces are a brass Alam or processional standard used during Moharrum and the original photograph of Maharaja Kishen Pershad, prime minister of the Hyderabad state under two Nizams — Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, Nizam VI, and Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam VII. The photograph was taken by Lala Deendayal, who was bestowed with the title Raja by the princely rulers. This is the fourth time that the NGA is returning the artefacts stolen from India. In 2016, the NGA had returned a sculpture belonging to Amaravati. Named Worshippers of the Buddha, it is a 3rd century CE limestone sculpture. It belonged to the early Buddhist settlements in now what is called Andhra Pradesh. The NGA described the Alam as a processional standard from Hyderabad, which was purchased in 2008. It dates the Alam to 1851 CE when Nasir-ud-Dowla was the Nizam IV of Hyderabad. However, city heritage experts and Shia scholars prefer to put the date of the Alam to early 16th century when the Qutub Shahi regime was at its nascent stage. Mir Murtuza Ali Moosvi, custodian of the historic Badashahi Ashoorkhana built in 1594, told TOI that the make and intricate work and designs on the Alam reveals that it must have been made between 1519 and 1529 CE. “This Alam belongs to the Vijayanagar empire. It was handcrafted in Hampi, the capital city of Vijayanagar empire, now in Karnataka,” he said. Murtuza Ali explained that the Alam had designs of lions and dragon-like figures. “It is priceless as it is one of a piece. Apart from its religious significance, the Alam has historic and cultural importance as it was crafted in a kingdom ruled by Hindu kings. This shows the cultural synthesis and religious tolerance in medieval India,” he said. INTACH city convener P Anuradha Reddy said the Vijayanagar rulers had a vast number of Muslim soldiers, who guarded the capital city and the empire. “Even today we find the remains of the quarters of Muslim soldiers stationed outside Hampi,” she said, adding that the Alam must have moved out of the state during or after the Asaf Jah period. “Several crafts and precious items of Hyderabad have been stolen or illegally sold. One of the top 10 costliest ever shoes in the world belongs to Hyderabad. The shoes of Sikandar Jah, who founded Secunderabad, is now in the Bata museum in Toronto, Canada,” Anuradha Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-of-14-rare-artefacts-set-to-be-returned-by-ozs-natl-gallery-from-erstwhile-hyd/articleshow/84933628.cms||Syed Akbar

Last year, class X recorded a passing percentage of 76.91% while class XII recorded 80.26%. In the high school results, boys outperformed girls after a decade as the former scored a passing percentage of 99.30% while girls recorded 98.86%. Though, in class XII results, girls maintained the tradition of outperforming the boys as they scored 99.71% while the latter scored 99.40%. A combined total of 2.71 lakh students were registered for this year’s class X and class XII board exams. In class X UBSE board exams, more than 1.48 lakh candidates were registered while in class XII, over 1.22 lakh were registered. The results were prepared on an alternative assessment scheme as board exams could not be held this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As far as class XII board results are concerned, only 10% weightage was given to performance in class XII while 50% and 40% weightage was given to class X and XI, respectively. Even in class X, the majority of weightage was given to performance in class IX. “I want to appreciate all the students of this year because their studies got badly disrupted due to Covid-19 yet they never backed out and continued with their academic studies,” said Arvind Pandey, state education minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/class-x-xii-record-high-passing-percentage/articleshow/84929647.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Mumbai||SGNP in need of funds for upkeep even as ‘realtors owe it over Rs 170 crore’||MUMBAI: Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), the world’s most unique urban forest, urgently needs funds for its upkeep. The Covid pandemic, with its restrictions on movement of people, has hit the park’s finances hard. Worse, the park is owed over Rs 170 crore by various developers, according to data accessed by TOI through the Right to Information Act. If developers were to pay this amount, it would help in better maintenance of the park and upkeep of wild animals at the rescue centre. The amount, called ‘Compensation Fund’ was to be paid to the park for permission for development/construction within 10 sqkm of the park’s eco-sensitive zone (ESZ). The 10sqkm ESZ around the park came into being around 2010-11. This was reduced to 0-4 sq km in 2016. The ESZ is a buffer zone around the park where development is regulated to protect the park. Most of the defaulting projects are in Thane and Palghar (Vasai) districts. One of the biggest defaulters, according to the information accessed through RTI, is Dosti Enterprises which owes the park Rs 39 crore for its Rs 1,956 crore Balkumbh project. Deepak Goradia, proprietor, Dosti Enterprises and president of CREDAI-MCHI said they have already written to the government that their project is 2.5 km from SGNP in Thane. He, however, said he was not aware when the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) clearance was obtained for the project. Forest officials said one of the biggest flaws in granting clearance was that there was no condition to first pay the 2% Compensation Fund and then issue the NOC. “The developers directly download the NOC from the NBWL website and submit it to the planning authority that is approving their project,” said a senior officer from the forest department. When park authorities asked civic bodies like Thane Municipal Corporation not to issue occupation certificate (OC), they were informed that if the commencement certificate has been issued, the OC cannot be withheld. The department has now asked the NBWL to issue clearances in two stages -- first an in-principle approval and a final approval only after all conditions are met. For now, the park is struggling as its daily earnings from ticket sales have plummeted from Rs 12 crore annually to around Rs 4 crore. “We are waiting for the restrictions to be lifted as monsoon is the peak time when the park has maximum visitors,” said G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator of forests, SGNP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sgnp-in-need-of-funds-for-upkeep-even-as-realtors-owe-it-over-rs-170cr-in-mumbai/articleshow/84936496.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Dehradun||Kin of man who died in elephant attack question forest dept’s ‘laxity’||Dehradun: Days after a 27-year-old man was trampled to death by a rogue tusker, his kin and friends have questioned the ‘laxity’ in patrolling by the forest department. They have also dismissed the forest department claim that the victim was stopped at a check post and was asked not to cross through the forest area of Neelkanth-Kandi Road. The victim, Manish Dobriyal, riding back home from work on a bike with another man, was trampled to death by a jumbo at Gohri range of Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) at 1 am on July 26. Shubham Dobhal, the man riding pillion with the victim, told TOI, “We were not alerted by anyone, neither at the Tapovan check post nor the Garud Chatti check post.” Echoing similar sentiments, Prateek Bahuguna, a former colleague and friend of the victim, told TOI, “They were not stopped by anyone from using the stretch. Besides, police took almost 6-7 hours to pick up the body from the spot.” Notably, three people have lost their lives in jumbo attacks so far this year on that road. When queried on the issue, Pramod Uniyal, inspector of Laman Jhula police station, told TOI, “We waited for sunrise to recover the body as per the instructions of the forest department. The forest officials asked us to not venture in the area before dawn, fearing a similar elephant attack.” Meanwhile, Dheer Singh, officer, Gohri range, told TOI, “The Gohri range spans across 10,500 hectares (almost), encompassing 34 villages. The tiger reserve is divided between the core and the buffer zone. Post sunset, no one is allowed to pass through the road. They shouldn’t have used the 45-km-long stretch after midnight. Whether they were stopped at the checkpoints is yet to be confirmed. As per preliminary information, they were stopped.” Recently, Rajiv Bhartari, the head of the forest force, had sent an alert to all the officials to take immediate steps in cases of human-wildlife conflict and draft a proper report regarding the incident so that such accidents can be averted in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kin-of-man-who-died-in-elephant-attack-question-forest-depts-laxity/articleshow/84929772.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Pune||Pune: Land sharks eye prime plots in suburbs, go for the kill||PUNE: Land grabbing and encroachments, always a lurking menace, have reared their ugly head in the months following last year’s lockdown. Many parts of Pune, especially developing suburbs, have witnessed a surge in land grabbing, encroachments and deals involving forged documents to wrest ownership of prime land. Since 2019, the Hadapsar, Wanowrie and Kondhwa police stations have received 23 such complaints. “The number of such FIRs is low compared to actual incidents,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta tells TOI, adding, “Landowners who have been affected must approach police; we will do everything possible to help them.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil says they have arrested and filed chargesheets against the accused in most of the 23 cases. “Those on the run will be arrested soon,” she says, adding that no FIRs are registered in civil dispute cases. “We have also helped some landowners, including an Indian origin woman residing in America, get back their property without litigation,” Patil says. The merger of fringe villages into the municipal limits, making Pune the largest municipality in Asia; government projects like Smart Cities Mission; and the proposed international airport — which instantly increased the real estate value — have made untended — and unattended — land ripe for the plucking. In recent years, several aggrieved landowners, alleging sale of their property without their consent, have approached the police; all complaints are pending inquiry with either the economic offences wing, the anti-extortion cell, or police stations concerned. It’s not just privately owned land; even government land is not spared — DCP Patil says huge tracts of land owned by the state women and child department and forest department in Wanowrie and Kondhwa have been usurped. “We have sent letters to the authorities concerned to barricade their premises, install sign boards, appoint a fulltime caretaker and be vigilant,” she says. Real estate developers say land has become extremely attractive in light of rapid urbanisation, IT hubs, and increase in business activities in fringe areas. “Criminals and organized crime syndicates from Hadapsar, Kalepadal and Mohammadwadi have become emboldened; even political and social organizations are involved,” says Nilesh Magar, director of Magarpatta Township Development and Construction Company. Some legitimate landowners also resort to underhanded tactics. “Many ancestral landowners sell properties by forging signatures of their relatives to deprive them of their share. The legal heirs then move the civil court, tying the land up in litigation,” says Sunil Tarte, vice-president of Amanora Township. Tarte adds that sometimes when there’s a delay in updating land records following a sale, the original owners mortgage the property and obtain fraudulent loans. Lawyer Prakash Savarkar, who specialises in civil disputes, claims land laws are often not implemented properly. “Open spaces are usurped. All documents are notarised on old stamp papers and no sale deed is executed. The buyers and sellers get monetary benefits, but the state loses out on revenue,” says Savarkar. “Land sharks identify properties whose owners died long ago without informing their heirs, or land that is fenced-in but unused for decades. They forge documents and sell the land or construct buildings and sell flats illegally,” explains land rights activist Salim Mulla. DCP Patil says once they receive a complaint, they conduct a preliminary inquiry and verify the documents provided by both parties. “If the agreement is registered, then revenue officials will verify the authenticity of the documents. We seek legal opinion and take action against land-grabbers,” Patil explains. If an agreement is simply notarised on stamp paper and not registered with the revenue department, the police then record statements of people residing in the vicinity of the disputed land, question witnesses and verify the credentials of the parties in dispute. “These measures help us identify genuine landowners/buyers and take action against the wrong-doers,” adds Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/land-sharks-eye-prime-plots-in-suburbs-go-for-the-kill/articleshow/84933599.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 75,000 shots to give vaccination drive a booster dose||LUCKNOW: The district health department is planning to administer a whopping 75,000 doses of Covid vaccine in a single day in Lucknow on Tuesday. If achieved, the target would be three-times of the record of highest Covid inoculations in a day in the district. To accomplish the plan, special camps will be organised in housing societies, apartments, residential colonies, government and private offices, markets and places of worship. Health officers are coordinating with resident welfare associations, companies, traders’ associations and religious heads. These camps will be in addition to the vaccination centres being run at district hospitals, medical education institutes, community and primary health centres and private hospitals. “Special camps will arrange logistics, while we will provide inoculators. We have around 650 vaccinators apart from observation staff and data entry operators. A vaccinator can inoculate around 150 people in a day,” said district immunization officer Dr MK Singh. The decision has been taken by the state government considering the demands of the resident welfare associations, government departments and private companies to organise special camps for their people. “Vaccines will be stored at our health centres and will be delivered to special camps in the morning. The drive will run from 9am to 5pm. People can simply walk-in with a government recognised identity card for on-the-spot registration,” said Dr Singh. “The existing centres will continue with the format of catering to both who come after booking the slot or prefer on-spot registration,” he said. “We have placed the demand for over one lakh vaccine shots, of which 75,000 doses – 67,000 of Covishield and 8,000 Covaxin – will be used on Tuesday. The spots for special camps will be finalised on Monday,” he added. Probable centres include Utrethia, Raniganj, Pandeyganj, Rajendranagar, La Touche Road, Electronic market, Maharaja Agrasen College and Gomtinagar Eldeco Colony. “At Sadar Gurdwara camp, 4,000 people will be vaccinated on Tuesday. So far, 25,330 people have been vaccinated here,” said president of the gurdwara committee Harpal Singh Jaggi. Times ViewIt’s a good move to rapidly vaccinate the maximum number of people against Covid-19 with at least one dose before September-October when the third wave has been predicted to hit the city. However, health officers will have to ensure that Covid safety protocols are followed at all the special camps where huge turnout is expected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/75k-shots-to-give-vax-drive-a-booster-dose/articleshow/84935609.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code and Standards of Performance of Distribution Licensees including Power Quality) Regulations, 2020, has empowered consumers for claiming compensation for delay in addressing different issues related to restoration of power supply. Experts, however, have said that many consumers were in dark about such enabling provisions framed for them by Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). “The energy sector regulator MERC has framed standards of performance for MSEDCL and other licensees with an aim to improve efficiency of these distribution companies and avoid possible inconvenience faced by consumers. Citizens should exercise their right in the light of these rules without any hesitation,” Hemant Kapadia, former authorised consumer representative at MERC, said on Saturday. As per the laid down procedure, consumers first need to register their complaint mentioning the claim of compensation through the official website of mahadiscom. In case of any unsatisfactory response, the zone-level commission grievance redressal forum and electricity ombudsman (Nagpur and Mumbai) are the two further levels of grievance redressal available for consumers.

---||Aurangabad||Strong suspicion cannot take form of legal proof: HC||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, while hearing an appeal against conviction and life imprisonment in a more-than-a-decade-old murder case, has ruled: “Suspicion, however strong it may be, cannot take the form of legal proof.” The division bench of the HC, comprising Justice VK Jadhav and Justice SG Dige, has quashed and set aside the conviction by Ahmednagar sessions court, granted in the year 2013, to two convicts — Dada, alias Mahendra Jagtap, and Rohan, alias Sunny Hazare. “We are of the firm opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish the case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellants accused. According to us, at the most, strong suspicion is created against the appellants-accused suggesting their involvement in the crime. The said suspicion, however strong it may be, cannot take the form of legal proof,” ruled the division bench of the HC while granting relief to the duo. Citing that “no useful purpose would be served by allowing the same,” the HC also turned down a criminal application by prosecution seeking permission to adduce additional evidence by the prosecution. As per the prosecution theory, a man identified as Kiran Bhingardive had left home on October 9, 2010, informing at home that he was going out of town with Rohan Hazare, and never returned. On October 18, 2010, Kiran’s brother lodged a missing complaint with the Topkhana police station. During the preliminary probe, police found that a body of similar description was found on October 10, 2010, under the limits of the Shrigonda police station. Based on the autopsy report, a case for murder and for destruction of evidence was registered against unidentified suspects. During the course of probe and the statements recorded, police arrested the accused duo for allegedly bludgeoned Kiran to death. As per the prosecution theory, trio stayed at a hotel in Shrigonda, when Rs 5,000 went missing from Rohan and Jagtap suspected Kiran. This led to an heated argument between the two. This was followed by the accused duo taking the victim man to a deserted place and allegedly bludgeoning him to death. Contesting on behalf of the accused duo, lawyer Naseem Shaikh submitted that the prosecution case entirely rests upon circumstantial evidence and there is no direct evidence. The lawyer, while challenging ‘last seen together’ theory, contested that “The prosecution has failed to prove the case by establishing the chain of circumstantial evidence and also failed to establish the motive on the part of the appellants-accused to commit murder of deceased.” He even pointed out that the second accused did not even know the deceased before meeting him at hotel and so there was no motive for any previous grudge. On hearing both the sides, HC also observed some contradictions in the prosecution theory with that of some witnesses, and set aside the conviction by trial court and acquitted the duo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/strong-suspicion-cannot-take-form-of-legal-proof-hc/articleshow/84931576.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Farm organisation president Joginder Singh Ugrahan announced the formation of Uttarakhand state committee, coinciding with the 81st martyrdom day of freedom fighter Udham Singh, in whose name the district stands in the hilly state. After paying tributes to Udham Singh, an ad hoc committee was set up to coordinate with farmers to strengthen the unit. Farmer and peoples’ poet Balli Singh Cheema from Terai region of Uttarakhand played a pivotal in formation of the state unit of farm organisation. The 69-year-old is popular among hilly people due to his poems. He said, “After participating in farmer struggle for long, the Uttarakhand farmers decided to get together under the banner of BKU Ekta Ugrahan. The farmers want to fight collectively for their issues and now with the organisation we will be effectively take on the authorities. “ Joginder Singh Ugrahan said activists from Uttarakhand were visiting the farm protest sites at the borders of Delhi and had shown willingness to come together and have formed an ad hoc committee to mobilise and take the grievances of the farmers at the centre stage. Earlier, Haryana-based farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni, too, had formed a Uttarakhand state unit of his outfit. The assembly elections in the hill state are due early next year alongwith Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bku-ugrahan-expands-base-in-ukhand/articleshow/84933597.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Estranged wife has no right to flat if rent deal ends’||MUMBAI: Accepting that a woman does not have the right over property rented by the husband when an agreement is terminated, a magistrate court rejected a plea by a British entrepreneur who insisted her estranged husband let her stay on in their flat. The husband had provided another one BHK flat to the woman in a neighbouring building in Vile Parle and agreed to pay the monthly rent, but she moved court seeking possession of the disputed apartment. She alleged that the new apartment was lower than her current standard. “...documents on record prima facie do not show the husband illegally and forcefully dispossessed the wife from the flat, therefore the applicant is not entitled urgent relief of restoration of possession…” the court said. It observed that prima facie the husband secured a one-bedroom flat with all amenities for the woman in the vicinity as alternative accommodation. “Therefore, the woman is not entitled to urgent relief (alternative accommodation, licence fees or security deposit) as prayed. Therefore, the application is not liable to be allowed,” the court said. Opposing her plea, the husband’s advocate, Kanupriya Kejriwal, told court the now-estranged couple had been living in the flat from their wedding in 2017 till November 2019. The husband had left the home and filed complaints against the woman for cruelty. In January 2020, the husband’s friend, the landlord, sent an email requesting the flat to be vacated. But the woman refused. The man claimed he had rented an apartment for her. The woman had filed a domestic violence complaint against the husband and in-laws in 2020. Seeking interim relief, she said the man had left her at the mercy of his friend, the landlord, after he walked out. She said there was no leave and licence agreement for the flat and on the pretext of discussing it, the landlord invited her to a restaurant on November 25, 2020. She alleged that when she returned home, she found all belongings were removed by her estranged husband and his friend’s father. The woman said she was forced to live with a friend and did not have family in India. She added that the husband had no authority to restore possession to the wife. The court accepted the submissions. “The order deals with a key issue that young couples face today while dealing with a divorce. As most urban, young, professional couples choose to live separately in rented premises from the beginning of married life, as opposed to living with parents in an ownership house, the ‘matrimonial house’, for all practical purposes, is the rented premises, and very few rights can be effectively asserted on such premises,” Kejriwal said. Her plea cannot be enforced as the husband had no right on the premises as the landlord had chosen to terminate their leave and licence agreement||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-estranged-wife-has-no-right-to-flat-if-rent-deal-ends/articleshow/84936498.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation seal on doorstep vaccine drive||KOLKATA: Bedridden due to a spinal cord injury, Lake View Road resident Dipti Mukherjee had given up hope of getting the Covid vaccine. Her son Diptiman Mukherjee, who works in a private firm, has been running from pillar to post to arrange for the septuagenarian’s vaccination, but in vain. Similarly, octogenarian Amit Ganguli, though very much capable of moving around, cannot stand for long. The retired state government officer — a resident of Regent Estate — has not had the courage to go to the Covid vaccination centre (CVC) near his home and queue up for the shot. “Waiting in queue is tough. But I am more afraid of catching the infection while waiting for the inoculation,” said Ganguli. For Mukherjee, Ganguli and thousands of other elderly, infirm, bedridden or terminally ill people in the city who haven’t been able to take the vaccine despite being eligible for the shot since March 1, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) will now administer the shots at their doorsteps. An earlier attempt by a ward coordinator to offer door-step vaccination in Bhowanipore had been shot down by civic health officials last month. The vaccination-at-home scheme was introduced by Ashim Bose, a Trinamool ward coordinator in some select Bhowanipore neighbourhoods. However, the KMC brass slammed the brakes on such a vaccination programme citing that the scheme had no official approval. This time, the civic body has decided to extend the facility across the city. A KMC health team will visit homes of those who are bedridden and have been unable to get the jabs from either a government or a private vaccination centre. The civic body’s vaccination team will also reach out to citizens who have crossed 80 and are either too frail to visit a Covid vaccination clinic or afraid to encounter the crowd. Sources in the KMC health department said arrangements for the roll-out of the special door-step vaccination scheme was comp-lete and the civic body will initiate the process by early next week. According to rules devised by the KMC health department, the family of a citizen will be required to approach the nearest KMC vaccination centre and book a ‘vaccination slot at home’ after furnishing an age proof in case the person is over 80 or a medical certificate in case the person is bedridden or terminally ill. After examining the certificate, the medical officer will book a slot and fix a date for the recipient, depending on the availability of vaccines. A photocopy of a government ID proof — Aadhaar, PAN, voter card or passport — can be submitted while booking the slot. According to the chair-man of the KMC board of administrators (BoA), Firhad Hakim, the vaccination-at-home scheme was the need of the hour as helpless citizens had been asking the civic body to offer some kind of remedy. “We have decided to introduce the vaccination-at-home scheme considering the plight of those who can’t visit our clinics due to various types of impediments. We solicit cooperation from the citizens in making the scheme a success,” Hakim said on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-seal-on-doorstep-vaccine-drive/articleshow/84931610.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Anger against low vax boils over after recipients waiting in queue fail to get shot||KOLKATA: A scuffle broke out between police personnel and vaccine recipients at ESI Hospital in Maniktala on Saturday morning after some tried to barge into the hospital demanding coupons for vaccination. The hospital, which has a capacity to inoculate 1,000-1,200 a day, had stopped issuing coupons after its quota of recipients for the day had been reached. Police had to be called in to control the crowd and vaccination had to be suspended for some time. It resumed very soon, though. ESI Manikatala is among the government’s mega vaccination centres that have been inoculating more than a thousand per day. SSKM Hospital and Ahindra Mancha have been leading the pack with 1,500 doses a day. ESI authorities claimed that a majority of their recipients are now from the districts, who have been queueing up a day in advance. “We had reached our capacity and could not accommodate more but some refused to listen. We have two counters and can’t exceed our capacity of around 1,200. There was chaos for some time till the police came in and controlled the situation,” said ESI Hospital MSVP Mayukh Roy. The incident at Maniktala is a reflection of the growing unease and at times unrest in queues across Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) as uncertainty over whether one would get the shot after spending hours in the queue is triggering anxiety, frustration and frayed tempers, often degenerating into jostling and fisticuffs. At some CVCs, including one situated near Gariahat, there were allegations of spots in the queue being sold at Rs 100-Rs 150. “There are youths from local slums who queue up very early, much before sunrise, and then leave the slots to people desperate for a jab against a premium,” one of the recipients who had paid Rs 100 for a slot in the queue said. Civic health officials said the problem was triggered due to the demand-supply mismatch. “First, it isn’t certain how many jabs will be given at a CVC daily. Since it depends on availability, it could be 50 one day when availability is poor and 100 or even 200 the next when supply improves. For people in the queue, there is no way of knowing how many will be vaccinated at the centre that day. Thus, after hours of waiting, when they learn that they will not get a slot for the jab, it naturally leads to extreme disappointment,” an official at a CVC explained. There was no resentment at the KMC-run CVCs though as supply improved on Saturday. “On an average, we could administer 200 shots at each of the 195 vaccination clinics. So, there was no question of any resentment,” said a civic health official. The state government had more than 28 lakh doses in stock on Saturday. The next consignment — 4 lakh Covaxin doses — is expected by Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anger-against-low-vax-boils-over-after-recipients-waiting-in-queue-fail-to-get-shot/articleshow/84931625.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The decision was taken during the core-committee meeting chaired by the chief minister for measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.The revision came a day after the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) and the Gujarat Traders’ Federation made a representation to the state government seeking a deadline extension.Despite a series of drives organized by civic authorities in Ahmedabad and other cities, many office-goers and traders are yet to get their first shot, according to industry sources.“It was good of the government to extend the deadline, but it must also ensure adequate supply of vaccines to ensure that all traders and shop workers are vaccinated in time. If supply is not adequate enough to meet demand, how does one expect traders to voluntarily get vaccinated,” said GTF president Jayendra Tanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vaccination-deadline-for-traders-extended-to-aug-15/articleshow/84933671.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Proposed plastic waste rules rattle packaging manufacturers||After battling the dip in revenues due to the economic slowdown post lockdown, plastic packaging manufacturers are staring at yet another roadblock: the draft plastic waste management (amendment) rules 2021. The draft rules proposing to ban manufacturing of plastic carry bags and commodities of less than 120-micron thickness, effective from September 30, have sparked fear and concerns among manufacturers, as they will be forced to either shut production or make fresh capital expenditures."In order to manufacture plastic bags above 120-micron, our machinery needs to be upgraded, which will come at a cost. Manufacturers will have to invest in upgrading their manufacturing facilities. This will be an added cost, and making a fresh investment is not viable especially amid slowing demand since the pandemic," said Prerak Patel, president, Ahmedabad Plastic Manufacturers’ Association."If the new rules are implemented from September 30, many industries will be compelled to downsize or shut down production," said Patel.Gujarat is home to some 5,000 plastic manufacturing units, of which 5% units will stare at a total shutdown, and many others will have to suspend operations, if the new rules are implemented, according to industry estimates.According to plastic manufacturers, a manufacturing unit of plastic packaging requires a minimum capital of Rs 20-25 lakh, as not only the manufacturing but even the cutting and sealing machines will need to be replaced."Besides, existing equipment will need to be scrapped, which is a waste of prior investment. At a time when industries are facing a shortfall in revenue, absorbing additional infrastructure costs will not be possible. In fact, most units are micro small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and due to the drop in demand, they don’t even spend on routine upgrades unless necessary," said a manufacturer based in Ahmedabad.Plastic makers have made a series of representations before the state as well as the Centre seeking to relax the norms and also provide an alternative to plastic before banning it completely. "We have urged the government to limit the ban to plastics up to 60-65 microns. We are hopeful that the government will take our appeal into consideration," said Bhagwanbhai Patel, president, GSPMA.An increase in the thickness will add to raw material costs say plastic manufacturers. "Our costs of production will almost double raising the price of the end-product. This will also increase costs of packaging and other materials," said Patel.Slump in demand hits plastic packaging sales: The proposed change in rules would be enforced at a time when the industry is already reeling from a revenue shortfall triggered by a reduction in demand. Shailesh Patel, ex-president, GSPMA, said, "Plastic packaging material and single-use plastic items are supplied widely to the hospitality sector, traders, food processing industries and other sectors. A decline in demand across most of these sectors indirectly impacted the sale of plastic materials too. The industry in Gujarat is currently operating at 70% of its total installed capacity, which clearly shows a decline in demand. The additional expenditure will cause a further decline in the industry’s revenues."Industry demands uniform laws, focus on waste management: Manufacturers have demanded that the Centre imposes uniform laws across the country. "With implementation left to states, there is no uniformity in laws across different states. This puts manufacturers in a fix because there is no clarity on what to manufacture, and where to supply," said Pinkal Shah, a plastic manufacturer in Halol. Pruthviraj Dhoka, president, Halol Plastic Association (HPA), said, "Most plastic manufacturers are MSMEs, and banning plastics will put employment and livelihood of thousands at stake. Instead, the government must focus on strengthening waste management rules."(With inputs from Tushar Tere in Vadodara)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/proposed-plastic-waste-rules-rattle-packaging-manufacturers/articleshow/84935665.cms||Niyati Parikh

The report found that around 2.8 million square feet of warehousing space was leased in 2020-21, representing a fall of around 42% as against the 2019-20 fiscal (4.8 million square feet). This was the joint-highest fall in demand for warehousing space across the country, with Ahmedabad also recording a similar dip, with slightly higher absolute numbers. The pandemic affected national demand for warehousing space in the 2020-21 fiscal, with only Chennai recording a 4% increase. The market was largely flat in Bengaluru. Around 31.7 million square feet of warehousing space was leased nationally in 2020-21, an annual fall of around 23%. “FY21 was a challenging year for the warehousing sector in Pune due to the extended lockdown during the first wave of the pandemic. On the positive side, we are witnessing stronger demand from industrial segments, which make up 66% of transactions. The industrial demand in Pune, which was earlier concentrated around automobile segments, is now coming from diverse sectors,” said Paramvir Singh Paul, Pune branch director of Knight Frank. The lion’s share of transactions in the local market took place in the Chakan-Talegaon region, representing about three-fourths of the market. Knight Frank added that high land rates in Chakan were driving companies towards Talegaon and other areas — Wagholi and Ranjangaon. Industry bodies said the warehousing market would need time to recover. “The effects of the first and second waves, and the resultant lockdowns, are clearly visible in the demand for warehousing space in Pune. People are currently not making investment decisions. The demand for commercial spaces (such as warehouses) will also pick up when people make investment decisions. Fully vaccinated people should also be allowed to go to ,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/warehousing-space-demand-shrunk-40-in-20-21-report/articleshow/84933641.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Two parallel tunnels have been excavated on the stretch for Up and Down lines. The first tunnel boring machine (TBM) had reached the Budhwar Peth site 10 days ago. Both the machines covered around 1.9km. The MahaMetro (Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited) officials stated that around 50% tunnelling work had been completed so far. The excavation of the tunnel on the remaining stretch of around 2km from Budhwar Peth to Swargate would be expedited. “We started excavation from Agriculture College towards Civil Court in the first phase of the tunnelling work. It was followed by the second phase from Civil Court to Budhwar Peth. In the third phase, we shall complete the remaining portion of tunnel work from Budhwar Peth to Swargate,” said Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR), MahaMetro. Another MahaMetro official said there was no hurdle during the excavation of both the tunnels from Agriculture College to Budhwar Peth. The tunnels are around 18 to 25 metres below the ground surface. The path of the tunnels has been marked. Now, the installation of other infrastructure like rail tracks, cables for signalling and telecommunication, and power would begin in the completed portion of the tunnels, the official added. Elaborating on the remaining work, an official said the excavation of one tunnel from Swargate towards Budhwar Peth had started. The MahaMetro is planning to install a machine that has reached the Budhwar Peth site for excavating the other tunnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metros-2nd-tbm-reaches-budhwar-peth-station-site/articleshow/84933657.cms||---

The day was soon to be recorded in history as the first organised battle the British lost after their fall in Kremlin, Russia, against a united Indian population. And it was not just that the British under the leadership of British officer Henry Lawrence bit dust at the hands of the Indians comprising rebels from the British army, peasants, farmers and Taluqdaars, but it also became a lasting example of Hindu-Muslim unity against the East India Company (EIC). The battle also marked the beginning of the siege of the Residency which lasted for the longest time, until September 1857. The battle cries of ‘Bajrang Bali, Ya Ali’ and ‘Ek pita ki dui santaan, ek Hindu ek Musalmaan’ along with the Mohammadi and Mahaveer flags were first raised in Awadh at the Battle of Chinhat when Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Taluqdaars and farmers came together to fight the British. The locals were also supported by British trained soldiers who had mutineered from the EIC army and were led in the cause by mutineer Barkat Ahmad and rebel leader Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah of Faizabad (Awadh). The British were in doldrums and had no option but to return to the Residency for its defence followed closely by the rebel troops. Some historical accounts mention that the British were outnumbered by the rebels with the latter force somewhere between 12,000 to 15,000 and the British just 300 in number, at other places it is said that ratio was 6,000 rebels to 600 British soldiers. That the battle of Chinhat was a gross miscalculation of their might by the British is a well-accepted fact by Indian historians and in British correspondence that still exists. Days before the battle, the British had started preparing defence of the Residency and on information from local spies had anticipated a rebel rousing from Ismailganj area near Chinhat village. Captain Birch in his correspondence from the day, as mentioned in ‘The Siege of Lucknow’ — the published diary of Lady Inglis — wrote that Lawrence as advised by his younger staff decided to nip the rebels in the bud, a mistake coupled with the heat, hunger and lack of trust from the native army who continued to defect to support the rebels. “At six am on the morning of June 30 the force formed up between the gate of the Residency and the iron bridge. Captain Hamilton Forbes, with a party of Sikh cavalry, twenty-five of H.M.’s 32nd under Captain Stevens and twenty-five Sikhs, formed the advanced guard. And here I must mention what I consider was a great mistake, not halting the men for refreshment...and the force advanced with empty stomachs, under a burning sun. Heavy guns opened fire, the 32nd being kept in reserve. Our artillery firing over our heads broke the centre of the enemy. These were so numerous that they divided into wings and came down on both flanks. I am told that the reason we did not advance was because there was treachery in our ranks,” wrote Captain Birch. Losing the battle of Chinhat at the hands of the Indians was not just the only formidable loss for the British, but the battle also caused them the loss of at least 200 soldiers. Henry Lawrence too later succumbed to wounds1. “A lot of things around the Chinhat battle were not documented by the British with them being losers, but oral history has clearly maintained many indigenous slogans used at that time. The Mangal Pandey Aalah recounts events after his martyrdom going on to tell about the battle cry of Ya Ali, Bajrang Bali that was used then,” said historian Amresh Mishra. Mishra, who has also mentioned the same in his book ‘War of Civilisations: India AD 1857’, added, “There were other slogans used too that included Allah o Akbar, Har Har Mahadev and the one saying Deen, deen, deen, Hindu aur Musalaman ka ek hee deen referring to the righteous call of duty towards the nation being the same.” While the incentive to curb the rebellion was playing at the highest in Lawrence’s mind, he was lured by a bunch of rebels at Kukrail bridge only to be placed in battle in front of an army of hundreds hiding behind village walls and mango groves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/when-united-battle-cries-of-bajrang-bali-ya-ali-defeated-the-mighty-british/articleshow/84935646.cms||Yusra Husain

The faculty currently has 7,800 students in first year bachelors of commerce (BCom) and can stretch itself to accommodate 9,000 students if one puts together the current infrastructure of the four units of Faculty of Commerce and the infrastructure available at M K Amin College of Commerce at Padra. This year, however, as many as 16,292 students have cleared their class 12 in general stream in Vadodara alone. Students from outside Vadodara including other districts of Gujarat too apply for admission at the faculty. MSU is exploring the possibility of utilising buildings of other faculties to accommodate more students in BCom. “University is exploring the possibility of utilising buildings of other faculties in specific slots so that more students can be accommodated. We believe, we will be able to manage between 11,000 to 12,000 students,” said faculty dean professor Ketan Upadhyay. The officials believe that the rush of applicants from outside Vadodara might be less this year due to Covid-19 induced pandemic and the fact that hostels have opened in restricted manner only for postgraduate students. The university provides admission at Padra college to those students from outside Vadodara who don’t want admission in higher payment category in Vadodara. The number of such students might see a decline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/with-100-results-msus-commerce-faculty-to-see-major-rush/articleshow/84930309.cms||---

Delhi government has established an integrated multi-purpose centre that provides a range of community-based services for identification of substance abuse, motivation, counselling and de-addiction, aftercare and rehabilitation. The centre also aims to create awareness and educate people about the ill-effects of alcoholism and drug usage. Women and child development minister Rajendra Pal Gautam inaugurated the centre, Suryoday Kendra, in Sultanpuri on Saturday. The centre will aid the overall well being of people with substance abuse problems and provide skill-based learning to them. The minister said that establishing such centres in each district can help combat drug abuse and will be opened in all districts in the long-run.

The Suryoday Kendra is also equipped with a digital library, which will help children access free online coaching and intellectual stimulation. It will also provide skill-based learning to both adults and children, said Rashmi Singh, director women and child development department. “Lack of education and awareness attracts children towards substance abuse.

The list will be given chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for finalising the names. Once the names are finalised, dossier preparation will be started. A consultant will also be hired for the purpose,” culture and tourism minister V Srinivas Goud told TOI on Saturday. He said there were many places in the state which qualify for the world heritage status. After getting the world recognition, the state government has decided to develop the temples and create a buffer around Ramappa temple to protect the monument. As number of tourists have already started thronging the Ramappa temple, the tourism department is planning to construct hotels in nearby places. The minister said the main Ramappa temple was in the purview of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), while three temples near Pakala Lake need to be developed. The government would also see no structures come up in the buffer zone of the main temple, he added. “To promote tourism in Ramappa and surrounding areas, the government is planning to develop ‘Kakatiya Circuit’,” Srinivas Goud said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-ramappa-state-eyes-unesco-tag-for-more-sites/articleshow/84933705.cms||Koride Mahesh

He had been named in a case of Rs 3.90 lakh fraud reported with the Panchkula police. Crime branch in-charge, inspector Aman Kumar said that the accused had been identified as Anand, 28, a resident of Govindpur village, district Dhanbad, Jharkhand. Police said that Anand, a science graduate, also had a fruit and vegetable business. Sub-inspector Tejinder Pal of the crime branch visited Jharkhand and said that the accused was arrested from Jamtara area. “The accused had great links in his neighborhood and used to distribute money to his neighbors to hide his identity and the public misled us while we reached the address,” he said. He added that most of the SIM cards and bank accounts used by the accused were taken on fake ids to prevent identification. Inspector Aman said one Devraj Mahajan, a resident of MDC, Panchkula filed a complaint on June 22 saying that some unknown person called him and asked him to update KYC of his bank, failing which his account would stop functioning. On the pretext of updating the KYC, he asked for OTP (One Time Password) nine times and duped the victim of Rs 3.90 lakh. A case has been registered under Section 420 of the IPC at Sector 5 police station. A local court granted six-day police remand of the accused. Police said they would try to arrest more people involved. DCP Mohit Handa said, “One must never share their OTP or personal bank details with anyone.

With the fresh round of funding, the startup now aims to collaborate with more schools and upgrade its technology offerings. "We currently work with some 250 schools across the country. With fresh funds, we are looking to expand our reach to some 2,000 schools in India by September 2022," said Sushil Agrawal, founder and CEO, Saarthi Pedagogy, which is also eyeing international expansion. "We would further channelize funds for improvement and upgrade our products with a sound AI-mechanism. Through data science, our product will be able to deliver better decision-making," added Agrawal.

Citing lack of funds to maintain and run the huge complex on its own in the long term, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has already invited expression of interest from government departments and institutions, public sector undertakings and multilateral institutions through a public notice for leasing of office spaces measuring around 1 lakh sq feet area. “The complex, which will have three blocks (A, B and C), has been constructed over a plot of 7,132 sq metre. While Block B (with ground and five floors) has been in use as a zonal office, the rest two blocks (A and C) will be leased out completely. The last date for receiving expression of interest is August 17. The approved bidders can develop the office complex after minimum modification,” said an EDMC official. The long-awaited building complex has a provision for two parking lots in the basements and a lot of open space on the ground floor for movement of vehicles. “The fully air-conditioned zonal office building (Shahdara south) is close to metro stations and other places like shopping malls, hospitals and educational institutions. The airport will be just around 30 km from this place,” said the official. “Besides office spaces, there will be a parking lot to accommodate at least 216 vehicles and a dedicated road to reach the complex. To avoid chaos during peak hour, provisions for multiple lifts and staircases have been made,” the official added. Officials claimed that the building will be self-sustained in various ways as there will be a dual wastewater system to treat the wastewater and reuse it for flushing purposes again in the washrooms. For solid waste management, the civic body plans to install a composting plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/before-finishing-touches-edmc-to-lease-its-office/articleshow/84933788.cms||Vibha Sharma

At Civil Hospital, many such duos and trios were formed over the past one-and-ahalf years as hundreds of junior doctors and resident doctors were pressed into the long Covid mission. While many got infected with Covid-19, Dr Neel Patel and Dr Pankaj Nanoda contracted the disease together! “I knew Pankaj before the pandemic as a surgery resident. I was pursuing my MD in pharmacology and was working on the side effects of a drug,” said Dr Patel. “As we became members of Junior Doctors Association (JDA) core committee, the bond was forged. We worked shoulder-to-shoulder for our treatment-onwheels initiative with which we gave treatment to severely ill patients in the queue outside the hospital.” But on May 14, the two friends tested positive one after another. “I considered myself a veteran, with infection in the first wave too!” Dr Patel said. “I was more worried about Pankaj as steroid treatment had started for us both. My tiffin would come from his home. We talked to each other over the phone or through friends to ensure that the other is doing fine.” Likewise, Dr Narendra Kumar and Dr Nikhil Chavda, resident doctors in community medicine, cemented a bond during the Covid period. “I’m from Chennai, and Nikhil made me feel at home over the past couple of years. We first got the Covid ward duties together, and then we were together for mucormycosis duty,” said Dr Kumar. Nikhil Chavda and Narendra KumarThe friends recently got dengue together, with Dr Kumar joking that they both might have been bitten by the same mosquito. “Having a good friend was very important during the pandemic, as it was physically and mentally exhausting,” he said. “At the end of the day you need a person to whom you can open your heart — share your fears and anxieties.” Dr Yogesh Mori, president of JDA, said that when the doctors were living virtually without their families for over a year, this ecosystem helped them cope with the challenges of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/camaraderie-healed-these-doctors-of-corona-scars/articleshow/84933937.cms||---

Following Singh’s letter bomb to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, alleging that Deshmukh had told Waze to mobilize Rs 100 crore per year from restaurant and bar owners, the state government had set up a one-man commission led by Justice Chandiwal. Its main task was to examine if Singh had submitted evidence to reveal any irregularity/offence by Deshmukh or any officer in his office. After the commission was set up on March 30, it had told Singh, Deshmukh, Waze, Palande, Patil and Bhujbal to submit affidavits on their contention on its terms of reference. Singh in his letter of July 5 raised preliminary objection to maintainability and purpose of the committee as issues raised before it had already been adjudicated by the high court and Supreme Court. Singh’s lawyer told the commission that in view of his ill health it may not be possibly for him to physically be present before it, so his statement should be recorded via video-conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/day-after-plea-rejected-panel-summons-ex-police-chief/articleshow/84936503.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

During the pandemic, the perception changed after police reached out and helped the people in need. But now the old perception is back. Why is public confidence not improving when it comes to police?” Modi asked, virtually addressing IPS probationers of the 71st and 72nd batch of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA), Hyderabad. “For country’s security, implementation of law and during crushing terror, police give their life. This challenge to change the police image by ending the negative perception, now depends on you,’’ he said, comparing police with NDRF. According to him, people have high respect for NDRF since they get confidence once they arrive during a calamity and that they risk their lives to save people. The passing out parade for the 178 probationers, including 33 lady probationers, and 34 trainee officers from Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Mauritius would be held at NPA campus at Shirvrampalli on August 6. Speaking about the challenges of cyber security and financial frauds, Modi said new research and experiments should be done and applied by police to avert the designs of criminals. While addressing the trainee officers, Prime Minister Modi said that whether the trainee officers would change the system or the system would change them, would depend on them during their career. “Whenever you are in field, whatever decisions you take, it must be in the country’s interest. You should always have the spirit of ‘Nation First, Always First’,’’ the PM said. Modi said that the induction of more women into the police department would only strengthen the police force. Interacting with some of the trainee officers, PM Modi said that financial frauds, targeting of women and children by cyber criminals was a major challenge. He also sought suggestions about what could be done to solve this issues by using technology. Apart from doing their routine policing responsibilities, the PM suggested woman IPS trainees to occasionally visit local girl schools and interact with the students as it would motivate them to achieve their goals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/modi-to-ips-officers-fight-negative-image/articleshow/84933733.cms||---

A local resident said, “We were asleep when the incident took place. I was supposed to go to my office in the morning at around 8.30 am but I found that the front door glass of the car was damaged, and the glass pieces were scattered everywhere in the cabin. I checked inside and found the music system missing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/thieves-break-front-door-glass-of-11-cars-to-steal-music-systems/articleshow/84935724.cms||---

He also expressed happiness that his son has decided to further his struggle for the deprived under the leadership of Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav. Rajbhar’s announcement of quitting BSP and active politics to hand over his political legacy to his son who is with Akhilesh Yadav is being seen as a major gain by the Samajwadi Party. “Sukhdev Rajbhar has been a hardcore BSP man and enjoys considerable clout in the Rajbhar community. He won the last assembly elections defeating Adil Sheikh of SP by a margin of 3,645 votes. Him announcing support to his son will benefit the SP in a big way,” said a senior SP leader. A five-time MLA and BSP veteran from Didarganj in Azamgarh, Sukhdev Rajbhar said he was crestfallen over the manner in which the Bahujan movement was getting weaker by the day and how the government was suppressing the cries of the underprivileged. Recalling his association with BSP founder Kanshi Ram and his struggle to voice concerns of his community, Rajbhar said he was unhappy in the manner in which the present government was muzzling voices of oppressed sections of the society and lamented that the Bahujan movement was no longer opposing it aggressively. “Hence I have decided to step back and make way for my son to take over my political legacy and continue with my struggle for the uplift of the poor. I am happy that he has decided to further our resolve to become the voice of the deprived under the leadership of Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav,” Rajbhar, stated in his letter he sent to Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati. In an apparent reference to sacking of former BSP state president and MLA from Akbarpur, Ram Achal Rajbhar, Sukhdev in his letter expressedconcern over the manner in which so-called ‘well-wishers’ were targeting the Rajbhar community .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/happy-to-see-son-under-akhileshs-tutelage-rajbhar/articleshow/84935721.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The garden department has told MMRDA that several trees under the girders and portions of the bridge can be saved and told them to come back with a revised proposal. More than 550 trees are proposed to be felled and transplanted for the upcoming Sewri-Worli connector that will connect Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) and a proposed redevelopment project at Worli. The BMC’s garden department last month issued a public notice inviting suggestions and objections for felling 329 trees. Apart from these, 123 trees are to be transplanted. TimesViewThe fact that the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act has been amended in an attempt to protect the state’s green cover is welcome. However, the state government must urgently constitute the state-level tree authority and take suggestions and objections from citizens on various tree-cutting proposals like the Sewri-Worli connector.“We conducted a hearing after the public notice. We have asked MMRDA to re-examine their proposal to see if maximum trees can be saved. We have asked to try and save some trees which come under the bridge portions since this is 30-40 metres tall and the trees are only around 5 metres tall, so they can be easily saved. We have returned the proposal to the MMRDA and have asked them to submit a revised proposal,” said a senior civic official. The BMC has also told the MMRDA that the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, which was amended in last month’s two-day monsoon session of the state legislature, states all proposals for cutting over 200 trees for any project must go to the Maharashtra State Tree Authority and not before the BMC’s Tree Authority. So, if MMDRA’s revised proposal seeks approval to hack over 300 trees for the Sewri-Worli connector, then it will have to be sent to the Maharashtra State Tree Authority and the proposal can’t be approved by the BMC’s Tree Authority, green activists have pointed out. The MMRDA started construction of MTHL in 2018. The 21.8-km-long six-lane road over bridge is expected to halve travel time between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The implementation of the Act was transferred from the urban development (UD) department to the environment department too. “It’s true that the Tree Act has been amended. After taking a hearing on the suggestions/objections, we have asked the MMRDA to try and reduce the number of trees that are to be cut. If they are less than 200, then we will take a call or then this proposal will have to be sent to the state government. We have informed MMRDA accordingly,” said a BMC official. The amendment states any proposal for felling of more than 200 trees of age five years or more, will be referred to Maharashtra State Tree Authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-bats-to-save-trees-along-sewri-worli-connector-route/articleshow/84936520.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Lucknow||BJP forms 5 new wings to reach out to people hit by pandemic||Lucknow: In a bid to mitigate the adverse impact of Covid-induced devastations, the Bharatiya Janata Party has created five new wings to cater to the needs of the people affected by the pandemic. The party will reach out to affected families and individuals and try to assuage their anger, if any, towards the government by listening to their woes. The five new wings are Pravasi Shramik Sampark Prakoshth for migrant workers, Shram Prakoshth for labourers, Rehdi-Patri Vyavasay Prakoshth for street-vendors, Divyang Prakoshth for physically challenged and Matsya Prakoshth for fisherman community. The office-bearers of Pravasi Shramik Sampark Prakoshth will contact migrant labourers and inform them about the works being done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for migrant workers. According to sources, the idea is to identify such people in the said category and ensure they come to the state to vote during elections. The exercise will be similar to the one carried out during village panchayat elections. Similarly, Rehdi-Patri Vyavasay Prakoshth will contact street vendors whose livelihood was affected during the pandemic. In all, BJP has 22 prakosths and 28 departments of which five are new. Sources said the party workers and the government have reached out to people and, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, helped them under free ration scheme and soft loans (for vendors). Sources said office-bearers of new wings have been directed to contact people under their respective categories and connect them with the party at the district level. The BJP is planning to launch a fresh membership drive from September 25 to urge such people to get associated with the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-forms-5-new-wings-to-reach-out-to-people-hit-by-pandemic/articleshow/84935768.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Hyderabad||Two in every three persons in Telangana had Covid-19: ICMR||HYDERABAD: A survey conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) reports that two in every three persons in Telangana had Covid-19 with or without their knowledge. The seropositivity survey presented in the Lok Sabha was conducted by the city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), an ICMR body, across the state. According to the survey, 63.1 per cent of the population in Telangana had seropositivity. The ICMR survey states that, for every positive case reported in Telangana, 42 cases were under-counted. This, as against the average of 33 under-counted cases across the country. However, the ICMR report, which is based purely on seropositivity, does not explain how the cases went under-counted. The report also does not mention whether the state deliberately under-counted cases or is it because of the fact that 80 per cent people who contracted Covid-19, did not show any symptoms at all and thus did not approach a hospital or undergo any tests. Going by the survey, Telangana has so far had 2.43 crore cases of Covid-19 as against the state’s population of around four crore. During the seropositivity survey, no distinction was made between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals nor did it mention if the individuals had suffered from Covid-19. Health experts pointed out that since the vaccinated population was also included in the survey, the results show a higher percentage of uncounted cases. Meanwhile, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh was reported to have a seropositivity rate of just over 70 per cent. The state is estimated to have had 3.78 crore cases, as against its population of 5.5 crore. The ICMR survey said that Andhra Pradesh had an under-counting factor of 22, which in other words means that for every one reported cases, 22 cases went unreported or under-counted. Telangana stood ninth in the country in terms of under-counted cases while AP stood 18th. Kerala, meanwhile, fared better with an under-counting factor of 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2/3-people-in-state-had-covid-19-icmr/articleshow/84933852.cms||Syed Akbar

The D grade is given to students who score between 33% and 40%. This year, 28,690 students received Grade D compared to 4,372 students last year, a sevenfold jump, said sources. Moreover, the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) had to give grace marks up to 130 per student in some cases to ensure that they cleared Class 12. After cancelling the Class 12 exams this year due to the Covid-19 situation, the state education department worked out a marks tabulation criteria for evaluating the performance of students. Not a single student was to be failed, in line with the government’s decision to give mass promotion to all regular school students this year. “Last year about 4,000 students were able to clear Class 12 with less than 40% exam result. This did not include the students who failed,” said an Ahmedabad-based academic expert. “However, a large number of students were given grace marks this year to make them eligible for mass promotion. That reflects the sorry state of affairs in the education system.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/boards-grace-35k-pass-with-flailing-colours/articleshow/84933863.cms||---

---||Pune||Pandemic control efforts leads to less pollution: ESR||Pune: Reduced vehicular traffic and other measures introduced for controlling Covid-19 pandemic have helped in checking air pollution too, bringing down the PM10 (by 38%) and PM2.5 (by 25%) levels to a decade low, stated the 2020-2021 Environmental Status Report (ESR) of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Both PM10 and PM2.5 dropped below the permissible standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in PMC limits in 2020-2021, the report showed. “Though a dip was expected due to the lockdown, it was mostly based on mathematical models. The actual closure has led to real-time quantification of the drop. It was significant,” said Mangesh Dighe, environment officer of PMC, while speaking to TOI. The ESR was presented before the general body on Friday. The data shows PM10 has seen a 30 µg/m3 drop as it has gone down from 80 µg/m3 to 50 µg/m3. The decline in PM2.5 was from 40 µg/m3 to 30 µg/m3. The standard for PM10 and PM2.5 are 60 µg/m3 and 40 µg/m3, respectively. The comparison was done between PM levels in April-May 2019 and April-May 2020. As per heath experts, high presence of suspended particulate matter makes the air polluted. These particles are dangerous for the respiratory systems as they cause many air borne diseases. The report states a 39% dip in the number of vehicle registration in 2020 as compared to 2019. This too has contributed to the drop in vehicular pollution. The report states that there was a decline in the consumption of electricity due to the closure of industrial estates and commercial places during the lockdown and has contributed to reducing pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pandemic-control-efforts-leads-to-less-pollution-esr/articleshow/84936013.cms||---

It will also have the city’s first authorized rooftop eatery. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which had earlier roped in MahaMetro for its construction but later cancelled the agreement due after inordinate delay, has now decided to engage a private agency to complete the project using its own funds and sell space. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that the tender inviting bids to appoint private agency has been floated. “NMC will generate Rs45 crore from the project,” he said. Anil Nair, former president of Credai Nagpur, said, “The city requires at least 15% commercial area, but has only around 5%. Such projects will also ease congestion in Sitabuldi, Dharampeth, Itwari etc.” He lauded NMC’s move to develop the mall on PPP basis. “”The density of population in Narendra Nagar, Somalwada, Manish Nagar, Chinchbhuvan, Khamla, Trimurti Nagar, Jaitala etc has increased manifold. This part of the city lacks a proper mall and recreational facilities.” NMC executive engineer Naresh Borkar said the private agency will have to construct eight floors as two basement floors for parking have already been constructed. “The agency will require around Rs39 crore for completing the project,” he said. “The developer agency can earn up to Rs85-90 crore from the project as it will get around 3.2 FSI. There will be no annual ground rent. NMC will allow more revenue sources like rooftop restaurant, pay and park especially for Jaiprakash Nagar Metro station, advertisements in and around the project etc. The agency can also come up with more ideas,” he said. Metro Mall is the first component under Orange City Street Project. The NMC had approval for special building bylaws for the project and can allow various relaxations to the agency. Borkar also said that the mall and Jaiprakash Nagar Metro station will be connected. “The mall is on the second plot on Orange City Street Project, so there is huge potential for more commercial, residential, hospitality and medical components coming up on the remaining area,” he said. The civic body had planned the mall on 3,308.76 square metres land in 2018 with a bank loan. The NMC had engaged MahaMetro to construct the mall and also paid an advance of Rs11 crore. MahaMetro constructed two basement parking floors. However, it cancelled the agreement citing inordinate delay and high cost. Then, the civic body decided to complete the project on its own, but now that decision has been changed. IN A NUTSHELL *Metro Mall planned on 3,308.76 sq mt plot adjacent to Jaiprakash Nagar Metro station *MahaMetro roped in to construct *Citing delay and high cost, NMC terminates contract *Now, tender floated to complete works through private contractor *Rooftop restaurant, advertisement, parking spaces on the anvil||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rooftop-restro-to-come-up-at-metro-mall/articleshow/84933892.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The reason for the sudden increase in the number of patents is believed to be increased scrutiny of research papers by the patent office, sources said. PU published 12 patents this year and five patents were received from the Government of India. In 2018-19, seven patents were published and four were granted to PU. In 2017-18, two patents were published and one was granted. The department of pharmacy published six patents in the last three years and PU got eight. The engineering department is the biggest department here and has about 200 teachers. Just two patents were published by this department from 2017 to 2019-20. In the department of dental and medical, no patent was published and none was received in three years, whereas many patents were published and granted in PGI. This data has also been recorded by the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) cell of PU for National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rank. Even though there were many research projects over the past few years, there were few patents. PU got 163 projects in 2019-20 and Rs 28.67 crore was spent on these. The funds were given by 25 agencies. In 2018-19, for 148 research projects, PU spent Rs 19.43 crore and 28 funded agencies were involved. In 2017-18, there were 138 projects, on which Rs 25.42 crore was spent. This year, there are more than 150 ongoing research proposals. Experts feel that given the research projects, the number of patents is less. Rajesh Gill, dean, Research, PU said, “PU has got 10 patents this time and I am really proud of the faculty who achieved it. PU may have been closed during the pandemic, but researchers have worked hard. Some more papers are yet to be published in the journal.We will soon hear about the rest of the papers, PU is working fast on research.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-bags-10-patents-8-in-pipeline/articleshow/84931813.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Create infra, don’t disturb biodiversity: Uddhav to Gadkari||Nagpur: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday performed bhoomi puja for a new railway overbridge (ROB) from Kadbi Chowk to Golibar Chowk and Santra Market. The 2.82km long ROB will cost Rs146 crore. MahaRail (Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited) has been entrusted with construction of the two-lane ROB and subway (connecting Pachpaoli and Bhanekheda road) to reduce traffic congestion and improve transport facilities in highly-congested central Nagpur area. The minister also performed bhoomi puja of Itwari-Nagbhid gauge conversion work and four other ROBs from Kalamna Market to Nagpur city, near Bhandewadi, Umred bus stand and Umred-Bhiwapur bypass road. All these works will also be implemented by MahaRail. Gadkari said that he had sanctioned Rs2,000 crore from Central Road Fund (CRF) for various infrastructure works in north, east and central Nagpur. The ROB work is one of those projects. Appealing to Mominpura residents to extend full cooperation to MahaRail in completing the ROB project, Gadkari pointed to encroachments on Craddock Road. “The road beneath the ROB will be widened and concretized,” he said. The minister further announced to provide Rs800 crore to Maharashtra government for road infrastructure under CRF. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who presided over the function through video conference, praised Gadkari for his work. He, however, urged Gadkari to ensure biodiversity of the state should not be disturbed. The CM also sought Gadkari's ministry help in strengthening existing infrastructures like old bridges, roads in western ghats etc. He requested Gadkari to work on strengthening road infrastructure to stop recurring pothole problems in the state. State PWD minister Ashok Chavan suggest connecting Marathwada with bullet train project. Energy minister and district guardian minister Nitin Raut assured all possible help to PWD’s NH division for constructing four-lane road in forest corridors from Umred to Bramhapuri stretch. On Gadkari’s request, Raut said that he will get the state forest department's nod for the project. Earlier, the forest department had rejected the proposal and instead gave permission for two-way lane road citing it will disturb the wild animal corridor. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari said that because of Gadkari's efforts city has witnessed sea change in terms of infrastructural development works, “which has reduced the travel time significantly, not only in Nagpur city but entire country”. Tiwari also urged state animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar to provide Rs100 crore fund to NMC for developing Nandgram, which would curb the stray cattle menace on city roads. Kedar assured all possible help to the civic body. Raut too claimed that he has been following the issue of renewal of Patwardhan ground land for developing Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial. He expressed anguish over NMC’s failure to act over demolition of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Bhavan at Ambazari garden.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Don’t want to sit idle in admission wait’, say students||LUCKNOW: UP board class 12 toppers were elated with their results, but remained concerned about the delayed academic session due to Covid-19 pandemic. They sought government intervention for launching free short-term vocational courses to enable them to hone a skill by the time they bag admission in higher education institutes. “Due to the pandemic, the admission process at higher educational institutes is running behind schedule. It would be a boon for class 12 passouts if offered specially designed vocational courses, which they can pursue till the time of admission,” said 92.4% scorer Jagrati Singh of Lucknow Public School, Rajajipuram, who aspires to become a civil servant. Two other meritorious students from the same school, Mahi Patel and Tanushi Agnihotri, who bagged 94.8% and 92.4% respectively also echoed Jagrati. “It would be great if we can learn a foreign language, imbibe computer skills till we get admission to an engineering college,” said Tanushi. “I am satisfied with my percentage, but marks awarded for mathematics are very less. If I would have sat for the exam, my score would have been better,” she added. Priyanshi Shukla of SKD Academy, Rajajipuram, who notched up 90%, said, “I want to become a software engineer, but if I can enrol myself in a skill-based government certified course before joining college, it would be great. I am satisfied with my marks and attribute my success to parents.” She said, a computer certificate course will not only add to her knowledge, but also propel her career. “Also it would be the best utilization of the free time till I get admission to a college,” she added. “Class 12 students are worst hit by the pandemic. First, our examinations were cancelled, then results were delayed and now the admission process too is running late. Don’t want to waste a single day. I want to learn extra if I get an opportunity,” said school topper of Bal Nikunj Inter College, Tripti Awasthi, who scored 89.4%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-want-to-sit-idle-in-admission-wait/articleshow/84935834.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Patna||Munger MP Lalan Singh replaces RCP as JD(U) national president||PATNA: Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh, better known as Lalan Singh (66), was on Saturday nominated as the national president of JD(U) at its national executive committee meeting in Delhi. Union minister and outgoing JD(U) chief RCP Singh proposed Lalan’s name, which was unanimously approved by all senior party leaders in the presence of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, a senior party leader told TOI over phone from Delhi. “Lalan Singh’s five-year tenure as state JD(U) president was very spectacular. Now, he will strengthen the party across the country on the basis of his long organizational experience,” JD(U) spokesperson Ranbir Nandan said. Lalan, who is also the JD(U) leader in Lok Sabha, has become the fourth national party president after Sharad Yadav, Nitish and RCP, who is now a Union cabinet minister. RCP remained party chief for the shortest period of only seven months. Lalan and RCP first called on Nitish at his Delhi bungalow and then reached the meeting venue. Voices were being raised within JD(U) to nominate a new party president after RCP’s induction into the Union cabinet on July 7 this year. RCP was also under pressure to sacrifice one of the two posts on the principle of ‘one man-one post’ adhered to by the party. A well-known face in JD(U), Lalan had also served as the party’s Bihar president for nearly five years — from 2005 to 2010. A three-time Lok Sabha member, he first won the parliamentary polls in 2004 from Begusarai on JD(U) ticket. In the 2009 general elections, he switched to the neighbouring Munger seat and won for the second consecutive term. He, however, lost Munger seat to the Lok Janshakti Party’s Veena Devi in the 2014 polls, but regained it in 2019. While being JD(U) state president, Lalan rebelled against Nitish over certain issues in 2010. But by 2013, he once again improved his relations with Nitish, who fielded him from Munger in 2014. JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi, the party’s parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha, and Rajya Sabha member and former Bihar unit chief Bashishtha Narain Singh were also present at the party’s national executive committee meeting. Apart from nominating Lalan, JD(U) also passed a number of resolutions, including reiterating its position that the central government should come out with caste census, an issue with potentially wide political ramifications, and also spoke against any coercive measures like the enactment of laws to control population growth. Some BJP-ruled states, including Uttar Pradesh, have batted for a law to curb the population growth. Tyagi told reporters that coercive policies had failed during the Emergency, even as he added his party was in support of steps to control the growth of population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/munger-mp-lalan-replaces-rcp-as-jdu-national-prez/articleshow/84931898.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Kochi||Kochi’s Onam business loss pegged at Rs 2,000 crore||KOCHI: Onam season, the biggest shopping season in Kerala, is expected to take a blow from the latest lockdown instructions set by the government. Overall, Kochi’s Onam market may suffer a potential business loss of Rs 2,000 crore (white and brown goods, clothing and kitchenware) during August and September this year. “Kerala has three major shopping seasons, first is the Vishu-Easter season spread over April-May that accounts for 20% of the annual sales. The second one is Onam which accounts for 40% of the annual sales, which happens in August-September. The third is the Christmas-New Year season of December-January, during which another 20% of the annual sales happens. The rest of the sales happen during the remaining months, in a scattered way,” said Antony Thomas Kottaram, director, Kottaram Trading Company, which markets kitchenware and home décor products. “The 2018 and 2019 Onams were marred by the floods, and 2020 was struck by the Covid pandemic. Now, again we are looking at a potential business loss this time also,” he said. Peter Paul Pittappillil, MD of Pittappillil Agencies, a chain of home equipment stores, said the Onam sales could be 30-40% lesser than last year. “Even that figure is possible only if the government allows to open the shops on all days from August 9 onwards,” he said. The overall white goods market of Kerala during Onam is about Rs 1,500 crore. According to Peter, the sales could be down by 50%-60% this season. Managing the crowd is the major hurdle for Onam season, but allowing the shops to open only three days a week and that too for short hours will only worsen the issue, warn the retailers. “It would have been better if the shops were allowed to open till 10pm, as it will ease crowd management problem,” Peter said. Deepak L Aswani, chairman, Kerala chapter of the Retailers Association of India (RAI), said, “This was mainly because of the wedding shoppers. They are rushing in because if they miss this season, they will have to wait for the next one. The normal customers are yet to start shopping for Onam”. According to him, the worst-hit are the malls, as they are closed at this moment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/onam-biz-loss-pegged-at-rs-2k-cr/articleshow/84931877.cms||Shenoy Karun

Special judge (POCSO) Harshvardhan also imposed a fine of Rs 1.60 lakh on the convict, Deepak Singh, of which Rs 1.25 lakh would be given to the girl’s family as a compensation amount. According to special public prosecutor Utkarsh Vats, a missing’s person complaint was registered against an unidentified person at the Khoda police station on August 3, 2018, a day after the girl went missing. Singh, who ran a tax attached to a cab aggregator, was then living as a tenant in the girl's house. After his arrest on August 7, police told the media that on the evening of July 2, Singh was watching porn in an inebriated state in his room when the girl walked in around 8 pm. He raped the girl and later smothered her to death when she tried to raise an alarm. “Singh kept the girl’s body in a bag near the house’s stairs and later put it on the roof of the adjacent house belonging to her uncle. Next day, he also participated in a search operation launched by her parents to trace her,” Vats said. The body of the girl was found two days later, on the morning of July 4, while the post-mortem was conducted the same night. The forensics team collected some important evidence in the case. The nature of injuries on her nose and lips and other circumstantial evidence hinted at sexual assault on her. On that basis, IPC Section 376 AB (rape of a girl under 12 years of age) and other relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was subsequently added. A total of seven witnesses were examined in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/man-gets-life-in-jail-for-rape-murder-of-5-year-old-girl/articleshow/84921314.cms||Aditya Dev

The contractor is going ahead with the erection of an additional roof over the synagogue so that the structure may not collapse in the rains. The works to protect the structure had been stalled in October 2020 after objection from a section of the local residents. They raised the apprehension that once a monument comes up in the area, there will be ban on construction in 300 square metres surrounding it. But a meeting convened by additional chief secretary V Venu on July 7 succeeded in allaying the fears of the local residents. Then, it was decided to expedite the work on the restoration of the synagogue. “The work has been resumed. We have instructed the contractor to complete the work on the roof at the earliest,” an official with the archaeology department said. One of the hindrance for completing the erection of the roof is an overhead electric line passing through the area. The roof can be erected with the help of crane only if KSEB removes the overhead line temporarily. The erection of the roof is being conducted as part of the work to stabilize the building. The more than 600-year-old structure, which had been exposed to rain and other adverse climatic conditions, is in a dilapidated state. Unless a roof is constructed over the structure, it may collapse in the rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/work-on-malabari-synagogue-resumes/articleshow/84931959.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: High court nixes Popular Front of India members’ plea for CBI probe||LUCKNOW: A Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court has declined to accept that the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of UP Police was was acting in biased and mala fide manner in pursuing investigation against two Popular Front of India members hailing from Kerala -- Anshad Badarudheen and Firoj K C. The court turned down a plea to transfer the probe in the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Dismissing a petition moved by Anshad, which was filed through his brother Azhar, the bench quoted an apex court verdict saying, “The decision to investigate or the decision on the agency which should investigate, does not attract the principle of natural justice. The accused cannot have a say in who should investigate the offence he is charged with.” The bench comprising Justice D K Upadhyay and Justice Ajai Kumar Srivastava also refused to agree that using term of ‘South Terror' on a portal amounted to prejudiced and biased intention of the authorities of the UP Government and ATS against the petitioner. “The use of such term would not per se import element of malice or bias towards the petitioner. However, we view this fact with profound concern and disapprove use of such term,” said Justice Srivastava.In its order, the bench further said, “The petitioner has been unable to show that the power of investigation has been exercised by the investigating officer of ATS in a mala fide manner. It is also not found to be a case of abuse of power and non-compliance by the investigating agency of the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure. The investigation has also been concluded by the ATS.” ATS had registered a case against the petitioner Anshad and another on February 16, 2021 in Lucknow. The two were arrested from Kukrail forest area in Lucknow and booked for various offences of IPC, Arms Act, Explosive Substances Act 1908, and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act . Arguing for the petitioner, advocates Mohammad Tahir and Mohammad SM Alavi had submitted that the arrest was false as the duo were picked from Bihar and then booked in Lucknow. It was also argued that after the registration of FIR , the central government was required to pass an order on how to investigate the offences, but in the present case , there was no such order was passed by the Centre and hence the charge sheet filed by ATS was without jurisdiction and liable to rejected. However, the bench rejected the said plea of the petitioner while accepting the argument of additional government advocate Shiv Nath Tilahri observing, “In the instant case, admittedly, the Central Government has not issued any direction under Section 6 (4) or Section 6 (5) of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act to get the Scheduled Offences investigated by the agency, therefore, the authority and power of the state government to investigate and prosecute any Scheduled Offence remains unaffected." The bench also did not agree with the plea of the petitioner that the special ATS court took cognizance in an illegal manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-nixes-pfi-members-plea-for-cbi-probe/articleshow/84935914.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, the CSIR chief said vaccination and wearing a mask will certainly help in reducing the intensity of the third wave. Dr Mande said that they were analysing the data of surge in positive cases in Kerala. He also said the Delta plus variant of the virus was not of great concern. Read AlsoIn-host mutations in Covid-19 virus reflecting in variants, finds studyNEW DELHI: Changes that happen in the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in an infected person reflect at the population level as a variation, according to a study that researchers say will be “of enormous utility” in predicting the spread and infectivity of viral Covid strains. Tracking the changes“The Delta variant is bad, but there is no need to worry about Delta plus. The UK, Europe and the US have witnessed the next wave. We have to take a guarded approach. The next wave is likely, but how and when is not known yet. It can be due to the new mutant of the virus or laxity of the general public in following the Covid-19 protocols,” Dr Mande said. The CSIR chief appealed to the public to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. “There is enough scientific evidence to show that vaccination is working,” he said and added that the genomic surveillance of coronavirus will be continued for another three years.

Experts of 37 CSIR labs were roped in. We had done genomic, sero and sewage surveillance. We have innovated and developed diagnostic kits and testing methods, including the dry swab method,” he said. He said the CSIR labs had contributed to developing Covid-19 drugs, vaccines, hospital devices and supply chains.

As World Breastfeeding Week begins today, TOI brings some facts that assume greater significance during the pandemic phase # Immunity benefits - Breastfeeding is a baby’s first dose of immunization - Protects from common disease by providing antibodies - IgA and IgM antibodies are found in breast milk, they act against bacteria, viruses etc - Contains lysozyme, lactoferrin, and oligosaccharides which help fight infection - Babies who are breastfed respond better to vaccines - Breastfed children perform better in intelligence tests # Breastfeeding when returning to work - Maternity Benefit Act gives 26 weeks’ leave - It is also mandatory for employers (with more than 50 employees) to make a provision for daycare - The employer must provide additional breaks to allow breastfeeding - The baby may be cared for in daycare near the workplace, enabling the mother to go and feed during breaks - Or milk can be expressed and stored for the baby to drink while the mother is at work # Storing expressed breast milk - Room temperature (16‐29C) 3‐4 hours, optimal 6‐8 hours acceptable under very clean conditions - Refrigerator (<40C) up to 72 hours - Freezer (<‐170C)- up to 6 months - Glass containers are best suited # Benefits of breastfeeding for mother - Develops close relationship between mother and baby - Lowers a mother’s risk of Type 2 diabetes, ovarian cancer and breast cancer # Lactating mother and Covid vaccination - Vaccinating lactating mothers could help provide babies with antibodies via breast milk - World Health Organization recommends that mothers continue to breastfeed after vaccination # Why mother’s milk best - In human beings, brain growth is prioritized over body growth during the first year of life - Human milk has the ideal composition to support this brain growth. - Animal milk is meant for the rapid body growth of the offspring. For eg, the calves double their weight in 40 days, while human babies do it in 180 days # What is best for your baby Human milk Animal milk Infant formula Protein Correct amount, easy to digest Too much, difficult to digest Partly corrected Fat Enough essential fatty acids, enzymes to digest Lack of essential fatty acids, no enzymes No enzymes Water Enough Extra needed May need extra Anti-infective substances Present Absent Absent QUOTE When the mothers get an infection, her body makes antibodies.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Eight woman cops now beat officers with twin intents||NEW DELHI: The senior citizens are particularly happy to see constable Rinku on beat patrol in an area under Bharat Nagar police station in northwest Delhi. The constable herself said, “An 82-year-old calls me every day and affectionately addresses me as Laddoo Gopalan. She even invites me to sit with her in the evenings. Her family lives on the floor above her, but she feels lonely and needs someone to talk to. So, each time she calls me, I visit her and assist her.” Breaking from the tradition of only male police officers being in charge of beat policing, North-West district has taken the initiative of deploying eight women as beat officers in four of its police stations. The move came after Usha Rangnani, the district DCP, felt that women officers too could be involved in day-to-day policing. This would not only give the policewomen visibility in the localities, but also motivate the residents into building a better police-public partnership. Constable Kiran, who patrols the same area as Rinku, said their patrolling has created a sense of respect for the uniform. “It was there earlier too, but nowadays when we question someone, they listen to us and acknowledge their faults. Many women also come forward to share their grievances and we try to resolve them,” said Kiran. Citing an example, Kiran continued, “When see people fighting on the road, we intervene and tell them that fighting and arguing are no solutions and that they will be taken to the police station if they continue creating a ruckus. Such fear tactics mostly work.” Out of uniform, the women officers aren’t as effective. As Monika Yadav, who is a beat officer in an Ashok Vihar locality, explained, “Sometimes when I am not in uniform or off duty and intervene in road spats, the impact isn’t as much as when I am in my cop’s uniform.” Head constable Sunita is on field duty for the first time since joining Delhi Police 26 years ago. “I have done office work or accompanied police teams on raids but have never been on beat work,” she said. “I particularly love looking out for the senior citizens in the area.” A WhatsApp group has been started for senior citizens to coordinate their needs. Constable Preeti, 25, who patrols a locality in Ashok Vihar, said, “It is overwhelming when young girls and kids playing in the parks approach us for selfies.” DCP Rangnani’s move to deploy women beat officers has brought about a positive change. “Earlier, these policewomen had responsibility, but now they have authority too,” said Rangnani. “It is easier now for local residents, especially women and young girls, to communicate with them. In fact, not only women but even men are beginning to open up in cases where they are facing harassment or have other problems with female family members. The beat officers are also challenging the traditional patriarchal mindset. We will ensure that we have women beat officers in all our police stations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/change-of-baton-eight-woman-cops-now-beat-officers-with-twin-intents/articleshow/84933966.cms||---

The woman, Mridula Chandra (48), was returning from morning walk. The criminal escaped on foot after snatching her chain worth around Rs2 lakh. The injured Suresh Chandra, 48, has been a contractor for the BCD for the last 24 years. He lives in a four-storey house with his three more brothers and other family members. The bullet pierced through his left shoulder. He is undergoing treatment in the ICU of Patna Medical College and Hospital. His son Shubham Chandra told TOI at the PMCH that his aunt Mridula’s husband Umesh Chandra is an engineer in Odisha government and is posted at Bhubaneswar. “The incident took place at around 6.35am when she had reached the entrance of our residence after a morning walk,” he said. Shubam said a youth was following her when she entered the lane which has a dead end. “After reaching near the house, she presumed that he might have entered the lane mistakenly and told him that it has a dead end. However, the youth reached near her on the pretext of asking for an address,” he said. Shubham said the criminal soon pulled out a pistol and started snatching the gold chain worth around Rs 2 lakh and other ornaments from the aunt. “She was assaulted and started screaming out of fear.Hearing it, my father jumped out of bed and checked from window and immediately rushed out,” he said and added that his uncle Ganesh Chandra, a businessman, also rushed and asked her to give everything whatever the criminal wants.  “However, my father pounded on the criminal after which he fired at him and esaped with the gold chain,” he said. Shastri Nagar police station SHO Ramashankar Singh said police were scanning the CCTV camera footage around the spot. “Another criminal might be on a bike a little far from the spot. Police are trying to ascertain the suspect’s identity,” he added. The criminals generally target those on the morning walk to snatch gold chains or valuables and several such cases have been reported in different localities of the state capital in recent past. On June 27, two bike-borne criminals had snatched a gold chain worth around Rs75,000 from the vice-president of a private firm, Manish Kumar, during morning walk near Rajiv Nagar police station on Ashiana-Digha road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/contractor-resists-gold-chain-snatching-in-patna-shot-at/articleshow/84932080.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Gifts from in-laws to kid not cruelty to woman’||MUMBAI: Observing that sending gifts via an online service for a grandchild did not mean the estranged daughter -in-law was being subjected to domestic violence or cruelty, a magistrate court has rejected a woman’s plea seeking “interim protection” from her husband and in-laws. The woman told the court that every week since August 2018, her in-laws had been making “violent attempts” to access her son by sending him gifts. Besides, she said, they defamed her in front of her watchman and she lived in constant fear. “It appears that respondents 2 and 3 are grandparents of the son of the applicant (woman), and in love and affection, sending gifts to their grandson is not amounting to cruelty or domestic violence.” the court said. She had submitted a domestic violence complaint against her in-laws in 2019. The applicant has not filed prima facie evidence of the watchman or society members to show the grandparents have created violence and harassed the applicant,” the court said. She alleged that since they tortured her, she had no option but to reside with her parents. She said her in-laws were visiting her son’s school and she was afraid they may take the child away. The in-laws had moved the family court for access to the child. The husband and his parents responded to the plea stating that the woman had been living separately since 2013 and filed a divorce petition a year later. They alleged that the grandparents were old and ailing and had tried to visit the child only once but were turned away by the watchman. They said they immediately returned home. The grandparents denied visiting the school. They said the son only sent gifts to the child through online services. Dismissing the woman’s plea, the court noted that she had not filed prima facie evidence to show that due to her husband and in-laws’ actions she had suffered injury. “The contents of the application and documents filed by the woman prima facie do not show that the husband and in-laws entered the house or visited the school and committed violence. The woman has prima facie failed to prove domestic violence or cruelty by the respondents,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gifts-from-in-laws-to-kid-not-cruelty-to-woman/articleshow/84936541.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Hyderabad||3 mosques in Rajendranagar open post-Covid centres||Hyderabad: After a survey in the Old City of Hyderabad revealed that one in every three women, who recovered from Covid-19, are suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs), three mosques have started post-Covid care counselling and treatment. The mosques are in Rajendranagar mandal. One of them includes a mosque, which has converted its Covid-19 hospital into a post-Covid-19 care centre as the number of pandemic cases are currently on the downslide. So far, as many as 3,500 patients have been screened or registered. They hail from as many as 50 slums in the city with a population of about eight lakh. The survey was conducted by Helping Hand Foundation (HHF), an NGO involved in healthcare. “Doctor reviews have been pending due to restriction on out patients, lack of money for expensive investigations due to loss of jobs and poor savings, and fear & anxiety of visiting hospitals,” HHF managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari said. The mosques have launched a multidisciplinary, community-level screening program for prevention and control of chronic diseases, particularly NCDs. The health centre at the mosques are screening patients for NCDs, oral health, ophthalmology, liver disease, cancer, particularly of head and neck, cervix and breast cancer in women. He said 90% of the patients screened are women. The mosque health centres are functioning from NS Kunta, Rajendranagar and Shaheenagar. The help desk comprises family physicians, counsellors and dieticians. Dr Ayesha Fatima, NCD coordinator at the exclusive women clinic in Masjid Muhammed Mustafa, said most of the patients are from economically weaker sections and are not fully aware of the condition, complications and tend to overlook their health. The survey found 5% of the women examined were diabetic, 18.3% had hypertension and 11% had co-morbidities. One in three women with diabetes had grade one fatty liver condition. Many Covid-19 patients post recovery are suffering from ailments related to Covid-19 sequelae. Also, with Covid dominating the health scenario, people suffering from chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension and those related to kidneys and thyroid were badly affected as they had no access to treatment. The survey also found that there is a rise in incidence of stroke, cardiovascular disease, renal failure and vision impairment in the last six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-mosques-in-rajendranagar-open-post-covid-centres/articleshow/84934037.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: After 18 years, doctors remove tip of pen from man’s lung||KOCHI: The chronic ‘asthma condition’ that has been troubling Aluva resident Sooraj, who recently underwent a CT scan for Covid related difficulties, has turned out to be the plastic tip of a pen and nib he accidentally swallowed 18 years ago. A team of doctors at Amrita hospital recently removed the object from his lungs. Sooraj from Poickattussery in Aluva was in class IX in 2003 when he swallowed the tip of the pen and the nib while trying to whistle with it. He was rushed to a private hospital, where an X-ray of the lungs was done. However, the X-ray did not show anything. Later, he developed a chronic cough and experienced shortness of breath. He then underwent treatment for asthma at various hospitals. Despite medication, his ‘asthma’ condition never really improved. Last December, Sooraj, now 32, was tested Covid positive and a CT scan of the chest showed the presence of a foreign body in the lower lobe of his right lung. For treatment, he was referred to Amrita hospital, where a team led by chief of interventional pulmonology Dr Tinku Joseph and cardiac anesthesiologist Dr Thushara Madathil removed the object using a relatively complex rigid bronchoscopy without surgery. “As the tip of the pen and nib were trapped in the lung for the last 18 years, things accumulated on top of it. The first arduous task was to remove these things. This was followed by rigid bronchoscopy,” said Dr Tinku. Within a day, the patient was discharged from the hospital. “I had been suffering for the last 18 years due to cough and shortness of breath. Finally, I am breathing freely,” Sooraj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/after-18-yrs-docs-remove-tip-of-pen-from-mans-lung/articleshow/84932079.cms||---

---||Lucknow||BJP highlights Jawahar Bagh carnage of 2016 to showcase anti-land mafia drive||Lucknow: The infamous Jawahar Bagh incident of Mathura, which saw a violent clash between a self-proclaimed revolutionary group led by one Ram Vriksh Yadav and the UP police during the previous Samajwadi Party regime in 2016 has made its way to the BJP poll campaign in the run-up to UP assembly elections due next year. The party has portrayed the incident as an overt support of the then SP government to squatters and land mafia, in contrast to the 'anti land mafia task force’ conceptualised by the Yogi Adityanath government to bring the land grabbers to their knees. The campaign material titled, 'Farq Saaf Hai’ (The difference is conspicuous) depicts a picture of a burning Jawahar Bagh on one side and the ruling BJP assertion of taking on accused land grabbers on the other. Comprising photographs of CM Yogi and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, the campaign material is being widely circulated among the party functionaries and on social media. The Jawahar Bagh incident had rocked the state after two cops, including SP Mathura, Mukul Dwivedi, got killed and six other injured as members of Swadheen Bharat Vidhik Satyagrah (SBVS) led by Yadav, armed with guns and bombs, launched a brutal attack on police force which had gone there to get the area cleared. The SBVS, a breakaway group of followers of religious leader Jai Gurudev, who died in 2012, had been illlegally occupying the sprawling over 100 acre campus of Jawahar Bagh since 2014. BJP sources said that the party planned to showcase the incident as a peculiar case of a crumbled law and order situation as mafia and land grabbers enjoyed political patronage during the then Samajwadi Party’s regime. When contacted, UP BJP spokesperson, Rakesh Tripathi said depiction of Jawahar Bagh in the campaign material was important to contrast it with the BJP government's bold and daring moves to bring land grabbers and mafias to book. “The Jawahar Bagh incident was a model of the Akhilesh Yadav government in which people of certain caste groups were allowed to encroach the government land," he told TOI. Tripathi categorically maintained that there was no doubt that the squatters who encroached the Bagh since 2014 had the backing of top SP leadership. BJP sources said that the party has conceptualised three types of campaign material -- one comparing the previous SP/BSP government with the ruling BJP, another on achievements of the Yogi Adityanath government and lastly cationing people about the malicious designs of the opposition to spread rumours which are potentially aimed to destabilise the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-highlights-jawahar-bagh-carnage-of-2016-to-showcase-anti-land-mafia-drive/articleshow/84935994.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Child activist and former director of Snehasadan dead||Father Placido Fonseca S J, a Jesuit priest who made the rehabilitation of the street child his mission, providing runaways and delinquents shelter and care through a network of homes, died on Saturday. The 84-year-old Fr Placie, as he was known, had cancer and was being treated at St Elizabeth’s Hospital in Malabar Hill. A guiding spirit in the social sector, the priest was a familiar figure as much to organisations committed to protect vulnerable children as he was to young boys and girls living and working on the city’s streets. “Hundreds and thousands of them knew him. So many who had vices were rescued, given a future by him. The best thing was he never gave up on a problematic child,” said Fr Noel Pinto, who succeeded him at Snehasadan, the institution he was synonymous with. A graduate of St Xavier’s College, Fr Placie joined Snehasadan in 1970 after his ordination.  It was then a shelter on the Holy Family Church premises at Chakala, Andheri, one of the first such for the homeless. Over the next 43 years, bulk of them spent as its director, Fr Placie is credited with initiatives that became benchmarks for child welfare. The homes would ring with laughter and humour; on reunion days, old boys would return to talk about his trademark perseverance: “Father hain na,” he would tell a child experiencing a particularly mortifying moment. Fr Placie had realised early on that if children rescued from the streets were to regard the institution as their home, they needed families to look after them, not caretakers. Thus came houseparents, couples with children of their own who would live at Snehasadan and bring up the homeless child along with theirs. A recipient of the National Award in Child Welfare in 1985, Fr Placie was also part of the committee which helped draft the Juvenile Justice Act and instrumental in bringing Childline to India.  The first booth for the 1098 helpline for children in distress was set up at Snehasadan. Today the institution has grown into a cluster of 12 homes in the western suburbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-child-activist-and-former-director-of-snehasadan-dead/articleshow/84934265.cms||Sunil Nair

A real-estate promoter, who launched a gated community project in an adjacent site, had constructed the wall seven months ago to keep scheduled caste people out, said Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhgam (TPDK) general secretary Ku Ramakrishnan. “More than 120 SC families are residing at Kondasamy Nagar in Pannimadai village panchayat. The promoter has been selling sites on Kannabiran Nagar, adjacent to Kondasamy Nagar, and had handed over four roads in the site to the panchayat for development. A panchayat road to Kondasamy Nagar passed through Kannabiran Nagar. The promoter constructed a tall wall and blocked the panchayat road, which is illegal,” he said. “Also, as per government rules, builders can construct only four feet tall walls. But this promoter violated the rules and constructed the 10-foot-tall wall to hide view of the settlement. We consider it an untouchability wall and requested the village panchayat to demolish it. But the panchayat administration took no action,” Ramakrishnan told TOI. TPDK on Saturday petitioned district revenue officer P S Leela Alex at the collectorate on Saturday, demanding action against the promoter. “The promoter told us that the wall was constructed to hide view to the arunthathiyar settlement, the presence of which, they said, makes the site less appealing to buyers,” TPDK member C Santhosh Kumar said. If the district administration fails to demolish the wall, TPDK members and arunthathiyar people will do it soon, Ramakrishnan added. Pannimadai village panchayat president Rathinam Marudhachalam told TOI that the promoter had agreed to demolish the wall. “Kondasamy Nagar residents will be able to use the panchayat road at Kannabiran Nagar within a few days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wall-to-shut-out-dalits-stirs-controversy-in-pannimadai/articleshow/84934057.cms||A Subburaj

Devotees are not allowed to offer prayers at Arulmigu Subramanya Swami Temple at Marudamalai, Perur Pateeswarar Temple, Anaimalai Masaniamman Temple and Vanabadrakaliamman Temple between August 1 and 3 and August 8. They won’t be allowed to offer obeisance along rivers. However, special puja will be performed at temples. The collector requested people to cooperate with the district administration to contain the spread of Covid-19. The district recorded 246 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, taking the case tally to 2,29,353, of which 1,940 are active cases. With 223 people getting discharged from various treatment centres on the day, the number of recovered patients has gone up to 2,25,236. The recovery rate in the district now stands at 98.2%. The Covid-19 toll rose to 2,177 on the day with the state including one more fatality that occurred in the district in the media bulletin. On Saturday, the district registered a 6.9% increase in the daily caseload. This was relatively low compared to 21% spike in cases on Friday and 14% rise on Thursday. Health officials admit the spike in cases was reported from across the district and was not restricted to a couple of blocks anymore. They, however, said they were not surprised by the spike. The officials, meanwhile, met food minister R Sakkarapani and appraised him of the spike in fresh Covid-19 cases in the district for the third consecutive day. Officials said the spike in cases after the lull in second wave was expected. “We knew the virus had become more transmissible. So, an increase in movement of people was expected to lead to an increase in cases. In fact, some other districts in the state are also seeing a rise in fresh cases,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/new-restrictions-to-come-into-force-tomorrow/articleshow/84934077.cms||Pratiksha Ramkumar

Public prosecutor Aruna Pai was opposing Kundra and Thorpe’s separate challenges to their arrest and remand which they said was “illegal” as there was “no compliance” to a Section 41A CrPC notice for their explanation, mandated when an offence attracts a maximum of seven years’ punishment. At a hearing via video-conferencing before the bench of Justice Ajay Gadkari, Pai said the duo is accused of “serious offences of porn streaming content” and police “also seized material from phone and storage device”. She said there was an “email message from Kundra on his Hotshot app with one Pardeep Bakshi , his brother-in-law, who owns a company in London...” Police “found obscene and bold videos” and information on a number of subscribers and payments received, she said. Pai further said, “During the course of investigation we added Section 201 (destruction of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code.” Senior counsel Aabad Ponda for Kundra had, while arguing earlier, submitted that the police had not mentioned any deleting of chats in their first remand and questioned its non-inclusion if the police are now saying it. The hearing was interrupted due to a technical glitch. As a result, by consent of all sides, the HC will now hear it on Monday at a physical hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/prosecutor-to-hc-cops-seized-51-films-in-raj-kundra-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/84936545.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kolkata||August rain alert prompts Kolkata Municipal Corporation to turn focus on dilapidated buildings||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation buildings department has sent an alert to borough executive engineers, asking them to keep a close watch on highly vulnerable buildings in their areas after a fresh caution for rain in August was issued. Borough executive engineers were asked to take stock of the condition of the insecure buildings following the partial collapse of five unsafe houses across the city in the past six days. The first collapse, that of a portion of a century-old building, was reported from Bhowanipore last Sunday. This was followed by a series of collapses in areas, such as Girish Park, Jorabagan and Mudiali. Incessant rain could lead to many more such accidents in the days to come, felt a civic engineer. According to a KMC buildings department engineer, the reason behind the collapse of a large number of buildings lies in the fact that most of these are century-old and made of lime and mortar. “Instead of using cement, most of these century-old buildings were constructed with lime. When water seeps into the structures after a heavy spell of rain or even incessant drizzle, followed by a sunny morning, the lime used as cementing agent weakens leading to the collapse,” the civic engineer said. With the monsoon still active in the region, the KMC engineers are keeping their fingers crossed.  A section of the KMC buildings department officials even cautioned that major accidents could take place in the absence of proper repair of the dangerous buildings. “We have reasons to feel worried about the fate of residents who, despite our repeated appeals, have continued to live in the dilapidated buildings that may collapse in monsoon. Urgent repairs need to be taken up for most of the buildings we have termed ‘insecure’ after examining their structural stability,” said a KMC buildings department official. According to the official, the civic body was particularly worried about the fate of 80 highly dilapidated buildings located mostly in north and central Kolkata. Some of these buildings are located in areas, such as Cossipore, Chitpore, Burrabazar, Burtolla, Shyampukur, Beadon Street, Bidhan Sarani and Pathuriaghata Street. There were also a considerable number of old and dilapidated structures in south Kolkata, like Bhowanipore, Lake Road, Kidderpore which needed urgent repairs, a civic official said. “We are keeping a vigil over some of these structures. We have already issued notice to them, asking the tenants residents to vacate them,” a KMC buildings department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/aug-rain-alert-prompts-kmc-to-turn-focus-on-dilapidated-bldgs/articleshow/84932124.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kochi||2,300 drug hotspots identified in Kochi||KOCHI: The district social justice department (SJD) has identified 2,300 hotspots here that are used for drug peddling or abuse under the ‘nasha mukt’ campaign. The move follows a report that identified Ernakulam as one of the 272 districts in the country where substance abuse is very high. The hotspots were identified with the help of the Kudumbashree, police, excise officials, and volunteers. For the programme, an 11-member district ‘nasha mukt’ committee headed by the collector has been formed. This committee will coordinate the various activities that will eliminate these hotspots and further open the areas for more public interaction. “We have formed committees at municipality and block level, and soon we will be forming at panchayat level too. These local committees will look into these hotspots,” said Subair, district officer, SJD. At the local bodies level jagratha committee, SJD, women and child development department and Kudumbashree will conduct joint activities. After a one-month campaign organized as part of the central government’s directives, a year-long programme will be launched that will have multi-pronged activities, including awareness campaigns for students through the curriculum, de-addiction campaigns and more intensive monitoring by the police and excise officials. Officials said as of now, following Covid protocols most campaigns will be held online, but they hope to intensify it in offline mode from October. During the identification of the hotspots, it was found that most drug abuse and peddling is in the city areas, while alcohol consumption is the major problem in rural places. The major hotspots in and around the city include Kaloor bus stand, south railway station, HMT Junction at Kalamassery, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Glass Factory area at Kalamassery, Koonamavu river bank, Karimughal, etc. A report by the ministry of social justice indicates six districts in the state - Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Malappuram and Idukki - have high levels of addiction and substance abuse. They were identified based on the inputs received from the Narcotics Control Bureau and the findings on the comprehensive national survey done by the ministry. The ministry has formulated a national action plan for drug demand reduction (NAPDDR), an umbrella scheme, that includes components for preventive education and awareness generation, capacity building, treatment and rehabilitation, setting quality standards, focused intervention in vulnerable areas, skill development, vocational training and livelihood support of ex-drug addicts, surveys, studies, evaluation and research. Under the rehabilitation programme, five de-addiction centres are functioning in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/2300-drug-hotspots-identified-in-kochi/articleshow/84932111.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||Pune||Encroachment on slopes, deforestation to blame for landslides in Maharashtra: Experts||PUNE: Excessive deforestation, cutting of hill slopes for agriculture and developmental projects combined with heavy rainfall have increased the fragility of the Western Ghats, leading to an increase in landslides in Western Maharashtra and Konkan regions, said senior geologists of the Geological Survey of India (GSI). The recent landslides, in Taliye village in Raigad and Satara districts, which claimed over 130 lives, have once again compelled the authorities to study the geological factors to find the reason behind the landslides. The experts have suggested a comprehensive investigation of these regions to identify ways to prevent landslides in the future. Arvind Kumar Singh, deputy director general, GSI, Maharashtra unit in Pune, told TOI, “The increase in encroachments on natural hill slopes for farming or expansion of habitation, deforestation and other anthropogenic reasons have added to the increased frequency of landslide occurrences in the past few decades, particularly in Western Maharashtra and Konkan regions.” “If we study the history of Pune, Satara, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, which are home to many forts of the Maratha Empire, we will not find reference to massive landslides because the human habitat was at that time only limited to designated places/ locations. Forests were maintained like a ‘sanctum sanctorum’. There was no disturbance to the natural slope of the hill and flow of water. However, this changed over the decades. Human habitat has increased tremendously at such places. That is why we are now facing the issue of landslides in the region,” said Sekhar Sarkar, former deputy director general (central region), GSI, who has visited the region several times in the past. Sarkar, who carried out a detailed investigation of the Malin landslide in 2014 in Pune, said, “In northeast, people have been staying on hills for generations together. Their understanding of the geographical aspects is much deeper. But, in Maharashtra, we came across a lack of knowledge among villagers living in hilly regions. To overcome this issue, we need to create basic awareness about geological and geographical changes that develop / take place on hills due to various reasons. Only then they would make conscious effort to move or shift to safer locations in future.” “Over 28,000sqkm area in landslide-prone western Maharashtra has been covered by the GSI under the National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Programme (NLSM) to classify susceptible areas in accordance with their potential to generate landslides. In addition, a comprehensive landslide inventory covering more than 1,000 incidences has also been prepared. Out of the total aerial coverage, nearly 5% area shows high potential to generate landslide, and over 30% additional area shows moderate possibility of creation of landslide,” said three geologists from the GSI. According to Singh, one needs to understand that the area that gets affected need not necessarily be categorised into high or moderate landslide susceptibility zones. “This is because the effect of landslide activity can be felt in areas that are outside of such zones but are in the path of the runout of the landslide incidences. Incidents at Jui (2005) village in Raigad district, Malin (2014) in Pune district and recent incident at Taliye in Raigad district are prominent examples of such cases,” he added. About recent increase in landslide activity, Singh said that the old and historic record of the landslide is far from being complete and usually only those incidents causing harm to human population are recorded. “As a result, it is difficult to establish the quantified relationship between incidences and the triggering factor, especially rainfall,” he added Following the recent landslide incidents, the GSI has sent two teams of geologists for rapid geological assessment of the affected areas. “The teams are currently in the field and are collecting field data necessary to assess the cause of incidences and to identify immediate short-term measures to reduce further risk. There are plans to cover 15 villages in the first phase of the work. The inferences of these studies will be shared with the district authorities concerned,” added Singh. Retired GSI geologist Sudha Vaddadi, said, “The state government should form a dedicated committee of geologists to review landslide-prone villages at least twice a year. This exercise will certainly help respective district administration to take measures in advance. Currently, we are acting only after the incident. Also, permission of geologists should be made mandatory before launching any developmental projects in hilly regions or districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/encroachment-on-slopes-deforestation-to-blame-for-landslides-in-maharashtra-experts/articleshow/84936046.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kolkata||CATS honour: Global recognition for Sunderbans in tiger conservation||KOLKATA: Sunderbans Tiger Reserve has got a global recognition in big cat conservation. It is among the 17 tiger sites in the world to have got the Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CATS) accreditation. CATS is a set of criteria that allows tiger sites to check if their management will lead to successful big cat conservation. Apart from Sunderbans, 13 other tiger reserves in India have also got the recognition for meeting the standards in effective conservation. A group of international experts and protected area managers have set the standards. The announcement was made by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) recently. A year ago, the South 24 Parganas forest division — known as the Sunderbans buffer zone that’s now home to at least 22 big cats — had met the criteria. It is, reportedly, only the third area outside any tiger reserve in India after Uttarakhand’s Ramnagar and Lansdowne divisions to have got the tag. As per the latest camera-trap exercise, the Indian Sunderbans is now home to at least 96 tigers, of which 74 have been clicked in the tiger reserve area. Apart from tigers, these standards are being adopted across the world for conservation of jaguars, lions and freshwater dolphins. The other Indian tiger reserves that received the recognition are Manas, Kaziranga and Orang in Assam; Valmiki in Bihar; Dudhwa in Uttar Pradesh; Panna, Kanha, Satpuda and Pench in Madhya Pradesh; Anamalai and Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu; Parambikulam in Kerala and Bandipur in Karnataka. One tiger site each from Nepal, Bhutan and Russia have also been granted the accreditation. Sunderbans Tiger Reserve field director Tapas Das said the accreditation will further strengthen and improve conservation efforts and management interventions on the landscape. According to him, among the standards evaluated before giving the accreditation are, big cat population in the tiger site, importance of the reserve, management, community participation, tourism, protection and human-wildlife conflict, among others. The CATS is being implemented across 125 sites in the world, including 94 in India. The sites in India also include areas outside tiger reserves. According to deputy field director Justine Jones, this means that Sunderbans has set a standard in its management efforts. “This will go a long way in safeguarding the habitat through the umbrella species approach,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cats-honour-global-recognition-for-sunderbans-in-tiger-conservation/articleshow/84932181.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: 14,000 transgenders of one lakh eligible take jab; stigma holds back others||LUCKNOW: Rajni Kinnar of Gonda describes Covid-19 as the wrath of God but doesn’t want to take the vaccine against the virus. “Those who take the vaccine will die in two years,” the transgender believes. In Mahoba, Nazo is also against the vaccine. “The vaccine causes Covid-19 and its lethal complications will kill me before my time,” she fears. The two transgenders lend a face to a gap in the state’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign which has otherwise earned accolades from various quarters for its out of the box thinking and implementation approach. As a result of the state’s strategy, UP is number one in terms of total vaccine doses administered in the country. So far, 4.68 crore doses of vaccine have been given in the state. In terms of people, 3.92 crore have taken at least one dose while 75.9 lakh are fully vaccinated. But triumph doesn’t side with the state health department when it comes to vaccination of the third gender. As per official data obtained from the Union government, nearly 14,000 people in the third gender category have been vaccinated, which is about 14% achievement against the estimated target of 1 lakh. A discussion with the members of the community indicated that there a number of reasons for this. “While hesitancy and misinformation affect all communities alike, lack of documents to prove our identity is the biggest impediment for them,” said Lovepreet Singh, president of Rehbar Trust, a not-for-profit organization. Farhaan Khan of Farhaan Foundation dittoed. “There is a dire need for counselling. All kind of myths haunt them and despite our efforts, we have not been able to mobilise many. Some are so adamant that they do not even listen to doctors,” he said. Stigma is another reason. “We do not know which booth to go to. Both sides make fun of us. Even health workers do not want to touch us. Many stay back leaving their protection to destiny,” stated Rani Kinnar. Some though, have led the change. Trangender Krishika from Lucknow got herself vaccinated and has been trying to convince her fellows. “I cite my own example and tell them that nothing happened to me but they are not ready to listen. If the government tells them in an organized way, they would come,” she said, adding that she got vaccinated thinking that 4 crore people in the state are not fools. Kajal Devi Kinnar in Prayagraj said: “The PM has taken it, the CM has taken it. If there was something wrong with the vaccine, they wouldn’t have. Vaccine is like a medicine. But not all think like me.” A senior health officer said, “We have not been able to reach this community for counselling. The matter will be taken up with decision makers.” Special camps may also help. In Gorakhpur, transgender rights body Ekta Sewa Sansthan organized a camp for the third gender on Thursday with the help of local administration. As many as 110 kinnars were vaccinated in the exercise that targeted to inoculate 150. Secretary Virendra Raj said: “Kinnars from Kushinagar, Deoria, Sant Kabir Nagar and Gorakhpur participated in the effort which became possible after six weeks of personalized counselling.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-jab-matters-over-14k-transgenders-of-1-lakh-eligible-get-vaccinated-in-up/articleshow/84936055.cms||Shailvee Sharda

A draft MoU is close to be finalized and will be signed within a week, Maharashtra Airport Development Company’s vice-chairman-cum-managing director Deepak Kapoor told TOI.The MoU will be a tripartite document between MADC, RAL and DRAL. The project is expected to be operational by December 2022. DRAL CEO Arvind Kumar refused to comment on the matter at this juncture.“The plan is to scale up the number of Falcon 2000 business jets assembled here. The existing unit is already making components of Rafale fighter aircraft which would continue in the new plant. Aircraft maintenance will also be taken up and this include the Falcon 2000 business jet and the Rafael fighter planes,” Kapoor added.Under the arrangement, RAL which has already sub-leased 31.4 acres to DRAL, plans to let out another plot of 30.85 acres adjacent to it. RAL has 104 acres under its possession in Mihan. DRAL is a joint venture between Anil Ambani promoted-RAL and France’s Dassault Aviation. The Nagpur unit of DRAL is part of investments arising out of the offset agreement on purchase of 36 Rafale jets in the country.“The expansion by DRAL is expected to not only generate higher revenue for the government, but also create a lot of jobs,” said Kapoor.The other major units in the aviation sector in Mihan include the maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) by Air India.

---||Patna||Bihar: Village court allows woman to leave husband, pursue career||PATNA: A gram kutchery (village court) in Bhagalpur district recently allowed the separation of a newlywed woman with her husband after she wished to pursue a career and fulfil her dreams. Neha Kumari (19) had submitted a petition to the village court under Gangania panchayat in Bhagalpur district on July 26, seeking separation from her husband Sunil Kumar, with whom she had tied nuptial knot one-and a-half-months back. In her petition, Neha said she wanted to pursue a career after getting married, but her husband and in-laws were opposed to it. As her proposal was turned down, she fled the house of her in-laws and reached Patna. In the meantime, her father Gurudev Pandit, a resident of Jehangira village, lodged a complaint with the Sultanganj police station, apprehending Neha’s abduction. Neha, an Intermediate passout, somehow came to know about the police complaint and sought intervention of sarpanch Damodar Choudhary. On July 28, both the families were summoned to a meeting held at Fatehpur village.  Neha and her husband also appeared at the meeting convened by the village court. Neha told the members of gram kutchery that she wanted to complete her ITI training first to get a job and then pursue higher studies. “I was married under pressure. Now I want to get rid of it for the sake of my career,” she told the village court. Sarpanch Choudhary said, “Initially we tried to convince both the families, but in vain. Finally, we decided to go for separation between Neha and her husband. After all, the woman is an adult and free to choose her way of life.” An agreement was signed and the two families agreed not to put pressure on Neha in future or blame her for separation. Earlier, the woman’s father told the village court that the marriage was solemnised as per Hindu rituals. Neha got married to Sunil, a resident of Ghorghat village under Gangania panchayat, in June this year. Neha, on her part, thanked the members of the gram kutchery for “saving her life”. SHO of Sultanganj police station Lal Bahadur said the move of the gram kutchery was commendable. “Disposal of complaints, which are not of serious nature, by gram kutchery will lessen burden on the police and judiciary,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/village-court-allows-woman-to-leave-husband-pursue-career/articleshow/84932143.cms||Ramashankar

The document says the slow speed during peak hours indicates that travel conditions in the city were below normal, but have not reached the saturation level. The traffic characteristics of the city were assessed under the study and analysis section to comprehend the problems concerning traffic movement and to understand the need for organizing the same efficiently and economically. The study covered the volume of traffic plying through selected screen line locations, major outer cordon locations of the city, mid-block locations and important intersections, and their capacity utilization concerning road capacity. The study and analysis indicate that the traffic has exceeded the design capacity in most of the roads/intersections warranting upgradation of transport infrastructure. As part of the study, traffic movement data during morning/evening peak hours at 52 major intersections were estimated for the year 2020, and the highest volume of peak hour movements was observed at Pattom junction, higher than 10,000 PCU (passenger car units) followed by Kesavadasapuram junction (between 9,000 and 10,000). Six intersections had traffic volumes between 8,000 and 9,000 PCU. Data projection for mid-block locations for 2020 shows the road section between Palayam and Overbridge had the highest traffic volume of traffic in the city roads with 70,000 PCU followed by Karamana and Pappanamcode with 52,431 PCU. Traffic management experts opine that while the city has well-developed roads, but parking on the kerb is a major factor that leads to congestion and slow movement of traffic. This is also being pointed out in the report. It notes that parking on the curb of the road has become a common phenomenon in city roads. “In the absence of off-street parking facilities, there is an increase in on-street parking activities which hinder the traffic movement,” the report says. Peak parking accumulation on major city roads in 2018 prepared as part of draft parking policy shows that heavy accumulation of parking was observed at Attakulangara - Killipalam- Karamana section, MG road between LMS and Manakkad, Plamoodu - Pattom - Kesavadasapuram, Vellayambalam- Sasthamangalam, Chalai market road, Pattom -Murinjapalam-Medical college road and Medical college - Ulloor road. As per the report based on the parking duration of vehicles on major roads, three fourth of the vehicles were parked for a duration of less than half an hour. About 11% of vehicles were parked for 30-60 minutes, and only 15% of the vehicles were parked for more than one hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/draft-master-plan-2040-calls-for-upgradation-of-traffic-infra/articleshow/84932148.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Earlier, the police station staff struggled for hours to get the address and phone numbers of the parents from the girl. The teenager, who had left home after a dispute with parents over Std X admission, was planning to a hitch hike on the highway to reach some orphanage without knowing any specific destination. A passer-by spotted the teenager at Ingoley Nagar and alerted police. She was unwilling to furnish then any details including her name to the women cops who went to rescue her. The drama came to an end following intervention of senior inspector Vijayeta Mandhodhare. “It was challenging to make her talk. Instead of routine questioning, we used certain psychological methods. In the beginning, I had just made her seat in my chamber and started working on my files without even looking at her,” she said. Later, the senior inspector said, she started a friendly banter with her and posed questions indirectly about her identity and whereabouts. “Later, I told her about child trafficking. It worked,” she said. After managing to get her address and parents’ phone number, the cops reunited her with the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-trafficking-talk-cops-make-runaway-girl-return-to-family/articleshow/84934280.cms||Soumitra Bose

Today, he wants to inspire others through his book ‘Hum To Jeetenge’ based on his strugglesNagpur: Harish Prajapati, 22, is a special youngster. Special, not just because of 90% loss of vision, but due to his vision for today’s stressed, confused, depressed youth, especially those with disabilities. He wants them to overcome struggles and become a winner in life. And in his own words, he wants the youngsters “to turn adversities into opportunities to grow and become self-reliant”. This is what is the gist of a book “Hum To Jeetenge” he has authored. Released a couple of weeks back, the book encourages youngsters to get rid of apprehensions in life, develop communication skills, overcome fear of English language and take risks. Son of an e-rickshaw puller, Harish, who is currently pursuing MA, lives with his parents, a brother and sister in Lalganj area in Itwari. His formative years, he says, had been a huge struggle – family’s weak financial background and then the near-total loss of vision at the age of three. He studied through Braille till Std VII and then took help of a writer during high school and Nagpur University examinations. After finishing schooling from Jnanjyoti Andh Vidyalaya, he joined Morris College in Std XI and since then started exploring new things. Harish doesn’t want to depend on government help but wants to become a motivational speaker and a soft-skills trainer. He hopes to impart free teaching to the students from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) schools. He has many feathers to his cap: a prolific debater, a national-level chess player, a poet, a comedian, and a mimicry artist, He has won over 100 awards in various competitions so far. He was also crowned as ‘Mr Institute’ in his Vasantrao Naik Government Institute of Arts and Social Sciences (formerly Morris College). About the book, Harish says it aims to motivate the youth to accept failures, overcome adversities and emerge a winner. “It’s based on my personal experiences and my struggle to learn new things. Many people advised me to look for a government job from the quota for disabled where my life would be secure, and I would also be entitled for a pension. But I have full confidence that one day my efforts will pay off,” he says. He earned some money by conducting motivational and personality development classes in his college and helped his parents financially. “Among the visually disabled, those pursuing geography and psychology are rare in BA, but I took up these for my graduation. Similarly, I used to fare poorly in economics, so I decided to take it as a specialization in post-graduation. Last week my MA final year got over,” he says. His sister Swati, completing her master’s degrees, helped him in penning the book, as she used to write the notes narrated by him. Even his family members, including mother Anita, encouraged him to go ahead with his plans. Harish says no one was ready to publish the book. “My mother had to keep her jewellery with a moneylender to raise the funds,” he says and adds, “I believe perseverance, commitment and hard work are the only way to achieve any goal.” Interested in the book contact 7620536027, 7030738421.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/visually-impaireds-vision-for-youth-beat-odds-be-a-winner/articleshow/84934457.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Goa||Goa government lying outrightly, we lost loved ones not to Covid but to oxygen shortage, say relatives||PANAJI: The state government’s volte-face over the oxygen shortage that led to the deaths of at least 83 persons sparked an online furore. Netizens lashed out at the state government, particularly health minister Vishwajit Rane, who was the first to officially state that Covid patients were dying at the Goa Medical College due to oxygen shortage. Goans and relatives of the Covid-19 victims accused the government of rubbing salt on their wounds at the behest of the Centre. In a written response in the state legislative assembly, Rane said, “At no point in time (did) the oxygen supplies at GMC run out of stock, and thus, no death has been reported to have (been) caused due to the non-supply of oxygen. No deaths have been directly attributed to the lack of oxygen. But definitely, consumption per patient increased due to the strain of Covid-19.” On May 11, Rane held a press conference to announce that 26 Covid-19 patients died between 2am and 6am at GMC during the second wave due to drop in oxygen supply. “Why (was) the health minister asking for inquiry for the deaths occurring during 1am to 2am? If it is not due to lack of oxygen, then why there was hue and cry for oxygen? Maybe the deaths at that time of the night were happening to accommodate the patients of his constituency,” said Emilia Fernandes on a social media platform. Twitter user Rajesh Mudras did not appear surprised with the government’s denial and described it as a natural corollary when “people without mandate” form the government. Not everyone shared the same restraint. Many called out the government and accused the chief minister and Rane of lying to the state. “How could you be such an outspoken liar? With almost every proof of it available on media and print media, do you think people are fools? It’s salt on wounds of people who lost their loved ones not to Covid but to shortage of oxygen supply,” said Shamila Siddiqui. TOI had reported that at least 83 persons were suspected to have died due to oxygenrelated issues between May 11 and May 15 while undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at GMC. CM Pramod Sawant, who had visited the Covid wards on May 11, had also hinted that there was oxygen shortage. “It looks like oxygen doesn’t reach the patients. I will not tolerate such acts which will lead to deaths of Covid patients due to oxygen shortage,” he had said immediately after his visit. But on Friday, in written replies to three questions on oxygen-related deaths, Rane outrightly denied there were any deaths but went further and lauded the government. “They have to stand by the words uttered in Parliament. How can they go against the high command? This is about the party not about the country or people, please understand. Those flights that arrived internationally with oxygen were not for shortages of oxygen,” said Judith Fernandes. Many lampooned the state government for taking a uturn on the oxygen shortage issue. “Yup, all deaths were because of lack of carbon dioxide! Because, you know oxygen is readily available in the atmosphere. CO2 is not and this seems to be the logic,” said Capstron Pereira. Entrepreneur Shruti Chaturvedi, one of the first citizen volunteers to put together relief measures and resources for Covid-19 patients, said the government appears to have no regards for families who lost someone due to lack of oxygen. “The shamelessness with which our elected representatives can go on record and lie is beyond you and me. They lie through their teeth, sit comfortably over dead bodies, make profits from every essential medicine sold, and win an election once they give donation for a football ground. I hope Goa remembers this,” said Chaturvedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-lying-outrightly-we-lost-loved-ones-not-to-covid-but-to-o2-shortage/articleshow/84934555.cms||---

The cracks have been witnessed in the deck slab between pillars 120 and 121 near Daultabad flyover. A large crack running across the slab from one end to the other has revealed iron rods and construction material. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said its project contractor, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), is currently carrying out a re-stimulation test to determine the strength of the slab. The cracks have been deliberately created to carry out a detailed analysis of the slab’s strength-bearing capacity, a senior NHAI official told TOI. “Work on the elevated segment was put on hold to get to the root of the problem that led to the unfortunate collapse of one of the segments in March. The crack that we are talking about is part of our resimulation process, in which a certain portion of the slab is re-examined to analyse the spacing of iron rods and evaluate the load-bearing capacity of the construction material,” the official said. L&T too said this is just a “regular exercise” being carried out before it submits a report to the NHAI over the strength of the structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/cracks-in-e-way-deck-slab-part-of-strength-test-nhai/articleshow/84934548.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

Sawant said the prime minister’s office has set a date of August 15, 2022, for the inauguration of the airport. The total cost of the project has gone up to Rs 2,615 crore due to court matters and the Covid-19 pandemic, Sawant said. Sawant said that the union government has notified a 6.5 km highway to connect the Mopa airport to NH 66 and that the tender has already been issued. “We will lay the foundation stone for the road soon,” he said. In 2018, the Centre had given an in-principle approval for the construction of an 8km-long highway from Dhargalim to Varconda. The authorities, however, are yet to decide whether to construct a six-lane or a four-lane highway. Sawant also said that a new skills development centre, built by GMR Goa International Airport Limited (GGIAL), which is constructing the new airport, will be operational from October and that enrollment for the centre will start from September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/34-of-mopa-airport-work-complete-cm/articleshow/84934705.cms||---

The same will be bridged in a phased manner, he said. “The policy will be implemented step-by-step in due course of time and will be fully implemented by 2030 for school education and 2040 for higher education, respectively. Infrastructural requirements cannot be ascertained at this stage because the policy will be fully implemented by 2040,” the CM has said. “However, government is in the process of assessing the infrastructural requirement at both levels.” The state committees are in the process of finalising the reports for implementation of NEP at the higher education and the school levels, the CM’s reply read. “However, consolidated report will be made public only once it is finalised and approved by the government.” Further, he said all stakeholders will be taken into confidence once before finalising the policy roadmap for the state. “The government is in the process of assessing the physical and human resource requirements for the implementation of the NEP,” he said. As preparation for implementation of NEP-2020, the full document has been circulated to schools in English, Marathi and Konkani for the benefit of heads of the schools, teachers, parent and school managing committees, Sawant said. “Headmasters have been briefed about the NEP -2020. Periodic workshops will be held to give a clear idea about implementation of salient features of NEP-2020.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-assessing-edu-infra-gaps-in-view-of-nep-cm/articleshow/84934831.cms||---

These cops have alleged that Golan has been putting pressure on police officers posted in the local police station to favour his workers and to disregard genuine complaints against them. The petitioners alleged when they refused to obey his ‘illegal orders/directions,’ the MLA, who is backing BJP and is chairman of the Haryana Tourism Corporation, used his clout to get them transferred. Justice Girish Agnihotri of the HC asked Haryana to explain the “lawful reasons” behind the transfer of these cops. COPS’ TRANSFER‘Our work conduct good, no complaints’He was hearing a petition filed by Kitab Singh, 55, an exemptee sub-inspector (ESI) and two other cops, who are at present posted at Pundri police station in Kaithal district. The petitioners sought directions to quash the transfer orders, dated July 23, which they claim were issued under “political pressure” due to malafide intentions of the Pundri MLA without any reason and justification and by way of punishment. The court adjourned the matter for August 9 and questioned the state government on why the transfer orders of these cops should not be stayed. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that their work and conduct was satisfactory and good and there was no complaint against their work and conduct. The petitioners were performing their duties with the best of their ability, hard work and honesty, the counsel told the high court. The petitioners alleged that Golan had the habit of putting undue political pressure on police officers working in the Pundri police station. “He used to issue directions to the police officials to favour his political workers and to avoid the genuine complaints of the persons related to opposite parties. When the petitioners refused to obey his illegal orders/directions then he used his political clout and got police officials transferred to Nuh district by way of punishment so that all the police officials obey his illegal orders due to his terror,” they submitted. Golan, they added, had become annoyed with them because they were performing their duties honestly and with hard work and did not obey his illegal and malafide orders as per his desires. It was due to these reasons, they claimed, he used his clout to get them transferred to Mewat to teach them a lesson. The petitioners also informed the high court that even in the past several cops were shifted to Mewat under the Pundri MLA’s pressure and provided the details of the cops transferred similarly in the recent past to the HC. However, such orders were subsequently cancelled, they claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/transfer-due-to-mlas-clout-three-haryana-cops-move-high-court/articleshow/84937495.cms||Ajay Sura

As many as 392 private hospitals – more than 56% of those investigated – have been handed showcause notices for ‘deficiencies’ detected in the scrutiny. All hospitals inspected in Indore city passed scrutiny. The orders, issued by the health directorate on Saturday, triggered ripples across MP. The statewide investigation of 692 hospitals was based on complaints and media reports, say sources. MP Nursing Home Association advisor, Dr Anoop Hajela said, “All hospitals should follow the MP Nursing Home Act. I have not seen the order myself.” Other medical experts who did not want to be named, acknowledged that there were gross violations and noncompliance of rules by many health institutions. “Some of the hospitals, I have not heard of them. Probably they mushroomed during Covid-19,” said a medical practitioner. When health department teams went on their inspections, at many nursing homes they couldn’t find the doctor in whose name the licence was taken. Some places had unqualified staff. Over 100 new hosps registered in Bhopal during pandemic Private nursing homes mushroomed during the Covid pandemic. In Bhopal alone, more than 100 new hospitals were registered. Patients at many of these hospitals were not given adequate treatment and the Nursing Home Act was not being followed, say officials. On the basis of “continuous complaints” against the nursing homes, Bhopal chief medical and health officer, Dr Prabhakar Tiwari, had sent notices to nine nursing homes in Bhopal on June16. The licences of two of them were revoked on Saturday. This triggered the statewide investigation.

The GFP delegation led by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai said that due legal and legislative norms were ignored by the BJP government while pushing the bills on Friday. The GFP MLAs conveyed to Pillai their objections and reservations about the bills being notified as laws before consultation with stakeholders and MLAs, particularly from the opposition. The GFP MLAs, along with working president Kiran Kandolkar, said the government had passed the 11 bills in a very “high handed and mischievous way” on a single day. “That the said bills were tabled in such utmost hurry itself speaks volumes and portrays that chief minister Pramod Sawant attempted to have the bills passed without a chance for the opposition MLAs to consider them or debate on the contents of the bills,” said GFP in a memorandum submitted to Pillai. Focusing on the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarni Bill, 2021, GFP said the proposed law “smacks of malafides” and appears unconstitutional and could encourage further illegalities. GFP said that the proposed Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarni law completely ignores the provisions of Goan laws, comunidade norms and basic democratic principles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-give-nod-to-11-bills-passed-hastily-guv-urged/articleshow/84935351.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Kuldeep now regrets missing his 25-year-old daughter’s excellent performance, even as she became one of the only two automatic qualifiers for the final round, the other being American Valarie Allman (66.42m). ‘Kamalpreet confident of performance in final’Kamal told me on Friday about the time of the event. I waited, but the broadcasters were showing something else. I didn’t wait much as I had some work to do at my farm," a proud Kuldeep told TOI. “When I was working, I started getting calls and messages and rushed back to my house. I hope they will show the highlights later in the day,” he added. Former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was among the first to ring up Kuldeep Singh. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal released a picture showing Badal Senior Kamalpreet’s feat. Kamalpreet belongs to Kabarwala village in Sri Muktsar Sahib district of Punjab, which falls in Lambi assembly constituency represented by the former CM. Kamalpreet began with a 60.29m effort and then improved it to 63.97m before her third throw of 64m. The Indian finished ahead of defending gold medallist Sandra Perkovic (63.75m) of Croatia and reigning world champion Yaime Perez (63.18) of Cuba. Perkovic qualified at third and Perez at seventh. Kamalpreet’s family and friends celebrate on SaturdayBut the road to Tokyo hasn’t been a cakewalk for the youngster, who had battled “mental agony”after one of her compatriots raised a request for an androgen test considering her rapid rise in throwing distance. The Punjab athlete has breached the 65m mark twice recently. She threw 65.06m during the Federation Cup in March to bag a quota for Tokyo, and in the process also broke the national record by becoming the first Indian to breach the 65m mark. Then on June 21, she bettered her own national record with a throw of 66.59m during the Indian Grand Prix-4 to sit at world number six. Acknowledging the kind of form his daughter is currently showing in Tokyo, Kuldeep exuded confidence in Kamalpreet. "She has always been devoted to her sport, and has been in great throwing form in the last three-four months. I spoke to her today, and she appeared confident of the final. I am sure the prayers of a billion people will work in her favour on August 2," said Singh, who owns 13-acre agricultural land in the village. The 6 feet 1-inch tall athlete’s coach Rakhi Tyagi, who missed the bus to Tokyo after failing to get her accreditation granted from the Tokyo organisers, is happy to keep motivating her ward virtually. "Last night when I spoke to her, she was a bit nervous, but I wanted her to go all out and enjoy the atmosphere. It is difficult to communicate virtually at times, but having been with her for so long we have a great understanding, and for the final, a target of around 66 or 67 could fetch her a medal," said Rakhi, who is with the Sports Authority of India. Meanwhile, Kuldeep has made up his mind to skip working at his farm till Kamalpreet’s event gets over on Monday. "I am not going to miss it for anything. I am praying for her to return with a medal," he said. Kamalpreet had started her sports career from the Sports Authority of India (SAI) centre at Badal village when she used to participate in discuss, javelin throw and shot put, but she soon channelised her energies on discuss throw while studying in a school at Badal village. She completed her graduation last year while spending hours on the track.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/discus-thrower-kamalpreet-kaurs-father-regrets-missing-her-super-throw-at-tokyo-olympics/articleshow/84937511.cms||Tridib Baparnash
---||Goa||Cong to ‘pray for CM’s mental state’ outside his Sakhali house||Panaji: Not satisfied with the protest outside chief minister Pramod Sawant’s official residence, Congress has decided to take their protest to Sawant’s constituency, this time through a “Sadbuddhi Yatra” on Sunday. State party president Girish Chodankar and opposition leader Digambar Kamat plan to “pray for Sawant’s mental health” outside Sawant’s residence in Sakhali. “Our functionaries will carry flowers depicting our gesture for his revival to come back into senses. We will also light candles to enlighten him of his responsibility as the chief minister of Goa,” said the party’s media head Amarnath Panjikar. On Friday Congress had organised a protest outside the official residence of the chief minister at Altinho and the supporters were subsequently detained by Goa Police and taken to the Dona Paula police outpost. They were released late in the evening. Congress also took a light-hearted dig at law minister Nilesh Cabral who had called for pre-wedding counselling sessions for couples. Panjikar said that the BJP should hold similar counselling sessions for the chief minister and the cabinet. “The peaceful, non-violent Sadbuddhi yatra is in the interest of the state. We want the chief minister to act in a responsible manner and understand that providing safety and security to the citizens is not only his responsibility but his prime duty. He has no right to continue as the chief minister if he expects the citizens and the children to take care of their own safety and security,” said Panjikar. Congress has also demanded an apology from Sawant for making “irresponsible statements” holding parents and children responsible for rapes in Goa. “He must apologize for his failure to provide safety and security to the people of Goa. It is the failure of the BJP government to maintain law and order which has resulted in rapes, murders, daylight shoot-outs and other criminal activities,” said Panjikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-to-pray-for-cms-mental-state-outside-his-sakhali-house/articleshow/84935463.cms||---

Judge Nitiraj Singh Sisodia also fined Omprakash Tyagi (35) and Satish Jatav (35), both residents of Morena district, Rs 10,000 each, CBI special prosecutor Satish Dinkar said. As per the prosecution, candidate Tyagi paid Jatav Rs1,25,000 to pass the constable recruitment test and the latter hired one Prakhar Trivedi to write the test using forged admission card and other documents. Trivedi, incidentally, died in a car crash during the course of the trial, Dinkar said. Tyagi and Jatav were convicted under sections 419 (impersonation) 420 (cheating), 467 (transfer of valuable security) 468 (forged documents), 471 (use of forged documents as genuine) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Examination Recognition Act, he said. Dinkar said CBI Inspector Shirish Pawade was the Investigating Officer (IO) of the case. The Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal or Vyapam scam pertained to several exams being rigged in exchange for money, the total amount running into several crore rupees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vyapam-scam-2-get-7-years-in-jail-for-rigging-2013-madhya-pradesh-cop-exam/articleshow/84937564.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘No cabinet reshuffle due, several parts of 18-point plan already done’, says Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH : While ruling out any possibility of an immediate cabinet reshuffle, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday said his government had already implemented several points of the party high command’s much-hyped 18-point agenda. Replying to another question about two power centres in the Congress, Capt Amarinder said there was nothing unusual as Navjot Singh Sidhu in the capacity of PPCC president and he as chief minister were performing two different sets of responsibilities. The CM said he also remained PPCC president thrice and knew well about the duties of the party president. Moreover, the government and the party were two different entities having defined roles. On the issue of the 18-point agenda given by the AICC-appointed Kharge Committee, the chief minister said that there was some confusion in this regard as his government had already implemented several points of this agenda and the remaining others would be accomplished soon. Amarinder said that he had already apprised both Sonia Gandhi and Kharge on this issue in their meeting. PPCC president Sidhu had been raising the18 points in all his meetings. The agenda was conveyed to the chief minister by the three-member AICC panel. Ruling out any possibility of an immediate cabinet reshuffle, Capt Amarinder, however, said he would surely discuss this issue with party high command during his visit to Delhi. He is likely to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi sometime next week. While interacting with the mediapersons in Sunam Udham Singh Wala (Sangrur) after dedicating Shaheed Udham Singh Memorial to people here during a state level function on 82nd martyrdom of the great revolutionary, the chief minister said that right now the party position was good and the same had to be further consolidated till elections. He added that his government and party leadership would work unitedly towards steering the Congress to victory in the ensuing assembly elections. On the issue of organising roadshows to run up to the forthcoming assembly elections, the chief minister said there were no such plans so far amid Covid-19, which is at present under control. He, however, said he would act according to the advice of medical experts on this count. Asked to comment on Sidhu’s not mentioning either his (CM), Rahul or Priyanka’s name in his address on installation ceremony as PPCC president, Amarinder Singh said that “it is hardly any issue and doesn’t affect him at all”. Asked to spell out the roadmap for the upcoming assembly polls, the CM said that his government had already fulfilled 93% of poll promises made in the election manifesto and would soon go up to 95%. He also mentioned that prior to his government, the Chandra Babu Naidu’s government in Andhra Pradesh had previously made a record by accomplishing 83% of poll promises. He said that 5% of the remaining promises were left only due to the GST regime because when their party drafted the manifesto there was a system of VAT not the prevailing GST.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-cabinet-reshuffle-due-several-parts-of-18-point-plan-already-done-says-punjab-cm-captain-amarinder-singh/articleshow/84937579.cms||---

Anthony Barajas, 19, was watching “The Forever Purge” at a theatre in Corona with Rylee Goodrich, 18, on Monday when they were shot in the head. They were found by an employee after the last showing of the night. Goodrich died at the scene. Barajas was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was placed on life support. Police said the shooting appeared to be random and unprovoked. They were working with Riverside County prosecutors to add a second murder count against the suspected shooter, Joseph Jimenez. Jimenez, 20, appeared in Riverside County Superior Court on Friday after being charged with murder in the death of Goodrich and attempted murder of Barajas. But he didn't enter a plea, and his arraignment was postponed to next week. Prosecutors also had charged Jimenez with a special circumstance of lying in wait that makes him eligible for the death penalty if convicted as charged. Jimenez has been jailed since his arrest. It's not clear whether he has retained an attorney who can speak for him. Barajas was a high school honor student and had hundreds of thousands of followers on his TikTok social media account, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported. “From his quick smile to his compassionate heart, Anthony's presence was a gift to all who knew him,” his family said in a statement on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/young-man-shot-in-california-movie-theatre-dies/articleshow/84937602.cms||---
---||Goa||Approvals under new startup policy will be expedited, says revenue minister||Porvorim: Revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate on Friday said the state government has granted administrative approval to the draft Goa Startup Policy 2021 which is prepared while integrating the department for promotion of industry and internal trade. She said that the policy would be sent to the finance department for concurrence. The minister said the policy was drafted after consulting startups, incubation centres and the central ministry. She said the policy has proposed to do away with the high-powered committee to avoid delays and maintain approval at the minister-level to expedite permissions. Monserrate said 150 applications have been received under the present startup policy of which 111 are certified and 41 have been incentivised. The draft policy proposes to revise the definition of a startup from the existing cut off of Rs 25 crore annual turnover to Rs 100 crore annual turnover. The move is part of the department of information and technology’s move to bring in more tech firms under the ambit of the policy, which will replace the Goa Startup Policy 2017. Tech bodies have been urging the government to roll out the new policy since the existing policy lapsed in 2020 and has been granted a six-month extension till March-end. The draft policy aims to create at least 500 innovative, technology-enabled startups over the next three years, which should potentially create employment for at least 6,000 Goans. Reacting to MLA Rohan Khaunte’s scam allegations in the IT department, with regards to contracts awarded to companies, Monserrate said the tender was awarded on the e-Nivida portal, brought onboard by Khaunte. “If you imply this is scam, it means e-Nivida, your initiative, is itself fraudulent,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/approvals-under-new-startup-policy-will-be-expedited-says-revenue-minister/articleshow/84935658.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As per orders issued by additional chief secretary (home) Anurag Agarwal on Saturday, the department of school education will be issuing detailed instructions about opening of all schools from August 2. Earlier, the state government had allowed schools to open for Class X to XII from July 26, nearly after four months of closure. Attendance of students has been thin. The state government had made the consent of parents mandatory for attending classes and had also given an option to students to attend online classes if they did not want to go to school. The state government, however, extended the restriction imposed earlier on July 20 to contain and manage Covid 19 till August 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-schools-open-from-aug-2-for-all-classes/articleshow/84937617.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Understand, accept changed monsoon pattern to avoid future catastrophe’||The state witnessed unprecedented rains and flash floods this season with Vidarbha’s Amravati and Akola severely hit. Floods in Western Maharashtra were followed by landslides. According to Prof Kiran Kumar Johare, an internationally renowned cloudburst and meteorologist expert, the sudden rains are nothing but cloudbursts according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards. Johare, a former IITM scientist, runs a farmer welfare blog titled ‘Concrete information not guesswork’ through which he gives rain-related forecasts to farmers in Maharashtra. In an exclusive chat with TOI, Johare says cloudbursts are a reality and that the local administration must learn to deal with such natural calamities. Excerpts… Q. Your claims about cloudbursts are groundbreaking, but there are no takers? A. According to the international standards, 25 millimetres (mm) or one inch of rain in 15 minutes or 50 mm in 30 minutes or 75 mm in 45 minutes or 100 millimetres or more in a period of one hour are considered as cloudbursts. Even the Indian Meteorological Department’s (IMD) website used to consider that rain falling at a rate of 100 millimetres per hour as a cloudbust till 2010. Researchers in Denmark, UK, US and many other countries, including India, use the term ‘cloudburst’ for this much rain in their scientific research papers. Unfortunately, in Maharashtra, our officials are using the confusing terms like ‘Ativrushti’ (heavy rains), Mahavrushti (very heavy rains) etc. which is not recognized by the WMO because they are unscientific, confusing, inaccurate and incomplete. Q. Have you noticed any such ‘cloudbursts’ in Vidarbha region this year? A: Unfortunately, Vidarbha and Marathwada regions are on the hit list of cloudbursts. On Sunday, July 11, at around 5.30am, a massive cloudburst was witnessed in Daryapur and Anjangaon Surji areas of Amravati district. Thousands of acres of farmland got submerged and crop was washed away. Last year, the rainfall in Marathwada increased by about 200 per cent and in places like Kannada, more than 1,000mm of rain was recorded. Agriculture in the whole of Marathwada was severely damaged. Now, East Vidarbha has been witnessing an increasing number of rains and cloudbursts. This will increase in the next few years due to the changed monsoon pattern. Q. In what way has the monsoon pattern changed? A. I have been claiming from the last 10 years or so that the monsoon pattern has changed. In 2019, monsoon rains began on July 15 and continued till November 15. In 2020, the monsoon season started in August and continued till December. In 2021, the real monsoon will start in August and rains will continue till December. The rains we are receiving in June and July are flash rains or heavy pre-monsoon activity. Our standards mainly depend upon the rainfall parameters. So, once a rainfall of that much parameter is recorded, our authorities announce that monsoon has arrived, settled in etc. As the monsoon pattern has changed, we must plan our farming activities accordingly. Farmers must get early warnings. Q. Is it possible to give early warnings regarding cloudbursts? A. It’s very much possible for the weather department to provide not just the forecast but the accurate information about the amount of rain in our suburbs, villages or areas. India has the latest technology and super computers ready and functioning. The technology is new, but the users are old. It is a ‘superstition’ to assume that the weather prediction system will improve automatically. If given an opportunity and access to data and control of various weather-related equipment, I can surely claim that my team will be able to provide accurate information to people on their mobile phones every ten minutes. Q. Have you ever predicted flash rains in the past? A. When I was conducting research work with IITM on October 4, 2010, Pashan in Pune had received 182mm rain in 90 minutes. We predicted this cloudburst quite early and saved many lives. In 2013, a cloudburst alert in Gadchiroli was delivered in advance by us. Recently, on September 19, 2020, my team delivered a message regarding cloudbursts in four places in Nashik. As alerts were served through a private system, many farmers were the beneficiaries. My blog ‘Andaz Nave Mahiti’ (Information not guesswork) has become quite popular over the years. If people get a cloudburst alert early, they can keep their important documents safe, take their vehicles and livestock to a safer place to save major losses. Q. Is there any difference in rainfall and cloudburst? A: Cloudburst means lethal rainfall of 100 millimetres per hour or more. This is often referred to as flash floods. Heavy rains in a short period of time cause landslides. Houses or walls collapse. The size of water droplets in cloudburst is about the size of a peanut or even bigger. Lightning flashes and thunder can be heard. The sky looks white. Rainwater flows from the eyebrows and literally makes visibility difficult. All this was experienced in Amravati district earlier this month. The pictures are scary. Q. Is there any permanent way to predict cloudbursts in advance? A. As the time to come will be difficult, farmers as well as the administration need to take immediate steps to prevent the collapse of agriculture. A collective effort is also needed to face the situation with courage. There is a need to install rain gauges in 43,722 villages in Maharashtra and for this to happen, the Gram Panchayat should invest its funds. My team is ready to provide the necessary technical assistance for online training and rain gauge. We are committed to the cause of farmers.

Judge N Krishanaiah of the special court also directed the district legal services authority to compensate the boy with Rs 5 lakh. Mufti Musharaf, a native of Uttar Pradesh, was working with a madrassa near Amalapur in Tumakuru when the incident took place on April 17, 2015. It came to light two days later when the mother visited the boy in the madrassa. The boy broke down seeing his mother and requested her to take him back. He explained to her how he had been wronged by the teacher. A complaint with Tumakuru rural police station was lodged and Musharaf was arrested under IPC sections 377 (unnatural offence), 506 (criminal intimidation) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Special public prosecutor GV Gayathri said statements by the boy and his mother during the trial helped in punishing the teacher. Eleven eyewitnesses, including administrative officials of the madrassa who had enrolled the boy, deposed their statements. Musharaf took the boy to Tumakuru railway station on the pretext of buying a ticket to UP. As a rule, each day, attendance of the wards in the madrassa will be taken at 9.30pm. On April 17, 2015, Musharaf told the boy that he would require help in translation at the station as he did not know Kannada. Musharaf took him on his bike and, on reaching the railway station, said the vehicle had run out of fuel and they had to stay in a nearby hotel. “In the hotel’s register, he had mentioned his name as well as that of the boy. After committing the crime, Musharaf took the boy on his bike the next morning and dropped him back at the madrassa. He returned to the lodge and vacated the room. The hotel ledger mentioned there were two persons; a man and a boy while entering the room, and only the man was present while vacating it,” she said. Soon after the complaint, police subjected the boy and Musharaf to medical tests. The reports confirming the offence too played a crucial role in the conviction, Gayathri told STOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/madrassa-teacher-jailed-for-sodomy/articleshow/84936139.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Board results: 99.53% Class 10 students successful||LUCKNOW: In a year marred by the Covid-19 crisis that forced Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board (UPSEB) to cancel Board examinations for the first time in its 100-year history, 99.53% class 10 students and 97.88% class 12 students were declared successful on Saturday. In the absence of examinations, there was no merit list in the results tally. While the class 10 pass percentage rose to 99.53%, a giant leap of 16.2% from last year’s 83.31%, the pass percentage of class 12 too soared to 97.88%, an increase of 23.3% from 74.6% last year. Results announced by UPSEB chairperson V K Pandey were based on the new tabulation method following UP government’s decision to scrap exams due to Covid-19. For (class 12) students, the board considered 50% marks obtained in class 10, 40% from class 11 and remaining 10% obtained by students in pre-board examination of class 12. Likewise for class 10 students, 50% marks were calculated from total marks obtained in class 9 and 50% scored in class 10 pre-board. More girls passed both class 10, 12About 30 lakh candidates had registered for class 10 exams, of which 29.8 lakh were declared successful. In class 12, 25 lakh candidates were declared successful of 26.1 lakh who had registered. Among 29.8 lakh who passed class 10 exams, 82,238 students were promoted without marks. These students were in the ‘doubtful’ category, said officials. Likewise, in class 12, 62,506 students of 25.5 lakh were promoted without marks. According to UPSEB, students who failed to secure minimum pass marks in theory subjects during tabulation and those whose annual examination scores of class 9 and 11, and marks of pre-boards of class 10 and 12 were unavailable were promoted uniformly. “These students had to be promoted because the board didn’t have their data. This was most likely because their schools did not conduct exams,” said a senior official. More girls passed both exams. While in class 10, 99.52% boys were successful against 99.55% girls. In class 12, 98.4% girls cleared the exams against 97.47% boys.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-board-results-99-53-class-10-students-successful/articleshow/84937643.cms||Isha Jain

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Fighter mom braves Covid, tough delivery and 36-day life support||Bengaluru: Suma (name changed), a 37-year-old Covid-positive woman not only survived 36 days on life support but also gave birth to a healthy boy while on a ventilator. She battled septic shock and fought the virus for 55 days in hospital before she finally recovered. Her hospital stay included 36 days of ECMO (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation) and 19 days in the ICU. The banking executive was 31 weeks pregnant when she contracted Covid pneumonia and was admitted to Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road on May 21. Her health deteriorated with her lungs not performing to peak capacity. She was put on a ventilator and two days later, she delivered a boy via C-section. Though preterm, he was healthy and Covid negative. He joined the family which includes Suma’s IT professional husband and a six-year-old sibling. Soon after, her health took a turn for the worse. The pulmonology team (led by Dr Ravindra Mehta), critical care team (headed by Dr Jagadish), Dr Vinay Devraj (infectious disease specialist), Dr Dharmesh Agrawal (cardiac anesthesiologist) and Dr Arul Furtado (cardiac surgery) joined forces for her treatment. Had post-delivery complications:Dr Furtado said after the delivery, she showed some improvement but three days later, her lungs turned from black to white and she couldn’t maintain sufficient oxygen levels. “She was put on ECMO,” Dr Furtado said. (ECMO mimics lung functions – provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide and helps the lungs rest while recovering from Covid pneumonia.) He added that Suma may not have survived but for ECMO, and even that guarantees only a survival rate of 30-35%. After going on ECMO, she had full-blown Covid pneumonia along with bacterial pneumonia. Dr Mehta said she went into septic shock when her blood pressure fell and toxins wreaked havoc. “She was on multiple antibiotics and high doses of medication to maintain blood pressure. But, over a week, she recovered and her airways and lungs were cleared via bronchoscopy,” Dr Mehta said. After 36 days, Suma was taken off ECMO and, over the next two weeks, she gradually started breathing on her own. She was discharged on July 17 after making a complete recovery. She never gave up:Dr Furtado said Suma’s treatment team was thrilled to see her recover. “We supported each other through those difficult days,” he said. Dr Mehta said a multidisciplinary approach and the committed nursing & perfusion teams facilitated her recovery. “It was particularly gratifying as she had Covid during pregnancy and septic shock too. She’s a fighter, never gave up and inspired us to ensure she went back healed to her family,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fighter-mom-braves-covid-tough-delivery-and-36-day-life-support/articleshow/84936125.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Nagpur||Cops crack WCL staffer’s murder; wife, paramour held||Chandrapur: Ballarpur police on Saturday cracked the murder case of Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) employee Maroti alias Vikky Kakade and have arrested his wife, paramour, mother-in-law and one other person. Investigations have revealed that Kakade was killed for being a hurdle in the illicit relationship of his wife Prajakta and main accused Sanjay Tikle. Kakade worked at WCL’s Sasti mine. His body with the throat slit was found near Sasti bridge over Wardha River on Thursday night. Initial inference was that way-layers might have robbed him and thrown his body after killing him. However, call records of the deceased gave away clues about foul play in the case. When cops grilled Vikky’s wife, she spilled the beans and confessed to the crime. Police sources said Prajakta was in a relationship with Tikle, her distant relative from Ghugus. Apart from planning to kill Vikky, Prajakta was also after the WCL job she would get on compassionate grounds after death of her husband. Prajakta’s mother, Kanta Bhasakhetre, was also involved in the plan that was hatched a month ago. Police said Tikle took help of his friend Vikas Nagrale from Ghugus to execute the crime. The accused revealed that Tikle and Nagrale took Vikky to Sasti to consume liquor. Later, the duo took Vikky to Nakoda village near Ghugus and killed him by strangulating him in a nullah behind ACC cement factory. The duo then dumped the bike of the deceased there and took Vikky’s body in Tikle’s car to Sasti bridge near Ballarpur to dispose it of. When asked why did not they throw the body into the flooded river, Prajakta said she was after the compensatory job of her husband and disposing of the body would have delayed that. Cops have registered an offence of murder and other relevant charges against Prajakta, Tikle, Bhashaketre and Nagrale. All of them have been remanded in police custody till August 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-crack-wcl-staffers-murder-wife-paramour-held/articleshow/84934066.cms||---

NIAL is implementing the joint-venture project of the UP government. The agreement was signed in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath and senior government officials, including officials of civil aviation department, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority and representatives of Zurich Airport International (AG). This firmed up the possibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi shortly laying the project foundation, paving way for construction. CM Yogi expressed happiness over the time-bound progress of the project despite the pandemic. He said, the airport was coming up in an area which was once infamous for land disputes. He said, his government directly coordinated with villagers, leading to seamless acquisition of land straddling 1,334 hectares in the first phase. ‘Aviation sector will generate jobs, propel economic prosperity’From site clearance from civil aviation ministry to immigration services nod from home ministry or taking no-objection from environment ministry, work was completed within the deadline. He stressed the aviation sector will not only generate employment, but also propel economic prosperity through investments and boost tourism. The CM said, the process of connecting Jewar airport to high-speed rail and Indira Gandhi International Airport by road and metro rail is underway. Civil aviation minister Nand Gopal Nandi said, the greenfield airport will provide a global identity to UP. Hammered out on a PPP model, the first phase of Jewar airport is scheduled to be completed in three years. It will have a capacity to handle 12 million passengers annually, which will be raised to 70 million by 2040-50. It will also double up as a cargo airport with a capacity to handle 2.6 million tonnes of cargo by 2040-50. The project is proposed to have two runways in the initial stage, which will be increased to six. The state government has acquired adequate land for rehabilitation of families affected by land acquisition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/noida-airport-foundation-soon-nial-signs-licence-memo-with-swiss-developer/articleshow/84937676.cms||Pankaj Shah

The family members of Rahul alias Bunty Borade alleged that he died in police custody, but the cops deny this, saying Rahul probably arrived at Dwarkapuri police station after taking some kind of poisonous substance. Rahul, who lived in Vidur Nagar, was suspected to have supplied spurious liquor, bottled as an IMFL brand, to Sapna and Paradise bars. Police were on a lookout for him. His uncle Shekhar Gurjar said Rahul had gone to Barwah in Khargone to immerse the ashes of his father in River Narmada on Friday. Ethyl & methyl alcohol found in reports: CopsHe went to the police station the same evening on learning that he was marked as a suspect in a spurious liquor case, Gurjar said. Dwarkapuri police station in charge Satish Kumar Dwivedi said: “Rahul started vomiting after he reached the police station. He was taken to hospital, where he died during treatment. He might have consumed some poisonous substance before reaching the police station.” Police are on the trail of a gang involved in bottling spurious liquor and passing them off as well-known brands. On Saturday, four people, including owners of Sapna bar and Paradise Club and Resort, were arrested for allegedly selling spurious liquor. Police said ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol have been found in viscera reports of two victims, identified as Shishir alias Chhotu Choudhary of Scheme-51 and Sachin Gupta of Sukhdev Nagar. “Shishir had consumed liquor at Paradise bar in Chhota Bangarda on July 23, and died on July 25. Sachin died on July 27, two days after he took alcohol at Sapna Bar,” DIG Manish Kapooria said. Aerodrome police on Saturday arrested Paradise Bar’s owner Yogesh alias Yogi Yadav and the owner of Sapna Bar identified, Vikas Baredia. Two others -- Pravin Yadav of New Govind Colony and Pankaj Suryavanshi of Valmiki Nagar --have also been arrested for allegedly supplying spurious liquor.The accused have been booked under IPC sections 304, 328 of the IPC and under MP Excise Act.

---||Kolkata||Moving into Top Gear||Kolkata: Till a year ago, advertising executive Bibhor Singhania had never thought of any business venture, leave alone trading in cycles. Cycle shops on Bentinck Street had been just about surviving selling no-frills standard cycles to milkmen, newspaper vendors, gardeners, plumbers and other tradesmen. The minuscule percentage that stocked up on more expensive lifestyle bikes regretted the low sales and a few old shops had even downed shutters. In March 2020, the world declared a pandemic and India went into lockdown. Public transport went off roads and gyms and parks were shut down. Those on emergency duty had to organise a transport. Suddenly, the humble cycle’s versatility as a vehicle for commuting, exercise and exploring the city surfaced. As some posted the experience on social media, it fuelled more interest. And demand zoomed. Singhania spotted the opportunity and dived in. “Everyone was suddenly taking to cycling. The passion had been rekindled, for some due to necessity and others who wanted to stay fit. It also allowed social distancing. When I went to purchase a bike around September, I found the experience very poor with crammed shops and no guidance. That’s when I decided to open a showroom myself,” says Singhania, who opened a 2,200 sqft store, Veloton Cycling, on Prince Anwar Shah Road this February. He stocks cycles ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh. Dipika Kedia, who had opened the cycle store Bike Studio in Salt Lake in 2018 and rode the boom, says the age profile of customers has changed. While she gets customers from all age groups, usually 30% are now below 20 years, 50% between 20 and 45 years and the rest above 45. “Earlier, 80% of the customers were below 20 years, 15% in the 20-45 years’ bracket and the other 5% above 45 years,” she said. Dhrupad Raja, who used to cycle to St Xavier’s College and park his bike in an obscure corner to avoid the strange looks of his classmates, also ventured into the business. A techie in Bengaluru, Raja had returned to the city post-lockdown, sensed the opportunity and set up a workshop — Wise Cyclist — with Vipul Kedia in Bhowanipore to manufacture custom-made bikes. “Cycling has now become ‘cool’. Usually, a person’s third or fourth bike is custom-made where key measurements — knee to ankle; pelvis to knee; elbow to wrist; shoulder to elbow; torso; and angle of sitting posture — are taken and the bike designed for the individual,” explained Raja. His cycles range from Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh, depending on whether the material used is steel, aluminium alloy or carbon fibre. UP Cycle stores, that has been in the business for half a century, and Decathlon in Salt Lake since January 2019 have seen demand skyrocket. “Some categories of bikes that had no takers earlier were suddenly in demand and we were saddled with a three-six months’ wait period,” said UP Cycles proprietor Ashish Gupta, who has even sold a cycle worth Rs 7.5 lakh. The increase in sales of lifestyle cycles, including mountain terrain bikes, hybrid cycles and road bikes, has also fuelled sales of biking helmets, lights, water canisters, bright jerseys and padded shorts, glasses, gloves and bandanas. “New-age cyclists are more conscious about protective gear and other accessories, leading to a category of business that hardly existed before,” said Siddharth Sharma of Decathlon. While cycles from all over the world are available in Kolkata now, Hero Cycles — the world’s largest cycle manufacturer — is doing roaring business. “Before 2020, 50-60% households owned a cycle. Now, there are three cycles for two households in Kolkata and by next year, we expect every household to have two cycles,” said Hero Cycles area manager Priyam Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/moving-into-top-gear/articleshow/84934629.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Misuse reports prompt govt-hospital meet on Swasthya Sathi tomorrow||KOLKATA: The state health department has convened a meeting of all private cancer hospitals empanelled under Swasthya Sathi after reports of misuse of the scheme by over-prescription of expensive medicines. The meeting, scheduled to take place on Monday at Swasthya Bhavan, “follows instructions from the highest level of the government”, say officials. “We have got credible reports of over-prescription of some expensive medicines, which is bleeding the Swasthya Sathi scheme,” a senior health department official told TOI on Saturday. “The money is going to pharma companies that sell these expensive medicines and a few unscrupulous doctors who may be prescribing these medicines even when they are not necessary or may not significantly improve a patient’s condition or chances of survival,” he added. The government, say officials, is “concerned at the abuse of a scheme” that is meant to help patients. “Our aim is to implement reforms in the Swasthya Sathi scheme, especially for cancer treatment. There is credible feedback of over-prescription of expensive medicines that might not be needed at all. The ultimate aim of the scheme is to provide treatment to patients. This aim is defeated if a patient has to stop treatment midway after the Swasthya Sathi cover gets exhausted because of over-prescription of expensive medicines,” said a senior state health department official engaged in the scheme’s implementation. “We intend to bring in more specific guidelines and packages for cancer treatment and want to take inputs from private hospitals before doing that,” he added, explaining the reason behind Monday’s meeting. The Bengal government’s ambitious universal health scheme gives an annual cover of up to Rs 5 lakh for treatment of various ailments, including cancer. “Many of the complaints that have reached us involve expensive immunotherapy medicines,” an official said. These medicines are often used in second- or third-line treatment, say cancer specialists. “A few unscrupulous doctors are prescribing these drugs after first-line chemotherapy treatment. But what is the benefit if a patient is forced to use up Rs 5 lakh of the annual cover on only two or three doses of treatment and then does not have any financial support for the remaining treatment?” a medical oncologist asked. “Who takes care of the patient after that? The only gainers are the pharma company that has sold the medicine and the unscrupulous doctor who has prescribed the medicine,” he added. Another oncologist spoke about a recent raid on a medicine shop attached with a private hospital after a patient’s family complained that 20 mg of an immunotherapy drug, which should have come free with a 100-mg vial, was being sold to them at a price. “This is just one example of how these medicines are being abused for profiteering,” she added. Some doctors also feel that the government must not allow private hospitals to sell medicines at the maximum retail price under the Swasthya Sathi scheme as MRP is often several times higher than the actual cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/misuse-reports-prompt-govt-hosp-meet-on-swasthya-sathi-tomorrow/articleshow/84934264.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The Trinamool’s key political slogan in the run-up to the assembly elections in Bengal is now the state government’s flagship scheme for the youth. The state sports and youth affairs department will hand over 1 lakh footballs to various sporting clubs. Even the ones registered with the IFA will get 10 footballs each, the CM has announced. Banerjee has said August 16 will be observed as ‘Khela Hobe Diwas’ in the memory of the 16 football fans who died in a stampede during a 1980 game at Eden Gardens. Dedicating the day in this manner will boost sportsman spirit, she added. Clubs have already enlisted under the scheme and Refugee Handicraft, an MSME unit, is making these ‘Joyee’ footballs. The CM wants to encourage Bengal’s youth to actively participate in sports, especially football, and the Khela Hobe scheme is a big step in that direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-to-kick-off-khela-hobe-scheme-tomorrow/articleshow/84933845.cms||---

T Srinithi, executive director of Shivshakti Agro, cycles 30km daily. He starts from his South City residence at 5am to do the rounds of the Maidan and Dalhousie before returning by 6.30am. He has been cycling since July 2019. Investment banker Ashish Bajaj, one of the most popular names in the cycling circuit, started it in 2016. The group he co-founded, Cycle Network Grow, had barely 50 members then and now has 1,300. Come rain or shine, Varun Singh, a senior executive in a healthcare company, takes a bike ride. He says biking is the perfect way to explore a city like Kolkata. He also does ultra-cycling runs of 600km and has qualified for the prestigious Paris-Brest-Paris (PBP) Randonneurs in 2023. Amol Sahare, an examiner of patents and designs who moved to Kolkata from Gadchiroli in Maharashtra in February 2017, cycles to work from New Town to the Intellectual Property Office in Salt Lake Sector V. Eight others in the office have been inspired by Sahare and now travel to office on cycles. The group of cyclists also include members of the entertainment industry. Film production company SVF Entertainment’s co-founder Mahendra Soni was one of the early ones to take up cycling to stay fit after the pandemic was declared. He has inspired several others, including actors Anindya Chatterjee, Gourab Chatterjee and Devlina Kumar. IGP Ajay Kumar Nand has been cycling passionately for a dozen years. He got hooked to cycling in 2009 when he and nine other officers at the National Police Academy undertook a Srinagar to Kanyakumari trip in 34 days. “A lot has changed since then. People have become health conscious. The quality of cycles has also improved,” said Nand, who cycles 25-30km daily, as do his wife and children. RJ Arvind, who is as crazy about Kishore Kumar and RD Burman as he is about cycling, used to ride to St Lawrence School and then St Xavier’s College from his Golf Green home and still goes to work on a bike. “I do my bit to reduce my carbon footprint,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-rides-out-a-pandemic/articleshow/84934818.cms||Subhro Niyogi

He was speaking after distributing cheques of Rs 10lakh each to 55 families of journalists, who died of Covid while on duty. “We organised special vaccination camps in Lucknow and Noida for media persons as they, like all corona warriors, needed a shield from the virus. Unlike healthcare staff, journalists did not have safety gears like PPE kits and gloves and were also short on masks and sanitizers. “Yet, they faced challenges and helped the government by highlighting facts,” he said. Yogi said special booths vaccinated around 25,000 journalists and their family members. “We brought down vaccine wastage and immunised the maximum number of people. Each vial can inoculate at least 11 persons,” he said. The CM said, though the situation was under control, the virus had the potential to mutate further. “We are thankful to PM Narendra Modi for providing vaccines and the speed of vaccination drive was enough to provide safety to the maximum number of people,” he said. President of National Broadcast Association and senior journalist Rajat Sharma said, media persons were not deterred by the devastating pandemic waves and continued to perform their duty. He also thanked chief minister Yogi Adityanath for organising special vaccination camps for journalists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-chief-minister-yogi-adityanath-gives-rs-10-lakh-to-kin-of-55-journalists-who-died-of-covid/articleshow/84937689.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka high court cites personal interest, rules out PIL against BS Yediyurappa||BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court on Saturday declined to entertain as Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition filed by social activist TJ Abraham as it felt he had a personal interest in it. Abraham had sought a probe by a Special Investigating Team comprising senior officers of the Anti-Corruption Bureau and registering a First Information Report into alleged payment of bribes and collection of cash on behalf of former CM BS Yediyurappa by his son BY Vijayendra and other family members. As an alternative, he sought a CBI probe into the matter. Appearing on Abraham’s behalf, senior advocate Meenakshi Arora told the court while acknowledging that there is a case to proceed, the trial court dismissed the private complaint on the ground that there is no valid sanction as the governor had rejected the request. However, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka pointed out that no FIR had been registered in the first place to refer the matter to any agency. The bench noted that since the petitioner had already filed a private complaint which had been dismissed, he had a personal interest and the remedy is elsewhere, not a PIL. The bench directed the registry to recategorise the petition. It will now come up before a single bench. On July 8, 2021, the trial court had rejected Abraham’s private complaint against Yediyurappa and others, citing that the governor had rejected sanction for prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Abraham had alleged payment of bribe of Rs 12 crore in relation to a BDA housing project as revealed in a TV channel’s expose and also illegal collection of around Rs 17.5 crore in cash on behalf of Yediyurappa by his family members. On November 20, 2019, he had approached the governor seeking sanction for prosecution against Yediyurappa and ST Somashekar. In addition to Yediyurappa and his son BY Vijayendra, grandson Shashidhar Maradi, son-in-law Virupakshappa Yamakanmaradi, Sanjay Sree, son-in-law of Yediyurappa’s daughter Padmavathi, cooperation minister ST Somashekar and businessman Chandrakanth Ramalingam were named as accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-cites-personal-interest-rules-out-pil-against-bsy/articleshow/84932388.cms||---

On July 17, two Covid deaths were reported in the state taking the death toll to 10,512. Ever since in the two weeks only one death has been reported. This was reported on July 28, and the death toll increased to 10,513. However, on July 12, a total of 1,478 deaths were added to the total death toll as the state government claimed that it is reconciliation of deaths which could not be reported during the second wave peak due to several reasons. Of these deaths, 762 had occurred at private hospitals across the state, 208 had died in home isolation and 508 were other deaths across several districts. With this addition, the total death toll had increased to 10,506 on July 12. Thus, between July 12 and July 31 only seven deaths have been reported. In the last few days there has been a mild but perceptible increase in new Covid-19 cases. For the past four days, more than 10 new cases are being reported daily. On July 31, a total of 22 new Covid-19 cases were reported and it was after more than 15 days that more than 20 new cases were reported in the state, as last time on July 15, 20 new Covid-19 cases were reported, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/1-covid-death-in-fortnight-in-madhya-pradesh-caution-is-the-key/articleshow/84937660.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Kochi||Kerala: 5 years & Rs 165 crore later, a green light at end of Kuthiran tunnel||THRISSUR: The Kuthiran tunnel, part of the Mannuthi-Wadakkanchery stretch of the National Highway, was opened on Saturday evening, marking the fruition of a long-pending dream of Kerala in the transport infrastructure sector. The project to construct two tunnels, each 964 m long, at Kuthiran was launched to reduce the acute traffic block on this stretch of the NH linking Kerala with Tamil Nadu and other south Indian states. The traffic blocks on this vital road often continued for hours together. This stretch had also witnessed numerous accidents claiming several lives and injuring hundreds. The opening of the road tunnel, reportedly the longest in south India, is expected to ease the traffic. The blasting for the tunnel, estimated to cost 165 crore, had begun in June 2016. Curiously, the opening of the tunnel was rather abrupt. Almost everyone -- including state ministers, officials and even the construction company officials --was caught unawares when Union minister for surface transport Nitin Gadkari tweeted in the afternoon that the tunnel is going to be opened. Public works minister Muhammed Riyas and revenue minister K Rajan said even around noon that they were unaware of the opening of the tunnel. Now, focus on opening second tunnel: MinisterThe state government had directed the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials and the construction company to open at least one tunnel by August. The contract for converting the 28.5-km Mannuthy-Wadakkanchery road was inked way back in 2009, and the estimated cost was only Rs 641 crore. The cost has gone up to over Rs 1,300 crore as per the RTI replies received by Congress leader Shaji Kodenkandath in 2019. The work also got inordinately delayed due to various reasons. The main work of constructing a twin tunnel at Kuthiran climb was awarded to KMC Constructions Ltd, which subcontracted it to Pragathi Engineering and Rail Projects Ltd. Pragathi Engineering had quit after completing over 90% work on the first tunnel and nearly 75% work on the other, by alleging that KMC had not paid about Rs 60 crore as the cost of the completed work. The tunnel work is now being undertaken directly by the KMC. Even though the left tunnel meant for travel from Wadakkanchery to Mannuthi has been opened, the work on the other tunnel meant to carry traffic from Mannuthi to Thrissur is progressing. KMC officials have claimed that the second tunnel will be ready for traffic by December this year. District collector Haritha V Kumar received a communication from the NHAI project director around 5.30pm, saying that the tunnel will be opened this evening. The collector and city police commissioner Aadhithya R were among the first passengers through the tunnel when it was opened around 7.55pm. Ministers Riyaz and Rajan said they were happy that at least one tunnel had been opened though the state government was not taken into confidence about the timing of the opening. “We are now focusing on the opening of the second tunnel, and will continue supporting and putting pressure on the NHAI and the construction company for the early completion of the work,” Riyaz said. Rajan said there would be strong public resistance if the construction company starts collecting toll citing the completion of one tunnel. Toll collection can begin only after the entire work associated with the six-laning of the Mannuthy-Wadakkanchery road is completed, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-5-years-rs-165-crore-later-a-green-light-at-end-of-kuthiran-tunnel/articleshow/84937765.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Business||Bandhan Bank posts 32% fall in Q1 net to Rs 373 cr||Kolkata: City-based private sector lender Bandhan Bank has reported a 32.1% decline in its net profit to Rs 373 crore in the first quarter this fiscal. This was largely due to additional provisions on non-performing assets (NPAs) and accelerated provisions on standard assets for potential impact of Covid-19. The bank is also planning to reduce the weightage of microfinance in its portfolio from 60% to 30%. During the first quarter this fiscal, the lender made additional provisions on NPA amounting to Rs 750.8 crore for potential impact of Covid 19 on certain loan portfolios, while it also held accelerated provisions of Rs 322.6 crore on standard assets as at June 30. The lender's total provision and contingencies during the first quarter of FY22 rose 61.9% Rs 1,374 crore from Rs 849 crore in the same quarter previous fiscal. During the period under review, gross NPAs as a percentage of total loans increased 137 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 8.1% from 6.8% during the fourth quarter last fiscal. During Q1FY22, net NPA ratio, however, fell by 22 bps q-o-q at 3.29% from 3.5% in Q4FY21. Commenting on the performance, Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, MD and CEO, Bandhan Bank, said, “In spite of challenging environment due to Covid second wave, we have delivered the best ever quarter in terms of operational performances. Collections continues to improve with Covid restrictions getting relaxed.” Typically, second half of the financial year is always better for the bank in terms of growth and collections, Ghosh said adding with easing of Covid second wave and upcoming festive season, the bank is confident of achieving better performance going forward. During Q1FY22, the bank’s loan portfolio grew 8.1% y-o-y, while its EEB (erstwhile micro-banking segment) portfolio grew 12% y-o-y during the period. Total collection efficiency for EEB portfolio during the June quarter stood at 98%. Ghosh informed that during Q1FY22, around Rs 4,661 crore worth of loans were restructured, while gross slippages stood at Rs 1,661 crore. In Q4FY21, gross slippages was around Rs 3,500 crore. “EEB is 60% of our business and that is unsecured. And, situation was such that with Covid last quarter that doorstep collections were not possible in many parts. So, slippages have been higher in this business,” said Sunil Samdani, CFO, Bandhan Bank. On overall collection efficiency, the bank said July was better than June. “Our growth situation is intact,” Ghosh said, adding the bank was focussing on transformation and diversification of its balance sheet for greater secure-unsecure loans balance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bandhan-bank-posts-32-fall-in-q1-net-to-rs-373-cr/articleshow/84906500.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: 45 years on, man believed to be dead in air crash returns home||KOLLAM: Ninetyone-year-old Fathima Beevi also, like her other family members, believed that her eldest son Sajaad Thangal (70) had died in a 1976 air crash. On Saturday evening, however, he returned to Beevi's loving hands after 45 years. The occasion turned into a celebration at their house, Padanilathu Thekkathil, Venga, Mainagappally Sasthamcotta, with friends and relatives arriving to witness the reunion. Sajaad, who had gone to the UAE in a ship in 1971, had returned to Mumbai in 1996 by air. His family members believed that he had also died in the air crash, in which south Indian actress Ranichandra was also killed, as there was no information about him after that. Sajaad was part of a team that organised a stage show of Ranichandra in the Gulf and he suspected that he could also be made an accused in the case related to the air crash. Ranichandra had offered the organisers a print of one of her films after they didn't profit much from the stage show and he was asked to go with her to Madras, now Chennai, and collect it. However, it was his friend Sudhakaran who accompanied her. ‘Fell into depression after the accident’Sajaad says he fell into a depression after the accident. It was two years ago that he reached Zeal Ashram in Panavel near Mumbai. The ashram officials identified his family in Sathamcotta last week and handed him over to his younger brothers Muhammed Kunju, Abdul Rasheed and nephew Salim a couple of days ago. Sajaad says he could return home and meet his mother because of the love and care he got at the ashram. “I cannot describe how good they were,” he adds.

Dr Sanket Mehta, a Surat-based anesthesiologist, came back from the brink after a total 96 days of hospitalization. There was a time when Dr Mehta had machines breathing for him and he showed no chance of recovery. Dr Mehta’s friends Dr Jayesh Thakral, Dr Sandeep Patel and Dr Hiren Shah dug in their heels that if there was only 1% chance of his survival, they were ready to bet on that. The friends along with relatives raised Rs 80 lakh through crowdfunding and another Rs 8 lakh from the doctor fraternity to shift Dr Mehta to Chennai in an air ambulance. “If I am alive today it is because of my friends who refused to concede defeat and let me go,” an emotional Dr Mehta told TOI. The good doctor himself won many hearts when a video of him risking his own life in Covid-19 ICU as a patient to intubate another patient went viral on social media. “It was a tough call for the family, but we convinced them that we wish the best for him, and we would take responsibility for the risks we were running,” said Dr Thakral. Likewise, Dr Patel in Ahmedabad too had great friends rallying for him when he fought for life during second wave. Dr Patel succumbed but his friends say their consolation is they did all to give him a fighting chance. Dr Patel (43) and his entire family was Covid positive in May at the peak of the second wave. He lost his father and later became critical with severe Covid-19 with his lungs becoming completely non-functional. Shailesh Patel, owner of a medical store and Dr Patel’s friend for over 15 years, said that all his batchmates such as Dr Pranav Joshi and Dr Vismit Joshipura came together to support Dr Patel. “We did all we could – right from getting the emergency bed to raising funds – to get one fighting chance for Dr Patel,” he said. Patel not only went to Chennai ahead of the air ambulance at the end of May and arranged for the room at the hospital, but also ensured all the logistics and support for Dr Patel’s family back home. After his unfortunate demise mid-June, Patel got his clinic on Anandnagar road on rent so that his family is looked after. “Dr Patel never said no to any of his friends or patients,” said Patel. The friends had raised close to Rs 1 crore for Dr Patel’s treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/they-were-friends-indeed-to-two-doctors-in-need/articleshow/84937902.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The survivor had moved the apex court in mid-June and the case has been listed for hearing on August 2. The Kerala High Court had in February dismissed the petition filed by Vadakkumchery, who was convicted in the case, seeking bail to marry the survivor. After considering his contention that it was consensual sex and that he renounced his priesthood to marry the survivor, the high court had said that the trial court’s finding that the survivor was a minor at the time of the alleged rape is still in force. An appeal against the conviction is pending before the high court. The high court said allowing the parties to get married while the trial court’s finding that the survivor was a child remains, would mean granting judicial approval to the marriage. As long as that finding remains, which itself is one of the crucial issue involved in the appeal, granting bail to enable the parties to get married and to have custody of their child will be giving legal sanctity to such marriage, the HC had observed. A Thalassery court had on February 12, 2019, awarded 20 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 3 lakh to Vadakkumchery for raping and impregnating the minor. He was serving as a parish vicar near Kannur and was the manager of the Church-run school where the girl was studying. The case was registered in 2017 when Childline got an anonymous call saying that a minor girl had delivered a baby in a hospital run by the church at Koothuparamba, on February 7, 2017. A police probe revealed that Fr Vadakkumchery had sexually abused the minor girl. In the course of the trial, the survivor and all main prosecution witnesses, including her parents, turned hostile but prosecution secured a conviction by managing to produce the girl’s original birth certificate that proved she was a minor when she was sexually abused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kottiyoor-minor-rape-survivor-moves-apex-court-to-marry-tormentor/articleshow/84937923.cms||---

Ten candidates, including five professors from Anna University and two from IIT Madras, were shortlisted from the 160-odd candidates from across the country who applied for the post, sources said. Candidates are likely to be asked to present their vision for the state’s premier technical university, including their plans for bringing in funds and improving the research output, during the interview. Following the interview, the search panel will recommend three names to governor Banwarilal Purohit. Other members on the panel are retired IAS officer Sheela Rani Chunkath and former vice-chancellor of Madras University S P Thyagarajan. The panel invited applications from candidates with 20 years of teaching experience in universities, postgraduate colleges and research institutions and minimum 10 years of experience as a professor in the university system. The application window ended on June 30. Anna University vice-chancellor M K Surappa completed his three-year tenure on April 11 and the varsity is being run by a three-member convener committee for the last three months. Anna University professors urged the search panel and governor to select a candidate with impeccable character and high academic credentials as vicechancellor. E Balagurusamy, former vice-chancellor of Anna University, proposed eight measures to the governor to make the VC selection process more transparent. He suggested that former VCs be included in the search panel, a publicity blitz to attract maximum suitable candidates, publication of bio-data of all applicants, disqualification of candidates who try to influence, obtaining a clearance certificate from DVAC for shortlisted candidates and integrity certificate from former employers. He also suggested that the list of recommended candidates be placed in public domain for at least a week before the appointment order is issued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/interviews-for-anna-university-vc-post-on-august-9/articleshow/84937927.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: All private students with disabilities to pass Class XII||CHENNAI: All Class XII students with disabilities appearing as private candidates, including those in special schools, will be declared pass, a recent government order said. The candidates are exempted from writing the supplementary examinations set to begin on August 6. The school education department will issue instructions on how marks will be awarded, but those who prefer to write the written exam can’t opt for the ‘all pass’ scheme later. There are 313 candidates with disabilities among 39,579 private candidates in Class XII in the state. Disability rights activists lauded the government’s move. R Sathish Kumar, member of the Disability Rights Alliance, said they had written to the previous government last year in this connection. “It must be noted that most of the candidates with disabilities who appeared for Class X and XII board exams from special schools appear as private candidates as special schools are not recognized by the department of education. As we didn’t receive any response despite sending reminders, we approached the Madras high court for the required exemption but didn’t get a favorable response from there either,” he said. Deepak T, president of the December 3 movement for the differently abled, said representatives had appealed for a similar exemption for students with disabilities in Class X. “We have been at it since last year. We really hope the state takes it up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-all-private-students-with-disabilities-to-pass-class-xii/articleshow/84937944.cms||---

The second slain terrorist was identified as Sameer Dar, an “A+ category” terrorist who also was involved in the same attack. On February 14, 2019, suicide bomber Adil Dar rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF convoy, killing 40 personnel. ‘Slain Pulwama terrorist was JeM IED expert’At a joint press conference at the Army’s Srinagarbased 15 Corps headquarters on Saturday, GOC 15 Corps Lt Gen DP Pandey, IGP Vijay Kumar and GOC Victor Force termed Lamboo’s killing a major success. Lamboo had infiltrated into Kashmir in 2017 and had 14 FIRs filed against him. “In total, there are 19 accused in the 2019 Pulwama attack. Eight have been killed, including Lamboo, and six have been already arrested. The remaining five are on the run,” IGP Kumar said. The NIA had also named Lamboo and Dar in its chargesheet, the IGP said, adding that Lamboo was also involved in the killing of SPO Fayaz Ahmed, his wife and daughter in Tral recently. “JeM’s IED expert, Lamboo was a highly trained terrorist who was active in south Kashmir for the past few years. He was responsible for carrying out many attacks, recruiting young boys and brainwashing them. He would also give weapons training to the recruits,” Lt Gen Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/pulwama-attack-conspirator-aide-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-encounter/articleshow/84937937.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In the letter to the additional chief secretary (forests), and the additional chief secretary (environment), the UT’s chief conservator of forests (CCF) has said it wanted to draw their attention towards two critical issues related to eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary and the untreated water of Kansal village draining into the forest area of Chandigarh behind Sukhna Lake, requesting them to resolve them on priority. The UT has said the matter was also raised by Badnore during the third meeting of the UT Chandigarh Wetlands Authority held on June 17. The minutes of the meeting said, “The chairperson of the UT authority has directed the forest department to take up the matter with Punjab for early solution of the problem, and accordingly, the authority members unanimously agreed to take up the matter.” In the meeting, the agenda was “Untreated sewage from Kansal village being released into Chandigarh behind Sukhna Lake, contaminating the lake”. The minutes stated, “There is no treatment plant for sewage of Nayagaon and Kansal village and all of it from Kansal is entering the forest area of Chandigarh between Rock Garden and Sukhna Lake, damaging local ecology and contaminating Sukhna as well. Chandigarh has taken up the matter several times with Punjab to construct and operationalise sewage treatment plant (STP) …, but no concrete action has been taken.” The issue pertains to sewage flowing from Nayagaon and Kansal villages and Saketri and Madadev Pur villages of Haryana into the forest area. To deal with the sewage of Kansal and Nayagaon, the administration had recently chalked out a proposal to construct a new sewage treatment plant at Kishangarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stop-sewage-flow-from-kansal-into-sukhna-forest-punjab-told/articleshow/84937990.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Kochi||Authorities chalk out measures to curb spread in Kochi||KOCHI: In an effort to ensure smooth business during Onam festival season and at the same time avoid spread of Covid-19 in the city due to crowding, Kochi corporation authorities have come up with a slew of measures.  Besides intensifying Covid diagnostic tests in the market area, all the merchants, workers and headload workers in Ernakulam Market and Broadway will be vaccinated through a special drive starting Monday. The plan is to vaccinate at least 2,000 people as part of the initiative. The key decisions in this regard were taken at a meeting of people’s representatives, district administration, police and merchants convened by mayor M Anilkumar on Saturday. “Considering the rush during Onam season, we will have to be prepared for streamlining all the business activities in the city. Otherwise, the crowding will cause superspreading. There are chances of tensions between various agencies and merchants. That’s why we convened a meeting to chalk out the plan,” the mayor said. “Discussions will be held with MLAs and other agencies for ensuring similar measures in Fort Kochi and Palluruthy areas as well,” he said. Authorities will take special efforts to ensure hassle-free traffic during Onam season. One-way system will be introduced for regulating traffic on Broadway. There will be separate entry and exit points. Street vending will be strictly regulated. Parking facilities for the vehicles of stall owners and workers will be provided outside the Market and Broadway. This will help regulate the traffic through Broadway and other important business areas. To get the GCDA-owned land at Marine Drive for parking, the mayor and district collector Jaffer Malik will hold a meeting with the authorities of the development agency. Employees of the corporation will clear the garbage in the market between 7pm and 10pm during Onam season. The area in banana market can be used for parking once the garbage is cleared. The interstate trucks which transport the goods can use the facility. At the same time merchants still raise apprehensions regarding the fixing of categories by the health department. “Kochi has fallen in Category C. Maybe the TPR in certain areas in the city is high. But the authorities shouldn’t impose stringent control measures in the entire city just because some parts of Kochi reported more Covid-19 cases. They should introduce area-wise categorization. The authorities can impose regulations in the areas where the TPR is high so that the people from such areas don’t move as per their will,” said Ernakulam Merchants Union secretary Mohammed Kamran. T J Vinod, MLA, district collector, city police commissioner H Nagaraju, among otherts attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-chalk-out-measures-to-curb-spread/articleshow/84931852.cms||---

The bus — after the flagging-off ceremony by Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore — will be on a trial run from PGI to Manimajra to assess its technical and mechanical strength. It will ply on the route for 15 to 20 days without any passengers. The bus will then be available for city residents. A total of 19 more such buses will reach the city by September and run on multiple routes, as recommended by the transport department of the UT administration. The city will get a total of 40 buses. “For a few weeks, the trial bus will run without any passengers. The trial run will be mainly to check its single charging range and other practical aspects. A single charging point for the bus has already been erected in Sector 25,” a senior official said. Green Fleet It will be for the first time that non-polluting public buses will run in the city, ending years of talks and paper work and giving a boost to the plan to replace the fleet of ordinary buses of Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) with electric buses. In 2016, UT administrator V P Singh Badnore had approved the proposal of the transport department to purchase electric buses to fight air pollution. The administration had floated tenders for purchase of 40 electric buses in January 2019, but it was scrapped. Finally, a fresh tender was floated in February 2020. 20 charging stations to come upA senior official said, “Over 20 more charging stations will come up at locations like the bus stand in sectors 17 and 43, PGI and the CTU depot.” The buses will be run by drivers of a company only according to the agreement. “Since the speed limit of buses in the city has been revised and a maximum limit of 60kmph is set, the driver will have to keep all these things in mind,” sources told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-first-electric-bus-arrives-trial-run-from-next-week/articleshow/84938028.cms||Deepak Yadav

Besides Meena, Suresh Chavhanke of Sudarshan News had also said he intended to go to the fort the same day. Reacting to Chavhanke’s announcement, Independent MLA from Gangapur city, Ramkesh Meena, in a video had dared Chavhanke to come to the fort, albeit also warned him for the consequences. The MLA, however, will take out a peace march on Sunday from Gandhi Circle to Civil Lines. “The area comes under the forest department. The entry to the fort is completely restricted,” Rahul Prakash said. Jaipur police said they were also keeping a close eye on the social media websites. The dispute began when a few idols were allegedly vandalised on the fort in June, following which police had detained five minors and arrested one person. Later Hindu outfits hoisted a huge saffron flag there in July, which was later removed. The videos of the flag being removed went viral on social media, drawing sharp reactions from both sides. Three separate FIRs have been registered at the Transport Nagar police station related to the row. Police said investigation into the case was underway and they would examine all the facts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amagarh-fort-dispute-security-upped-amid-congregation-calls/articleshow/84938089.cms||---

The crime came to the fore on April 21 when the ATM began to run dry within a few days of refilling cash, they said. Nikhil Sharma, counsel for Euronet Service India — the company which has the contract for maintenance of ATMs - said the fraud was committed on April 16 at 11 a.m. in ICICI Bank ATM. He said the accused — captured in CCTV cameras installed inside the ATM - fled off with Rs 13.20 lakh. A day before the crime, the bank had replenished Rs 23 lakh into the ATM. A complaint was filed on July 30 following which a case was registered at Sector 37 police station under section 454 (house-trespass) and 380 (theft in a building) of IPC. In a similar fraud, unknown accused looted Rs 12 lakh from an ATM in Gurgaon’s sector 37 on Saturday, the police said. The ATM was refilled with cash on Friday, they said, adding that the accused cut open the machine and fled with the cash tray. There is no CCTV footage, an officer said, adding that the probe is underway. In April 2019, an unknown accused had targeted the same ATM and fled off with Rs 12 cash. At that time as well, there was no guard at the spot. However, the theft was captured on a CCTV camera. The theft was committed within 24 hours of loading cash into the ATM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/2-men-steal-rs-13-lakh-from-atm-caught-on-camera/articleshow/84936154.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Gurgaon||MCG files case against hosp for charging fee for parking||Gurgaon: A private city hospital has been booked for charging for parking facilities. The case was registered after a complaint was filed by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG). In September 2020, a person named Ramesh Yadav had filed a complaint with Sector 43 police against the hospital over what he alleged were illegal parking charges. No action was taken, following which he filed another complaint, this time on CM Window, in October the same year. The CMO took cognisance and directed the MCG to file a police complaint against the hospital. The civic body gives property tax rebates for providing free parking facilities in basements of commercial buildings. According to the complainant, Paras Hospital allegedly took advantage of this. “As per rules, the hospital should have provided free parking to people but it was charging them,” claimed Yadav. After receiving the complaint last year, MCG initiated an inquiry. It found that the hospital was making commercial use of its basement-2 and imposed a property tax of Rs 16.27 lakh. “The hospital paid the amount. Later, on the direction of the CM Window cell, we filed a complaint against it,” said a senior MCG official. Based on the complaint, a case was registered against Paras Hospital on Thursday at Sushant Lok police station under IPC Section 384 (extortion). The hospital, however, claimed that it provides free parking in the basement and valet parking for the convenience of patients. “We have a free-of-cost parking space in our basement for multiple cars. In our hospital premises, we also have a valet parking facility that is used only when the basement parking is full. The valet parking is free for the first 15 minutes and then charged at Rs 30 for four hours. We provide this assistance to our patients so that they don’t have to take the unnecessary stress of parking their car in the busy OPD hours. These parking details are mentioned near the entrance gate. We are ready to cooperate with the concerned officials for further investigation,” said a hospital spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mcg-files-case-against-hosp-for-charging-fee-for-parking/articleshow/84934277.cms||Bagish Jha

According to cops, the men entered the shop and said they wanted to buy rice. Asked to make the payment by the shopkeeper, one of the men pointed a gun at him and threatened to kill him. They fired a few rounds in the air and fled the spot with cash. The complaimant, Virender Kumar, said he was at the shop with an employee, Manish, at the time. “Three men entered the shop while another waited outside. One of them inquired about the price of rice. When I started to tell him the prices of different kinds of rice available at our shop, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at me. He threatened me and directed me not to make any noise. Another youth opened my cash drawer and took over Rs 65,000. They then fled from the spot,” Kumar said, adding that the robbers had come in a car. He could not note down the registration number of the vehicle. A case was registered under sections 379B (snatching by force) and 34 (common intention) of IPC and sections of Arms Act at Badhshahpur police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/four-men-rob-shopkeeper-of-over-rs-65000-at-gunpoint/articleshow/84936158.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Study of outdoor air purifiers shows they cut PM2.5 by 17%||GURUGRAM: A study conducted by the National Environment Engineering Research Institute has revealed that the air purifiers installed by GMDA last year brought a reduction of around 32% in PM10 and 17% in PM2.5. The impact of the air purifiers installed under the Air Care project was carried out by NEERI during the winter of 2020-2021. The difference was calculated by measuring the particulate matter at the inlet and outlet of the purifiers. There are 66 air purifiers installed at eight different locations across the city. The study required measuring the PM10 and PM2.5 values at different locations at different times, which were then averaged to get to the final figures. “The chemical characterisation study results indicate the source of PM10 and PM2.5 at eight locations are mostly exhausts of vehicles and are suspended road dust. At sites like Bakhtawar Chowk, biomass burnings were also found as the source,” said a copy of the report accessed by TOI. Encouraged by the response, NEERI, along with the India Pollution Control Association and GSK, decided to install 48 more air purifiers at other busy junctions in the city. While the project was under GMDA, it was funded by GSK. The pollution purifiers were designed by NEERI and installed by IPCA. Subhas Yadav, district forest officer said that NEERI is a government institute, and their findings should be taken seriously. However, to better understand the impact of these purifiers, GMDA has proposed the installation of low-cost air quality monitors near the purifiers. “These purifiers will give us data to better understand the impact of project Air Care,” said Yadav. However, Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said: “The study was carried out during morning hours, which doesn’t throw much light on the air quality improvement. During morning hours, the air tends to warm up slowly and the pollutants get dispersed. This is a natural phenomenon and cannot be related to efficiency of the purifiers. Gurugram is still far away from getting its air cleared up. Also, these air purifiers are installed on the medians and thus the positioning is incorrect.” Last November, the chief minister had launched the project. The WAYU (Wind Augmentation and Purification Units) air purifiers have been developed by CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and customised to address the rising levels of pollution in the millennium city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/study-of-outdoor-air-purifiers-shows-they-cut-pm2-5-by-17/articleshow/84936171.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Anandpal partner Anuradha Chaudhary held in Delhi with a fugitive||NEW DELHI/JAIPUR: A day after the arrest of gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi, Delhi Police announced on Saturday that it had arrested his woman accomplice too. While Jathedi carried a bounty of Rs 6 lakh for his capture, Ajmer Police had announced a Rs 10,000 reward for the apprehension of Anuradha Chaudhary alias Madam Minz for her alleged involvement in three cases of extortion and possession of firearms in Nagaur district of Rajasthan. Sandeep, 37, belongs to Jathedi village in Haryana’s Sonipat while Chaudhary, 37, is a native of Sikar in Rajasthan. Chaudhary was earlier an associate of the slain interstate gangster, Anandpal Singh, but on his death in an encounter in 2017, had joined the Lawrence Bishnoi-Jathedi faction, police said. The woman gangster, the cops claimed, was synonymous with terror in the business communities of Nagaur, Sikar, Didwana and other places. She is known to have fired from an AK-47 rifle as a tactic for intimidating her victims. Chaudhary is implicated in 12 criminal involvements in Rajasthan. Two cases were filed against her in Nagaur’s Kuchaman City police station in August 2020 and January this year and the third at Gotan police station, also in January. “We are sending a team to New Delhi to interrogate Chaudhary in these cases,” said S Sengathir, Ajmer range IG, on Saturday. Sikar police revealed that the woman, who claimed to have an MBA and MPhil degrees and once worked with a brokerage firm, had jumped bail last August. According to Delhi Police special commissioner Neeraj Thakur, after Chaudhary joined him, they got fake identities made as husband-wife and constantly shifted bases across different states to evade detection by police. Jathedi hadn’t fled the country as was believed earlier, but the story of his flight from India was created by his syndicate after his escape from police custody in Faridabad last year. Jathedi grew a beard, wore a turban and went around in the guise of a Sikh. Using an international number for encrypted internet chat platforms, Jathedi tried to create the impression that he was in Dubai and Bangkok. However, his cover was blown when his accomplices were arrested and interrogated. Thakur said, “A team led by DCP Manishi Chandra and inspector Vikram Dahiya first traced Jathedi to Goa and then to MP, Bihar, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand.” The pursuers finally got footage showing the gangster in Chaudhary’s company. On July 30, he was apprehended at the toll plaza in Saharanpur. A PX-3 pistol and a 0.38 bore revolver were recovered from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/anandpal-partner-anuradha-chaudhary-held-in-delhi-with-a-fugitive/articleshow/84938123.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Work on Bajghera road stuck due to rains, potholes & dust add to commuters’ woes||Gurgaon: The opening of a much-awaited flyover on Bajghera road in January last year and its widening by the public works department (PWD) in October has given little respite to commuters travelling from Gurgaon to Delhi using the stretch. This is because the four-lane road in Sector 110A abruptly ends just 500m before the Dwarka Expressway, and the unmetalled approach road linking the stretch to the expressway is riddled with potholes and dust, making commuting a nightmare. Moreover, it is inundated during the monsoon, adding to commuters’ woes. Residents said the widening of the road is meaningless as long as the approach road continues to remain in such a deplorable state. “Manoeuvring vehicles on this small stretch is tough. The situation is worse when it rains. I’ve slipped on the road several times and even fractured my leg once,” said Manoj Singh, a resident of sector 110. PWD completed the widening of Bajghera road after a delay of over four months last year. The 3.5km village road was converted into a four-lane sector road, but the 500m approach road that connects Sector 110A with the Dwarka Expressway was left unattended. It was to be developed by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which is constructing an underpass on the same stretch to connect Sector 110A with Sector 113. As part of the Dwarka Expressway, NHAI had proposed to build an underpass and black-top the stretch. Work, however, was stopped midway as it is struggling with traffic management and rainwater accumulation on the stretch. The initial deadline for the underpass was June 2021. “The work on the box structure of the underpass was underway but had to be slowed down due to the monsoon. It requires heavy excavation work and it is impossible to do that during monsoons. Once the rains are over, we’ll speed up the work and try and complete it by December this year,” a senior NHAI official told TOI. The revamp for the approach road, however, may get stuck in the absence of adequate right of way (ROW) for the commuters. Insufficient space is available on either side of the underpass to divert traffic and black-top the stretch, NHAI said. “When we had gotten the land from the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to construct the approach road, we were told that there’s enough ROW. But, we later found the ROW is inadequate and we are facing difficulties in diverting traffic,” the official said. The NHAI contractor for the project, L&T, said they have urged GMDA to look into the matter and suggest possible ways of developing the stretch without causing much traffic disruption. “The last resort would be to take one side at a time, block traffic on that side for a brief period and divert it to the other side. The issue is that there isn’t enough space on both sides to make an alternate route for traffic. We’ll wait for NHAI and GMDA to take the call,” said an L&T official. When asked, a GMDA official said NHAI had raised the issue in a couple of meetings held earlier this year and that they are “comprehensively looking into the points raised by NHAI”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/work-on-bajghera-road-stuck-due-to-rains-potholes-dust-add-to-commuters-woes/articleshow/84934478.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

While epidemiologists, virologists and public health authorities are now hopeful of seeing fewer hospital admissions and deaths, they stress there are multiple reasons why neither the state nor the people can let their guard down. First, since seroprevalence isn’t a uniform figure, even high prevalence districts aren’t completely safe yet. “Moving without masks is still not an option anywhere in the state,” said R Sunderraman, public health expert and former director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre. “We can say that Chennai is relatively safe since more than 80% of its people have the antibodies. But not all of Chennai is safe. An apartment block or the neighbourhood a person lives in or their workplace have a seropositivity of just 20%. In that case, there can be a micro epidemic there,” he said. This means, those who are not vaccinated, particularly the elderly and others with comorbid conditions, continue to face a high amount of risk. “The rule in general is to wear at least one mask and maintain social distance. For additional protection, one can use a double mask in crowded areas and closed spaces. Elderly and those with poor health conditions, who are yet to be vaccinated may need N95,” said senior virologist Dr Jacob John. Experts also suggest that in areas with lower seropositivity rate vaccinations should be high priority. “Vaccinations will not stop transmission, but there is enough evidence to show it will certainly bring down deaths,” said senior epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, who is also a part of the state task force on Covid. “So, the state must ensure everyone receives at least one dose of the vaccine,” he said. The state, he said, should use these results as evidence to unlock colleges and schools. “There could be a rogue mutant that may take us back to square one. But that is not a good enough reason for us to force children to stay at home,” Muliyil said. “We should pin our hopes on the antibodies we have developed against the disease,” he said. Even if the antibodies wane with time, the biological memory response will be able to respond quickly when a person is re-infected. And this will mitigate the severity of disease, he said. Infectious diseases experts such as Dr Subramanian Swaminathan, however, say they are not so sure. “The high seropositivity is mostly induced by natural infection and not vaccines,” he said. The seropositivity dropped between October 2020 and April this year because infection immunity did not last, he said. “We don’t know the future,” he said. Director of Public Health Dr TS Selvavinayagam agrees. “This is a new virus. We saw cases go up in April, when antibodies came down. Another rogue mutation can also make things worse,” he said. The priority should be to increase vaccinations and prevention and preparedness measures in districts with lower antibody levels, said ICMRNational Institute of Epidemiology director Dr Manoj V. Murhekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/serosurvey-a-dose-of-hope-but-tamil-nadu-cautious/articleshow/84938173.cms||Pushpa Narayan
