Spread over three acres, not only is Gujjarakere the oldest lake in Kudla, but also one of the largest with historical significance attached to it. Over the decades, this ancient lake became neglected and treated as a dumping ground for waste materials. But all of this is now a thing of the past: Gujjarakere lake has been revived and restored to its former glory, thanks to a lake revival project. A sacred lake with a 1,800-year-old historyLegend has it that the Gujjarakere lake was founded by saint Gorakshanatha. “The water from the lake was said to have medicinal properties and could cure a host of diseases, including skin infections. Spring water fed the lake and it was used for drinking by the locals,” shares Yogish Kumar Jeppu, president of the Gujjarakere Theertha Samrakshana Samithi, a local body that has been working towards conserving the lake since 2002. “Earlier, religious processions from the neighbouring temples of Mangaladevi and Marigudi would pass by this lake and the deity made to have a jhalaka (holy bath) before proceeding further. But over the last century, these religious activities stopped completely. And with industries coming up around this area, the lake water became heavily polluted. The Mangalore City Corporation too began treating it as a dumping ground,” adds Yogish. Setting the course for revival“Revival of lakes in Mangaluru was a dream project and we identified eight such lakes that were in a state of disrepair. Gujjarakere was one that we could return it to its former glory, especially given its historical importance,” says Mangaluru City South MLA, Vedavyas Kamath. “The lake had a lot of drainage seeping into it, which was an area of concern. We removed the trash, cleared out weeds and silt and put up steel railings around the lake to prevent further pollution. We have also created a jogging and walking track around it for the public. Most importantly, we want to revive the tradition of deities being brought here for the jhalaka during religious festivals,” he sums up. Mangaluru, a city of lakesOut of the eight lakes that have been identified for a facelift, four - Bajal, Kudroli, Jeppinamogaru and Gujjarakere - have been completed, and work on the rest is in progress. “Water bodies sustain a city and when they are destroyed, it is a matter of grave concern. Now, not only have they been revived, but we have a place of peace and quiet to retreat into amid the city life,” shares Neena Umesh, a resident of Bajal. - Madhu Daithota||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mangalurus-1800-year-old-gujjarakere-lake-among-eight-others-in-revival-scheme/articleshow/85592376.cms||---

With the pandemic forcing work from home as an option and most offices still remaining shut, people are choosing to step out to a cafe or pub to work and break the monotony. Bangalore Times explores the trend... Breaking the monotony "We have seen an influx of guests looking to break the monotony and work in a comfortable space where they can enjoy the service of our food and drinks at the same time. We get a lot of professionals who come for quick meetings with clients or even take video calls. With fast and steady internet connections and multiple plug points at convenient locations, it is the ideal space for guests to work out of. We also take every safety precaution and ensure all hygiene protocols are strictly maintained," says Anirudh Kheny, partner, Suzy Q by 1522 - Plate Project Hospitality. Ranveer Sabhani, business head for South India at Impresario Handmade Restaurants says, "The pandemic has irrevocably changed the way we’ve worked. Over the past year, it has become monotonous for many, and now as the world is opening up while adapting to the new normal, people are seeking new avenues of working which are flexible and cost-effective." Arun Prasanna, head of operations, Byg Brewski Brewing Company, shares, "Both our locations are big and offer multiple kinds of settings. Given the proximity to software professionals who live close by, it helps them find a change from the four walls they work out of otherwise." Sometimes, guests choose to stay longer "We saw a lot of working professionals coming in for early lunches and then staying to get some work done post lunch. We have also seen professionals stepping in at noon to work from Gawky Goose and staying back after completing their work to catch up with friends for dinner/drinks. This prompted us to get packages in place to cater to those guests and will soon be launching the same," says Rohit Barker, partner, Gawky Goose Kitchen & Bar. The same has been the case with diners at Hanoi, where diners choose to stay on post lunch. "We get people coming in post lunch who come to have a hot cup of Vietnamese coffee. We offer them free wifi and power to connect their systems and work from the outlet. Usually they prefer sitting at the balcony and carry on with their routine," says Nirav Rajani, partner at Hanoi Indiranagar. Proving the right amenities Kuncheria Marattukalam, co founder of URU Brewpark, shares, "Here, instead of having a limited menu option, we provide the entire food and drinks menu to the customer to choose from, with a percentage discount when they avail the Work From URU package, along with some complimentary beverages and free wifi. We also have a selection of specialty coffee by Mannheim Coffee and a range of shakes, sliders and sandwiches to choose from." Ranveer adds, "At Social, we offer full cover membership which means the member gets free food and drinks worth the membership package, effectively making it a zero rental workspace. It’s a workspace model that allows millennials to connect with people offline in a setting where you can work and at the very same time, order a drink and listen to good music." Fun activities for a break Amrut Mehta, director, Little Italy Group of Restaurants, says that besides proving basic infrastructure, adding some fun activities is important. "At one of our Tutto Bene Cafe we have added puzzles, board games and card games which help people unwind in between work. Providing this balance of amenities along with comfort food would be a winning combination for us and the people who choose to work from our outlets," he explains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/breaking-from-the-monotoy-of-wfh-bengalureans-work-from-cafes-and-pubs/articleshow/85588256.cms||Sunayana Suresh
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Former tenant, three associates nabbed for killing elderly couple in Kumaraswamy Layout||BENGALURU: A former tenant of two senior citizens who were found murdered at their residence in Kumaraswamy Layout last week and three of his associates were on Tuesday arrested for the killings. Narayana Swamy, 42, Sheik Asif, 46, Devangam Ramu, 38 and Gangadhar, 36, all from Hindupur in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, were arrested from their hometown by a special team of south division police. Cops recovered 193 grams of gold that the quartet had looted from the house of retired BMTC employee Shantaraju, 65, and his homemaker-wife S Premalatha, 62, after allegedly killing them on August 20. Swamy and Asif run grocery shops, while Ramu and Gangadhar are self-employed, police said. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Harish Pandey said, “The four suspects, including the prime accused, are in our custody. We cannot reveal more since the matter is under investigation.” Police sources said prime accused Swamy was a tenant of Shantaraju between 2008 and 2010 and worked as a supervisor in a garment factory near Konanakunte Cross. By 2010-end, he left Bengaluru and settled down in Hindupur. After trying his hand at different businesses, he opened a grocery shop. Asif too ran a grocery shop next to Swamy’s. Swamy is said to have landed in a financial crisis in 2019, which forced him to raise hand loans from relatives, friends and local financiers. “Swamy visited Shantaraju in early August, seeking a loan of Rs 1 lakh. However, Shantaraju and Premalatha expressed helplessness as they had spent over Rs 2.5 lakh on Shantaraju’s heart surgery. During the visit, Swamy decided to target the couple,” sources said, adding: “He roped in Asif and two others, saying they could make easy money by looting the couple. He told them police wouldn’t delve deep into the case since the couple was childless.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/former-tenant-three-associates-nabbed-for-killing-elderly-couple/articleshow/85605886.cms||---

She complained to Yelahanka New Town police that not only is he hacking her social media accounts, but also posting inappropriate photos and videos and sending them to her friends and relatives on her contact list. The man also engaged the services of a private detective agency to follow her and is ordering pizzas in her name. As a result, pizzas are regularly arriving at her doorstep, she claimed. Police have booked the suspect under IPC section 354(D) for stalking. “On August 12, a pizza delivery boy knocked on my door. I was shocked when he said an order was placed in my name. Since then, the man has been sending pizzas in my name to my residence and office. I have been stalked, defamed, insulted and harassed by the accused, who has destroyed my privacy and peace for past four years. I am living in constant fear that I might be attacked any time by him or by someone working for him,” the woman’s complaint copy read. She added: “The accused has engaged the services of a private detective agency from Koramangala to keep track of my whereabouts. To show that he is regularly following me, he sent two photos of his employees standing outside my residence. When I visited my parents who live in a different state, he sent messages to my relatives saying I had gone to my parents’ place. A person sent by him visited my father’s shop too. Somehow, he has obtained my call detail records, which has helped him access phone numbers of my friends and relatives,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-hires-detectives-sends-pizzas-to-woman-who-turned-him-down/articleshow/85605887.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Hair follicle tests confirm accused took drugs, say cops||BENGALURU/ SHIVAMOGGA: Hair follicle test results of the suspects in two-drug peddling cases with links to Sandalwood confirmed that they had consumed narcotics. Home minister Araga Jnanendra on Tuesday said the samples collected from two actresses in a drug case tested positive at Central Forensic Science Lab (CFSL), Hyderabad. Officials from the Central Crime Branch (CCB) recently received reports of around 12 accused persons and submitted the same before court. Kamal Pant, Bengaluru police commissioner, said CCB police, who investigated a case registered in September last year, had sent the hair follicle samples to CFSL and the reports came recently. These reports will help the prosecution prove the alleged offence committed by the suspects, he added. However, neither police nor the home minister revealed the names of the suspects. One of the two drug-peddling cases was registered against two actresses and several others in Cottonpet in September 2020. “For the first time in a drug-case investigation, hair samples were sent for testing as drug traces can be found in hair follicles for up to one year. Generally, only blood/urine samples are sent, but drug traces in them can be detected only if it is consumed within 24 hours,” Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime), said. According to sources, the reports pertaining to the 12 accused persons have reached city police. Cops sent samples of the suspects in connection with three cases registered in Cottonpet and Banaswadi in 2020. They received the reports pertaining to the two actresses on August 13 and of the other 10 in July. Speaking to reporters in Shivamogga, Jnanendra said the actresses were arrested and interrogated by police in the drugs case and samples were collected from them and sent to the Hyderabad lab. The samples have tested positive, he said, adding Karnataka police now has strong evidence against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hair-follicle-tests-confirm-accused-took-drugs-cops/articleshow/85605912.cms||---

The CM on Tuesday credited Rs 666.84 crore into the accounts of over 7 lakh account holders. The CM said he was happy to render justice to small depositors of Agrigold and the government had cleared all dues below Rs.20,000 to each depositor in the last two years. Jagan said that he decided to bail out depositors after listening to their woes during his padayatra while in Opposition. “Majority of the depositors duped by the private firm were daily wagers and factory workers. It is really difficult for them to tide over such a sudden shock,” said Jagan. Jagan flays TDP for abandoning depositorsPointing out that the state had fulfilled the promise made to the victims and credited Rs 905.57 crore to 10.4 lakh families in two phases, the CM said, “There is no instance in the country of any government taking up the responsibility of families betrayed by a private financial company. We have identified the depositors through our volunteers and CID staff.” He said that the government had released Rs 238.73 crore in November 2019 to 3.4 lakh account holders who had less than Rs 10,000 deposits. Another 3.86 lakh depositors, who were left out in the first phase, were given Rs 207.61 crore. He said the Agrigold scam had taken place with the involvement of TDP leaders and flayed the previous government for abandoning the depositors. He said TDP leaders made a brazen attempt to loot Agrigold properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/cm-releases-666cr-vows-to-clear-dues-of-all-agrigold-depositors/articleshow/85604409.cms||Samdani MN

This is the fourth time that the servers of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) have “frozen” in as many months. Many devotees rue that every time the monthly quota is released slow TTD servers make it difficult to book the online quota. TTD, which manages the richest Hindu temple in the world, releases the quota for darshan every month. Sources said that TTD’s websites registered 1.1 lakh concurrent hits immediately after the tickets were released on Tuesday morning and the servers couldn’t manage the rush. Websites froze with 1.1L concurrent hitsP Srikanth Reddy, a devotee from Tirupati who tried to book special entry darshan tickets for his family, told TOI that he kept waiting and refreshing the website for hours on Tuesday, but eventually could not book his tickets. “Many websites have been handling huge traffic. It is surprising that the TTD could not fix the problem even after repeated failure,” he said. Though TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Reddy reviewed the issue with the IT department and tech major TCS, which helps implement various projects under the temple’s digitisation project on a donation basis, the issue could not be resolved. TTD’s IT chief PV Sesha Reddy told TOI that after a similar incident was reported last month, the temple body scaled up its servers and roped in experts to set right the glitches. “This is not a crash. With 1.1 lakh concurrent hits, which is higher than concurrent hits last month, our websites froze for a while when the online darshan tickets quota was released”, he said. Sesha Reddy said the temple body consulted the senior management of TCS to help in testing and upgrading the websites to handle a higher number of users. TTD has plans to utilise the services of a third-party consultant for testing its IT capabilities through a comprehensive audit. Bheema Kumar Atmakuru, head of the digitisation project at TTD, clarified that though the number of servers had been scaled up to 21, the unprecedented queue of 1.1 lakh users within a specific time-frame resulted in the situation. “Various options including increasing the number of servers or migration to cloud technology are also being explored,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/glitches-in-ttd-website-holds-up-online-darshan-ticket-sale/articleshow/85604412.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Students flock to govt schools after govt infrastructure boost||AMARAVATI: Teachers in KNR Municipal Corporation High School in Nellore were surprised to see large groups of parents thronging the school to get admission for their wards when it reopened last fortnight. About 2,000 students appeared for the entrance held for admission to Class 6 for 200 seats. As the surge continued, the principal had to put up a banner declaring all seats were full for the academic year. Many government schools across the state are witnessing a similar situation. Academicians and teachers opined that this transformation was due to the focus laid by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. About 15,000 schools in the state were renovated under ‘Nadu-Nedu’ programme by spending close to Rs 4,000 crore. The infrastructure available at the government schools has impressed parents and wards. Govt eyes revamp of 45k public schools in 2 yearsThe government has also spent close to Rs 24,000 crore on different education schemes in the last two years and plans to complete renovation of all 45,000 public schools in next two years. “It is a like a dream come true for children. I had not imagined this kind of upgradation in such a short duration,” said teacher Bollepalli Sridhar. The schools now have wash rooms with running water, RO units for drinking water, green chalk boards, colourful study desks, tube lights and fans, granite flooring and compound wall. The kits provided under ‘Jagananna Vidya Kanuka’ comprising three pairs of uniform cloth, shoes, school bag, textbooks, workbooks and notebooks have become a big attraction. Oxford Dictionary was added to the kit from the current academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/students-flock-to-govt-schools-after-govt-infrastructure-boost/articleshow/85604407.cms||Samdani MN

The bustling area is full of people sporting the traditional salwar kameez, speaking Pashto, and on weekends, it is crowded with those visiting from across NCR to get a taste of Afghan food. Among those who frequent this spot are Afghan students, who drop by on weekends from Greater Noida and north Delhi. However, over the past few days, as distressing visuals from Afghanistan are emerging after the Taliban takeover, food isn’t the only thing on everyone’s mind here. “Our business has been down for long due to COVID, and it is still the same. These days, most of our orders come from Afghan Colony or Lajpat Nagar residents and there are hardly any discussions related to food. Everyone wants to know if our families are safe,” says a vendor, who was baking flatbreads, when we recently visited the colony. In times likes these, Little Kabul is serving as a reminder of home for Delhi’s Afghans. ‘Afghans come to our stall to remember the taste of home’Vendors say that Afghans visit the colony to relive their “food memories”. A worker at a restaurant in the colony, said, “Locals may not be able to tell the difference between authentic Afghan food and its local versions, but it’s that very difference that brings Afghans here. People come here to chat and relive their food memories. They can feel that connection here.” Some of the most popular dishes here are Kabuli pulao and a wide variety of kebabs. Another vendor added, “These food items mean a lot to Afghans. They keep coming to our stalls to remember the taste of home. Some even bring their kids to introduce them to Afghan food.” ‘Afghan Colony offers the authentic Afghan food’Restaurateurs and vendors of the area say that customers often tell them that Afghan food served at several restaurants in Delhi isn’t really as authentic what you get here, besides being a lot less spicy. “There are only a handful of places where you can get authentic Afghan food in Delhi, and the Afghan Colony is one of them. That’s what attracts people to this place,” a resident of the area, who was waiting for his order at a burger stall, told us.

---||India||India at UNSC: Afghanistan shouldn't be used by Pakistan-based terrorists||NEW DELHI: While expressing concern over the "grave humanitarian crisis" unfolding in Afghanistan, India Tuesday yet again voiced its apprehension about the security situation as it said Afghan territory should not be used by Pakistan-based terror groups to target any country in the neighbourhood. Speaking at a UNHRC session on human rights concerns in Afghanistan, the government said stability in the country is linked to peace and security of the region and that India, with its millennia old friendship with Afghanistan, stood ready to assist its Afghan friends in fulfilling their aspirations. India also called for unhindered access to those in need of assistance in Afghanistan. "We hope the situation in Afghanistan does not pose a challenge to its neighbours and its territory is not used by terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) , to threaten any other country," said the government in a statement. Without naming the Taliban, or mentioning any specific atrocity committed by the group, India also said everyone was concerned about the increasing violations of fundamental rights of Afghan citizens who were worried about whether their right to live with dignity would be respected. "We are closely monitoring the rapidly evolving security situation in Afghanistan and we continue to call upon parties concerned to maintain law and order, ensure the safety and security of all Afghan nationals, UN personnel and diplomatic staff members, and observe human rights and international humanitarian law in all circumstances in Afghanistan," said the government, adding that while the security situation remained precarious, a grave humanitarian crisis was unfolding. India said thousands of people who had been internally displaced were facing acute shortage of food, medical care and shelter and the basic rights of civilians, children and women, including freedom of speech and opinion, access to education and medical care had been "drastically" hampered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-at-unsc-afghanistan-shouldnt-be-used-by-pakistan-based-terrorists/articleshow/85608528.cms||---

India and Russia agreed to set up a "bilateral channel" for consultations with Modi tweeting: "Had a detailed and useful exchange of views with my friend President Putin on recent developments in Afghanistan. We also discussed issues on the bilateral agenda, including India-Russia cooperation against Covid-19. We agreed to continue close consultations on important issues". The Modi-Putin conversation comes on a day when G-7 leaders met virtually to discuss the Afghan situation. A readout from the Russian embassy here said, "During the exchange of views on the situation in Afghanistan, the sides noted the importance of coordinated efforts which would contribute to the establishment of peace and stability in this country, ensuring security in the region as a whole." India and Russia agreed to continue consultations, but both countries are coming to the Afghan question from different positions. Russia has courted the Taliban openly for the past few years. How that will play out in the coming months remains to be seen. India has refrained from engaging the Taliban in any meaningful way, but with a huge developmental presence in that country, the question is whether any engagement is possible. The conversation coincided with the first NSAs meeting of Brics nations after the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. NSA Ajit Doval would have got a good idea of how Russia and China are working together on Afghanistan. A readout of the meeting by MEA said a plan was adopted to further strengthen existing mechanisms of cooperation in areas such as financing and combating terrorism, misuse of the internet by terrorists, curbing the travel of terrorists, border controls, protection of soft targets, information sharing, capacity building and regional and international cooperation. There was a lot of attention to "heightened risk of growth of illegal drug production and trafficking in the region." This was also part of the discussion between Modi and Putin that sought to "enhance cooperation on countering dissemination of terrorist ideology and the drug threat emanating from the territory of Afghanistan." The Kremlin statement said Modi "expressed gratitude to Vladimir Putin for assistance in combating the spread of the Covid-19 infection, including supply and production of the Russian vaccine in India, as well as shipment of the necessary medicines and medical equipment."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/modi-putin-discuss-coordinating-steps-to-ensure-regional-security/articleshow/85609190.cms||---

Around 70 to 80 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Gurdwara Karte Parwan did not want to migrate to India as they are keen on moving to Canada or the US, Indian World Forum president Puneet Singh Chandhok told on Tuesday. These Afghan nationals were not only creating obstacles in the evacuation process but also delaying the evacuation of others, he said.

A virtual programme has been organised during which the CM will also interact with some beneficiaries of the scheme. “Under Ujjwala 2.0, migrant workers can avail of a free cooking gas connection just with a self-declaration. They are not required to submit documents like address proof. The scheme aims to provide deposit-free LPG connections to low-income families who were not covered under the first phase of PMUY,” said a government spokesperson. Ujjwala Scheme 2.0 was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 10 when he handed over LPG connections to beneficiaries in Mahoba. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana was launched by the PM on May 1, 2016, from Ballia in Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-to-give-20-lakh-free-lpg-connections-today/articleshow/85609509.cms||---

Waverly police chief Grant Gillespie said at a news conference Tuesday that the issue was that some people who were in the emergency room and died of natural causes were added to the count. Gillespie said John and Jane Doe victims twice were not crossed off the list once they were identified. "The authorities slowed down the process and had detectives follow up on each case and confirm the numbers. The totals now line up with what the state has tallied," he said. ``Just an honest mistake, and I hope everybody understands that,'' Gillespie added. ``It's still a tremendous loss of life. I hope that number doesn't grow.'' Three people are still on the list of those missing who witnesses said they saw in the water, he said. Town of Waverly saw the most death and destruction from Saturday's flooding. Humphreys County chief deputy Rob Edwards said search teams started from Waverly and moved slowly downstream. Fewer than 10 people remained unaccounted for Tuesday. It's difficult to know how far the bodies might have been carried, but one car was found about a half-mile from where it had been parked. Sheriff's deputies and police were aided by crews from agencies all over the state, he said. The teams have cadaver dogs at the ready if they suspect a body might be nearby. With the heat in the mid-80 degrees F and rising, it was not difficult to detect the odor of decay, Edwards said, although crews also were finding animals. The flooding took out roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines, leaving people uncertain about whether family and friends survived the unprecedented deluge, with rainfall that more than tripled forecasts and shattered the state's one-day record. It also left large swaths of the community suddenly displaced, leaving many to sort through difficult decisions about what comes next. GoFundMe pages sought help for funeral expenses for the dead, including seven-month-old twins swept from their father's arms as they tried to escape. Matthew Rigney and Danielle Hall described to WTVF-TV how the water began to rage through their apartment where they sheltered with their four children. ``I had the twins in my arms, I had (19-month-old) Brayla on my hip and I had (five-year-old) Maleah wrapped around my neck,'' Rigney told the news station, his voice trembling behind tears. ``The water, when it hit us, it just pulled us under, all of us and we were trapped underneath a bed.'' Hall said she was trying to climb out the window to go to a nearby store for help and ended up having to grab onto a tree for her life. The other two children survived. A neighbor helped Rigney and the two children up to the roof. Hall was ultimately rescued from the tree by boat. Meanwhile, the state received approval from President Joe Biden for a major disaster declaration, which frees up federal aid to help with recovery efforts in Humphreys County, the White House said in a statement Tuesday. After touring the area on Sunday, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee called it a ``devastating picture of loss and heartache".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/just-an-honest-mistake-authorities-revise-tennessee-flooding-death-toll-to-18-from-22/articleshow/85609219.cms||---

"Their religion and lives were under constant threat... As there is no scope for them to return to their country, they and their children will have to face many challenges in India until citizenship is granted to them. They are desperately looking up to the Indian government as a beacon of hope," he said in a letter to Shah. Sirsa thanked the Centre for evacuating members of the Sikh and Hindu communities from war-torn Afghanistan and said his gurdwara committee was making "necessary arrangements to rehabilitate these Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in India".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tweak-caa-for-those-from-afghanistan-says-sikh-body/articleshow/85609616.cms||---
---||India||Custody battle may need Interpol help||NEW DELHI: The Interpol may need to be involved and diplomatic channels invoked in the battle for custody of an 11-year old as the father, a holder of dual citizenship of the UK and Kenya, has refused to subject himself to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court after flying away with the kid to the African nation. The man, who got a favourable order from the SC after misleading the court, is now avoiding any communication with the Indian embassy. "We do not have a treaty with Kenya to enforce the order of the court and cannot serve him notice as he is a Kenyan citizen," solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the SC, which in its last hearing had asked the government to get in touch with the man. Faced with the peculiar situation, a bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi said that it would consider exploring other options. The bench said that the man was in clear contempt of court as he had himself invoked the jurisdiction of Indian courts for getting custody. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Kenya-based businessman's wife, informed the bench that the Centre could use diplomatic channels with the UK to put pressure on him as there is a treaty between India and the UK. He said that it was a case of international kidnapping and the CBI should be directed to register a case so that a red corner notice could be issued by Interpol. The couple had married in 2007 and the child was born in 2009. Since 2012, they have been living separately. The mother is an Indian citizen. The bench said that it would examine the options suggested by the lawyer but the first step was to recall the order by which the man was allowed custody of the child. It said that the verdict was passed by a three-judge bench and hence a three-judge bench will need to be constituted for the purpose. It directed that case be listed before a larger bench on August 27. In October, the SC had granted custody to the father but to safeguard the interests of the mother, it had directed him "to obtain a mirror order from the concerned court in Nairobi, which would reflect the directions contained in this judgment". It also asked him to deposit Rs 1 crore in the SC registry for a period of two years to ensure compliance with its directions. He got custody after he complied with the order and produced relevant documents from the Kenyan court but it was later found that Kenyan courts do not recognise orders of Indian courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/custody-battle-may-need-interpol-help/articleshow/85609753.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

State-run primary schools were abuzz with activities as students and teachers celebrated the reopening of junior classes. Though the basic education department couldn’t track the attendance due to a cable fault in the Integrated Voice Response System (IVRS), officials said nearly 50% students attended physical classes on Tuesday. Schools had arranged thermal scanning and sanitization at the entrance. Masks were distributed and social distancing was maintained. “It is a delight to see smiling children and equally excited teachers in schools. We are hopeful that we will soon be back on track,” said additional director, basic education, Lalita Pradeep. “We welcomed children by applying tilak on their forehead, and showered flower petals on them. We distributed stationery and sweets. Students were happy to be back to school,” said Shashi Verma, the head mistress of a composite school at Itayara in Meerut. “We showered flower petals on children. They were duly scanned and sanitized before being allowed into the classrooms,” said Akhilesh Chandra Mishra, head teacher of a composite school at Shahganj in Jaunpur. At English Medium Junior School (Koilara) in Bhadohi, a senior teacher said, “Though we met kids during mohalla classes but seeing them back on the school campus is a different feeling.” The first day at a junior school in Derapur block of Kanpur Dehat began with a yoga session. “Karein yog, rahein nirog (Stay fit with yoga) is our theme. We organised a yoga session for students and the response was overwhelming,” said head teacher Shanendra Singh Tomar. At the upper primary school in Sarsawa block in Saharanpur, teachers made a flower pot made of used ghee containers and put artificial flowers in them. These flower pots were used as a selfie point for students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/back-to-school-students-greeted-with-flower-petals-chocolates/articleshow/85609546.cms||---

---||World||After Cuomo, New York gets first female governor Kathy Hochul||ALBANY: Kathy Hochul became the first female governor of New York on Tuesday and in her first hours on the job sought to bring a new sense of urgency to tackling immense problems that went unaddressed during Andrew Cuomo's distracted final months in office. In an afternoon address, she said she was immediately making masks mandatory for anyone entering schools and would work to implement a requirement that all school staff either be vaccinated or undergo weekly Covid-19 testing. She said the state would launch a back-to-school testing programme to make testing for students and staff more convenient. ``None of us want a rerun of last year's horrors with the Covid-19,'' Hochul said. ``Therefore we will take proactive steps to prevent that from happening.'' Hochul also pledged quick action to unstick an application bottleneck that has kept federal aid money from flowing to renters who suffered financially because of the pandemic. She promised to get the state ready to distribute vaccine booster shots, when they become widely available, including reopening mass inoculation sites that had previously closed. And she also said New Yorkers ``can expect new vaccine requirements", though she didn't specify what those might be. Hochul, a Democrat and former member of the Congress from western New York, took the oath of office just after midnight in a brief, private event overseen by the state's chief judge, Janet DiFiore. At a ceremonial swearing-in later Tuesday morning at the State Capitol, Hochul promised a ``fresh, collaborative approach'' in state government. She said she had already begun speaking with other Democratic leaders who have, for years, complained about being shut out of key decisions and of being bullied by Cuomo, including New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. ``There'll be no blindsiding; there'll just be full cooperation,'' Hochul said. Over the next few months, Hochul, who was little known as lieutenant governor, will have an opportunity to reshape Albany, where Cuomo dominated decision-making for years before being felled in a sexual harassment scandal. For generations, it's been said that all of the real decisions in the state government were made by ``three men in a room``-- the governor and the leaders of the state Senate and Assembly. Now, for the first time, two of those three -- Hochul and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins -- are women. Only the state Assembly is led by a man, Speaker Carl Heastie. Hochul promised more transparency and ethical conduct in government going forward. She ordered an overhaul of state government policies on sexual harassment and ethics, including requiring that all training be done live, ``instead of allowing people to click their way through a class". And she said she would order ethics training for every state government employee, ``which, shockingly", she said, "is not required across the board". Cuomo left office at midnight, two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face an impeachment battle that appeared inevitable after a report by independent investigators -- overseen by state attorney general Letitia James -- concluded he had sexually harassed 11 women. On his final day in office, Cuomo released a recorded farewell address, in which he again said he was innocent and portrayed himself as the victim of a ``media frenzy". Hochul takes over a state still dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, and struggling to get aid out the door. Little of the $2 billion set aside by the federal government to help New Yorkers pay off rent debt has been distributed. Thousands face the possibility of eviction after state and federal protections expire. Hochul also pledged quick action to distribute money from a new $2 billion state fund intended to benefit unauthorised immigrants who didn't qualify for other types of federal pandemic relief aid. "The money's there,`` Hochul said. ``These people are not eligible for other forms of assistance, and they're hurting and they're part of the New York family.'' Former governor David Paterson, who, like Hochul, unexpectedly became governor when his predecessor resigned, said she will need to restore faith. "There's going to be some pressure on Gov. Hochul, as there was on me, to kind of restore the values and to restore the conduct and the decorum that bespeaks a governor," Paterson said. She'll also have to work quickly. Hochul has already said she intends to run for a full term next year and will have just months to establish herself as the favorite before a spring Democratic primary. In the meantime, she'll be building an administration -- a task that began in the first minutes of Tuesday with the oath of office, hours ahead of the restaging of the event for television cameras in mid-morning. DiFiore administered the oath in the Capitol in front of a stone fireplace, atop which were placed family pictures. Hochul, her husband and DiFiore entered the room wearing masks, taking them off when the ceremony began. Hochul placed her hand on a Bible held by her husband, Bill, a former federal prosecutor and current general counsel for Buffalo-based food service and hospitality company Delaware North. Hochul signed a pile of papers, including the oath, using a set of 10 pens dated "August 24, 2021", while her family stood behind her, looking on. In a restaging of the swearing-in ceremony at 10 am Tuesday, Hochul thanked her ``big Irish Catholic'' family. Her immediate family sat in the front row, wearing masks and spaced slightly apart. Hochul, her daughter and daughter-in law wore white to honor suffragists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/after-cuomo-new-york-gets-first-female-governor-kathy-hochul/articleshow/85609824.cms||---

The massive surge pushed the national count of fresh cases past the 37,000 mark again after 11 days. India recorded 37,642 new cases on Tuesday, the highest single-day count since August 13. Nearly 65% of the fresh infections came from Kerala. The state's tally nearly equalled India's Covid count on the previous day, when 24,733 cases were detected. The spike in Kerala comes after days of relatively low testing and detections due to Onam. The state reported fewer than 17,000 new daily cases over the past three days, although the numbers prior to that were above 20,000. The accumulated backlog was reflected in Tuesday's test positivity rate which jumped to 18.04%, the highest in recent weeks. Tuesday's count of 24,296 was the highest single-day tally of cases in the state since it recorded 28,798 on May 26. Kerala also registered the highest toll on Tuesday with 173 deaths. India's death count rose to 480, the highest in five days, with Maharashtra recording 119. The state also added 169 previous fatalities to its total toll. As in the past few days, Odisha reported the third highest deaths at 67, followed by Karnataka (29), TN (27), Andhra (15), Assam (13) and Bengal (12). After the festive weekend of Rakhi, Covid numbers also nudged upwards in several other states. Maharashtra logged 4,355 new cases, up from 3,643 on Monday, while Karnataka posted 1,259 (1,151 on Monday), Andhra 1,248 (1,002), Bengal 613 (510) and Himachal 281 (233). Mizoram recorded a big spike in cases, with 845 fresh infections recorded in the state, the highest in 13 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-onam-kerala-sees-3-month-high-of-24k-cases/articleshow/85610340.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Currently, travellers from Kerala must produce a negative test report that is not older than 72 hours to enter Karnataka. However, officials say random rapid antigen tests (RAT) conducted on people entering the state from Kerala showed many were infected, despite possessing negative reports. Daily new infections in Kerala are hovering around 13,000 and the test positivity rate (TPR) has been stagnant at a staggering 16% for some time now. Wary that infections could spillover and trigger a new wave, the Karnataka government is planning to appeal to both the Centre and the Kerala government to conduct genomic sequencing to find out if a mutated variant of the coronavirus is driving the surge in Kerala. “The prevailing Covid situation in Kerala is a big concern,” said Dr MK Sudarshan, chairman, Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee. “We need to find out why the number of new cases and TPR are not reducing at a time when the situation is well under control in all the other states in the country. We should not forget that both the first and second waves began in Kerala and spread across the country.” A senior health department official suggested some reasons for travellers testing positive are “because they are showing fake reports, or the tests were wrongly conducted”. “A study of individual cases is underway,” the official said. “However, we cannot take chances at a time when the Covid wave is considerably receding in Karnataka. Stricter screening is necessary at the border. The proposed institutional quarantine will be an effective solution.” While three residents of Kerala’s Wayanad district allegedly furnished fake negative Covid test reports in Mysuru on Tuesday, Kodagu district health officer Dr K Mohan said the district administration recently sent back two from Kerala after they tested positive on RAT. Dr Sudrshan backed the idea of a week’s institutional quarantine and said an RT-PCR test should be conducted at the end of the isolation period. Besides, people should self-report for another week. He said the TAC will deliberate on the issue at its next meeting later this week before making recommendations to the government. The pandemic situation in Karnataka is well under control with the TPR falling below 1%. And while Kerala is showing signs of improvement, with the number of daily cases falling from 22,064 on July 29 to 13,383 on August 23, officials in Karnataka are wary, especially given the spate of positive RAT tests at the border. “A study is required, and we hope the Kerala government will cooperate,” said Dr Sudarshan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kerala-cases-surge-ktaka-mulls-7-day-quarantine-on-entry/articleshow/85610347.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Mumbai||Union minister Narayan Rane gets bail at midnight, will move high court to quash case||MUMBAI: Union Cabinet minister Narayan Rane, 69, arrested on Tuesday after a Ratnagiri court refused him transit pre-arrest bail in FIRs over his 'slap' remark against CM Uddhav Thackeray, was granted bail by a Mahad magistrate minutes before midnight. The procedure in filing the case diary was not as mandated and custodial interrogation of Rane was not needed, said the judicial magistrate first class in his order. The court granted Rane cash bail of Rs 15,000, and imposed a condition to appear in the Mahad City police station on August 30 and September 13. The police were asked to issue him a seven-day notice for seeking his voice sample. Minutes after midnight, Rane walked out of the court. He was present throughout the remand and bail hearing, which began at 9.30 pm. The court had rejected a seven-day police custody plea and remanded Rane to magisterial or judicial custody after which it heard his bail plea and granted him bail. Meanwhile, the Nashik Police has sent notice to Rane in connection with the FIR lodged against him for his comments on the CM. As per the information shared by the police, Rane has been asked to appear at the police station on September 2. Rane, recently inducted in the Union cabinet as minister of micro, small and medium enterprises, was produced before the Mahad local court in Raigad district around 8pm and there was a 45-minute hearing, where district government pleader Bhushan Salvi sought seven days' police custody arguing that the remarks made by the minister were aimed at lowering the reputation of the CM and more investigation was needed. Senior counsel Rajendra Shirodkar, who appeared for Rane in Mahad, argued against custody, saying no custodial interrogation was required. He also said the case and Rane's arrest were politically motivated. Even if his remarks are taken as alleged, there was no case made out of promoting disharmony or ill-will to attract the FIR. He said the arrest was unlawful as no notice was issued to him by the police first to seek his explanation, though mandated by the law for offences which, like the ones invoked against him, attract less than seven years' imprisonment. Section 41A of CrPC requires a notice to be issued to a person for his or her appearance at the police station to give an explanation before an arrest. A person can be arrested only after citing reason.

He told that while Union ministers and members of Parliament enjoy immunity from arrest in the case of civil matters and cannot be arrested 40 days before,Lawyer Aniket Nikam had tried to file a plea for an urgent hearing in Bombay high court on Tuesday just before Rane's arrest, but could not due to technical reasons. So, there was no hearing on Tuesday. "On Wednesday, we will approach the HC for an urgent hearing with a quashing petition," advocate Shirodkar told TOI. Before the HC, he will be challenging the validity of the arrest and proceedings against him.

Sena MP Vinayak Raut wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Rane's removal from the Union Cabinet. NCP, which is part of the MVA government, also objected to Rane's statement. "An insult to the chief minister is an insult to the people of Maharashtra," said NCP minister Jayant Patil. Before his arrest, a defiant Rane said, "I said if I was there, I would have slapped the chief minister. I did not say I will slap him. So this is not an offence. When the chief minister said a BJP MLC Prasad Lad's face should be broken, why was no action taken against him?" The bad blood between Rane and the Shiv Sena goes back a long way. The Union minister had begun his political career with the Sena and rose to become chief minister in 1999. He had exited the party in 2005, after challenging Uddhav Thackeray's leadership. The Sena had reacted immediately to Rane's statement against Thackeray, with a party worker lodging a complaint against him in Raigad's Mahad taluka on Monday. On Monday night, Rane moved to the adjoining Ratnagiri district. By Tuesday morning, over 500 Yuva Sena workers gathered outside Rane's house in Mumbai's Juhu, ostensibly in response to a tweet from his son Nitesh, "daring" them to do so. The demonstration snowballed into violence as Sainiks clashed with BJP supporters resulting in police lathicharge. The two groups pelted stones at each other. The Sainiks broke police barricades leading to Rane's residence.

---||Pune||Union minister Narayan Rane gets bail at midnight, will move high court to quash case||MUMBAI: Union Cabinet minister Narayan Rane, 69, arrested on Tuesday after a Ratnagiri court refused him transit pre-arrest bail in FIRs over his 'slap' remark against CM Uddhav Thackeray, was granted bail by a Mahad magistrate minutes before midnight. The procedure in filing the case diary was not as mandated and custodial interrogation of Rane was not needed, said the judicial magistrate first class in his order. The court granted Rane cash bail of Rs 15,000, and imposed a condition to appear in the Mahad City police station on August 30 and September 13. The police were asked to issue him a seven-day notice for seeking his voice sample. Minutes after midnight, Rane walked out of the court. He was present throughout the remand and bail hearing, which began at 9.30 pm. The court had rejected a seven-day police custody plea and remanded Rane to magisterial or judicial custody after which it heard his bail plea and granted him bail. Meanwhile, the Nashik Police has sent notice to Rane in connection with the FIR lodged against him for his comments on the CM. As per the information shared by the police, Rane has been asked to appear at the police station on September 2. Rane, recently inducted in the Union cabinet as minister of micro, small and medium enterprises, was produced before the Mahad local court in Raigad district around 8pm and there was a 45-minute hearing, where district government pleader Bhushan Salvi sought seven days' police custody arguing that the remarks made by the minister were aimed at lowering the reputation of the CM and more investigation was needed. Senior counsel Rajendra Shirodkar, who appeared for Rane in Mahad, argued against custody, saying no custodial interrogation was required. He also said the case and Rane's arrest were politically motivated. Even if his remarks are taken as alleged, there was no case made out of promoting disharmony or ill-will to attract the FIR. He said the arrest was unlawful as no notice was issued to him by the police first to seek his explanation, though mandated by the law for offences which, like the ones invoked against him, attract less than seven years' imprisonment. Section 41A of CrPC requires a notice to be issued to a person for his or her appearance at the police station to give an explanation before an arrest. A person can be arrested only after citing reason.

He told that while Union ministers and members of Parliament enjoy immunity from arrest in the case of civil matters and cannot be arrested 40 days before,Lawyer Aniket Nikam had tried to file a plea for an urgent hearing in Bombay high court on Tuesday just before Rane's arrest, but could not due to technical reasons. So, there was no hearing on Tuesday. "On Wednesday, we will approach the HC for an urgent hearing with a quashing petition," advocate Shirodkar told TOI. Before the HC, he will be challenging the validity of the arrest and proceedings against him. Read AlsoMaharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM took final call on Narayan Rane arrestAfter the Mahad police registered a criminal case against Union minister Narayan Rane for offensive speeches against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, leaders of the MVA government were in two minds about whether to arrest him. They were aware that in most cases registered under section 153 of theThe FIRs against Rane were registered in Mahad, Nashik Cyber police station and Pune, and also in Thane on Tuesday. The police have filed four FIRs against the Union minister for his controversial statement under IPC sections concerned with causing disharmony or enmity and breach of peace. ‘Felt like hitting Yogi with footwear’: BJP brings up 2018 videoBJP hit back, with national president J P Nadda calling Rane's arrest "a violation of constitutional values" and a reaction to the support his party was gathering during the yatra. BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said, "BJP does not support Rane's statement against the chief minister. But we do not support the government's actions. The government is misusing police to take revenge. We are strongly behind him." BJP also recalled the frequent use of violent language by the Shiv Sena's functionaries against its rivals, especially a video of an Uddhav Thackeray speech in 2018 saying he "felt like hitting Yogi Adityanath with his own footwear" for allegedly disrespecting Chhatrapati Shivaji. 1/10Photos: Sena, BJP workers clash in Mumbai Previous NextShow Captions<p>Shiv Sena and BJP activists clashed outside union minister Narayan Rane's residence in Mumbai on Tuesday in the wake of his comments against Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.

TOI photo: KK Choudhary</p>Sena MP Sanjay Raut defended Rane's arrest, saying, "When someone threatens to hit the chief minister, won't there be action from police and courts?" Sena MP Vinayak Raut wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Rane's removal from the Union Cabinet. NCP, which is part of the MVA government, also objected to Rane's statement. "An insult to the chief minister is an insult to the people of Maharashtra," said NCP minister Jayant Patil. Before his arrest, a defiant Rane said, "I said if I was there, I would have slapped the chief minister. I did not say I will slap him. So this is not an offence. When the chief minister said a BJP MLC Prasad Lad's face should be broken, why was no action taken against him?" The bad blood between Rane and the Shiv Sena goes back a long way. The Union minister had begun his political career with the Sena and rose to become chief minister in 1999. He had exited the party in 2005, after challenging Uddhav Thackeray's leadership. The Sena had reacted immediately to Rane's statement against Thackeray, with a party worker lodging a complaint against him in Raigad's Mahad taluka on Monday. On Monday night, Rane moved to the adjoining Ratnagiri district. By Tuesday morning, over 500 Yuva Sena workers gathered outside Rane's house in Mumbai's Juhu, ostensibly in response to a tweet from his son Nitesh, "daring" them to do so. The demonstration snowballed into violence as Sainiks clashed with BJP supporters resulting in police lathicharge. The two groups pelted stones at each other. The Sainiks broke police barricades leading to Rane's residence. Ten policemen and two Sena workers were injured. 1/10Narayan Rane sparks a row Previous NextShow Captions<p>TOI Photo: Sanjay Hadkar</p><p>Narayan Rane's 'slap Uddhav Thackeray remark' creates uproar in Maharashtra.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Anand Singh takes charge as tourism & ecology minister after 18 days||BENGALURU: More than a fortnight after he was allocated the portfolios of tourism and environment & ecology, Anand Singh finally assumed charge as a minister on Tuesday. He has been upset over not being given a more high-profile role in the government, and it has taken assurances from chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel to pacify him. They told him they would look into his request for a portfolio change. Singh met Kateel at the party office. Bommai had an hour-long chat with Singh, asking him to take up the assigned responsibilities and be patient, according to BJP insiders. Bommai reportedly said he would discuss the issue with the party leadership when he visits Delhi this week. Singh also met former chief minister BS Yediyurappa. “I have brought my issues to the notice of the chief minister, state party president and Yediyurappa. They have assured me that my appeals would be considered and a solution would be found. I have decided to take charge,” Singh said. On his choice of portfolios, he told reporters: “I have spoken to people concerned as to what my appeal is. I can’t discuss these issues with you.” Bommai handed out portfolios on August 7. Singh, who was apparently expecting to be appointed as the energy or PWD minister, registered his displeasure by not using the official vehicle and shutting his MLA office in Hospet on August 11. He hinted at resigning before Bommai and revenue minister R Ashoka reached out to him. A four-time MLA, Singh was among the 17 legislators who had quit the Congress-JD(S) coalition and joined BJP in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/18-days-later-statemin-takes-charge/articleshow/85610745.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Steady dip: Daily Covid deaths in Karnataka lowest since March||BENGALURU: The number of people dying of Covid-19 in Karnataka and Bengaluru has been consistently declining for the past several weeks, and average daily deaths in the first 23 days of this month is the lowest in more than 19 weeks. As of August 23, Karnataka had 37,155 deaths, including 630 this month. Comparatively, there were 1,485 deaths in July, 5,950 in June and 13,567 in May. And, going by the average daily deaths in August — 27 — Karnataka is expected to end the month with not more than 850 fatalities, adding between 200 and 220 in the last eight days. “But in the past few days, deaths have further reduced, so we may even have fewer deaths in the coming week,” one official said. However, the government, which is anticipating a third wave of the pandemic, is continuing to remain cautious — especially in districts bordering Kerala and Maharashtra. The local administration in Bengaluru too — the district has also seen a record reduction in deaths — continues to remain vigilant given that a host of festival days are just around the corner. Bengaluru, which reported zero deaths for the first time since March 13 on Monday, has seen only 87 deaths between August 1 and 23, at a rate of around four/day. This is half of the average of daily deaths seen in July, and nearly 95% less than the numbers seen in June. As of August 23, Bengaluru had 15,959 deaths, the second highest for a district after Pune where more than 18,800 people have died due to Covid-19. Low share:Further, Bengaluru’s share of Karnataka’s Covid-19 deaths in August — only 13% — is the lowest since the pandemic broke in March 2020. With 246 of the 1,485 fatalities, it is just 16% of the deaths in July. Bengaluru’s share has been less than 20% only once before July — in May last year when total deaths were only 27. Between June and December 2020, the city’s share was 40% or more in five months, 31% and 28% in the other two. The highest (57%) was in December. Analysis of 2021 data shows that Bengaluru accounted for 69% of all deaths in January and 77% in February, before reducing to 59% in the next two months, 51% in May and 38% in June. As reported by TOI earlier, hospitalisation in Bengaluru has reduced significantly in the past two months, but experts advise caution saying the local administration and government should not repeat the mistake of being complacent as they did in the months that preceded the second wave. 25% more vaccination doses:Karnataka will receive an additional 15 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines from September, Union health and family welfare minister Mansukh Mandaviya assured vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday. Until now, the Centre has supplied between 60 and 65 lakh vaccine doses a month to Karnataka as opposed to its demand for 1.5 crore per month and it has now promised to increase the allotment by 25%. “During my stay here, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai met me and urged me to intervene and secure additional vaccine doses for the state,” Naidu told reporters at the end of his week-long trip to the state. “I asked Mandviya to increase the allocation.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Only 15% rural kids engaged in learning during class hours, says study||BENGALURU: Homebound due to Covid-19, only 15% of government schoolchildren in rural areas are engaged in some form of learning during school hours, while others are busy with mobile phones or watching television, a survey has found. Grassroot Research and Advocacy Movement (GRAAM), a Mysuru-based public policy research and advocacy initiative, conducted the survey among 400 children in rural areas of Mysuru district a month ago to gauge the impact of the pandemic. The children are students of Classes 5 to 10. The objective was to find out how children are spending their time at home since schools have been shut for more than a year due to the pandemic. According to the survey, only 15% of the children achieve some form of learning during school hours, including through TV, online classes or reading. It reaches a maximum of 23.8% between 6pm and 9 pm. While 29% of children watch TV or use mobile for entertainment during school hours, this figure touches 42% in the evening. The other major activity is playing indoors or outdoor: 27% of students play during school hours. The survey results come at a time when there is demand from educationists to reopen schools for lower classes. Chief minister Basavarj Bommai announced on Monday that a decision will be taken on reopening of Classes 1-8 by the month-end. The percentage of time higher primary (5-7) students dedicate to learning is significantly lower than in high schools. During school time, only 10% of boys and 16% of girls are engaged in some form of learning activity. Among higher primary students (Class 5 to 7), girls spend more time on TV and mobiles for entertainment than boys during school hours (10am-5pm) — at 31% and 29% respectively. On the other hand, while 34% of boys said they played during school hours, 29% of girls said they did so. While 10% of boys in this bracket are engaged in agricultural activities, 11% are occupied with household work. Among girls, agricultural activities are less while nearly a quarter (24%) on average are involved in household work. Reopen schools for all grades:“The answer to all the problems is reopening of schools for all grades. If that cannot be done, the state government has to then look at launching community learning centres with the help of local people, instructors or NGOs. This is the most important part of their lives where they have to develop the foundation and it is being wasted in watching TV and playing on mobiles,” said Basavaraju R Shreshta, executive director of GRAAM and principal investigator of the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/only-15-rural-kids-engaged-in-learning-during-class-hrs-study/articleshow/85610758.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Site allotment: Karnataka high court relief for ex-cricketer Smitha Harikrishna||BENGALURU: In a big relief for Smitha Harikrishna, former member of the Indian women’s cricket team, the high court on Tuesday dismissed a writ appeal filed by Bangalore Development Authority BDA vis-a-vis allotment of sites to sportspersons. BDA had appealed against a single bench order dated October 21, 2020, which quashed the July 3, 2020 letter from the agency fixing Rs 77 lakh as the value of the site allotted to Smitha at Sir M Vishweshwaraiah Layout. The single bench said the value which existed in 2008 when BDA passed the resolution to allot sites to sportspersons should be adhered to and site allotted to her within two months. A contempt petition filed by Smitha against BDA for not abiding by the single bench order was submitted before the high court. Even as the appeal was in progress, BDA executed a lease-cum-sale deed for a 50X80ft site in favour of Smitha for Rs 7.8 lakh in Vishweshwaraiah Layout on August 16, 2021. Asked by the court why the allotment of 2008 was not given effect till August 16, 2021, counsel for BDA submitted that the file was misplaced. “It is really shocking that a statutory body like BDA has come up with a lame excuse before this court that the file is missing. With the staff of BDA misplacing the file for obvious reasons, the respondent international cricketer has been slapped with an exorbitant price for the plot. Merely because the file (relating to allotment of site) is misplaced, the respondent cannot be blamed for the inaction by BDA,” a division bench comprising justices Satish Chandra Sharma and Sachin Shankar Magadum observed while rejecting the writ appeal. Before the single bench, Smitha had claimed that though she had submitted an application for a 40X60ft site, since other sportspersons named in the 2008 BDA resolution were allotted 50 80ft site, a declaration should be issued that she is also entitled to the same. She had further sought for a direction for allotment of site at the 2008 rate either in HSR, HBR, OMBR or Chandra Layout or any other developed layout, on a par with other similarly situated persons. The single bench had ordered BDA to consider the petitioner’s request for allotment of a 50X80ft site in a layout better formed than Sir M Vishweshwaraiah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/site-allotment-hc-relief-for-ex-cricketer/articleshow/85606027.cms||---
---||India||Form special force to guard courts, judges: Bar Council of India||NEW DELHI: Referring to the killing of a judge in Jharkhand and crimes committed frequently within court premises across the country and clashes between lawyers and police, the Bar Council of India, the apex statutory body to regulate Bar, has pleaded the Supreme Court that a specialised security force be formed under the control of the judiciary to provide protection to judges and court premises instead of relying on police. Supporting a PIL which sought that a special security force for the judiciary be created on the line of Railway Protection Force, the BCI has opposed Centre's stand that a special unit within the police force be given the task and said that the judiciary should form a separate force under its control and should not be dependent on governments and police force for this purpose. In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the BCI said that Article 146 of the Constitution gives ample scope to the Supreme Court to appoint and regulate the specialised security force under control and supervision of the judiciary and not the executive. "It is the humble suggestion of the Bar Council of India that there ought to be a specialised security force for the safety and security of the judges, presiding officers, advocates, court officials, litigants/visitors, witnesses and the premises of courts for betterment of the judicial security," it said. The BCI filed its affidavit responding to PIL filed by Karunakar Mahalik through advocate Durga Dutt in 2019 in view of frequent violent incidents inside court premises including clashes between the police force and lawyers in Tis Hazari court in Delhi and gunning down of the first woman chairperson of Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh inside Agra court premises. After the Jharkhand judge was killed, the apex court took suo motu cognisance and also expedited the proceedings on the PIL and sought response from all states. The BCI in its response also pointed out that the security of Parliament is being handled by Parliament Security Service and on the same line security of the court premises and judges be handled by respective courts. "There is already a specialised security system in the Indian Parliament and the Parliament Security Service of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha Secretariat look after the security set up in Parliament House Complex. In the same line there can be Judicial Security Service set up in the Supreme Court, high courts and subordinate courts," it said. "In recent times there have been number of incidents of mishappenings/crimes of violence within the court and the court premises thus endangering the Iives of the Judges/lawyers/Public Litigants and Court officials present over there and the stakeholders have right to sufficient security in courts and its premises, seeking uniform guidelines for security measures in all courts across the country," the BCI said. It said that requirement of special security system for courts has become imperative as there had been clashes between the police and the lawyers as at the Tis Hazari Court after which Delhi Police officials threatened to take back the security at various court premises and to abstain from the security of judges. "Presently such a trend is rising and there is conflict of interest regarding the security and safety of judiciary as there are many instances where the security agencies are not cooperating with the courts in true sense," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/form-special-force-to-guard-courts-judges-bar-council-of-india/articleshow/85610986.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Guwahati||Assam signs MoU with MFIs for relief to women borrowers||The Assam government on Tuesday signed an MoU with 37 MFIs to provide financial relief to several lakh poor women borrowers in the state to help them maintain good credit discipline in Covid times by expending over Rs 7,000 crore to the lenders. The MoU will remain in force till March 31, 2023. In the last election, BJP’s biggest promise was to these women borrowers that after coming to power, the government will waive off their dues to the MFIs. Till June this year, there were 14 lakh women microfinance borrowers in the state of which about 11 lakh have either made regular repayments or whose payments are overdue, but are not marked as non-performing assets (NPA). To these categories of borrowers, the government will pay a one-time incentive up to Rs 25,000 to incentivize such credit discipline. For the remaining three lakh borrowers, who are stressed, destitute and whose accounts have become NPA, the government will consider providing partial or full relief based on a detailed evaluation. “The finance department of the Government of Assam signed an MOU with microfinance institutions for implementation of Assam Micro Finance Incentive and Relief Scheme (AMFIRS), 2021 to provide succour to poor women borrowers who are not able to return the loan amount of microfinance institutions,” chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. “Accordingly, Assam Micro Finance Incentive and Relief Scheme has been devised with an objective to balance long-term view of ensuring continuity of micro-finance for supporting economic activities of low income and poor households in the state and providing relief to eligible customers for tiding over current stress in the microfinance sector due to various operational reasons,” the chief minister said. Among the prominent MFIs and Banks which have signed the MoU are Micro Finance Institutions Network, North East Small Finance Bank, Association of Small Finance Bank of India, Nightingale Finvest Private Limited, Grameen Development and Finance Pvt. Ltd, North East Micro Finance Association, Bandhan Bank Ltd, Arohan Financial Services Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, Fusion Microfinance Pvt Ltd, L&T Financial Services and Asirvad Microfinance Ltd. Sarma added that the scheme emphasizes responsible lending by financial institutions through compliance of RBI regulations and industry guidelines in letter and spirit while promoting responsible borrowing and timely repayment culture among customers. The CM also urged the MFIs and banks to maintain fair practice code of RBI while disbursing loans in future. He called upon people to ensure judicious utilization of borrowed money. Speaking on the development, Dr Alok Misra, CEO and director of micro Finance Institutions Network (MFIN), said, “The signing of the MOU after several rounds of discussions is a significant development, demonstrating the intent of the Government of Assam and the microfinance institutions in working unanimously towards the welfare of microfinance borrowers in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-signs-mou-with-mfis-for-relief-to-women-borrowers/articleshow/85611196.cms||---
---||World||Biden keeps to Kabul August 31 deadline, cites ISIS attack risk||WASHINGTON: United States President Joe Biden is sticking to his August 31 deadline for completing a frantic airlift of Americans, at-risk Afghans and others seeking to escape Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The decision defies allied leaders who want to give the evacuation more time, and opens Biden to criticism that he caved to Taliban deadline demands. The United States in recent days has ramped up its airlift amid new reports of rights abuses that fuel concern about the fate of thousands of people who fear retribution from the Taliban and are trying to flee the country. Pentagon officials expressed confidence the airlift can get all Americans out by next Tuesday, the deadline Biden had set long before the Taliban completed their takeover. But unknown thousands of other foreign nationals remain in Afghanistan and are struggling to get out. The Taliban, who have wrested control of the country back nearly 20 years after being ousted in a US-led invasion after the 9/11 attacks, insist the airlift must end on Aug. 31. Any decision by Biden to stay longer could reignite a war between the militants and the approximately 5,800 American troops who are executing the airlift at Kabul airport. In Kabul, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference the US must stick to its self-imposed deadline, saying ``after that we won't let Afghans be taken out'' on evacuation flights. He also said the Taliban would bar Afghans from accessing roads to the airport, while allowing foreigners to pass in order to prevent large crowds from massing. It was not immediately clear if they would stop Afghans who are escorted by foreigners or in the process of being evacuated by Western nations. In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden, whose handling of the hastily arranged evacuation has been roundly criticised by Republicans and Democrats alike, announced during a meeting of fellow leaders of the G-7 industrialised nations that he planned to stick to the Aug. 31 deadline. British, French and other officials argued for extending the deadline, officials said. "He also made clear that with each day of operations on the ground, we have added risk to our troops with increasing threats from ISIS-K, and that completion of the mission by Aug. 31 depends on continued coordination with the Taliban, including continued access for evacuees to the airport," Psaki said. ISIS-K is the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, which Biden has vowed to keep in check even after the US forces leave. During a briefing on Tuesday, Biden said the longer the US stays in the country, there is an "acute and growing risk of an attack by a terrorist group known as ISIS-K", or Islamic State-Khorasan. "Every day we're on the ground is another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport and attack both US and allied forces," he said. Psaki said Biden has asked the Pentagon and the state department for evacuation contingency plans to ``adjust the timeline should that become necessary.'' At the Pentagon, spokesman John Kirby said Aug. 31 leaves enough time to get all Americans out, but he was less specific about completing the evacuation of all at-risk Afghans. He said about 4,000 American passport holders and their family members had been evacuated from Kabul as of Tuesday. ``We expect that number to grow in coming days,'' Kirby said. He also said the military would have to start moving troops and their equipment out of Kabul several days prior to Aug. 31 in order to be out entirely by then. It's unclear how many Americans who want to leave are still in the country, but their status is a hot political topic for Biden. Some Republicans bristled Tuesday at the US seeming to comply with a Taliban edict. ``We need to have the top priority to tell the Taliban that we're going to get all of our people out, regardless of what timeline was initially set,'' said Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana. And Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters Monday that ``it was hard for me to imagine'' wrapping up the airlifts by the end of the month. Biden decided in April that he was ending the U.S. war, which began in October 2001. Former President Donald Trump had earlier agreed in negotiations with the Taliban to end the war in May. However, Biden waited until the Taliban had swept to power this month, following the collapse of the US-backed government and its army, to begin executing an airlift.

Among alternate financing measures, the government is looking at allowing insurance bonds instead of bank guarantees, a senior government official said. In her first visit to Mumbai after the second wave of the pandemic, the finance minister addressed industry leaders at a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) interaction on Tuesday evening. Later, she attended a dinner meeting with industry chiefs, including Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran. The FM said that industry dependence on banks would be further reduced by the operationalisation of the new development finance institution, which will take over long-term lending and also provide competition to banks. The FM emphasised the need for government and industry to work together to “create India’s own equity capital”. The meeting was attended by industry leaders including veteran banker Uday Kotak, Bajaj Finserv chairman and managing director Sanjiv Bajaj, and Tata Steel CEO & CII president T V Narendran. Industry members sought clarity on the taxation of startups and issues relating to ease of doing business. In his speech, Narendran called for an increase in government spending as this was the immediate source of demand. T V Somanathan, finance secretary & secretary expenditure, said in his address that there was a need for a “behavioural change” in the trend of appealing against arbitration awards. Revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj said that the government was working on tax-related issues of startups and has sought inputs from the industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fm-asks-india-inc-to-look-beyond-banks-for-finance/articleshow/85607443.cms||---

They were arrested from village Badi Yusufpur under Industrial police station area at Hajipur. A woman identified as Laxmi Devi (40) from Badi Yusufpur had thrown the lubricant on the minister. She had managed to flee. The arrested persons are alleged to be ardent supporters of Paras’s elder brother late Ram Vilas Paswan. Ram Vilas, the founder of LJP, had won from Hajipur Lok Sabha seat till 2019 when he fielded Paras from there. However, Paras split LJP and replaced Ram Vilas’s son and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan as the parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha as well as the party president in June this year. Later, Paras was made a Union minister. Industrial police station SHO Santosh Kumar said the arrested persons are Navin Kumar (25), Anil Paswan (35) and Tribhuvan Paswan (37). He said Navin is Laxmi’s son. He said altogether 11 persons, including Laxmi, have been named as accused in the FIR. “Villagers told police that the accused are ardent supporters of Ram Vilas. They were angry with Paras for causing a split in LJP and replacing Chirag,” the SHO said. Kumar said a programme was organised near the chowk to welcome Paras, who had reached his constituency for the first time after becoming a minister. “Laxmi, with LJP flag and flowers, was standing with a bag in which she had kept a polythene bag filled with used mobil. When the minister reached there, she threw the lubricants through his SUV window,” he said. Vaishali SP Maneesh said further investigations are going on in the case. “An FIR has been registered in the incident on the SHO’s statement,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-held-for-throwing-lubricant-on-pashupati-kumar-paras/articleshow/85603132.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had also visited the hospital before the CM to enquire about the health condition of Tiwari’s wife. Sources said Nitish had been taking updates on the health condition of Tiwari’s wife, a kidney patient, ever since she was admitted to the Delhi hospital. He had also asked the officials concerned to ensure all facilities for her at the hospital. Asked about Nitish’s visit, Tiwari told TOI over the phone, “Few relations are above politics. We have an old family relation. Even Tejashwi stayed at the hospital for a long time.” The JD(U) and RJD leaders said Nitish’s visit to the hospital had nothing to do with politics. JD(U) state spokesperson and former MLC Ranvir Nandan, said. “The CM always gives personal relations with his known people priority. As far as Tiwariji is considered, everyone knows that he has an old relation with the CM. The meeting should not be looked from the prism of politics.” RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, “Tiwariji has a personal relation with both Laluji and Nitish. Such old relations are above politics.” Fun time for Tej: After training guns on RJD state president Jagdanand Singh, national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari and leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s adviser Sanjay Yadav, Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap is now having a fun time in Delhi. Photos which went viral on social media on Tuesday show Tej in a mall with his friends. In one of the photos, he can be seen enjoying snacks at a food court with a big smile on his face.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-visits-shivanands-ailing-wife/articleshow/85605249.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||Papads don’t attract GST, but fryums face 18% rate||MUMBAI: No Gujarati thali is complete without a papad, be it fried or roasted. Fortunately for consumers, as the GST burden is ultimately borne by them, the Gujarat bench of the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) has held that Papads will attract nil GST. Interestingly, the AAR bench observed that Papads were handmade once. Hence, it was easier to roll them into a round shape. Today, with the advancement of technology, the old traditional round papad has given way to different shapes and sizes. But — as long as the goods are similar in respect of the ingredients, manufacturing process and use — it will be a papad classified at HSN 19059040. Currently, the GST rate against this classification is nil. The manufacturer, Global Gruh Udyog, which produced puri papad and unfried papad (in such varieties as jeera, red chilli, green chilli, rice & mung dal) sought a ruling on the classification for its products. Papad is an Indian food prepared mainly with ingredients like flour, spices, salt and oil. This product is unfried and it is not a cooked food. Further, it is not an instant food that is ready for human consumption. Consumers need to fry or roast the product to make it ready for consumption, the applicant explained. It is pertinent to point out that several months ago in the case of Sonal Products, the Gujarat AAR bench had held fryums to be “not papad” and subject to GST at 18%. The ingredients for fryums were maida flour mixed with other additives. “In the past, a few high court decisions have treated fryums to be papad. Even if we focus only on the recent AAR ruling, it is clear that as fryums are also flour mixed with spices and come in different shapes and sizes, these should also be classified as papad subject to nil rate. While AAR rulings do not set a precedent, they do have a persuasive impact in assessment. If the manufacturer has taken a different view, it typically results in litigation,” said a chartered accountant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/papads-dont-attract-gst-but-fryums-face-18-rate/articleshow/85607810.cms||---

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation filed by one Shashi Ranjan Singh, urging the court to direct the authorities concerned to stop sale of prohibited drugs and unapproved FDC medicines. The petitioner alleged that people sell prohibited drugs in the state by changing their chemical composition slightly. The petitioner, represented by counsel Shri Prakash Srivastava, also apprised the high court about action taken by authorities in Muzaffarpur in which an assistant drug controller, Shivani, who was earlier posted there, had sent a report to the in-charge state drug controller Ravindra Kumar Sinha, mentioning names of 111 drugs which are under prohibited category as per The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 but sold at medical stores in Muzaffarpur. Srivastava also submitted that the assistant drugs controller, in her letter dated June 12, 2021, had also provided names and details of firms manufacturing these drugs and the shops selling them rampantly to common people. Appearing for the state government, additional advocate general S D Yadav said the petitioner is a mediaperson and has no locus-standi as well as knowledge of the matter. Yadav also vehemently opposed the matter, submitting that it was not a PIL but a writ petition filed with vested interest. However, the court sought to know from the AAG whether the state government has taken any action on the letter of the assistant drug controller posted in Muzaffarpur. The court told Yadav that the petitioner has raised several other issues too and fixed August 31 as the next date of hearing in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sale-of-banned-drugs-patna-hc-seeks-bihar-govt-reply/articleshow/85603009.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Forest department has also destroyed poppy plants in Barachatti area on several occasions and encouraged the locals to go for lemongrass farming.

Like its famous garbas, the annual display draws students, parents and the art fraternity which congregates from across the country. But the Covid-19 pandemic got the studio vacated just when the work for the degree show was starting last year. Now, budding artists of the faculty have put together the annual display in a virtual ‘avatar’. “The days just before the display used to be busy, hustling and fun for students which can be understood from countless anecdotes each batch shares as display stories. Unfortunately, the pandemic has deprived us of all these aesthetic experiences and fun. For two years, the campus wore the look of a long vacation, summer, winter and monsoon all mixed up,” said Jayaram Poduval, officiating dean of Faculty of Fine Arts. “As the cliché goes — ‘the show must go on’. And our students have created their own initiative of hosting the virtual display, innovatively opening their own opportunities,” he said. The bachelor students of the faculty have put up the online exhibition — Fine Arts Graduates Show 2021 — and even borne much of the expense incurred in the process. “The idea of virtual exhibition originated due to this prevailing pandemic situation and the constraints of not having a proper annual display for past two years,” said final year painting department student Anushree Rabadia. “We had to restrict ourselves to only a virtual show this year but hopefully that will not deprive the students from reaching out to an interested audience at large. It is the time for showcasing of works; a tentative first step in the professional world. It is also the time for us, the teachers, to see students’ work across the disciplines,” said associate professor at Department of Painting Indrapramit Roy. The virtual display showcases works of around 30 students of painting, sculpture and art history departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-fine-arts-show-in-online-avtaar/articleshow/85603816.cms||Prashant Rupera

A batch of petitions was filed before the high court challenging the digital evaluation of answer sheets of Group-1 mains examination. The APPSC chairman was made a respondent in his official and personal capacity. The high court asked the respondents to file affidavits in reply to the petitions. While limiting his current role as chairman of the APPSC, Uday Bhaskar said he was obstructed from discharging his duties for which he had sought intervention of the high court. Despite the high court order to provide facilities entitled to APPSC chairman and to not obstruct him from discharging his duties, he was denied an attender and ‘peshi’ staff. He further stated that all administrative work is being done without the approval of the chairman even though he is regularly attending the office. He was not invited to any official meeting since January 2020, in complete violation of rules of procedure. Uday Bhaskar told the high court that he neither headed a meeting nor authorised any member to head meetings since February 2020. He said the APPSC chairman was bypassed in appointing examiners for the Group-1 examination held from December 14-20, 2020. Any amendments to rules of procedure have to be made by the full commission headed by the chairman and the same has to be issued as a GO and notified by the governor in the official gazette. In the present case, no procedure was followed and hence amendments to the rules of procedure brought in by the state government lack legal sanctity, said Uday Bhaskar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/not-party-to-appsc-decisions-since-jan-20-says-chairman/articleshow/85604790.cms||Srikanth Aluri

With a view to expediting timely publication of examination results, PU started on Tuesday centralized evaluation of answer sheets of Degree Part III honours examinations at Patna Women’s College just a week after the commencement of examinations. The final year BA, BSc and BCom honours examinations of PU commenced on August 17 and are likely to conclude on August 31. PU examination controller R K Mandal said the Degree Part III examinations of vocational (self-financing) courses also commenced on Tuesday. The examinations of PG semester III conventional courses would commence on September 4, whereas the examinations of PG semester III vocational courses shall commence on September 6, he said. The controller said the dates of Degree Part II and Part I honours examinations of both conventional as well as vocational courses would be announced shortly. Meanwhile, PU has already allowed its colleges and postgraduate departments to run both offline and online classes to cover the syllabi before the dates of examinations are announced, said vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Choudhary. The VC further pointed out that the process of online submission of applications for admission to the first year degree classes in arts, science and commerce streams in different colleges of PU is already on, with the last date of submission being August 31. Under the system of centralised admission, the list of candidates selected for admission as per their choices of subject and institution depending upon their merit would be announced by the university in the first week of September. The process of online submission of applications for admission to the postgraduate courses of PU shall start only after the publication of Degree Part III honours examination results. In all probability, admission to the PG courses would commence in the second or third week of September, said PU sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-university-tries-to-regularise-its-academic-sessions/articleshow/85602696.cms||B K Mishra

The state on Tuesday registered nine new Covid cases and the number of active cases has gone down to 101. Bihar is at the third position from the bottom among all the states and union territories in terms of active Covid cases. Health minister Mangal Pandey described it as a big achievement for Bihar. “Tests, tracking and vaccination are the reasons behind sharp fall in number of Covid cases in the state. We test 1.25 lakh to 1.50 lakh samples per day on an average. In case of positive cases, we immediately isolate the patients and then create a micro containment zone. In this zone, tests are again done to identify Covid positive people. This is how we break the chain,” Pandey added. Health officials too said the process of conducting tests in an aggressive manner would continue in the state even though the number of Covid cases has dropped. Of late, the state has been registering less than 20 daily Covid cases. In fact, it logged fresh cases in single digit thrice this month. Health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said the department had been always stressing on conducting tests aggressively. “Even though the number of cases has come down, we are conducting more than 1.50 lakh tests per day. We hold videoconferences with officials of various districts on a regular basis. CM Nitish Kumar also reviews the situation periodically,” Amrit said. Amrit said vaccination would also go a long way in reducing the number of daily cases. “So far, nearly 2.75 crore people have got at least the first dose of vaccines. Special centres have been set up to help people get their second doses. The moment Covid cases show a rising trend in any part of the country, especially Kerala and Maharashtra, we hold meetings to review the impact on Bihar,” he added. Since the number of recovered patients has started exceeding number of fresh cases, active cases have gone down in the state. Even Patna, which used to top Covid chart in the state, has been registering two daily cases on an average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aggressive-tests-vaccination-reasons-for-drop-in-covid-cases-bihar-govt/articleshow/85602808.cms||Sheezan Nezami

A property dealer, Ajay Shukla (40), was shot dead during morning walk near Vishnupuri in Beur area on August 12. Later, on August 20 night, unidentified armed criminals shot dead Rajkumar Sao alias Pintu Sao (40), the husband of Baank panchayat’s former mukhiya Asha Devi, near Painal in Bihta. Next morning, police recovered the body of Siddhnath Lal (55) from behind a temple at Rajpur village in Bihta. Assailants had smashed his head with a heavy object. At around midnight of August 21, sand smugglers shot dead a farmer, Munna Rai (45), at Amnabad village in the riverine belt of Sone in Bihta. Next morning, police recovered the body of an electrician, Varun Thakur (35), dumped in a field covered with vegetation near entrance of the Air Force station at Bihta. When asked, Beur police station SHO Amit Kumar said police are yet to ascertain the reason behind Shukla’s murder. “His family members have lodged an FIR against unknown persons. Police are trying to ascertain the identity of the four shooters,” he said. Bihta police station SHO Rituraj Kumar Singh said the reasons and killers involved in Lal’s murder had been ascertained. “The killer is a 30-year-old ill-tempered man known for his erratic behaviour. He is evading arrest. Police have come to know that he had a heated argument with Lal before the incident. Police have also come to know that the accused used to assault his wife, parents and other family members on petty issues. We will nab him soon,” he said. Singh said none had been arrested in the murder cases of Sao, Rai and Thakur. “Rai’s killers, who are from Bhojpur, are evading arrest. Named accused in the Sao’s murder case are also untraceable. Investigation is going on. Nothing can be said until killers or conspirators are arrested,” he said. Singh said there are a few suspects in Thakur’s murder. “Reason behind his killing is unclear,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-murders-in-20-days-patna-police-still-clueless/articleshow/85602774.cms||---

They want to make it big and look good in their own eyes as well as those of peers, friends and family. The fact of the matter is that most of us enjoy being a hero. That’s nothing wrong, as it does motivate us to work harder and smarter. However, having met over 5,000 candidates in my career, I have noticed that often a number of very talented candidates do not attain their potential, simply because they do not strategise their career well enough. Several candidates just look at opportunities in isolation and not make moves that will help take them to their goal. We do not realise that reaching the top position in our career is like playing a chess game where every move must be thought through and the potential of the opportunity to take us a step closer to our goal is important. Unfortunately, a career is not a 100-metre dash that some of us think it is. The moot question is, what can help accelerate your career? Are we focused on game-changing opportunities and their potential to help us take a quantum jump? Fix a huge problem Yes, the biggest opportunity for you is when you can fix a huge problem. If you are hungry for a huge opportunity, look for a huge problem that you can solve. Remember, no one wins a Nobel Prize by doing ordinary work. You need to excel, and bigger the problem the bigger the opportunity. A lot of capable professionals look at a problem and get scared. Life does not offer easy choices. So, if you think you have the capability to deliver, then seize the opportunity. Do be prepared to work hard and smart and, if you think you can fix a problem, do seize it with both hands. Yes, if you are successful, your career would move to a different orbit — you would have arrived and would be in huge demand. In reality, there is paucity of professionals who have fixed huge problems and, if you are one of them, the corporate world would woo you and you would command a huge premium. High risks, high gains. You will be a hero in the true sense. The world looks very closely at what you achieved for your employers, and you would reap huge rewards. Give more and take less Sometime ago, a very successful CEO of a very large company told me his secret of success. He felt it always pays to be underpaid rather than overpaid. It is funny but true that when you take money out of your equation, more game-changing opportunities fall into your lap as money is a distraction that confuses most people. I have noticed several professionals missing out on game-changing opportunities when they perceived money being 5-10% less than their expectations. They just missed the big picture as they gave more importance to money now and less to the opportunity to make a huge difference and reap rich rewards in the future. Strangely, I have noticed that people who make the most money are not chasing money, but instead focus on the quality of the opportunity. People who chase money often make suboptimal career decisions as they just get too tempted by increase in money. We must remember that everyone looks at ROI (return on investment) of people and being overpaid can be both risky as well as dangerous as expectations and pressure increase manifold. Many of us find it difficult to perform when the pressure is huge, especially now in the post-Covid world. Thus, it pays in the long run to be not out of sync with market compensation. Being underpaid will ensure you can consider far more opportunities that in the medium and long term could be far more lucrative. Leverage your strengths It is very important to have high self-awareness and be equally conscious of our strengths and weaknesses. Believe me — self-awareness is not very high. If you don’t agree, just ask people to list out their areas of improvement and you will find most people will struggle beyond 2-3 at best. This, even though we all know The best of us have minimum 9 weaknesses. Therefore, if you are not aware of what you are not good at, you will make bad career decisions. The trick is to be aware of your strengths and take assignments where you can best leverage on them. Also, know what you are not good at to ensure the job demands are compatible with your strengths and weaknesses. You do need a platform to best exploit your talent. So, look for opportunities where your talent can flourish uninhabited. Suppose your biggest strength is out-of-the-box thinking and you work with an organisation that is bureaucratic, slow-moving or risk-averse. You will then not get a platform to exploit your potential, leading to suboptimal output and frustration. Stay Humble and likeable It is very important to stay humble and keep your ego at bay. Laugh at yourself to enable you to not take yourself too seriously. We must remember that we may be awesome at our work, but if we are not humble or likeable, we will miss out on the most important opportunities as arrogance is the biggest put-off. It is also not easy to stay humble as, bigger the success the bigger is the larger-than-life picture that the world will paint of ourselves. Staying grounded will not be easy. Better to have critics around you than flatterers. Seek areas of improvement and shun praise, but welcome criticism. Please, also do avoid ‘yes men’ around you as they will both fuel your ego as well as manipulate you. Creditable track record Ensure that your track record at every organisation you work for is commendable. Everyone wants to back a winning horse, and not losers. Ensure you leave a creditable performance track as it will comfort your prospective employers when they know you are a performer. Ensure cordial relationship with your previous employers as it will help you. It will help if you are perceived to be dependable, a good performer, professional and ethical. Our trail always remains, and sometimes catches up with us at the wrong time. Some of us just get bitter about previous employers and mess up our reputation, not knowing the damage it could cause us in the future. Bad references about you will be very detrimental for future opportunities. In majority of the cases, the past catches up with us. Do not cause any damage to your previous employers as it is neither ethical nor prudent. I have noticed a number of careers getting destroyed as individuals, in trying to teach a lesson to their previous organisation, ended up spoiling their reputation of dependability and loyalty. Individuals can never be larger than organisations. Hence, to be a hero we need to do heroic deeds. We should create our brand to be one of consistently delivering, ideally of a problem-solver, dependable, good value-for-money, aware of our strengths & weaknesses and best leveraging them. Sometimes a good game plan helps propel the career and takes it into a new orbit. Plan your career as you do plan a chess game, thinking about the consequences of every move. Let every move count and take you closer to your goal, which should be crystal clear in your mind.

Developed by Ramlakhan Singh, the principal of Kala Kendra at Bhagalpur, the unique art form, also known as ‘Gurujee shaili’, is based on Ajanta style of painting and Bhagalpur’s Manjusha art as well as sculpture art. Organic colours and jute canvas are used on walls and floors for this art form. Kala Kendra, the institute imparting training in this art form was established at Lajpat Marg in Bhagalpur in 1954. Kaushmika Priya and Sagarika Srivastava have been trying to reach out to the people with this art form. “Ramlakhan Gurujee developed this technique of painting, which is symbolization of zero,” Priya said. “Gurujee teaches young artists. The unique reason to use ‘zero’ as base in this art form is based on the philosophy that starts from ‘nothingness to infinity’ and that ‘every child learns from nothing to the infinite substratum of knowledge’,” she said. Rajiv Kumar Singh, a teacher at Kala Kendra, said major beneficiaries of this art form are children from slum areas, who got motivated to learn it and finally enrolled in schools and colleges. “Many children from families living in slum areas like at Mayaganj, Barari and Bhikhanpur are thankful to this art form as they took up schooling or college level education and some are in jobs,” Rahul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-poor-kids-in-bhagalpur-keen-to-learn-this-art-form/articleshow/85603238.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Business||KL University’s paper sensor to detect vitamin-D deficiency||Hyderabad: KL Deemed-to-be University on Tuesday said its faculty and researchers have developed a low-cost paper sensor that can measure vitamin-D deficiency with high level of accuracy. The paper sensor developed by the team of Dr Pradeep Kumar Brahman of the department of chemistry and Tummala Anusha, research scholar at the institute’s Andhra Pradesh campus, can help clinics and dispensaries in remote areas measure vitamin-D deficiencies without any lab equipment. According to KLU, the paper sensor costs around Rs 40-50 as compared to the available tests for vitamin-D in hospitals and labs that cost around Rs 1,500-2,000. The accuracy of this sensor is at over 94% which is at par with the existing commercially available tests and generates reports within 30 minutes, it claimed. The sensor is developed by designing a paper electrode in a specific dimension and printing the patterned electrode on an A4 photocopy paper with a specially designed ink - Conductive Ink - that acts as a sensor to detect vitamin-D deficiency. The strip, along with two common electrodes is then dipped in the patient’s serum sample containing electrolyte solution in a voltametric cell. The electrodes are connected to a Potentiostat (a type of electronic instrument), which is connected to a monitor on which the lab technician can view the results of the vitamin-D sensor. Commenting on the development, Dr Pradeep Kumar Brahman said, “This is possibly the first-of-its-kind and the most affordable vitamin-D deficiency sensor in national and international markets. We took two years to finish the research and come up with this product. This handmade sensor is accurate and reliable for the monitoring of vitamin-D deficiency in remote areas where limited resources are available.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kl-universitys-paper-sensor-to-detect-vitamin-d-deficiency/articleshow/85605790.cms||---

Announcing this at a press conference here on Tuesday, Union tourism and culture minister G Kishan Reddy said the GMR Group had come forward to take up restoration work at Golconda Fort. Giving out details of various initiatives planned for 75 weeks of festivities to mark 75 years of India’s Independence, the minister said the government had urged private companies to take up restoration works of monuments and run them for free as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR). “We have entered into an arrangement with Dalmia Group to maintain Gandikota and Red Fort in Delhi, while GMR Group will take up works at Golkonda,” he said. Asserting that too many modifications won’t be carried out at the ASI monuments, Kishan Reddy said better sound and lighting system and replicas of old paintings and souvenirs could be created at these sites. Kishan Reddy said it was worrying to note that Telangana has only eight sites listed out of 3,700 monuments recognised by the ASI. Neighbouring AP has 160 such sites, while Karnataka has over 500 such sites. “There are several forts in Telangana spread over 200-300 acres but they are neglected. Even nearby villagers are unaware of their importance,” he said. He said several programes were lined up in 40 Unesco world heritage sites in the country, including Ramappa temple, to encourage domestic and international tourists. There is also a plan to identify unsung heroes from India’s freedom movement in the 18th century and tell their stories to the next generation. “We are also contemplating to map every past and present detail of the villages in an app,” he said. Once the Covid-19 vaccine drive is completed in the country by December this year, the tourism department will formally welcome foreign and domestic travellers to experience the country’s rich cultural heritage and scenic beauty, said the minister. “I am calling this as ‘dekho apna desh’,” Kishan Reddy said. He also said an international conference on Buddhism, its history and culture will be held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/golconda-74-other-asi-sites-to-be-refurbished-kishan/articleshow/85608097.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Business||ReNew Power lists in US via SPAC, m-cap hits $4.5 billion||MUMBAI: ReNew Power, India’s biggest renewable energy company, on Tuesday listed on the Nasdaq in the US through the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) route and achieved a market capitalisation of nearly $4.5 billion (about Rs 33,500 crore).  This is the biggest listing of an Indian entity through SPAC, the vehicle through which an Indian company could list in the US. At present, an Indian company cannot directly list on a foreign bourse. On Tuesday, ReNew Energy, the UK-domiciled holding company for ReNew Power, started trading on the US exchange under the ticker symbol ‘RNW’. In early trades, the stock was quoted at $8.6. Since under current rules an Indian company can’t directly list on a foreign bourse, the UK-domiciled ReNew Energy has been structured as the holding company for ReNew Power, the India-domiciled company that owns all the renewable energy assets in the country. Although it’s a circuitous route to listing in the US, it is allowed under current laws. In the run-up to the listing, ReNew Energy merged with RMG II, the SPAC that had earlier raised money from wealthy investors around the globe. As is common with SPAC structures in the US, while raising money, RMG II did not have any specific target company to acquire or invest the money in. However, after the fund-raising, it identified ReNew Power as the target company in which it wanted to invest the money it had raised. Some merchant bankers also said that the decade-old ReNew Power’s SPAC listing in the US was the largest for any Asian company, but this could not be independently verified. According to ReNew Power chairman Sumant Sinha, around $700 million of gross proceeds from the listing will accrue to the company. This fund will be used to set up new power production facilities. Currently, the company has an operating capacity of about 5,600 megawatt (MW) and another 4,300MW is in the pipeline. It also has a target of 18,500MW operating capacity by 2025, Sinha told TOI. The company has also set up a large battery facility in Karnataka to store the power it produces, Sinha said. A storage facility was needed since production of renewable energy is mostly intermittent and it may not always be possible for the energy grids to absorb it as and when produced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/renew-power-lists-in-us-via-spac-mcap-hits-4-5bn/articleshow/85607683.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Three years on, DNA report identifies Moradabad girl; cops connect dots, arrest her rapists & killers||BAREILLY: A DNA test report which took almost three years to arrive finally established the identity of a Moradabad girl, 3, who was found charred to death in a pile of garbage three years ago. It gave a closure of sorts to her parents, who, all this while, were still hopeful of finding her. The report also prompted local police to dust off the files of the sensational case and detain two suspects, who finally narrated chilling details of the crime they had committed on the night of September 5, 2018. The child, who had come with her parents to see Janmashtami fair, was kidnapped, gang-raped and strangled by the two accused. “They had put the girl’s body on a garbage pile and set it on fire. The body was charred beyond recognition. Even her parents could not identify her,” a police officer said. One of the suspects, Ravindra, was booked for abduction in 2018 on a tip-off of a shopkeeper who had seen him with the child. But, he had come out of jail on parole last year. On Tuesday, both the accused, Ravindra and his friend Mintu, were booked for murder and gang-rape. Superintendent of police (SP) of Moradabad, Amit Kumar Anand, told TOI, “The charred body of a girl was recovered from a pile of garbage on Moradabad outskirts on September 6, 2018. On the same day, a complaint was lodged at Civil Lines police station that a three-year-girl had gone missing. The family was called for identification of the recovered body, but they couldn’t identify her. Later, the DNA samples of the body and that of the family were taken for tests.” The SP city said, “The accused, Ravindra, was sent to jail after a case under 363 (punishment for kidnapping) was registered against him.” Ravindra was released from jail on parole during lockdown last year. SP Anand said, “After the DNA report confirmed that the deceased was the daughter of the same parents, who had lodged a missing complaint, Ravindra was again taken into police custody. During interrogation he revealed everything. The second accused, Minto, has also been arrested.” The officer couldn’t explain the almost three years of delay in the arrival of the report.

Three of the state highways are in south Bihar and one in north Bihar. Besides, the roads to be inaugurated have two road overbridges (ROBs). Nitish will inaugurate the four state highways at a function through videoconferencing. Pankaj Kumar, managing director of Bihar State Road Development Corporation (BSRDC), said: “Of the three roads in south Bihar, the 54.519-km-long Bihia-Jagdishpur Piro-Bihta state highway-102, that runs through Bhojpur district, has been constructed at a cost of Rs504.20 crore. The road has 10-metre paved shoulder and an ROB on Ara-Sasaram railway line. It connects with the four-lane Patna-Buxar road at Danvar Bihta. Through the Nasriganj-Daudnagar bridge, it links with the Magadh region.” He added: “Another 29.3-km-long Amarpur-Akbarnagar SH-85 will provide smooth traffic through Bhagalpur, Munger and Banka districts. It has been constructed at a cost of Rs220.71 crore.” On the other hand, the 41.11-km-long Ghogha-Panjwara SH-84, that runs through Bhagalpur and Banka districts, has entailed an expenditure of Rs332 crore and will provide smooth running to stone chips laden trucks coming from Jharkhand, besides serving as the “outer bypass road” for Bhagalpur. The construction of the ROB at Ghogha Bazar has been delayed due to problem in land acquisition and will now be ready for use by January 1 next year. As to the fourth one for north Bihar, the 10-metre-wide 4.55-km-long bypass of the SH-91 (Bihariganj bypass-Udakishanganj Madhepura road) will provide link to Vijayghat and Nugachhia in Bhagalpur through SH-58. Nitish hopes PM will heed plea for caste census: CM Nitish Kumar said on Tuesday that he was “hopeful” that the Centre will give “due consideration” to the plea of the 11-member all-party Bihar delegation and decide for the caste census in the country. “PM (Narendra Modi) heard patiently the arguments and the pleas put forward in favour of the caste census by every member of the delegation. We presented all the details from our side, and are now hopeful that the PM will give due consideration to them and also decide in favour of the caste census,” Nitish said, adding that the copies of the unanimous resolutions passed by the state assembly on the matter in 2019 and 2020, along with other details, had earlier been sent to the Centre. “We want that the Centre takes a decision on it,” Nitish stressed, adding at the same time that it was also the view in other states across the country, but Bihar took the initiative to press for it. Nitish was talking to mediapersons at the Patna airport after returning from Delhi. Nitish on Monday led the 11-member delegation and presentation views on the matter before the PM. When reminded that the preparations to conduct 2021 general census have already been made for its launch and start, Nitish said: “There are two aspects to it. If the census has already started, and if it is to start. The census count has not yet started and, therefore, the decision to conduct it can be taken.” He further said: “It is on the basis of the findings of the 1931 census that the policy decisions were taken. Therefore, at least one more caste-based census should be conducted for the future use.” He insisted that the second caste census will be advantageous for the people as it has its own benefits for them and accordingly, all the political parties in Bihar have favoured it, while it will also be in “national interest”. As to the “monetization” plan – euphemism for privatization of the public assets – of the Patna airport and roads under the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in the state planned by the Centre, Nitish said his government has consistently taken steps to improve the Patna airport. “In fact, we don’t yet have the details on what is being done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-to-inaugurate-4-state-highways-today/articleshow/85603071.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Sanitation drive in schools and colleges till August 30||HYDERABAD: With the state government deciding to open all educational institutions for physical classes from September 1, education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy and panchayat raj minister E Dayakar Rao directed the district administration to sanitize all schools by August 30. The ministers said that sarpanches and panchayat secretaries would be held responsible for any lapse on their part. Following the decision of the government on starting physical classes, the ministers held a video conference with district collectors, additional collectors, zilla parishad chairpersons and other district and mandal level education officials on Tuesday. Sabitha Indra Reddy said that the schools were closed for the past 17 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Even school buses, both private and RTC buses, that take the children to the schools, need to be sanitised. The education department should coordinate with municipal and panchayat raj department officials,” the education minister said. Dayakar Rao said that the state government’s programmes—Palle Pragati and Pattana Pragati— were highly successful as the villages and towns were cleaned and issues were resolved. “With the same spirit, the sanitation programmes in schools should be taken up,” he said. District collectors and additional collectors (local bodies) have been asked to closely monitor the sanitisation of schools. “As per the CM’s directions, there should be no lapse on the part of the government as far as children’s health is concerned. Keeping past experience in mind, masks must be worn and other measures should be taken,” the ministers said.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Indian Council for Historical Research move to implement Sangh agenda, says Congress||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Senior Congress leaders on Tuesday came out in unison against Indian Council for Historical Research’s (ICHR) decision to review the inclusion of names of Malabar rebellion leaders Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji and Ali Musaliar from the list of martyrs of Indian freedom struggle. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said ICHR move to strike out names of 387 participants of the Malabar rebellion is ‘heinous, despicable and treacherous’. “Malabar rebellion is a glowing chapter in the struggle against the colonial forces. Only Sangh Parivar can find communal elements in this historical struggle. It is part of the move to paint the valiant and anti-colonial warrior Kunhamed Haji as an anti-Hindu bigot and the great rebellion as a communal riot,” he added. Senior Congress leader V M Sudheeran said that the attempt to discredit the Malabar rebellion leaders was part of Sangh Parivar attempts to discredit leaders like Gandhi, Nehru and glorify Gandhi-killer Godse. “This is also part of the efforts of a failed government to deflect public attention from their anti-people activities,” he said. Former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the ICHR decision to remove the names of Malabar rebellion leaders who made the British imperialist forces shudder showed the cowardice of ICHR. “The decision is an insult to the great independence struggle. It’s quite natural that the memories of valiant martyrs like Kunhamed Haji and Musaliar would disturb Sangh Parivar, which remained subservient to the colonial forces. It may be possible to twist history and rewrite history books by using power, but the memories of fighters like Kunhamed Haji and Musaliar cannot be rubbed off from the minds of Indians,” he said. BJP cries foulMeanwhile, BJP national executive member P K Krishnadas said the Congress leaders were challenging the opinions of their own leaders of the past about the Malabar rebellion. Krishnadas said CPM, by glorifying the people behind the Hindu ‘genocide’ was trying to appease the ‘Taliban outfits in Kerala’. The opportunistic stand of CPM and Congress were a matter of serious concern for Hindus, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ichr-move-to-implement-sangh-agenda-says-cong/articleshow/85608126.cms||---
---||Patna||534 blocks to get 1 modern ambulance each: Bihar health minister||PATNA: All the 534 blocks of the state will now get one advance life support ambulance each for transporting serious patients from remote villages to the nearest district hospital or medical college and hospital for treatment. State health minister Mangal Pandey said these ambulances would be equipped with cardiac units, portable ventilators, monitors, oxygen and other life-saving medical devices. The initiative is part of the state government’s preparation to face the likely third wave of Covid pandemic. He said though primary health centres, sub-divisional and district hospitals have their own ambulances, these new ambulances, which would be made available within three months, would remain under the control of the health department. Since people faced difficulties in arranging oxygen-equipped ambulances for carrying serious patients to big hospitals like IGIMS, AIIMS, PMCH and NMCH during the first and second waves of Covid pandemic, introduction of proper ambulance facility was the need of the hour. The state government is also trying to make medical oxygen available at all the health facilities. “Of the proposed 123 oxygen plants, 22 have already been installed at different hospitals, including PMCH, NMCH, IGIMS, DMCH and Vardhman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri. The rest of the plants will be installed at the hospitals by September 10,” Pandey added. As health experts have expressed fears that the third wave of the pandemic might affect children the most as they have not been immunised yet, the state government has launched an initiative to set up paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) at all the important government hospitals. “While the medical college and the hospitals with 100 beds are developing 40 PICUs each, those with less than 100 beds will have 32-bed PICUs,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-health-minister-534-blocks-to-get-1-modern-ambulance-each/articleshow/85602953.cms||VK Tripathi

In such times, I could ill-afford paying Rs 1,800 monthly school fee for both my girls. I have shifted them to government school as education is online anyways,” said Lalita. Since Covid-19 struck the state in March 2020, a sizable 5 lakh schoolchildren in Gujarat have left private schools and taken admission in government schools or government-aided schools. As per data maintained by state education department, 2.82 lakh students left private schools and took admission in government or grant-in-aid schools in 2020-21. In 2021-22 which saw the state reel under the killer second wave, 2.27 lakh students shifted to government schools till August this year. Experts say the significant shift can be attributed to the financial crunch witnessed through the pandemic and loss of lives and livelihoods of many across cities and rural areas. In such times, a big number of parents suddenly felt the pinch of paying an average Rs 15,000 to Rs 30,000 annual fee in self-financed schools especially when physical schooling is practically shut all through the one and half years of the pandemic. In grant-in-aid schools this fee is reduced to Rs 600-900 per annum while there is no fee charged in government schools. Bharat Gajipara, president of Gujarat Self Financed School Management Association said that private schools in villages and towns have suffered the most. "Incomes of families across cities, villages and towns got curtailed. Majority parents cited lack of funds while removing their wards," said Gajipara. Bhaskar Patel, president of Gujarat State Grant-In-Aid School Management Association said "Many families lost bread-winners. We have witnessed many widows citing no money to fund private schooling." Administrator of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporationrun school board Laghdir Desai said that some 8,500 city students have shifted from private schools to AMC schools. "Free of cost schooling, improving infrastructure and starting English medium schools has led to the change," said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/5l-students-shifted-from-pvt-to-govt-schools-in-pandemic-period/articleshow/85606858.cms||Bharat Yagnik

This will be the first Tejas Express of the East Central Railway (ECR) to run on the path of Rajdhani Express. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, Tejas Express runs at the maximum speed of 160km/hr. “The speed limit of express trains has been increased from 110km/hr to 130km/hr on Patna-Buxar-Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction mainline route. Thus, Tejas Express is fit to run at the maximum 130km/hr between Patna Junction and New Delhi, reducing journey hours marginally by half an hour at least,” he said. Tejas coaches have been indigenously designed and manufactured at the Kapurthala rail coach factory in Punjab. Two rakes of the most sophisticated and luxurious coaches numbering 52 have already reached Patna. “The special features of the Tejas Express coaches are that the train will not move unless automatic doors of the coaches are completely closed. Facilities like Wi-Fi, CCTV cameras, dustbin, tea and coffee vending machine, LCD screens displaying information about each station are available in Tejas coaches,” the CPRO said. “Well experienced chefs will be there on the running train to serve delicious meals to passengers. Touchless water taps, soap dispensers, bio-vacuum toilets, hand drier machines and infant-care seats in lavatories have been provided in the Tejas coaches. Besides, Tejas coaches are fitted with the facility of fire detection and suppression system while side lower berth is single. The berths have been provided with upgraded cushion and colourful roller blinds at each window,” he said. The Tejas coaches have retro reflective tape in the aisle area. Besides, railways has, for the first time, provided much improved convenient steps to climb on upper berths. Senior divisional commercial manager (DCM) of Danapur, Adhar Raj, said rakes are ready for carrying passengers with all comforts from Rajendra Nagar Terminal to New Delhi from September 1 onwards. “Fare for passengers travelling by Tejas Express is the same as of the Rajdhani Express. Online tickets can be booked on the IRCTC website,” he said. According to sources, the total number of berths in full one rake of the Tejas Express comprising 26 coaches is 758, including first AC, second AC and third AC coaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-delhi-tejas-express-to-replace-rajdhani-from-sept-1/articleshow/85602593.cms||Kumod Verma

According to the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation officials, nearly 80% of the total cases in the last five years in the city were due to the domestic breeding of mosquitoes. Whenever a new case emerges, the GVMC and district malaria wing officials conduct a survey to check the breeding source. Flowerpot plates, ornamental plants, water drums, refrigerator drip pan, and domestic containers were found to be the major culprits in harbouring the mosquitoes. For instance, when the GVMC conducted a two-day special sanitation drive against vector-borne diseases in 2018 covering all the 5.8 lakh households in the city, the GVMC officials found thousands of larval habitats sequestered inside the households, even in posh localities of the city. Contrary to the popular belief, clean stagnant water is the perfect breeding ground for Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue and chikungunya, while some mosquito genera thrive in the dirty water. The mosquitoes need stagnant water such as in water containers, flower pots, empty coconut shells, tyres, etc. to complete their lifecycle – from the larva stage to a fully developed adult mosquito. The larvae thrive on the microorganisms in the stagnant water to metamorphose into an adult mosquito. GVMC commissioner G Srijana said that based on the case history in the last four to five years, it has been found that 80% of the total dengue, malaria and chikungunya emerged from domestic breeding. “We request the public to completely empty out the water containers and others, which may lead to water stagnation, once every three to four days. And the water containers need to be fully covered. We have mapped every ward secretary with about 75 to 80 houses. They have to check on the mosquito breeding sites in these houses and destroy them, if any. Public should make sure water doesn’t stagnate inside or outside their homes to prevent the breeding of the mosquitoes,” Srijana added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/mosquito-breeding-in-homes-poses-seasonal-risk-in-vizag/articleshow/85604738.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Goa||Goa: Ahead of Sep 1, aided colleges meet to decide uniform SOPs||PANAJI: Even as the academic year 2021-22 is set to begin for general stream colleges from September 1 in the physical mode, deliberations are on at the institutes to draw up SOPs. While the principals of aided colleges will hold a meeting later this week to finalise a uniform SOP to operate in the physical mode, heads of government colleges have already readied plans to welcome students back on campus. Colleges are expected to begin conducting physical classes for second and third year students first, as these students have not experienced physical teaching at all, having enrolled for undergraduate programmes after the arrival of the pandemic. Also, institutes feel safer calling the older students on campus, as a large majority of them are vaccinated, being over the age of 18. Principal of government college, Khandola, Purnakala Samant, said that the institute will conduct physical classes for second and third year students first. He said the focus will be on completing the practical sessions before there is any rise in Covid-19 cases. “SOPs are to be drawn up by each college depending on the feasibility, based on its student numbers and infrastructure,” said Samant. “We have decided to call second and third year students to college first as they have only been taught in the online mode for the past two years, and we don’t want third year students to complete their programme without attending physical classes. We will be calling them in batches of 40 students each, and classes will be held in larger classrooms to ensure social distancing.” Colleges are unlikely to call first year students on campus for physical classes at least for the first few months. “We will be calling first year students to college only after at least 50% of the portion for the second and third year students is complete through the offline mode. We will mainly take up teaching of subjects like accountancy, costing, mathematics, etc, first, as it is difficult to teach these in the online mode,” said Samant. Institutes are keen that third year students attend classes in the physical mode throughout the academic year. Principal of government college, Quepem, Joydeep Bhattacharjee, said that his institute will start with scheduling offline classes for third year students first. “Online theory classes will be conducted for first and second year students. For second and third year students, practicals for all science stream subjects will be held offline. For third year students, both theory and practicals will be conducted offline,” said Bhattacharjee. He said the college will review the arrangements by the end of September based on the Covid-19 situation. “We had asked students to submit information about their vaccination status during readmission and we are happy that all our third year students have taken at least one dose of the vaccine,” he said. Aided colleges are hoping that a common SOP can be drawn, which will also bring uniformity in the process followed in both aided and government institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ahead-of-sep-1-aided-colleges-meet-to-decide-uniform-sops/articleshow/85608084.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The paper sensor developed by the team of Dr Pradeep Kumar Brahman of the department of chemistry and Tummala Anusha, research scholar at the institute’s Andhra Pradesh campus, can help clinics and dispensaries in remote areas measure vitamin-D deficiencies without any lab equipment. According to KLU, the paper sensor costs around Rs 40-50 as compared to the available tests for vitamin-D in hospitals and labs that cost around Rs 1,500-2,000. The accuracy of this sensor is at over 94% which is at par with the existing commercially available tests and generates reports within 30 minutes, it claimed. The sensor is developed by designing a paper electrode in a specific dimension and printing the patterned electrode on an A4 photocopy paper with a specially designed ink - Conductive Ink - that acts as a sensor to detect vitamin-D deficiency. The strip, along with two common electrodes is then dipped in the patient’s serum sample containing electrolyte solution in a voltametric cell. The electrodes are connected to a Potentiostat (a type of electronic instrument), which is connected to a monitor on which the lab technician can view the results of the vitamin-D sensor. Commenting on the development, Dr Pradeep Kumar Brahman said, “This is possibly the first-of-its-kind and the most affordable vitamin-D deficiency sensor in national and international markets. We took two years to finish the research and come up with this product. This handmade sensor is accurate and reliable for the monitoring of vitamin-D deficiency in remote areas where limited resources are available.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/clearedkl-university-researchers-develop-paper-sensor-to-detect-vitamin-d-deficiency/articleshow/85605846.cms||---

Reason: 17 of 33 districts were not opened for counselling. These principals were recently promoted from school lecturer and will be posted in other places. Out of 33, just 16 districts were opened for counselling while Jaipur, Ajmer, Tonk, Alwar and 17 more districts were kept out of the counselling. The districts kept out of the counselling are supposed to be most sought-after districts for postings. Mahendra Pandey, general secretary of Rajasthan Primary and Secondary Teachers Association, said, "This is a serious issue and government needs to explain why it kept 17 districts out of the counselling. In absence of explanation it would show corruption in the education department. The districts that are closed are in high demand, so teachers’ agitation is justified." The authorities said that they opened posts in districts where there was high demand for principals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/principals-demand-opening-of-postings-in-17-dists/articleshow/85608131.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Parents move from top-notch schools, seek better options||HYDERABAD: Job loss and financial crisis during the pandemic have forced many parents to downgrade their child’s school by opting for an educational institution with less fee. In some cases, a few were forced to look for a cheaper option as sponsors have backed out from shelling out a huge amount for online classes. “It did not make sense for me to continue to pay about Rs 40, 000 per year even during the pandemic. I wanted to minimise expenditure and decided to opt for a school with a lesser fee,” said K Srujana, whose sons are studying in class 6 and class 8. Srujana said they did not compromise on the quality of education, but just looked for a better option. “Now, we are paying Rs 16, 000 each for my sons,” said Srujana, who runs a boutique. Parents said that it was not worth opting for schools that charge lakhs of rupees even for kindergarten school. They questioned what these schools were teaching children by charging such exorbitant fees. Another parent, Pavan D, whose daughter is in class 8, said that he had also decided to opt-out of an international school. “When I spoke with management about exorbitant fees, it felt that this is just another business for them. I no longer wanted to continue in that school and moved her to another school, which charges way less than what we were paying in this top school,” Pavan added. He said that one of the reasons why he opted for a school with a less fee was an addition in the family, the birth of his son. “I could not afford to pay about a lakh each for both my kids. I don’t think it is worth paying,” he added. Several parents said they have moved their children to a different school after their fight against management to enforce fee regulation norms failed. “They behaved as if we are asking for a discount. Whereas, in reality, we were just asking them to follow norms and collect fees accordingly,” another parent, whose daughter is in class 9, said.

In the country, about 200 school owners died during the pandemic. TRSMA and National Independent Schools Alliance (NISA) will be holding a protest on September 5, Teachers’ Day, to highlight their problems. TRSMA representatives said the number of deaths of school owners was way higher in Telangana compared with other states. Speaking at a press conference organised by TRSMA and NISA in the wake of increased number of suicides by educationists due to financial problems, TRSMA president Y Shekhar Rao said: “We have dues from 2019-20 and most managements have mounting debts as they borrowed to keep schools running.” TRSMA members said that the Prime Minister and finance minister should come to their rescue by ensuring they get Rs 10 to Rs 20 lakh loan. They also asked the state to waive off property and vehicle tax for the pandemic period and pay an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh for families of budget school owners who died during the pandemic. “Educators fought Covid-19 and conquered it, but failed to fight private financiers. Unable to pay interest on loans, school owners are committing suicides,” NISA president Kulbhushan Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/school-bodies-to-protest-on-sept-5/articleshow/85608128.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Colleges may reopen with practical classes||HYDERABAD: Following the state government’s decision to reopen colleges for physical classes from September 1, managements are planning to start with practical classes for the first few weeks. Students across Telangana will be returning to the classrooms after more than 1.5 years. According to sources, the government is likely to adopt the same guidelines that were issued in September last year with slight modifications. While the city colleges are awaiting clear guidelines from the state government on reopening, many are planning to begin with practical sessions. “The pharmacy course for example is a lab-oriented course. Every student will have to undergo atleast three to four lab classes every week. Students have not been exposed to any lab sessions for the last 1.5 years. It’s time we begin with practical knowledge,” said K Ramdass, president of Telangana Pharmacy Colleges Association. Vaccination of teachers and students will play a pivotal role as colleges have already started collecting data ahead of reopening. “We have asked all our teachers and students to submit their vaccination certificates to us before the reopening. Those who are not vaccinated are being encouraged to atleast get their first dose before the reopening. Apart from this, we have also started taking up sanitization measures,” said Fareetha Farzana, principal, Shine India Degree College, LB Nagar. Many colleges running in standalone buildings in and around Hyderabad may find it difficult to maintain social distancing. Therefore, colleges want the government to adopt a shift system for students. “In the shift system, first and second year students can be called during morning hours and others in the afternoon hours. Not just that, students can also be divided into batches and called on alternate days to maintain social distancing,” said Laxma Reddy, director, Association for Strengthening Private Initiative in Rural Education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/colleges-may-reopen-with-practical-classes/articleshow/85608117.cms||Preeti Biswas

This year, admissions in government schools rose by over a lakh to reach 27.5 lakh students, while in government junior colleges 1,05,090 students enrolled in intermediate first year. “After the government started English medium schools in 2017-18 academic year, the admissions in government schools have started seeing an upward trend as admissions improved by about 50,000 per academic year. This year, however, because of Covid-19 and schools remaining physically closed, the number has gone up by about 1.14 lakh,” said Chava Ravi, a government teacher and general secretary, United Teachers Federation. He, however, said that the admissions might go down a little as the state is planning to resume physical classes from September 1.  Same is the case with junior colleges as well, as they too are anticipating that the number of admissions might slightly decrease after they provide the delete option. “While about 86,000 students used to join government colleges every year, this year over 1.05 lakh students have joined till date. However, after giving delete options, the numbers slightly decrease every year and the same might repeat this year as well,” said an official from the intermediate board. - Nirupa Vatyam After the government started English medium schools in 2017-18 academic year, the admissions in government schools improved by about 50,000 per academic year.

Parthasarathy is currently in judicial remand in a similar cheating case registered at Central Crime Station (CCS), Hyderabad. The complaint against KSBL, C Parthasaraty, KSBL director Yugandhar and others was filed with Gachibowli police on August 23 by ICICI bank and a case was registered under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) r/w 34 of the IPC. Cyberabad additional DCP D Kavitha said that KSBL had pledged securities of clients with six banks without their consent between 2009 and 2019. “Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in its circular directed that clients’ securities lying with trading members or clearing members can’t be pledged to banks or NBFCs for raising funds. SEBI also specified that broker should maintain clear segregation of client beneficiary account and its own beneficiary account. But funds raised by KSBL from six banks through pledging shares of clients were transferred to KSBL’s own bank accounts and not into the stock broker client account, which is against SEBI guidelines,” Cyberabad police stated in a statement. As Parthasarathy was in judicial remand in a cheating case of CCS, Hyderabad, Cyberabad commissioner V C Sajjanar said they would arrest him after filing a prisoner transit warrant before court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/karvy-boss-booked-for-rs-563-cr-fraud/articleshow/85608170.cms||---

The move would increase the number of municipal corporations in the state from 15 to 21, help address infrastructure imbalance in areas adjoining urban local bodies and improve the living condition of people, officials said. Tambaram would be upgraded into a corporation by merging Pallavaram, Sembakkam, Pammal and Anakaputhur municipalities and nearby areas, the minister said while replying to the debate on demand for grants for the municipal administration department. Nehru also announced that Trichy, Nagercoil, Thanjavur and Hosur corporations and Chengalpet, Poonamallee and Mannarkudi municipalities would be expanded by merging nearby developed areas with them. The elected members of the local bodies in the territories falling under the new corporations, expanded corporations and expanded municipalities would continue in their posts till the next local body elections. He also announced upgradation of Pallapatti, Thittakudi, Mangadu, Kundrathur, Nandhivaram, Guduvanchery, Ponneri, Thiruninravur, Sholingar, Edanganasalai, Taramangalam, Thirumuruganpoondi, Gudalur, Karamadai, Karumathampatti, Madukkarai, Vadalur, Kottakuppam, Thirukovilur, Ulundurpet, Adirampattinam, Manamadurai, Surandai, Kalakadu, Thiruchendur, Kollankode, Mursiri and Lalgudi town panchayats into municipalities. Pugalur municipality would be created by merging Punjaipugalur and TNPL Pugalur town panchayats. The government’s decision to upgrade and expand the urban local bodies would improve the basic amenities and infrastructure in the region by better mobilisation of land resources and finance. Going by the 2011 census, 75% of the male workers in the expanded areas coming under the urban local bodies are involved in non-agricultural sector, which is an indication of urbanisation of the area, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/corporation-status-for-tambaram-five-more-municipalities/articleshow/85605899.cms||---
---||Kochi||CPM leadership may rein in Kochi corporation administration||KOCHI: The CPM leadership is learnt to have decided to start actively involved in Kochi corporation’s administration. The party leadership has asked Mayor M Anil Kumar to seek the views of senior party leaders in the council before taking major decisions. It is believed that the party leadership’s decision follows some back-to-back controversies regarding certain decisions taken by the mayor. At the CPM councillor’s meeting held a couple of days ago, the councillors aired their views that many decisions by the corporation administration are not being communicated to them before council meetings. The mayor’s decision to give anticipatory approval (an approval given by the mayor, in an emergency situation, anticipating that the council would ratify the decision) to telecom service providers for erecting poles for drawing optical fibre cables in the city had earned the wrath of many of the councillors, including those from the ruling front. The UDF had stalled the proceedings of the council which discussed the agenda for ratifying the mayor’s anticipatory approval. It is learnt that some of the ruling front councillors had lodged complaints with the party stating that the mayor should not have given anticipatory approval for the telecom service providers. “The meeting held at Lenin Centre a couple of days ago, was attended by 24 councillors. Many of them expressed their dissent over the manner in which key decisions are taken,” sources said.  “Some of the councillors who spoke at the meeting said the approach and speeches made by a section of the ruling front councillors are causing a headache to the LDF-led administration. They use the council meetings as a platform for criticizing the ruling front,” sources said. Besides the councillors, CPM district secretary C N Mohanan, party state committee member and former mayor C M Dineshmani, and mayor attended the meeting. Though we tried to contact C N Mohanan over phone, he did not pick up. Meanwhile, mayor said all the decisions are taken unanimously. “The meeting was held in a cordial ambience. The allegations that the councillors criticised me are baseless. We are taking all the decisions after consulting the councillors and leaders,” Kumar said. Many issues, including projects related to waste treatment at Brahmapuram, were also discussed at the meeting. Meanwhile, the corporation authorities have sought the support of police for addressing the issue of waste dumping on streets and have decided to erect CCTV cameras at various places where waste dumping is rampant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-leadership-may-rein-in-corp-admn/articleshow/85605896.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The university decided to give admission to students from non-science background following a direction by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). Students will have to go through a bridge course to study engineering.RTU, Kota, vice-chancellor RA Gupta said, “The students from non-science streams in class XII will be able to get admission for engineering but they have to take bridge courses in which basics of class XI and XII science will be taught. The students will have to study subjects in this bridge course along with their usual course.” The idea behind these new changes has been derived from the New Education Policy, 2020 which focuses on multi-disciplinary learning and calls for giving students a wider exposure of learning across streams. New Education Policy even said that a student from science field should be able to study humanities subjects, and humanities’ students should be able to learn science subjects. The final decision is left in the hands of respective institutions. Puneet Sharma, higher education expert said, “This will be a good initiative for students who were confused in class XI during subject selection. But provisions have to be changed in Rajasthan Engineering Admission Process (REAP) as well to allow such students or else the plan of RTU, Kota will not be properly implemented.” The process of application will start soon in RTU, Kota, although students from Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics or Biology will be given preference in this. For the remaining seats, humanities and commerce students will be admitted. This doesn’t seem to be a big challenge because in RTU, Kota many seats remain vacant every year during admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rtu-to-admit-non-science-students-for-engg-courses/articleshow/85608140.cms||---

In a setback to CU, Lakshadweep administration has given nod to Pondicherry University to start a community college in the islands and establish a regular campus later. The move comes close on the heels of the administration asking CU to discontinue PG courses offered at its centres in the archipelago. Lakshadweep’s administrator has approved a new community college in Lakshadweep under the aegis of Pondicherry University from the academic year 2021-22. The letter written by A Anbarasu, adviser to the administrator, to VC of Pondicherry University says that the varsity has already issued NOC to Lakshadweep administration for starting three vocational courses namely B.Voc (tourism and service industry, software development and catering and hospitality) as part of the community college. “Pondicherry University may like to add integrated BSc-BEd (4 years), B.Com (3 years) and BBA (3 years) and other courses as may be needed as a part of the Community College. Also the administration has offered facilities at the campus of the education department in Kadmat, including hostel facilities as an interim measure to immediately commence courses in the ongoing academic year. Also, the administration requested Pondicherry varsity to visit and firm up infrastructure, make required short-term and long-term arrangements, including finding suitable land for establishing the regular campus of community college. Meanwhile, CU clarified that it had to discontinue PG courses as per the decision taken by Lakshadweep administration. CU registrar EK Satheesh said the varsity was ready to offer any course at the three centres of Kavaratti, Kadmat and Andrott. CU said that it was Lakshadweep administration which had set up infrastructure facilities for the varsity centres on the island and the salaries for faculty and staff were being paid using the fund provided by the island administration. Varsity officials said that they cannot override the policy decisions or go beyond the MoU signed in this regard. Varsity authorities said that the island administration cited low number of PG students at the centres and low pass percentage as the reasons for stopping the PG courses. MSF national president TP Ashrafali said that the move was the latest attempt by Lakshadweep administration to slowly delink the strong social, educational and cultural links the people of the island have with Kerala. “As Pondicherry is ruled by the NDA alliance, there could be a hidden agenda to suit their political interests in the academic realm as well,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cus-loss-as-dweep-opts-for-pondy-univ/articleshow/85608171.cms||---

Senior medical officer Dr Jaskirandeep Kaur said it was very important to take care of children's health during a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, as top health experts have predicted that children will be worst affected by the wave. Asha workers were given training and briefing at the Primary Health Care (PHC), Boothgarh in Mohali. Underlining the need for sensitisation of ASHA workers for child care, she said, “Asha workers are the backbone of the health department and it is very important for them to be aware. If they are aware, they will be able to give accurate information to people. She added said that since children were not being vaccinated, they were vulnerable. “Therefore, it is the duty and responsibility of the health department to constantly monitor their health,” she said. Medical officer Dr Harman Mahal and Dr Anuradha Nadda, assistant professor, medical college, Mohali gave understandable and succinct information about how to take care of children during the possible third Covid wave to Asha workers.

Temple sources said it was for the first time that an artist from the community was appointed at Guruvayur to a post related to daily rituals of the temple. Karuvannur Melepurakkal Satheesh from Erumapetty said he has already taken up his job. “It is a blessing of Lord Guruvayurappan. I’m getting good cooperation from other temple staff,” he said. Usually artists from communities like Marar and Poduvals are posted at Guruvayur temple for performances associated with the daily puja rituals. These posts are generally filled by members belonging to the families that enjoy hereditary rights. This latest change happened after permanent appointments at Guruvayur were taken over by Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board. Till then, Guruvayur Devaswom managing committee was authorised to recruit staff. However, artists from ‘marginalized sections’ can perform only at the immediate area inside the temple compound wall. Only artists from the upper castes can perform inside the nalambalam. There were several protests in the past against the long-standing practice of Guruvayur Devaswom not to permit artists belonging to dalit sections and other communities like Ezhavas to play percussion instruments within the temple. There was a protest in November 2020, when Thimila exponent Peringode Chandran was permitted to perform within the ‘Chuttambalam’ area of the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dalit-artist-posted-at-guruvayur-temple/articleshow/85608220.cms||T Ramavarman

Former state president Arun Chaturvedi accused CM Ashok Gehlot of discharging his constitutional duties by not stepping out for his residence. “State is under utter chaos,” said Chaturvedi, while releasing the black paper. The letter reads that Gehlot had promised full loan waiver to farmers and unemployment allowance to youths but has not fulfilled any promises. “Adding to the woes is increase in the power tariff which has made the situation worst for farmers. The government remained busy in carrying out anti-people activities by stopping former government’s social welfare schemes like Jal Swavlambhan and Bhamashah Health schemes,” said Chaturvedi. Highlighting the issue of declining pension and scholarships, the letter mentioned that the schemes related to the most vulnerable lot like elderlies and students have met with a reduction in their financial benefits. The government has stopped rural development by reducing the funds under various schemes. It has underlined the deteriorating law and order situation in the state by calling it a safe den for the mafia, rapists and murderers.

---||Kochi||Kochi: Man suffering from bowel gangrene gets new life||KOCHI: Post-Covid complications are on a rise in the state; recently doctors at the Aster Medcity here have managed to save the life of a 38-year-old patient who was admitted with a massive bowel gangrene, multiple surgeries and sepsis. Patient Farooq V was tested positive for Covid in mid-June, and was admitted to a government hospital with severe abdominal pain and weakness. “Our patient had bowel gangrene, and to save his life a good proportion of the small intestine was removed surgically at the government hospital. As the ends of bowels were not healthy for re-joining together the surgeons there had brought the ends of the bowel as a stoma. However, as it was difficult to maintain him with high output stoma, an early reversal was performed. Though the ends of the intestine were joined, he had leakage from the bowel anastomosis and he became septic, and hence was referred to our hospital,” Dr Prakash K, senior consultant gastro surgery, Aster Medcity, said. According to the doctors, post-Covid blockage of blood vessels to the intestine and massive bowel gangrene is a fatal, but less known complication with a very high mortality rate. During surgery, if a patient has a non-viable bowel for a considerable length, the only option is to remove the dead intestine and it might result in a shortage of length of available healthy intestine for long term survival. A medical team from anaesthesia and critical care headed by Dr Suresh G Nair first succeeded in stabilizing the patient within six days. The next challenge was the leaking intestines, respiratory distress and difficulty sustaining him with nutritional support “The challenges during the surgery to correct his intestinal fistula were multi-fold. Dense adhesions due to sepsis, a short length of intestine leaving no room for additional resection of bowel, suboptimal blood supply to the bowel due to previous blood clots. However, we could identify the fistula, repair it and join the bowel together without further length loss,” Dr Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/man-suffering-from-bowel-gangrene-gets-new-life/articleshow/85605931.cms||---

After Speaker Prem Chand Aggarwal allowed it, under section 58 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly, Deputy Leader of Opposition Karan Mahra said that the BJP had learnt no lessons from the second wave and were not prepared for an imminent third wave. “It is unfortunate that our ruling party MLA colleagues have forgotten the death of legislator Surendra Singh Jeena (who died from Covid-19). No lessons have been learnt from past experiences. The government needs to remember that experts have predicted a third wave,” Mahra said. He also questioned the government on the 1 lakh alleged fake Covid tests that were done during the Haridwar Kumbh. “The government needs to inform people of the action it has taken against people involved in the scam,” said the Congress legislator from Ranikhet. Congress MLA Qazi Nizamuddin asked the government to take the advice of experts to prepare for the third wave. “Financial contribution is being made by legislators and through CSR. The government must also do its part. I lost my mother to Covid-19. Everyone needs to work collectively to fight Covid-19.” Meanwhile, Kedarnath legislator Manoj Rawat, along with other Congress MLAs, demanded to know why equipment bought for public welfare was not being used because of lack of technicians. “In my constituency, a ventilator was bought for Rs 8 lakh and was not used for a long time because there was no one to operate it. Eventually, I came to know it had got damaged,” Rawat said in the House. The health minister said that the state had ramped up the facility to deal with the third wave. “From having only one Oxygen plant earlier, Uttarakhand is now in the process of setting up 88 oxygen plants. Of these, 42 are operational and the rest are expected to start in the next 15 days. Before 2018, the state had 1,193 oxygen cylinders. Now, we have around 18,000 to spare. The number of ambulances has recently been doubled. In 2017, we had 673 oxygen beds and we now have 12,123. In 2017, Uttarakhand had 1,003 doctors and now it has 2,381. Right now, our Covid recovery rate is at 96.7 per cent and death rate down to 2.15 per cent,” Rawat said. He added, “There are roughly 36 lakh children in the state. We are making the arrangements for the third wave as per the suggestions and recommendations of the Centre and I would like to say that we have required a number of beds, oxygen and ICUs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/opp-attacks-bjp-on-covid-mismanagement-health-min-says-ukhand-prepared-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/85603386.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Setback for CBI as Mathews granted anticipatory bail||Thiruvananthapuram: In a major set back to the CBI probing the conspiracy angle behind the infamous ISRO espionage case, the district sessions court here on Tuesday approved the pre-arrest plea filed by retired DGP Siby Mathews, who is arraigned as the fourth accused in the case. The major offences charged against Mathews were kidnapping or abduction, giving or fabricating false evidence and criminal conspiracy. The judge, R Krishna Kumar, held in the order that when the entire case diary and the Justice Jain committee report were carefully perused, he found no materials which would prima facie indicate the ingredients of the offence under section IPC 365 (kidnapping). There is also no materials to show that there was any conspiracy. There is no dispute that all the accused persons were produced before the jurisdictional magistrate within a period of 24 hours and at that time or even thereafter, any of them raised a complaint that they were wrongfully confined or were kidnapped or abducted by the investigation agency. To deny the remedy of pre-arrest bail to a person accused of certain non bailable offences, the investigation agency is expected to show that there are some materials which would prima facie show that the custodial interrogation of the petitioner is utmost necessary for moving further or that if the accused person is released on bail, he would flee from justice or that he would interfere with the course of investigation or at least that such an exercise will be against the larger public interest. However, considering the career trajectory and age of the petitioner, he is unlikely to resort to such measures, the judge held in the order. The judge held that in the event of arrest of the petitioner, the investigating officer is directed to enlarge him on the bail for a period of 60 days, on executing bond for Rs 1 lakh with two solvent sureties on conditions that the petitioner shall not leave the country without the permission of the jurisdictional court; he shall report before the investigating officer for interrogation as and when required; he shall not tamper with evidence or influence the witnesses; he shall not get involved in any offence while on bail and he shall fully cooperate with the investigation, including subjecting himself to the deemed police custody for the purpose of investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/setback-for-cbi-as-mathews-granted-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/85608262.cms||---

Confirming the development, UT adviser Dharam Pal, said the UT administrator approved the cabinet note and accordingly they sent it to MHA. The MHA will further coordinate with power ministry for cabinet’s nod on power privatisation bidding process, he added. Recently, the UT’s empowered committee of power privatisation under the chairmanship of Pal had approved Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution’s highest bid for the privatisation of the electricity department with Rs 817 crore against a reserve price of Rs 174 crore. The administration on August 5 had informed the Punjab and Haryana high court that the process to get cabinet nod for UT’s power privatisation project will take 2-3 months more and submitted that the petition challenging privatisation project is premature. Eminent had defeated giants like Tata and the Adani group. The company is a subsidiary of Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation Ltd, a flagship of RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group. After relief from the Supreme Court, the administration had recently speeded up the project. In June, the apex court had stayed the Punjab and Haryana high court’s May 28 order of staying the privatisation process on the application filed by Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary, UT Powermen Union. The UT had then moved the Supreme Court. Recently, the administration had opened technical bids of all seven companies and submitted the case to the technical bids evaluation committee. The UT was planning to open the bids in the first week of June, but the union had moved the high court. The UT engineering department had issued notice on November 9, 2020, and invited bids for distribution licence in Chandigarh. The bids closed on February 8. On March 8, UT had issued an amendment to the bid document and extended the bidding date to March 18. The amendment also provided an opportunity to new bidders to submit their bids and allowed the existing bidders to modify theirs. Box: 2.47 lakh power consumers in city The electricity department caters to 2.47 lakh consumers divided into nine different categories. According to official figures, of the total consumers, 2.14 lakh are domestic, which accounts for more than 87% of total consumers.

Police registered an FIR against 2-3 unidentified persons under IPC section 332 for voluntarily causing hurt to public servants. “Four to five persons skipped the line of beneficiaries and asked the computer operator to get them vaccinated. When denied, they abused him and held him by the shirt’s collar and even hit him with a chair. When I tried to stop them, they thrashed me. We called police but they did not reach for an hour. When police came, one of them used the policeman’s lathi and hit the staff,” said a nursing staff whose video was circulating on social networking platforms. The nursing staff alleged that the persons who created the ruckus allegedly had support of local councillor Manoj Mudgal. Mudgal denied the allegation, saying he was not present at the spot and did not know the persons who created the ruckus at the vaccination centre. “It is a baseless allegation. I do not know the persons who did this in the hospital. I do not know why nursing staff Om Prakash Jat dragged my name. I was not even present on the spot. I came to know that one person had gone to the vaccination centre and asked the computer operator to verify his mobile number for second dose, but when it was not getting verified, he asked him to try again it but it converted into an altercation between the two,” said Mudgal. Following the incident, the nursing staff and the vaccination team started sloganeering and boycotted work demanding the arrest of the accused. IRD superintendent Dr Vinod Joshi, who was on leave, reached the hospital on a call. “When I reached the hospital, the accused were still creating violence.

The commission has also decided to recommend the names of the police officers for awards to the Union government. The commission observed that they would recommend all the states to take AP as a model to handle the attacks against the SCs. A delegation of NCSC made a whirlwind visit of the state on Tuesday. The team comprising vice-chairman Arun Halder, members Dr Anju Bala and Subhash Pardhi visited the residence of the victim girl and consoled the family members. They interacted with the public representatives and also delegates of political parties. The SC commission reviewed the investigation of the case with the police officials in Guntur and took stock of the overall situation with the chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das and other senior officials in secretariat. Speaking to the media in the Secretariat, the NCSC commission vice-chairman, Arun Halder, observed that the killing of the SC student was very unfortunate. “The response of the state government is really laudable. We can give 200 marks to the government for the speed with which it responded right from the arrest of the accused to the filing of charge sheet under Prevention of Atrocities (SC,ST) Act,” said Halder. He complimented Guntur zone DIG, both urban and rural Superintendents of Police, for their excellent job in investigation. He said that the state government has also granted ex gratia, compensation and other benefits to the victim family within no time of the incident taken place. He said that AP could be a model for other states in handling such cases. NCSC member, Dr Anju Bala, appreciated the measures initiated under the Disha Bill, including the mobile app. She said that they wanted to replicate the model for the protection of the SCs in the state.

The gene therapy drug was administered at Aster MIMS hospital under the supervision of paediatric neurologist Dr Smilu Mohanlal. Hospital authorities said that Mohammed will have to remain at the hospital under observation for a few days. The kid was diagnosed with SMA type 2 and 3, a rare genetic disease that weakens the muscles and leads to walking difficulty, after early childhood. The child had to be given the gene therapy medication before he reached the age of two. The medicine targets the genetic root cause of SMA by replacing the function of the missing or nonworking survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. The new gene tells motor neuron cells to produce more survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Motor neuron cells need SMN protein to survive and support muscle functions. Central government had waived duty for the import of 74.2ml dose of Zolgensma drug for Mohammed’s treatment The family had hoped to collect Rs 18 crore through crowdfunding for the gene therapy treatment; but Rs 46.7 crore was contributed by the people. It was decided to hand over the excess amount to the treatment of other SMA-affected children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/mattool-child-given-sma-drug/articleshow/85608309.cms||---

Also, the commission was directed to prepare a reservation roster under the supervision of an official to be appointed by the commission. Sources said that PGI director Dr Jagat Ram was asked to tender an apology for not abiding by the Central Educational Institutions Act, 2019 and for going against the commission’s directives. Denying the apology, the director said, “This is wrong information. Also, whatever has been asked by the commission will be verified by the Union ministry of health and family welfare before we are asked to implement it.” He was also asked to create a reservation cell within a week where such issues could coordinated as they existed in most national institutes of importance. This has been a longstanding demand of the SC-ST, association which has been unfulfilled till now. As per the Act, the reserved category’s selection for the faculty shall be considered for recruitment on the basis of considering whole institute one unit as per 200 points roster in compliance with the reservation in central educational teachers Cadre act 2019. The new roster will be made in accordance with this act. A special recruitment drive is to be carried out after calculations as per 200 points roster is done and no fresh recruitment should be made till the backlog is cleared. Sources said that the commission asked the director to withdraw the petition they had filed against the commission directive of implementation of the 200-point roster. This was done by the PGI administration without required permission from the ministry and is against the commission. Prior to this, when the commission had asked for personal appearance of the director last month, he had sent Dr Ashok Kumar from the administration on his behalf. However, the commission this time had not granted exemption for personal appearance except in exceptional circumstances. The director had come along with all this three administrative officers, the deputy director administration etc and his entire administrative staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-director-asked-to-fill-reserved-category-posts-since-1997/articleshow/85606101.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Telangana requires 83.5 lakh metric tonnes of paddy for local consumption in a year. Agriculture minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy at a review meeting on Tuesday said that paddy was cultivated in 55 lakh acres this season, with a total expected produce of 1.48 crore tonnes. “Food Corporation of India has already agreed to procure 60 lakh metric tonnes, but we are requesting that they procure an additional 15 lakh tonnes, with 20 lakh metric tonnes to be sold to other states,” he said. Rice exports from the state have good demand in states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala. Telangana, he said, consumes 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice a year. Even though Punjab is one of the largest producers of paddy, the state has no local consumption. The minister advised the civil supplies department to try to construct open paddy storage facilities similar to those seen in north India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-paddy-yield-to-be-1-48-cr-tonnes/articleshow/85608319.cms||---

The startup founded in January 2020 was primarily offering its services in Chennai and this is the first phase of expansion. Currently, over 750 families are benefitting the home care services provided by Alserv. Some of the key services are safety and security, housekeeping and maintenance, food and catering, healthcare and medical and concierge. Alserv will be offering home healthcare & maintenance, sanitisation and cleaning services and pest control services in Kochi for now owing to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. Once, the lockdown restrictions are eased, all their services will be offered in Kochi. The startup has collaborated with over 20+ verified, trusted vendors in Kochi. During the Covid-19, Alserv’s subscribers increased by 500%. Amidst the pandemic, Alserv had launched various Covid relief initiatives for its customers. These initiatives helped over 300 subscribers. Speaking about the first-phase of expansion, Jagadish Ramamoorthy, co-founder & director of Alserv, said: “According to a recent study by national statistics office, Kerala has the highest population of elderly (16.5%) in India. There are about 15,000 to 20,000 retirement homes in India today indicating a wide chasm between the aging population and the number of available homes,” he said. “Furthermore, seniors feel that they don’t have a viable alternative to these distant, investment-heavy communities. With Alserv, everything can be availed at home at a more affordable cost. In fact, we even provide services that are not available in these communities. Our mission is to ensure that seniors are not displaced from their familiar lifestyle and able to enjoy a full life,” he said. “During the pandemic, we received several requests for Alserv’s services to be launched in Kochi. We are excited to launch in Kochi and aim to secure 500 plus families in Kochi by 2022. We will also be launching our services in other cities of Kerala and in other states soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/startup-for-elderly-to-launch-service-in-kochi/articleshow/85606179.cms||---

She said that Chengalikodan nendran, the variety of banana from Thrissur which commands a premium in domestic markets, is one such product to be tried next. “Compared to Europe, there is a sizable population of Thrissur natives in the Middle East and they are the people who got some attachment to the Chengalikodan variety of nendran,” she said. People from other states and countries usually prefer Robusta variety of banana, but it is Malayalis who prefer nendran the most, so where there is a considerable number of Malayalis, Kerala could find an easy market worth tapping, she added. However, farmers and exporters have to adhere to the food quality parameters of the overseas market, which needs a new set of protocols to be followed by farmers. “Trichy-based National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) had developed protocols for the same,” said Elsy. Sivaramakrishnan, CEO-in-charge, VFPCK, said that it is the first time that nendran is being exported. “Malayalis in the Middle East had told us that they were getting a relatively-hardy variety of nendran originating from South Africa at local markets. And when we exported, we had given QR code to ensure traceability of our products. The nendran was sent in a temperature-controlled climate at 12 degrees Celsius. The consignment was sent to the UK and the second one to Kuwait,” he added. Elsy said that other than nendran, we have a handful of other products which are worthy of being exported. “Marayoor jaggery is one such product. With the current style of packaging it could get a shelf-life of two months and with a better packaging, this could be extended,” she added. Some of the unique rice varieties of Kerala could also find buyers in other parts of the world, she said. “Wayanad Jeerakasala rice and Wayanad Gandhakasala rice are two such products. Navara rice, which is cultivated in 12 districts of Kerala, and Vazhakulam pineapple could also find buyers in foreign markets,” Elsy said. According to Elsy, Kerala should explore overseas markets aggressively. “This is because UK and European countries are GI-tagging more than 40 products in India to explore our domestic markets. Hence it is ripe time for us to explore the European markets with our own GI food products,” she said. Moreover, when the domestic prices are low, the export markets could fetch a decent price for the growers, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/export-opportunities-for-keralas-gi-foods/articleshow/85608379.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Goa||Include topographic maps in coastal zone plan to prevent disasters in Goa: Greens||MARGAO: A cause of concern for environmentalists is that while the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) has used toposheets to prepare the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP), the agency has carried out no independent study to determine the state’s coastal geomorphology. Environmentalists are of the view that this renders the draft plan inadequate as dressing or altering sand dunes, hills, natural features, including landscape changes for beautification, recreation and other such purposes, is among the prohibited activities within the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) as per the CRZ notification 2011. This and other related shortcomings of the plan were pointed out in a written submission made by Roshan Mathias, who stressed on the need for incorporating topographic maps in the plan. “Hilly areas and natural features are prohibited from being altered as per the CRZ notification 2011. These have to be identified and marked by using topographic sheets. If not, this will be difficult to be identified in the currently prepared draft maps as everything looks like it is a one level terrain. The NCSCM used the toposheets only to extract the High Water Line (HWL) and Low Water Line (LWL), not for extracting topography or contours,” Mathias said. Explaining how it will have an adverse impact on the coastal environment, Mathias said, “Permissions may wrongly be granted due to this and will be in direct violation/contravention to the CRZ Notification 2011. It will also lead to disaster of the coastal areas due to erosion, change in land use, etc.” Giving instances to drive home his point, Mathias pointed out to hilly areas within CRZ on beach fronts in Tiracol, Keri, Arambol, Mandrem, Ashvem, Chapora, Vagator, Arpora-Baga, Aguada, Dona Paula, Mormugao, Pequeno (Island), Bogmalo, Cabo De Rama and Canacona. Further pointing out the absence of any definition for hills or slopes in the CRZ notification, Mathias said, “The closest definition can be found in the Goa TCP Act, which has considered sloppy lands as those having gradients of 1:10 and more. These lands have been distinctly earmarked as sensitive areas in the Regional Plans 2021 of Goa. But there is no record of sloppy lands below 1:10 gradient, which is required to be identified in the case of coastal areas.” He said that with no topography marked on CZMP, “It is not possible to identify slopes, especially at the time when applications come to the department for development on such plots on hills/sloppy lands and natural features.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/include-topographic-maps-in-coastal-zone-plan-to-prevent-disasters-greens/articleshow/85606219.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Illegal’ land survey: Farmers fume as probe yet to start||HANUMAKONDA: Hundreds of farmers from Arepally and Paidipally villages continued their protest on Tuesday against an illegal survey of their agriculture land allegedly by staff of a Pune-based firm. They raised slogans against the illegal land pooling survey and took out a rally from the village centre to a Hanuman temple where each farmer broke 108 coconuts. The protest began last week after the ‘surveyors’ fled when confronted by the villagers, subsequently leading to a temporary blockade of nearby National Highway and petition to collectors of Hanumakonda and Warangal districts on Monday. The two collectors have ordered a probe into the survey. On Tuesday, however, an enquiry by TOI revealed that the RDOs were yet to get the representation submitted by the farmers to the collectors. Hanumakonda RDO and in-charge DRO Vasu Chandra said that the farmers had explained the matter to the collectors during a grievance hearing on Monday, but the file had not come through to the department. Chandra said that they would take up the matter once they receive the relevant instructions from the collector’s office. With no clear answers from anyone on the matter, villagers have been in a state of panic over their land. Two villages have formed a united farmers front and its convenor Budde Peddanna stated that Kakatiya Urban Development Authority (KUDA) and revenue officials were not even responding to their pleas to investigate the alleged illegal land pooling survey in the villages. “We request officials to take up the inquiry immediately and take action against those behind this illegal survey,” Pedanna said. Earlier on Monday, farmers had tied rakhis to their crops as mark of protest against the survey. Meanwhile, Warangal district collector M Haritha said that the KUDA proposal will be taken up only with consent of farmers in order to conduct a land pooling survey.

According to forest veterinarian Dr David Abraham, it was rarely that an injured hornbill, which is the state bird of Kerala and belonging to the endangered species included in the Schedule One category of Wild Life Protection Act, was treated and rehabilitated. The bird was located in a weak condition on the roadside at Nelliampathy on July 16, by the residents, said Krishnadas, forest range officer of Nelliampathy. The residents handed over the bird to the local forest officials. It was raining on that day and the forest officials dried it with a drier borrowed from a nearby salon. Subsequently it was taken to the local veterinary clinic and the officials there suggested it be taken to the rehabilitation centre at Akamala. “It was suffering from minor injuries on the chest. It was off feed initially. But we supported it by giving fluid at every hour during the day and night. It started lifting its head after three days, on the fourth day it started taking solid food. Fruits and berries were given in the morning and evening, while non-vegetarian at noon. First we supplied cooked chicken and later raw meat was added to the diet and we continued the treatment. We decided to release it, after ensuring that it will be able to fly on its own,” said Dr David.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/injured-baby-hornbill-released-after-month-long-treatment/articleshow/85608425.cms||T Ramavarman

The state government told the high court that it would pay Rs 756 crore within the next one week and the balance would be paid once it received funds from the Union government. The high court had earlier summoned principal secretary, panchayat raj, Gopala Krishna Dwivedi, commissioner, Girija Shankar and principal secretary, finance, S S Rawat, to appear in person for failing to implement the court orders. Dwivedi and Rawat appeared before the court on Tuesday while Shankar sought permission to dispense with appearance on personal grounds. Special government pleader, C Sumon, and Dwivedi told the HC that they have received Rs 571 crore from the Centre and will make payments by adding the state government’s share of Rs 185 crore in the next one week for works valued above Rs 5 lakh. They said the balance amount, Rs 361 crore out of total Rs 1117 crore, would be paid once they received additional funds from the Centre. Sumon said that they have deposited Rs 413 crore in the accounts of respective panchayats towards payment of works valued under Rs 5 lakh. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya recorded the details submitted by the state government and asked it to file a detailed affidavit with payment details. The high court further said that it was the responsibility of the state government to ensure that the payments were made to the contractors who did works under MGNREGS instead of releasing funds to respective panchayats. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsels P Veera Reddy and Dammalapati Srinivas told the bench that though the state government stated that they have released Rs 413 crore, the contractors have not received any money. They sought directions to the state government to ensure that payments are made to those who did the work. The HC considered their request and directed the officials to ensure contractors get the money they are entitled to. Assistant solicitor general, N Haranath, told the high court that the Union government released Rs 571 crore with a pre-condition that the state government should clear pending payments. He said that the state government had unspent amount of Rs 1991 crore as on April and Rs 5 crore as on August 4. The high court directed the Centre to file an affidavit with details about the funds released so far and by when the additional funds will be given to the state of Andhra Pradesh and posted further hearing to September 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-seeks-report-from-state-govt-on-pending-nregs-funds/articleshow/85606151.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Sources said Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw proposed the plan to the group of ministers on infrastructure on Tuesday. Union minister Nitin Gadkari chaired the meeting where issues relating to environmental clearance, land availability and transfer of land for infrastructure projects were discussed. Officials said Vaishnaw said his ministry will come up with a policy on the payment that they charge for transfer of land to other departments building infrastructure. According to an official statement, Vaishnaw talked about the importance of new technologies and financial models for railway infrastructure enhancement and also offered to work in close coordination with the highways ministry on similar lines. "He added that he would like to examine the feasibility of working out a plan to lay the railway lines along the highways in the already acquired land in order to make the projects viable," the release said. TOI has learnt that the environment ministry officials, while dismissing the charge of delaying environment and forest clearances, flagged how the departments concerned were not putting up complete details for seeking such approvals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/railways-may-let-private-players-lay-tracks-collect-revenue/articleshow/85611524.cms||Dipak K Dash

The decision was taken after two back-to-back meetings conducted by the NHAI officials with the protestors on Tuesday evening. On Tuesday morning there were huge protests at the toll plaza after the NHAI started collecting the toll from 8 am onwards. While Rs 70 was charged from light motor vehicles with FASTag, Rs 140 was levied from those without the FASTag. This soon made way for huge protests in which local leaders from all major political fronts joined. Kovalam MLA M Vincent also turned up for the protests following which the NHAI officials decided to hold talks with the protesters. The first round of discussions was held at around 4pm and concluded without finding any resolve.  During the second round of the meeting, which started around 7pm and went on for over an hour, the NHAI project director held talks with the authorities of the construction firm that carried out the works of the highway bypass and put forward a suggestion that free passes can be granted to residents within five-km radius of the toll plaza. This comprises residents of eight villages. To avail the free pass, the motorists have to produce the registration certificate of the vehicle or residency proof, including voters’ ID card or driving license.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nhai-free-pass-to-motorists-living-within-5km-radius/articleshow/85606285.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ban on new trade licences hits investments in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Hundreds of applicants have been left in the lurch in the absence of a uniform policy to issue trade licenses for commercial activities on the major sector roads in residential areas. The corporations are inviting applications for fresh trade licenses from business owners through its portal. Moreover, many other departments are issuing licenses for commercial activities in residential areas. However, as ambiguity prevails due to lack of transparency, investment and efforts of many investors are going in vain. The local self government (LSG) department in January, 2017 had given directions that no fresh trade license will be issued to commercial activities operating in residential areas. The corporations were also directed only to renew trade licenses of commercial activities operating in residential areas before 2017. An official source at Greater Municipal Corporation said, “Despite the ban, many establishments have come up in residential areas. Due to this, the state government is losing crores of revenue every year. A letter was sent to the LSG last year to issue licenses to hotels, restaurants and cafes etc. operating on major sector roads of residential areas as it is pending from almost four years.” A trade license is necessary to operate businesses and to get similar licenses from other government agencies. However, some of the government agencies have started issuing licenses leading to revenue loss to the corporation. A business owner said, “The government should not accept applications if trade licenses are not issued by corporation. Several businesses are being operated in residential premises without obtaining a valid trade license from the local bodies. Serious traders should not be discouraged.” However, the government still does not seem to be in favour of granting trade licenses to business activities operating in residential areas. “Be 60ft road or 200ft road, if commercial activity is being done in residential areas, then a trade license cannot be issued,” urban housing development minister Shanti Dhariwal said. The corporation, on the other hand, has asked the local LSG department for approval for trade license with a condition that it does not convert land use from residential to commercial status and application for commercial land use have to be moved by the business owner during license term. “We are trying to work within the rules and regulations and take up such issues under ‘Prashashan Sheharo ke Sang’ so that people can be given permit to run their business especially in Covid pandemic era,” a senior LSG department official said. A source said the ban imposed by department of local bodies (DLB) on granting such trade license had already been lifted by the UDH minister Shrichand Kriplani, but formal orders have not been issued. “Since then such establishments are operational but have not remitted license fee,” he added. According to officials, the state government had permitted to run commercial activities on 60ft road in residential areas of cities like Jaipur and 40ft road in smaller cities and trade license is issued if the land use is converted to commercial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ban-on-new-trade-licences-hits-investments-in-jaipur/articleshow/85608394.cms||---

The corporation officials are pooling together around 100 more applications. The town planning adalats had always put the officials in a fix since many of the applications would be put off owing to deviation from norms or because of the fact that permits would be sought in violation of zoning norms or completion certificate sought for constructions done in violation of building rules. During the tenure of previous government, nearly 10 applications that had surfaced in the adalat pertained to violation of zoning regulations or demand for compromising on provisions laid down either in master plan or town planning schemes. In majority of the cases, the corporation was asked to go by the demand in a way rendering zonal regulations and development plans earmarked in master plan and town planning schemes useless. One of the applications received was regarding construction on a plot under the Vizhinjam-Kovalam area development scheme. According to the minutes, the adalat convened by the minister decided to direct the council to change the provision of the scheme in such a way that permit could be granted to single residential houses upto 300 sq.m in agricultural zone. There were also decisions to give occupancy certificates to constructions which came up on land proposed for future road widening as per master plan. The minutes said construction may be given occupancies on the condition that the owner will demolish in case of road widening in the future. Another application was for granting occupancy in an area which was reserved for parks and open spaces. The adalat had decided that if there are other constructions in the same place for which occupancy has been given, this one also can be considered. In order to deal with such applications, the corporation introduced a new system by which the applicant will have to fill in a form detailing the known reasons for which the application was either rejected or not settled within the time frame.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/town-planning-adalat-sees-fewer-applicants/articleshow/85606349.cms||---

DCP (west) Richa Tomar told TOI that police were examining the role of the girl’s friend who had dropped her at the place following which she was waylaid and raped. The girl was returning from a party in the boy’s car and following a tiff, the boy asked her to leave his car at a secluded place and drove away. The girl was walking alone when the accused abducted her before taking turns to rape her. Police had arrested one Prem Singh from UP on Monday, the other accused Sukh Lal, remains at large. Additional DCP (East) Ram Singh said police teams had conducted a door-to-door survey in pursuit of the suspects, based on the description provided by the girl. “It was a blind case because there was no clue about the two accused. What we did know was that there were a lot of cement factories in that location. Workers from different cities come here to work there. So, we conducted a widespread search and zeroed in the two suspects.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gang-rape-cops-may-act-against-male-friend/articleshow/85608446.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Dalit Bandhu has got nothing to do with Huzurabad bypoll: KTR||Hyderabad: Claiming that Dalit Bandhu scheme was not taken up by the government only to win the forthcoming Huzurabad bypolls, TRS working president KT Rama Rao said Huzurabad election was a ‘small issue’ for the party. He said the government will not fall or come to power at the Centre with the election outcome. He said the general elections are a good two-and-a-half years away. He also said the party did not discuss the Huzurabad bypolls at the state executive meeting on Tuesday. The party will take a call and work out a strategy after a poll notification is issued, he said. “We have confidence that people of Huzurabad will bless us again. The TRS had won MPTC and ZPTC polls immediately after its launch in 2001. Former minister Eatala Rajender joined the TRS in 2003,” KTR reminded. Taking a dig at the opposition parties, especially Congress and BJP, he dared them to implement Dalit Bandhu and other welfare schemes in their party-ruled states. KTR also said both the parties had ruled the country for 75 years but failed to provide even drinking water and electricity to people. Asserting that Dalit Bandhu was taken up on a pilot basis for upliftment of Dalits since they have been at the bottom of the pyramid in the country, KTR said: “The CM wants Dalit Bandhu scheme to be the torchbearer for the entire country and is keen to make the scheme a big success.” KTR said the TRS was unperturbed by the criticism of the opposition parties and added that the Centre, on many occasions, had gone on record praising Telangana’s schemes. At the meeting, TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao said the government will be in power for next 20 years. He asked the party cadre to take the government schemes to the doorsteps of people. He said the government will roll out various schemes on the lines of Dalit Bandhu for BCs, poor in upper castes, other castes and economically weaker sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dalit-bandhu-has-got-nothing-to-do-with-huzurabad-bypoll-ktr/articleshow/85608422.cms||Koride Mahesh

Residents of various villages in Sattari taluka have started organising meetings against the bill and have pledged to take an active part in the agitations, pointing out that their land ownership issue has been unresolved for decades. In a recent meeting held at Caranzol, the locals said that the bill passed recently by the state government is not in the interest of Sattari people and demanded that the bill be repealed immediately. Harishchandra Gawas, president of Sattari Bhumiputra Sanghatana, said, “The agitation has been going on at various parts in Sattari for the last several years on the issue of land ownership. However, neither the previous government nor the present government has paid heed to these issues. Currently, there is a commotion in Goa over the Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill. Instead, the government should pass a bill on the issue of land ownership.” History lecturer Prajal Sakhardande said that it is a real shame that no government has resolved the issue of land ownership in Sattari taluka since Goa’s Liberation. “If the government really wants to look after the interests of Goan people, then the bill should be repealed and a new bill should be introduced in the Assembly to resolve the issue of land ownership in Goa,” he said. Vishwesh Prabhu, Ganpat Zarmekar, Batu Gawde and others expressed their views at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-protest-till-bhumiputra-bill-is-scrapped-sattari-locals/articleshow/85606343.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Pak, Kashmir storm in Punjab: Amarinder camp’s ministers, MLAs demand action against Sidhu’s advisers for remarks||Chandigarh: After 32 MLAs and cabinet ministers of Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s camp revolted against chief minister Amarinder Singh, five cabinet ministers and an MLA from the latter’s group have urged the party high command to take “strong action under the law” against Sidhu’s two advisers for “anti-national and pro-Pakistan” comments. They said the statements of both these newly appointed advisers — Malwinder Singh Mali and Payre Lal Garg — were clearly against India’s interests and detrimental to national security. The cabinet ministers include Brahm Mohindra, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot. Congress MLA from Amritsar West Raj Kumar Verka also sought action against the two advisers. Besides stringent legal action against Mali and Garg, they also urged the Congress leadership to direct Sidhu to immediately rein in his aides in the interest of the party as well as the country. “The Congress has made many sacrifices for the nation’s security and peace, as have our soldiers at the borders. Nobody can or should be allowed to undermine these sacrifices and jeopardise the safety of our country and its people,” they emphasised. This group also questioned Sidhu’s failure to put his foot down on such anti-national and pro-Pakistan diatribe by his close aides, despite the justified uproar it has triggered across party lines. They pointed out that Sidhu’s omission in this regard had given ammunition to the opposition parties, who were quick to recall the PPCC president’s own bonhomie with the Pakistan prime minister and Army chief. They also warned Sidhu against the massive damage it could cause to the Congress in the run-up to the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, which are due early next year. These Congress legislators termed Mali’s statement on Kashmir a dangerous and unacceptable deviation from India’s stated position on Jammy and Kashmir. By questioning the unanimous 1994 resolution of the Parliament declaring Jammu and Kashmir as an integral part of India, Mali had blatantly toed the line of Pakistan, which had been trying to stake claim to the region and was in illegal occupation of certain areas, they added. These ministers and MLA added that Garg’s statement countering the chief minister’s criticism of Pakistan reflected strong pro-Pakistan leanings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pak-kashmir-storm-in-punjab-amarinder-camps-ministers-mlas-demand-action-against-sidhus-advisers-for-remarks/articleshow/85608491.cms||---

UNESCO India director Eric Falt on Tuesday met tourism secretary Gayatri Rathore to review the work and lay out the way forward for the project intended also to boost tourism and empower the artist community.“We had a detailed discussion on the works already done and the way forward.

National BC Welfare Association president R Krishnaiah, Congress veteran V Hanumanth Rao, Telangana Jana Samithi founder M Kodandaram, AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan, members from CPI, CPM and over 50 BC associations participated in the BC Maha Deeksha held at Dharna Sthal in Hyderabad demanding BC Bandhu scheme.

He demanded that KCR should lead an all-party delegation along with BC leaders to meet PM Modi in Delhi and prevail upon him to introduce a bill in Parliament to extend 50% political reservations to BCs in state assemblies and Parliament. The deeksha also demanded the TRS government immediately take back 7,651 field assistants who were removed from their jobs. “There are over 2,000 BCs, 3,000 SCs and 1,800 STs among field assistants ousted from employment,” Krishnaiah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/calls-grow-louder-for-bc-bandhu-scheme/articleshow/85608492.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||CMO claims 7 who took part in controversial meeting still with Capt||Chandigarh: The Punjab chief minister’s office claimed late on Tuesday evening that at least six party MLAs and one former MLA, who were purported to have been party to the demand for chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s removal, have ‘completely and categorically disassociated’ themselves from any such move. There was no reaction from the chief minister on the issue. The press statement issued by the CMO said that the Congress leaders who have distanced themselves from the “so-called festering revolt in the party” are MLAs Kuldeep Vaid, Dalvir Singh Goldie, Santokh Singh Bhalaipur, Angad Singh, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Gurkirat Singh Kotli and former MLA Ajit Singh Mofar. Denying outright being part of what they termed as ‘a conspiracy hatched by a section engaged in trying to drive a wedge within the party’, these seven leaders have thrown their weight behind the chief minister and reposed their full faith in his leadership, it claimed.All seven of them said the closed-door meeting held at panchayat and rural development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s residence, after which their names were fraudulently released along with others, had been convened to discuss party affairs. Some of the participants tried to raise the issue of the chief minister’s replacement but, contrary to claims, no unanimous resolution was passed or agreed upon, claimed the CMO. Mofar said he did not even attend the meeting and had merely gone to meet one of the cabinet ministers present there. He said he was shocked to see his name being touted as one of those seeking Amarinder’s removal. Vaid made it clear he was “not part of any such conspiracy against the chief minister,” according to the press release. The CMO claimed that Angad said he had gone to the meeting to discuss cooperative elections in his constituency, and that Warring said he was not even aware of any such discussion being held during the meeting. The CMO said that all seven of them condemned the attempts by a section of the Punjab Congress to trigger revolt in the party ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, especially when the high command had already resolved the differences between Sidhu and Amarinder. They urged the party leadership to take immediate steps to quell any attempts to divide the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cmo-claims-7-who-took-part-in-controversial-meeting-still-with-capt/articleshow/85608648.cms||---

The DGC (criminal), who is monitoring the prosecution part in the MP-MLA court in this case, also provided the current status of the case against the BSP MP from Ghosi, who is lodged in Naini jail. He said, “Apart from the complainant and Suraj, the statement of other witnesses including former station officer of Varanasi’s Lanka police station Bharat Bhushan Tiwari, investigation officer and sub-inspector RC Pandey, head constable Raghav Rai, Dr Rashmi Gupta, constable Priti Rawat, Amit Srivastava and Shiv Kumar Gaud, the security guard of the apartment where the alleged incident took place, have already been recorded before the MP-MLA court.” “Now, the process of recording the statement of the accused at MP-MLA court is due,” he added. The complainant and Suraj had set themselves on fire outside the Supreme Court on August 16 after levelling serious allegations against the police and other authorities, including DIG Amit Pathak, retired IG Amitabh Thakur and a judge of conspiring against her. The incident resulted in massive action and former Varanasi SSP Amit Pathak was attached to DGP headquarters by the state home department. The in charge of the Cantonment police station in Varanasi, Inspector Rakesh Singh and sub-inspector Girijashanker Yadav were suspended and the state government formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe into the self-immolation case. Former circle officer Bhelupur Amaresh Singh Baghel was suspended by the state government on December 30, 2020, for performing laxity in investigation in the rape case after parts of his investigation report had leaked, showing the BSP MP as a victim of a conspiracy hatched by a jailed gangster. Alleging that on March 7, 2018, Atul Rai had raped her after calling her to his apartment, the woman had lodged a rape case against him on May 1, 2019, with the Lanka police station. Atul Rai, who had filed nomination as BSP candidate from Ghosi parliamentary seat, won the elections as an absconder and later surrendered before court on June 22, 2019, and has been in jail since then. Police had filed a chargesheet against Rai and hearing in the case was taking place at MP-MLA court at Prayagraj. Atul Rai’s brother Pawan Kumar lodged a complaint in November 2020 with the Cantonment police station of Varanasi, accusing the woman of having forged her date of birth in documents attached to her rape complaint. A non-bailable warrant was issued against the woman and her companion in this case by the Varanasi court in August first week. Before it, the complainant had also filed one more case against the jailed MP and his companion Sudhir Singh with the Lanka police in December 2020, accusing the two of defaming her through propaganda on social media. Meanwhile, the complainant’s grandfather in his village in Narahi area of Ballia district had no idea regarding her death in Delhi till Tuesday late evening as he said he or his family members had not received any call from her mother, who was staying in Delhi. He said that for the past two years, the complainant had not visited her parental village after she lodged the case. “The police had once arrived here to confirm whether she belonged to this place. But, without telling the purpose of their visit, the cops returned,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/legal-problems-for-bsp-mp-to-increase-after-death-of-complainant-witness/articleshow/85608573.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The drivers of the two vehicles claim that despite repeated requests to senior officials in the district health department, the payment for fuel and maintenance remains pending due to which the hearses have been standing still outside the district hospital for the past one month. While one of the vans is used to ferry bodies from the district hospital to the mortuary and elsewhere, the second one is under the office of the chief medical officer. Asked why the hearses are not functional, driver Santosh Tiwari told the media, “It’s been over 20 days now. Senior officials were informed but they said that the vans can be left standing. When we are not getting the diesel, how are we going to run them.” Of the two hearses, the one parked just outside the district hospital has most of its tyres punctured and drivers say that even if they are repaired. Sources say the bills are outstanding due to a huge amount of payment pending to be paid by the health department for the different vehicles put into use during the second wave of Covid. When contacted, CMO Sunil Sharma told TOI that he was not aware of the issue but will order an inquiry into the same. “The hearses will run if there are bodies. There is no lack of funds. In Noida, the advantage is that there are many parties ready to donate via CSR funds,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/payment-delayed-2-govt-hearses-gather-dust/articleshow/85608561.cms||Shikha Salaria

---||Chandigarh||Explain remarks on Pak, Kashmir: Nadda to Cong||New Delhi: BJP President JP Nadda and other party functionaries on Tuesday asked the Congress leadership to explain their stand on remarks made by their Punjab leaders about Kashmir and Pakistan which, the party said, reflected the opposition outfit’s divisive and ‘anti-India’ approach. In a series of tweets, Nadda said silence on the matter will be seen as “implicit support” to such objectionable remarks. “Recent comments by Punjab Congress leaders, who enjoy the patronage of the topmost state leadership as well as the High Command in Delhi, are reprehensible. They are repeatedly making irresponsible statements that have grave implications on national security,” the BJP chief said. Comments by two advisors of Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu have stoked a controversy. Malvinder Singh Mali had claimed that, "Kashmir is a country of Kashmiri people" while another advisor, Pyare Lal Garg, had taken a swipe at Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for criticising Pakistan, alleging it is not in Punjab's interest. The BJP president added, “I would urge the topmost national leadership of Congress to state clearly whether they support the remarks on Kashmir and Pakistan made by Congress leaders in Punjab? Silence on the matter will be seen as implicit support to such objectionable remarks.” Later addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters, party spokesperson Sambit Patra said such remarks could not have been made by the Congress leaders without the approval of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. “The remarks made by advisors of the Punjab Congress chief clearly show that the party has a divisive and anti-India approach towards Kashmir,” Patra said. Taking on Congress over Garg’s remark that Pakistan should not be criticised, Patra said that "these people earn their livelihood in India but sing Pakistan's tune”. The BJP leader also asked why Sidhu, who hugged the Pakistan Army Chief, had been made Congress'' Punjab unit chief and "on whose behest”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/explain-remarks-on-pak-kashmir-nadda-to-cong/articleshow/85608810.cms||---

The victim is Pramod Saini, 34, a resident of Chiloda, who is a corporal posted at the South Western Air Command in Gandhinagar. He was trying to get a refund for a cancelled railway ticket. Saini said that on July 4 he had attempted to book a railway ticket from Delhi to Guwahati using the app of the IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation). Even though the ticket could not be booked, Rs 2,644 was debited from his State Bank of India account. Later, Saini called up the customer care number of the IRCTC to inquire about the matter. He was told that as the server was down, his ticket could not be booked and he will get his money back in a week, mentioned the FIR filed with Chiloda police. He did not get the money till July 11, so he again called the IRCTC customer care number. He was told that the money had been released and he should now contact his bank to determine what had happened. To talk with a bank representative, Saini said he called the official customer care number of SBI. But his call was diverted to an online scammer from West Bengal, police said. The cyber crook posed as a bank representative and told Saini that he would connect Saini with a senior. The so-called senior functionary told Saini that a transaction had taken place due to which his money refund could not be completed. He told Saini that he would send a code which Saini must share to receive the refund. Saini sent the code after which Rs 49,010 was debited from his account. Saini was soon logged out of his UPI (Unified Payments Interface) app with which he had paid for the ticket. The UPI account was locked for 24 hours, he said in the FIR. Saini went to his bank and obtained a statement from which he came to know that Rs 4,999 was also debited from his account. He had filed a plea with cybercrime police on July 11 and over a month later Chiloda police filed a complaint of fraud under the Information Technology Act. An SBI official denied the possibility of a call to the bank’s customer care service getting forwarded to any other number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iaf-mans-bank-call-hijacked/articleshow/85606552.cms||Ashish Chauhan

One kg onion was on Tuesday sold in the range of Rs7 to Rs19 per kg as against Rs10 to Rs20 per kg on the same day last week. Similarly, potato was sold in the range of Rs7-13 per kg as against Rs10-16 per kg last week. The rates of other vegetables, such as cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, okra and cabbage, have dropped in the range of 10-20% compared to the rates last week (see graphic), an APMC official said. Madhukant Garad, chief administrator of Market Yard, told TOI, “We are receiving excessive harvest from Pune and its neighbouring districts during the past few days. As a result, prices of almost all vegetables have come down.” Garad said, “Vegetables in the rainy season get spoiled due to the excessive rainfall. But rainfall has been low this August. Many growers could manage to water their crops in the right quantity. As a result, they have got bumper harvest. This led to the fall in prices. But the scenario is likely to change in the next few days.” A similar trend was observed in terms of the rates of leafy vegetables.A bunch of coriander was sold for as low as Rs2 per bunch on Tuesday. A fortnight ago, it was sold in the range of Rs 12 to Rs 20. A bunch of fenugreek and spinach was sold for Rs4-6. Dutta Kalamkar, head of vegetables section of the Market Yard, said, “We had an intake of 1.18 lakh bunches of coriander alone on Tuesday.

That is why, I came to the hospital for her check-up and also to thank to the medical team personally for the kind of care they have given to my mother,” Lovlina told TOI. Her mother Mamoni Borgohain (45) had undergone a kidney transplant surgery at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) on February 15 this year. A medical team under the hospital’s nephrology head, Deepak Shankar Ray, had conducted the surgery. “On that day, after the surgery was over, I managed to see my mother once while she was being wheeled out of the OT. I left for Delhi to resume my training for the Olympics. I am really happy with the recovery of my mother,” said the boxer. “I broke down in joy. I am lucky that I have three strong daughters and the other two are in the paramilitary forces. I draw a lot of energy and motivation from them,” said her mother, Mamoni. Lovlina is being accompanied by her father Tiken and a cousin. The family will leave for Guwahati on Thursday. And before she heads for Delhi from Assam, she is planning to visit a few places in Assam to meet school children to encourage them to take up sports. “This was the first follow-up that kidney recipients should do after six months of the surgery. All the reports of the patient are fine and we are satisfied with the progress,” said Ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/olympic-medallist-lovlina-in-city-for-moms-post-surgery-check-up/articleshow/85606598.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Mishra said that the report filed in the Bikru case will be investigated if the BSP government is formed in the state. “The report filed is based on falsehood. In the name of the Bikru scandal, massacre was done wherein innocent Brahmins were killed,” said Mishra. He said, “Khushi Dubey was widowed before the colour of ‘mehandi’ faded off her hands. Dalits and Brahmins both are being targeted and subjected to torture and atrocities across the state.” Mishra further said, “BJP is cheating people in the name of Ram Mandir. Corruption worth several crores was done in the name of development. BJP has no account of the donations received in the name of Ram Mandir. After the decision of the Supreme Court, on August 8 five gold bricks were worshipped. Where did these bricks go? Claims are being made for the completion of the foundation work of Ram temple. Truth is that no such development has been carried out.” BJP people don’t take Ram’s name, they take Ram’s name only for votes. In that too, they forget Sita, he added. He asked the people, “You all have seen the Samajwadi government. What was your status there?” And said that when the SP came into power, atrocities increased and riots broke out. Similarly, after the formation of the BJP government in 2017, young children of five Brahmins were brutally murdered in Rae Bareli.” “So far, more than 400 Brahmins have been murdered by this government,” he added. BJP had promised to provide two crore jobs every year. “In fact, several crore people are losing their jobs here every year. This government is working hand-in-glove with some capitalists,” said Mishra adding, “Farmers have been protesting for a year. Their grievances are not being redressed.” He said, more than 5,000 farmers have died during the protest and despite that their demands were not accepted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/innocent-brahmins-killed-in-name-of-bikru-scandal-mishra/articleshow/85608724.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

At least three multiplex brands — Inox Leisure, Carnival Cinemas and PVR Limited — have introduced home delivery of food in major cities where multiplexes have been allowed to operate. In Maharashtra, where cinemas are still shut, food delivery service from multiplexes is likely to start when the properties get the permission to reopen. Select multiplex majors have, however, started food home delivery in Pune and Mumbai, where they have cloud kitchens or a food court outside the multiplex property. Multiplexes have tied up with food aggregators such as Swiggy and Zomato to home deliver their products like caramelized popcorn, sandwiches, burgers, fries and shakes for the consumers. Dinesh Hariharan, vice-president (F&B operations) INOX Leisure Limited, said, “Food home 1deliveries began from Inox’s B1und Garden Road food court on Monday. Once all the five properties in Pune reopen, food delivery will start from there too. Currently, we are live in 45 cities (in 14 states) in India where multiplexes have been allowed to reopen. We have started food home delivery from all those locations, including Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. We are planning to start this service across Maharashtra once cinemas reopen in the state.” INOX started food home delivery from its outlet in Bund Garden, which is located near its multiplex property in the city. The place is likely to serve as a food court as well. Shrikant Bhasi, founder and chairman, Carnival Cinemas, told TOI, “We have started home delivery of our branded food items in Mumbai, while we plan to start it in Kolkata from September 1.We have region-wise cloud kitchens: for instance, the West Bengal region is catered to from Kolkata, while parts of the Maharashtra markets are catered to from Mumbai. We have started the initiative through cloud kitchens in some cities, including Mumbai, where multiplexes are still shut.” Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Ltd, told TOI, “We have tied up with Zomato and Swiggy to home-deliver cinema staples, such as popcorn, nachos, fries and products like American hotdogs, loaded nachos, loaded fries, gourmet burgers, sandwiches and mini meals. These are home-delivered from our cinema kitchens in 17 markets where multiplexes have been allowed to open. They are prepared by our team of chefs. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/multiplexes-begin-home-delivery-of-food-beverages/articleshow/85606597.cms||Neha Madaan

The university on August 18 announced a reduction of fees for different categories. S K Jain, president of the Shikshan Prasarak Mandali, said there is agreement among college managements that students must not be charged for unused facilities. “However, students have failed to pay fees for the previous year as well, causing losses to colleges. We expect about Rs1 crore in fees from students for the previous year. If this amount is not paid, it will be difficult to run the institutions,” said Jain. An official from the management of a college said that cleanliness, electricity bills, water bills among other recurring expenses needed to be met. Either the fee relaxation should be withdrawn or some provision should be made to ensure that the students’ pending dues are cleared, said the official. Educationist Nandkumar Nikam said that while many families suffered due to the pandemic, there are some who can afford to pay fees and are avoiding it. “Online education is going on. To continue with virtual classes, it is important that the students pay the dues,” said Nikam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-want-sppu-to-review-fees-decision/articleshow/85606634.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

He hired an auto rickshaw from Banur in which six to seven people were already sitting. When the auto reached a traffic signal on the airport road, one of the passengers said “they would get him arrested as he was a drug runner”.

A division bench of justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and justice B Pugalendhi, referring to a report filed by the commissioner of HR&CE disclosing that several thousand committees had been formed to retrieve the lost lands, said they were proceeding at a snail’s pace. Complying with comprehensive directions issued by courts in 2018, the report said two committees -- identifying committee and scrutinizing committee – had been formed for all temples. As of September 2020, as many as 42,674 committees had been constituted and they were entrusted with the works of identifying the lands, encroachments and third-party occupation. The judges took note of the fact that out of 38,655 temples, properties of 10,586 temples had been identified by the identification committees. Based on the report of the scrutinizing committees, 41,664 demand notices were served on the lessees / tenants / other occupants, who failed to remit the dues. While 13,660 lessees / tenants have remitted the dues, legal actions were initiated against the defaulters. Steps are underway to upload the details of temple properties in the web portal. The judges observed that from the report it appears that approximately 5.17 lakh acres of immovable properties belong to temples as per the database. But, the extent of available temple properties is disclosed as 4.78 lakh acres, which means, the remaining around 39,000 acres of land are in the hands of encroachers, observed the judges. "All that this court can say is that the rock has moved a bit, instead of saying that nothing has moved. No doubt, something is always better than nothing. At the same time, the pace at which the implementation is going on needs to be increased," observed the judges, adding that the authorities need to realize that still nearly 39,000 acres of land were still in the hands of encroachers. "Courts have time and again observed that temples in Tamil Nadu are not only a source of identification of the ancient culture, but also a testimony of pride and knowledge of the talent in the field of arts, science and sculpture and a conduit for spiritual activities as well. The properties of the religious institutions, more particularly the temples, have to be maintained properly in order to derive more income to spend for their betterment," they said. The court made these observations while disposing of a petition filed by A Radhakrishnan who sought to safeguard the properties of Sankara Rameswarar and Vaikundapathi Perumal temple in Tuticorin district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/retrieval-of-temple-land-at-snails-pace-says-madras-hc/articleshow/85606696.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Allahabad||Busting myths helped ramp up vaccination in Prayagraj district: Health deptt||PRAYAGRAJ: From vaccine hesitancy to vaccine acceptability, the three factors of -- vaccine recipients sharing their experiences, easing of misconceptions about vaccination and its side-effects, and busting of various myths about vaccination are the three prime factors that have helped health authorities to ramp up vaccination exercise among the eligible recipients in Sangam city. Nodal officer (vaccination) at MLN Medical College, Dr Utsav Singh said, "Experiences shared by vaccinated persons have helped health authorities to ramp up vaccination among targeted recipients to a major extent and more and more recipients of all age groups are arriving at the vaccination sites to get vaccinated." He further added, "Apart from travel restrictions, compulsory vaccination in many government and non-government departments have also offered a helping hand for health authorities to achieve the target in the city". About eight per cent of the targeted recipients in the city are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. With 3,000 more people getting the second jab administered on Tuesday, the number of people who are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19 in the city crossed the 3.24 lakh mark. Moreover, with 30 per cent of the targeted recipients taking the first dose, their numbers have also surged to 12.60 lakh. Officials of the health department have set a target of immunizing around 42.39 lakh recipients of all age groups, including 29 lakh recipients aged between 18 and 44 years and 12.87 lakh above 45 years. As per the latest data released by the health department, a total of 15.97 lakh shots have been given to recipients of all age groups in the district till August 24. Out of the 12.61 lakh people who have been administered the vaccine first dose so far, 3.24 lakh recipients have received the second shot. A total of over 14,000 vaccine shots were administered to people of all age groups on Tuesday itself. District Immunization Officer (DIO) and Additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that the immunization drive was in full swing in the Sangam city and that vaccination teams are making sincere efforts to cover the maximum number of recipients at vaccination sites in rural and urban sites. He added that vaccination has been currently taken up at 46 sites including 21 in rural areas and the rest in urban areas. However, with the health department ramping up the vaccination drive against Covid-19 infection, the city is likely to zoom past the 17 lakh vaccination mark by the end of this week. As 15.91 lakh doses have been administered to eligible beneficiaries in the district so far, the department aims to cover at least 14,000 – 16,000 recipients in a single day as per the availability of vaccines. Interestingly, people of all groups, particularly youngsters, are keen to get the jab and they too wait patiently in the queue outside vaccination sites. The number of recipients in the 18 to 44 years group was undoubtedly five to six times compared to the recipients above 45 years, said the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/busting-myths-helped-ramp-up-vaccination-in-distt-health-deptt/articleshow/85608819.cms||Kapil Dixit

Vaccination work will be carried out at 554 centres and by 150 mobile teams placed at the disposal of SDMs. Chief medical & health officer (CMHO), Bhopal, Dr Prabhakar Tiwari said, vaccination is essential to reduce the risk of Coronavirus infection to the minimum and the vaccines are completely safe. So far, 21,42,611 persons have received the vaccine doses in the district- of these16,40,374 have received the first dose and 5,02,237 the second dose. District collector Avinash Lavania emphasised that getting both the jabs is essential for complete protection against Coronavirus, and those, who have not taken the second dose after getting the first jab must make it a point to get the second dose during the mega vaccination drive. District vaccination officer Dr Kamlesh Ahirwar pointed out, there are 1,67,901 people in the district, who have not turned up for the second dose after getting the first jab. He said all the people who have not got vaccinated (first dose or second dose) in the district, are being contacted to motivate them for vaccination. In addition to health staff, students of nursing colleges have also been involved in the task, so that the target of 100 percent vaccination could be achieved.

GGL has also hiked the price of industrial PNG (piped natural gas) supplied to the ceramic and sanitaryware units in Morbi and Surendranagar. However, the company has kept unchanged the price of natural gas supplied to its residential consumers.According to GGL website, the CNG price has been increased to Rs 54.45 per kg (inclusive of taxes and duties) in Gujarat, which shows a rise of Rs 2 per kg over its previous tariff of Rs 52.45/kg. The new price is effective from August 24. “GGL had not increased CNG prices for the past one-and-a-half-year. This coupled with a rise in operational cost led the company to hike CNG prices,” said people in the know. The company serves about 7 lakh CNG consumers through its network of around 450 CNG stations in Gujarat. Meanwhile, GGL also hiked industrial PNG prices to Rs 37.51 per standard cubic meter (SCM) for ceramic and sanitaryware units in Morbi and Surendranagar. “The industrial PNG price for 3-month minimum guaranteed offtake (MGO) has been hiked by Rs4.37 per SCM (excluding taxes), which will put additional burden of Rs 100crore a month on ceramic units in Morbi,” said Nilesh Jetpariya, president, wall tiles division, Morbi Ceramic Association (MCA). Market sources said that the increase in industrial PNG price is mainly on account of the steep surge in liquified natural gas (LNG) price in the international market. Gujarat Gas provides 6.5 million metric standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd) to ceramic and sanitaryware units in Morbi and Surendranagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-gas-raises-cng-industrial-png-prices/articleshow/85606691.cms||---

It has simultaneously invited bids for design, supply and construction of track between Ahmedabad and Vapi. On Tuesday, the NHSRCL invited tenders for design, supply and construction of track between Sabarmati Depot and Vadodara. Also, the technical bids were opened on Tuesday for design, supply and construction of track and track-related works between Vapi and Vadodara. The NHSRCL officials said that a total four bids have been received and all four bids are from India-led joint venture companies including Ircon International, Larsen & Toubro, NCC-Rahee, and Afcons-Texmaco. The officials said that the technical bid for Vapi-Vadodara section of 237km was opened while another 118 km from Sabarmati to Vadodara was invited. The officials said NHSRCL has invited parallel tenders as they want their work to be put on fast track. The NHSRCL has set itself a target for December 2023 to commence the bullet train in the Gujarat section that is from Ahmedabad to Vapi. The officials said that the work for the elevated corridor was first allotted and the tendering for stations was done later. The officials said that the tenders for track and related work was also awarded as the NHSRCL wanted the work to begin once the elevated corridor was ready. “We do not want to wait for the entire corridor to be ready and then begin track work as it can delay the project. The NHSRCL wants work to begin simultaneously so that the stretch is ready for testing even in small segments.” In July, the NHSRCL took a step forward in its construction work by casting the first full-height pier near Vapi, at Chainage 167 on Mumbai Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Corridor. The average height of the pier on this corridor is approximately 12-15 m and exact height of the first casted pier was 13.05m, which is almost equivalent to a 4-storeyed building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nhsrcl-fast-tracks-ahmedabad-vapi-section/articleshow/85606796.cms||---

Deepak Kadam, a teacher at a zilla parishad school in Bhor taluka of Pune district, said children were enthusiastic about attending classes but there were few students, and it was the parents who were not keen on physical classes. “As a result, we have to continue teaching virtually and in classrooms too,” said Kadam. Based on the data provided by the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT), an estimated 1.52 lakh students are attending offline classes and 17,701 schools have reopened in Amravati, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Nashik, Pune, Mumbai and Latur divisions. Initially, the state government had announced reopening of schools in urban areas from October 17, but the order was later withdrawn citing safety concerns. As the positivity rate dipped across Maharashtra, the state government said schools can resume physical classes, especially for Classes VIII to XII. The government also decided to start offline classes for standards five to seven, but later withdrew it. The state government’s task force is not keen on physical classes in view of an impending third wave of Covid-19. Earlier in August, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad had said that it was up to the local officials to take a call on resuming physical classes in schools based on an assessment of the the pandemic situation in their areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/38-schools-reopen-in-state-attendance-remains-under-15/articleshow/85606725.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The collector inspected paddy cultivation in Madurai East and Melur blocks and inaugurated a workshop on water management for farmers in Melur on Tuesday.

In some places such as Arubanur bit-1 and bit 2, Sathurmadangan and Udupankulam, the cultivation was limited to a small area last year. However, this year, it has been increased to 250 acres. Farmers also benefited by the rice intensification system and implementation of modern methods and technology.

This has, predictably, resulted in a rebellion brewing within the party ranks, and senior functionaries in the BJP are busy placating those who have been denied the ticket. The situation is similar in the Congress as well, where discontent is simmering among the ranks of the younger members, who had been hoping to cut their teeth in electoral politics in the HDMC polls have been left disappointed.Meanwhile, the candidates announced by the JD(S) are mostly youngsters, and the party is reportedly looking for those who have been refused tickets by the BJP and Congress, and can afford to fight the polls using their own resources.In the BJP, youngsters who have been refused the party ticket have been vocal in criticising the party, and have even threatened to work against the candidates fielded by the saffron party. MLA Arvind Bellad, president of the BJP’s Hubballi-Dharwad unit downplayed the rebellion in the party’s ranks.Of the 63 candidates announced by the BJP, there are those who have risen to the post of mayor and deputy mayor, while most of them have been elected to the HDMC Council five or six times, not to mention the fact that they are mostly in the 55 to 70 age group.One of the aspirants denied the party’s ticket said that the BJP had unofficially reserved 60% of the tickets for young faces. “But this has not come to pass. The list of candidates announced includes former mayors who lost the assembly elections,” he said.The Congress, keen on preventing a revolt, decided to announce its list of candidates for all the 82 wards on Sunday, a day before the deadline for the filing of nomination papers. The party has chosen senior members for most of the wards, wives of former corporators have been fielded in seats reserved for women.In a few cases, senior corporators have vacated their seats and the party has fielded their sons. Hemanth Gurlhosur, president of the Congress’ OBC wing, was an aspirant for the party’s ticket for ward 13. However, the Congress announced Anand Jadhav as its candidate, much to the former’s chagrin. Gurlhosur has announced that he will contest the polls as an Independent. Disgruntled aspirants are likely to contest the elections as rebels.The JD(S), meanwhile, has announced its candidates for 36 of the 82 wards, and is hoping to capitalise on the divide in the BJP and Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rebellion-brews-in-cong-bjp-as-parties-opt-for-old-faces/articleshow/85598156.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Tiger-killer big cat prowls Amangarh, spl team to track angry 'AT-1'||BIJNOR: Amangarh Tiger One, or AT-1, doesn’t believe in boundaries. Now 12, the male tiger has been “picking fights” with the other tigers in the reserve and has already killed two so far. A worried forest department has now set up an eight-member team, led by the Amangarh ranger, to track AT-1 and come up with a plan to reduce conflict. The Amangarh Tiger Reserve had started out with 13 tigers in 2012, when it was notified as a reserve, and now has 27. Space is shrinking, tiger density is going up and territorial wars don’t end well. Especially with AT-1 around. “Our big concern is AT-1 … He is the king of Amangarh,” said Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran. “We are trying to understand his behaviour … Tigers are thriving here, there is a large prey base. But we are worried about these territorial fights.” Amangarh is a buffer zone of the Corbett Tiger Reserve, spread across a 95-sq km area of forests, teak plantations, grasslands and wetlands. AT-1 has always lived in its forests. But it was only in 2017 that foresters started noticing it. “It was October 26, 2017. We found the carcass of an eight-year-old tigress at Jaspur in Amangarh. Parts of it had been eaten away. There were camera traps in the area. When we went over the images, we realised it was AT-1 engaged in a territorial fight,” Semmaran said. Last year, another carcass of a tigress was found, again at Jaspur. “A half-eaten cheetal was also lying nearby. This time, it appeared, they were fighting over prey. The tigress carcass had also been eaten away. The photos and blood-stained pugmarks matched those of AT-1,” Semmaran said. Tigers attack other tigers over two things — territory and prey. AT-1 fit the pattern. But without knowing where AT-1 was headed or which territory he wanted, it would be difficult to figure out how to stop these attacks. “During the last tiger census, we found AT-1 moving throughout Amangarh and the border areas of Corbett,” Semmaran said. Not bound by its territory, AT-1 could keep attacking other tigers in its way. “We have set up a team to track every movement of AT-1. The next tiger census is scheduled for October or November. That will give us a better picture,” Semmaran said. Once the forest officials are done mapping his movements, a report will be sent to the state forest department to figure out how to protect other tigers from AT-1 and, soon, AT-1 from other tigers. At 12, AT-1 is getting old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/tiger-killer-big-cat-prowls-amangarh-spl-team-to-track-angry-at-1/articleshow/85604090.cms||Harveer Dabas

He told that while Union ministers and members of Parliament enjoy immunity from arrest in the case of civil matters and cannot be arrested 40 days before, during, or 40 days after a Parliament session, but there is "nothing in the rule book" that prevents a minister's arrest in a criminal matter. "The Rule is that the presiding officer of the House, of which the arrested person is a member, must be informed upon his arrest. This information is then notified in the Parliament bulletin if the House is not in session, or informed to the House, if it is in session," Achary said. The only exception to the rule is when a member or minister has to be arrested from the premises of Parliament, in which case, the permission of the chair must be sought, he said. Under the Constitution, immunity from arrest in both civil and criminal matters extends only to the President and governors, who cannot be arrested even in criminal matters while they are in office. Any action, even in criminal matters, may only be initiated after they demit office. Narayan Rane is the first Union minister to be arrested in nearly 20 years and the third to be arrested by state police. In June 2001, Murasoli Maran and TR Baalu, both Union ministers at the time, were arrested by the Tamil Nadu police following the arrest of then TN chief minister Karunanidhi in connection with a Rs 12 crore 'flyover scam'. Maran and Baalu were released on bail the following day after then defence minister George Fernandes had visited Chennai. Rane was arrested by police in Mumbai in connection with certain objectionable remarks he had made against Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ministers-have-no-immunity-from-arrest-in-criminal-matters/articleshow/85611615.cms||Swati Mathur

The 4th additional chief judicial magistrate Rajendra Singh ordered additional public prosecutor D K Morabiya to deposit Rs 500 with the District Legal Service Authority towards cost imposed on him for ignoring court’s summons as an in-charge APP of the court on August 11 and not examining a witness, who was present in court in connection with a case lodged in Ghogha Road police station. As the regular APP of this court was on medical leave, the court repeatedly summoned in-charge APP Morabiya to come an examine the witness. The court sent a peon, but the APP conveyed to the court that he would come for urgent bail and remand matter only. The court continued to wait for him to come till 4.45 PM. After repeated calls, when the prosecutor did not turn up, the court said if a witness turns up, section 309 of the CrPC mandates recording of deposition of the witness except in extraordinary circumstances. There is also a provision that if there is an adjournment, cost may be imposed on the prosecution or the accused. The court further said that there is no provision in any law that an in-charge prosecutor should attend the court for bail and remand only. If the regular prosecutor is absence, the in-charge prosecutor is bound to conduct examination-in-chief of all witnesses. The court also cited a Gujarat high court’s judgment saying that the court itself cannot conduct examination-in-chief of a witness, but only prosecution should conduct it. After imposing cost on the prosecutor, the court directed that Bhavnagar collector to be informed about the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/public-prosecutor-fined-for-absence/articleshow/85606854.cms||---
---||Bhopal||High fuel prices are Congress propaganda, says Bhopal BJP MP Pragya Thakur||BHOPAL: Petrol is selling at Rs 112 a litre in parts of Madhya Pradesh and diesel at Rs 100, but Bhopal BJP MP Pragya Thakur dismisses it as Congress propaganda. Less than a month ago, her party colleague and minister Vishwas Sarang had blamed Jawaharlal Nehru for the current inflation, and when questioned by reporters recently, a BJP district chief told reporters to “go to Afghanistan”. Pragya carried on with this dismissive attitude to fuel prices on Tuesday. At an event where she shared the dais with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Pragya said: “Jo yeh log propaganda karte hain ki diesel mehanga, petrol mehanga. Ye mehangai kuchh aur nahi hai, yeh Congressiyon ki mansikta hai, phokat ka propaganda hai (These people spread propaganda that diesel and petrol have become expensive. This inflation is nothing else but the mindset of the Congress and empty propaganda).” On the same day, diesel was selling for more than Rs 100 in Anuppur, Seoni and Shahdol, and petrol at Rs 112.14 in Rewa, Satna, Betul, Seoni, Sheopur and Shahdol. Congress tore into Pragya over this, with party spokesman Narendra Saluja tweeting: “Congress is responsible for floods? Nehru’s speech responsible for inflation? If facing a problem, go to Afghanistan? Now, MP Pragya Thakur is saying that inflation is nothing but propaganda of Congress’s mindset. Send all of them to a mental hospital.” Saluja was referring to statements by minister Sarang and Katni district BJP chief Ramratan Payal. On July 31, Sarang had blamed Congress and Nehru for inflation, saying: “If the credit for increasing inflation by crippling the economy after the country's Independence goes to anyone, it is the Nehru family. Inflation does not rise in a day or two. The country's economy has deteriorated due to the mistakes in the speech that Jawaharlal Nehru delivered from Red Fort on August 15, 1947.” Congress mocked this and pointed out that Nehru had not given any speech from Red Fort on August 15, 1947. Last week, Payal flared up when journalists asked him about high fuel prices. “Go to Afghanistan. Petrol is Rs 50 per litre there. Go and tank up there,” he told the mediapersons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/high-fuel-prices-are-cong-propaganda-says-pragya-thakur/articleshow/85606828.cms||---

Biometric scanning at ration shops has been made mandatory under the ‘One India, one ration card’ scheme and it has been specified that only the people whose names are on the cards should come for purchasing the goods. In some cases, when the fingerprint was not recognised after three trials, the customers were being asked to update their fingerprints at the e-seva centres in the taluk and municipality offices, sources from the district civil supplies department said. However, physically and visually challenged cardholders and elderly have been exempted from this rule and can purchase the goods with the help of other people after obtaining the certification from the district civil supplies officer or concerned authorities. “The goods were provided without delay and the customer does not have to make multiple trips to the shop,” sources added. The biometric scanning system was put on hold when the Rs 4,000 dole as Covid-19 relief and the bag of 14 items was being distributed to the people. But, it has resumed since the first week of August. Sources said that it was introduced as goods were being purchased through proxy where the ration cards holders did not come in person to get the goods. Sources from the district civil supplies department said that almost 95% of the cardholders have started purchasing ration after biometric scanning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/e-seva-centres-in-sivaganga-see-huge-rush-to-update-biometrics/articleshow/85606835.cms||---
---||Hubballi||CM hints at separate municipal corporation for Dharwad||Dharwad: The demand for a separate municipal corporation for Dharwad seems to have got a boost with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai hinting that Dharwad needs to be freed from Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation.A delegation of eminent citizens of Dharwad met Bommai at his residence in Hubballi during his visit to the city on Sunday and submitted a memorandum seeking bifurcation of HDMC. Bommai said Dharwad deserves to be freed from the HDMC and the government is actively considering the demand.Convener of the Action Committee for Separate Municipal Corporation for Dharwad Manoj Patil told TOI that the chief minister was receptive to the demand and his statement has boosted the citizens’ hopes.The demand for a separate municipal corporation for Dharwad is getting louder as the city, despite being the district head quarter, has received a raw deal as far as development under the HDMC schemes are concerned.The HDMC was constituted by the government in 1962 and all the councillors were nominated. Giriyappa Nalawadi of Dharwad was the first mayor. The formation of a municipal corporation for twin cities was without a demand from people in Hubballi or Dharwad.With Hubballi having more number of wards when compared to the number of wards in Dharwad, major part of the funds were being allotted to development works in Hubballi. Now there are 82 wards in HDMC and of them 28 are in Dharwad division and 54 in Hubballi division.Dharwad has always been discriminated against when taking up development works and all the projects of HDMC have been Hubballi-centric, said Manoj Patil.HDMC commissioner, mayor and deputy mayor visit Dharwad only twice a week, and that too for a few minutes. They often skip visiting HDMC office in Dharwad citing some meeting at the DC’s office or the minister’s visit as the reason. The staff strength at Dharwad office has also been reduced forcing people to go to Hubballi for works related to HDMC.Under the Smart City project no funds are allocated to Dharwad and all the works are pertaining to Hubballi. There was a plan to construct a flyover from Kalghatagi toll naka to Alur Venkatrao Circle in Dharwad to ease traffic congestion and that has been shelved while the work on flyover construction at Rani Channamma Circle has commenced. Since former CM Jagadish Shettar and Union minister Prahlad Joshi are from Hubballi, focus is more on Hubballi. Dharwad lacks political leadership, said businessman Lalit Bhandari.The citizens have demanded a white paper on the development works done in both Dharwad and Hubballi by the HDMC since 1962.For a city to be eligible to have a municipal corporation it should have a population of three lakh and Dharwad already has a population of 5.5 lakh. By having a separate municipal corporation, Dharwad will get an annual special grant of Rs 100 crore for development and Hubballi will be relieved of sparing the money in the grants allotted to it, the committee said in the memorandum which has been signed by eminent writers, artists, academicians and businessmen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/cm-hints-at-separate-municipal-corporation-for-dharwad/articleshow/85598188.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The Kandivali police’s chargesheet shows that key accused Mahendra Singh had supplied vials to a Malad pharmaceutical company in April for their employees to get vaccinated against Covid. This was before Singh allegedly masterminded fraudulent drives at a number of firms, educational institutions and a housing society. But none of the beneficiaries at the Malad pharmaceutical company were able to generate certificates from the CoWin portal which raises questions as to whether the vaccines they got were authentic or not. The 2000 page long chargesheet contains the statement of the Malad pharma’s firm’s owner, Dr Haresh Shah, 66. Shah has said that he first met Singh at the office of the Malad Medical Association where Singh used to work as a clerk. Thereafter, the two men were in frequent touch as Singh’s residence was close to Shah’s office. “During the pandemic, Singh would visit my office to supply masks and sanitizers to my staff. He informed me that he had access to Covid vaccines. I made inquiries for getting my staff and their families vaccinated. Singh had indicated that the vaccines would come from Shivam Hospital in Kandivali,” Shah’s statement says. On April 22, Singh went to Shah’s house and delivered 38 sealed vials of “Covishield.” Shah paid him Rs 1.61 lakh for the vials. Singh told him to prepare a list of beneficiaries so that their details could be entered online at Shivam Hospital for generating vaccine certificates. He also asked Shah to return all the empty vials once the shots were given. Shah returned the 38 empty vials later, but the certificates were never generated. The chargesheet also contains the statement of a Shivam Hospital staffer who said she had given shots to “important contacts and acquaintances” of the hospital owner, Dr Shivam Pataria, inside his cabin much after the hospital stopped functioning as a designated PCVC (Private Covid Vaccination Centre). The statement of the staffer, Pranita Ghadi, says she gave shots to Pataria’s contacts on May 23 and a couple of occasions afterwards as well. “The vials were given to me by Pataria’s wife, Neeta. After administering the shots, I would return the vials back to her,” Ghadi has said in her statement. Shivam Hospital was a PCVC between March 5 and April 28. The Pataria couple has also been arrested in the fake vaccine scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fake-vax-scam-mastermind-may-have-targeted-malad-pharma-company-too/articleshow/85608920.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Allahabad||Students receive warm welcome as schools reopen||Prayagraj: After a gap of six months, as many as 1005 upper primary schools in Prayagraj district were re-opened in the Sangam city here on Tuesday. The teachers and school staff welcomed the students with roli tika amidst following of Covid-19 protocol. Although the percentage of attendance was low on the first day of reopening of schools from class VIth to VIIIth, students expressed their happiness and joy once they arrived at the school campus to attend classes. Students were given warm welcome by the teachers and school staff and teachers applied roli tika on the foreheads of some students. Students were strictly asked to wear a mask. Teachers also offered masks to students who arrived at the school campus without a mask. The school authorities have put sanitisers at the entry of the school appealing to visitors to use it before entering the school premises. A senior official said that the upper primary schools in urban and rural areas recorded 50 and 30 per cent attendance respectively. Many of the students had brought self–declaration letters from their parents. Upper primary school authorities on their part have focused on the strict adherence of Covid-19 protocol and wearing of the mask was made mandatory for every school staff and student. The principal of an upper primary school in trans-Yamuna told TOI that family members or guardians of the students were asked to carry a self-declaration letter and follow all Covid-19 protocols. Besides, all the children were asked to sit while maintaining a proper distance from each other. To make students comfortable, teachers and school staff shared their experiences with students on the lockdown and the pandemic. The teachers also educated students on precautionary measures to be safe from the infection. Pointedly, all the cooks in school canteens have been directed to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and the children would be sitting at a proper distance from each other while attending mid-day meal programmes at schools. School children were told about the importance of washing and sanitising their hands regularly. A senior education department official said that schools have been asked to conduct proper cleanliness on their premises and students should be sitting at a proper distance while maintaining social distancing. Moreover, there would be two shifts from 8am to 11am and 11:30am to 2:30pm and meals should be distributed with the strict following of mid-day meals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/students-receive-warm-welcome-as-schools-reopen/articleshow/85608911.cms||---

Storage in the dams around Pune increased to 96% on Monday. “Water stocks did not report a remarkable rise in the past week due to the lesser rain in the catchments. This prompted us to stop the release of water from the Panshet and Khadakwasla dams into the Mutha. However, water discharge into the canal continued. We will observe the rainfall activity in the catchments and water storages for the next few weeks. In case of a longer dry spell, the ongoing water release into the canal will be curtailed,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/irrigation-dept-may-curtail-water-release-if-rain-remains-subdued/articleshow/85606824.cms||Sarang Dastane

Officers of Navrangpura police said that a man identified as Mahesh, whose whereabouts are not known, took help of the Angadias — a Vasna resident Ajay Chauhan, 35, who runs a vegetable business and a Paldi resident, Vijay Nayak, 30, who runs a private construction firm — and conducted the fraud. Manager of the private bank in which the two forged cheques were deposited filed two FIRs of forgery and producing of forged documents against the two Angadias whose help was taken by the accused. In the first complaint, manager of Navrangpura branch of the Indian Bank, Kartikeya Thirunanasamanthan, said that Chauhan had opened an account in his bank branch on March 24, 2021. He opened the account in the name of his vegetable firm having its address near Geeta Mandir and submitted his Pan and Aadhaar card details. On April 29, 2021, he deposited a cheque worth Rs 62 lakh issued by a university in Patna and the money was finally deposited in Chauhan’s account. On July 17, 2021, Patna zonal office of the bank approached the bank branch in Ahmedabad and informed that someone had withdrawn money using a forged cheque. The cheque submitted by Chauhan was a forged one using which the money was withdrawn, said the FIR. Similarly, Nayak had also opened his bank account on December 17, 2020 in the name of KD Enterprises. On April 23, 2021, a cheque worth Rs 42.80 lakh issued by a firm named TDI Infrastructure from New Delhi was deposited in the bank. On June 21, 2021, the corporate branch of New Delhi sent an email to the Ahmedabad branch saying that the transaction from the Delhi firm was also fraudulent and it was done using forged cheque.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bank-duped-of-rs-1-15-cr-using-forged-cheques/articleshow/85606851.cms||---

After the Covid-19 second wave subsided, OPDs were opened, but with a limit on the number of patients to be seen daily in order to have a manageable crowd for ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour. However, since huge number of patients from across the state come to KGMU for specialised treatment of various diseases, the university authorities on August 18 increased the limit from 75 (25 new and 50 follow-up cases) patients daily to 100 (40 new and 60 follow-up cases) for super-speciality departments, and from 150 (50 new and 100 follow-up) to 200 (60 new and 140 follow-up) for other departments. Patients need to take prior appointments through telephone (0522-2258880) or online (www.ors.gov.in). TOI reality check of online appointments on Tuesday found that waiting period for appointments in medicine, cardiology, surgery, surgical oncology, paediatric, gynaecology, and family medicine is around 45 days, whereas it is at least 30 days in super-speciality departments such as gastroenterology, neurology and neurology surgery.

---||Nagpur||Regular supply, drop in demand streamline vax scenario in city||Nagpur: The only available safety mechanism amid Covid-19 pandemic, vaccination has finally got streamlined in the city following regular supply of doses from the state government and drop in the number of beneficiaries. For the first time since the resumption of vaccination of 18-44 group, inoculation drive was not affected in the last 11 days due to lack of doses. The number of beneficiaries dropped to 12,232 in the city on Tuesday despite sufficient number of doses were available in all 162 centres of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and 28 private hospitals. Total 11,881 people took the jab in NMC centres whereas the number was 351 in private centres. The demand for vaccine had shot up after the government resumed inoculation of 18-44 age group on June 23. Between June 23 and August 13, the civic body could carry out inoculation in Covishield centres only on 21 days out of total 52. The vaccination was affected due to irregular supply of Covishield doses from the government. On August 13, the NMC received 91,000 doses of Covishield and 5,600 doses of Covaxin. After two days, on August 15, again the civic body got 40,000 Covishield and 2,100 Covaxin doses. Thereafter, 59,000 doses of Covishield and 7,040 of Covaxin were received on August 20 followed by 21,000 Covishield doses on August 22. With the supply improving, NMC could conduct vaccination on all days after August 14, excluding two holidays — Independence Day and Rakshabandhan. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Government is giving sufficient supply of doses from the second week of August. Along with this, number of vaccine seekers has also gone down. Daily vaccination numbers were 25,000-30,000 after resumption of inoculation of 18-44 group, which has now dropped to 12,000 per day. Therefore, NMC is having sufficient number of doses. The government is likely to send fresh stock on Thursday.” Dr Chilkar said, “People due for second dose should take it immediately. Of the eligible population of 17 lakh, 11.26 lakh have taken the first dose. Those remaining should also get inoculated before the projected third wave strikes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/regular-supply-drop-in-demand-streamline-vax-scenario-in-city/articleshow/85606857.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

He was tired and emotional as he recalled his last days in the war-torn country. “I stepped in Kabul airport two years ago hoping to open a new chapter in my life. But over the last seven days, what I experienced was hellish. I’m one of the lucky persons to have returned to India in a short time,” said Rajesh.He worked at EcoLog, an European company which was into catering services to the US army units based in Kabul. “Everything was right till August 14, when the Taliban was about to capture Kabul city. I was working at the army base then. Around 4pm the next day, army sirens went off, and we were asked to enter bunkers fearing air attack. I rushed to a bunker which was already overcrowded. I stayed there more than six hours without sitting,” he said, adding that their company asked them to pack bags the same day. “The US army base is adjacent to Kabul airport. We were expecting to leave Kabul on August 15 evening. But what unfolded was out of the blue — over five thousand Afghans, including women and children, rushed to the airport and occupied the runway. The plane which was to ferry us to India did not land, and crowd swelled. For two days, we were stranded in the airport with no plane movement. I thought it was the end,” he said.“However on August 17, the US army arranged a plane, and we left for Qatar. Even there, horror sights greeted us — over 20,000 Afghans were seen crammed in temporary shelters. Forget getting food on time, we even waited in a long queue to attend nature’s call. To avoid this, we stopped drinking water, while pieces of bread made for our meal. Officials of the Indian embassy took care of us in person.”On Monday night, he reached Karwar via the Delhi-Goa route. “The dreams of the Afghans have shattered, and I’m sorry for them,” he signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karwar-returnee-recounts-afghan-ordeal/articleshow/85598245.cms||Deepak Kumar Shenvi

---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Tortured in 1993 over Capt’s links with ultras, alleges Malvinder Singh Mali||JALANDHAR: Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s adviser Malvinder Singh Mali kept up his attack on chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday. In a Facebook post in the morning, Mali claimed that he had to face third-degree police torture in 1993 as the Punjab Police questioned him about links between Amarinder and Sikh militants. The post came at a time when Amarinder and his camp have been taking on Mali and Sidhu’s other adviser Pyare Lal Garg on issues of nationalism and national interest. He had attacked Amarinder in a Facebook post on Monday night too and is still to remove a caricature of late PM Indira Gandhi, from a magazine 1989, which shows the slain PM holding a gun with a skull on its barrel. Describing his arrest and torture, Mali posted that he was asked questions which were meant for Amarinder’s personal assistant, whose name was also Malvinder Singh Mali and belonged to the same district, Sangrur, but from a different village. He mentioned that he was arrested while travelling to Ludhiana to see then education minister Harnam Dass Johr for transfer of a teacher. “At that time, a case was registered against me as I was actively working with Justice Ajit Singh Bains to investigate human rights violations. I was granted anticipatory bail by court,” he posted. He claimed that police officials tortured him at Ladda Kothi. Mali said he was stripped completely and then given ‘kutchi faansi’ (hanging somebody with hands tied behind and a rope passing through loop of arms) and he was questioned by an SP and a DSP. “Their first question was that I called Gurjant Singh Rajasthani (a militant) to Neela Mahal, facilitated his meeting with Captain Amarinder Singh and gave him two Springfield rifles. Second question was that I used two militant brothers, Khem Singh and Raj Singh, from Balad Kalan village, who were later killed in police encounter, as Amarinder’s gunmen. I had never seen Captain’s Neela Mahal even from outside. I knew Khem Singh well, but never met him after he got into militancy. But, to get rid of extreme pain as I was feeling... I told a lie: that I would get arms recovered. They (then) removed me from ‘kutchi faansi’,” Mali said. Claiming that both his shoulders were dislocated and a policeman later managed to put them in place, he wrote: “Suddenly then, CIA staff in-charge came with a file and said: ‘Sir, this file on basis of which questioning is being done is of Malvinder Singh Mali of Khurd village, while the file is of Malvinder Singh Mali of Sakraudi village’.” Mali said the police officers, after reading the file, questioned him about his work and the place where he lived. When he told that he was working as a journalist, they cross-checked with the newspaper and then left. Mali said he was kept at the police station with his feet shackled even after that. “Around 11pm, a policeman known as ‘Butcher’ came and started hurling abuses and shouting that I was a member of Panthic Committee, a murderer of families of policemen. He said: Now a team from Chandigarh is coming which would teach you a lesson,” Mali posted. He concluded by writing: “Only this much for now.” In another post, also aimed at the CM but without his name, Mali said: “Those who live in glasshouses should not throw stones at others; look at how your salaried advisers and how they behaved.” He attached a link to a news story in which Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh alleged that he was threatened by Captain’s aide Sandeep Sandhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tortured-in-93-over-capts-links-with-ultras-alleges-mali/articleshow/85608955.cms||IP Singh

When teachers rushed to the principal’s chamber, he escaped and it was found later that the teenager was not a student. Principal Pankaj Kumar said, “I found a teenager participating in the assembly without a uniform. He was wearing rings and his hair was long. I asked him to come in uniform. After the assembly, when all teachers and students moved to their classrooms, the teenager came to me and put a revolver on my temple and abused me. When teachers spotted him brandishing a revolver, they chased him, but he fled the scene.” “Soon, I inquired about him and he was found to be an outsider. The boy is stated to be a resident of Karauli village. It is yet to be ascertained that why he had joined the morning assembly. I have lodged a complaint against him at Mandawali police station,” added the principal. According to witnesses, there was a commotion on the campus after the incident. College sources said the boy had entered the college premises to beat up a student, but as the principal lambasted him, he got angry and targeted the principal. Bijnor superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said, “We are probing the matter. The accused will be nabbed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/asked-to-dress-up-decently-in-school-teenager-pulls-out-a-gun-put-on-principals-temple-abuses-him/articleshow/85604242.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||Bad air may cause monsoon to weaken, finds new study||NEW DELHI: While the health and economic impact of air pollution has been well documented over the last decade, a new research has thrown light on its possible repercussions on monsoon too. An increase in anthropogenic aerosols could lead to a reduction in the mean monsoon rainfall by as much as 10% to 15% in the coming years. According to a recent report, “Anthropogenic Aerosols and the Weakening of the South Asian Summer Monsoon”, monsoon rains are brought by large-scale wind patterns that transport heat between the northern and southern hemispheres. As winds head northwards over the Indian Ocean during the northern hemisphere’s summer, they pick up moisture, which falls as rain over south and southeast Asia. However, air pollution can weaken these long-distance wind patterns as it reflects sunlight back into space, cooling the polluted area. “A thick aerosol pollution over Europe in the summer ensures the northern hemisphere isn’t much warmer than the southern; so, there is nothing to drive the winds – and nothing to trigger the monsoon. The monsoon unpredictability is ‘more worrisome’ than the overall decrease in rainfall as it leads to drought one year followed by floods the next, testing resilience building and adaptation capability to prepare for these changes,” the study states. This concern has also been raised in the recent UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, “Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis”.  According to IPCC, results from climate models indicate that anthropogenic aerosol forcing has dominated the recent decrease in the summer monsoon precipitation. Data from the last three decades from the monsoon season shows there has been a gradual drop in the annual mean monsoon rainfall.  While it was 881mm in the period 1981 to 1990, it dropped to 877mm in the decade 1991-2000. In the next decade, it fell to 847mm and the last decade (2011-2020) has recorded 860 mm, largely saved by a high rainfall recorded in the years 2019 and 2020. Dr Dilip Ganguly, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at IIT Delhi, estimates air pollution to reduce the southwest monsoon rainfall by 10-15% for the entire country in the coming years. “Meanwhile, some places might even see reduced rains as high as 50% and it would also impact the overall dynamics of the monsoon — for instance delaying its onset,” said Ganguly. S N Tripathi, head of department (civil engineering) at IIT Kanpur, has similar views, stating areas with more pollution are likely to be affected the most. “The southwest monsoon is driven by the difference between land and ocean temperatures. Presence of large-scale aerosols over the Indian landmass would lead to dimming of the land surface. The entire process would lead to weakening of the dynamics of the monsoon as a whole,” said Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bad-air-may-cause-monsoon-to-weaken-finds-new-study/articleshow/85606870.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

This is evident from the fact that a substantial surge is witnessed in seizure of most prevalent contraband substance mephedrone powder, better known as MD drugs and which is also popular as a sex stimulant, by the police department this year. City police have seized MD drugs worth almost Rs50 lakh till July this year, compared to seizure of just Rs4.39 lakh worth of the contraband last year in the same period. This year, the police have arrested 21 MD peddlers till July, while the number was 15 during the corresponding period last year. The police have also seized marijuana or cannabis worth Rs68 lakh till July this year and arrested 94 people, while seizure of the same contraband substance last year in the same period was Rs23.53 lakh and 51 arrests. Call it lockdown effect or general frustration trying to find a vent, whopping 380% increase was witnessed in different types of narcotics cases registered, resulting in seizures worth over Rs1.18 crore by the cops till July this year following a drive initiated by CP Amitesh Kumar. Sharing his experience, psychiatrist Dr Rajesh Rathi said the number of patients related to addictive substance use disorders has increased in the Covid era or post lockdown period. “The major reasons being financial burden and stress-related problems which got aggravated during the lockdown,” he said. “Lot of interpersonal stress within the families due to lockdown and ample inter-personal conflicts, which had stemmed from the addictive behaviours, were the probable reasons behind the increase in tendency to fall back upon the substance abuse,” said Dr Rathi. Incidents of mental health disorders like anxiety spectrum illnesses and depressions are also the other triggers behind substance abuse, he added. Dr Rathi also underlined the fact that MD drugs are also used by many, especially the youngsters, as sex stimulant and performance enhancers. Another renowned psychiatrist Dr Sudhir Bhave said he too has seen several patients with alcohol, nicotine and cannabis addictions amid the pandemic. “The prolonged lockdown restricted movement and induced ennui which made many fall for addictions as a way out of the compelling situations. The other reason could be the increasing inter-personal conflicts at homes as family members had to spend longer periods with each other,” he said. CP Kumar said the sustained drives against peddlers, especially the MD drug cartels, was to break the supply chain, bust the networks and put the kingpins behind the bars. “Narcotics are spoiling the younger generations and also triggering crimes for which we have been repeatedly targeting criminal syndicates and busting gangs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-lockdown-blues-fuel-substance-abuse-disorders/articleshow/85606894.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses 90 lakh vaccination milestone||MUMBAI: Amid shortage of vaccines, the city on Tuesday reached a milestone by completing 90 lakh vaccinations. However, the vaccination drive will be a trimmed one at the 315 public centres on Wednesday due to unavailability of doses. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said that some doses are expected to arrive on Wednesday, which would be distributed to public centres on Thursday. “We will have a limited drive on Wednesday and centres may remain closed on Thursday,” she said. On Tuesday too, limited public centres administered vaccines. Over 83,650 people could get inoculated—around 47,000 in public centres and 36,662 at private ones. According to CoWin, a total of 90,93,920 vaccine doses have been administered in Mumbai since the start of the drive in January. At least 67.5 lakh people have got the first dose, while 23.4 lakh have been fully vaccinated. “Around 70% of Mumbai’s population has been vaccinated with at least one dose, while 25% have got both the doses,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. He said the BMC was trying to accelerate vaccination depending on doses before the expected third wave. As per BMC data, over 90% of senior citizens, over 80% in the 45-59 age group and around 57% in the 18-44 age bracket have been covered with at least one dose, officials said. The private sector too has aided in Mu-mbai’s vaccine coverage, said Kakani. More than 43%, or over 38 lakh doses, have been admin-istered in the private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crosses-90l-vaccination-milestone/articleshow/85608982.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||ANMA seeks zero duty on all scrap imports||Ahmedabad: The All-India Non-Ferrous Metal Exim Association (ANMA) on Tuesday announced that they have asked for the abolishing of all import duties on non-ferrous metal scrap from the current 2.5%. The association has also sought that no BIS regulation requiring 99% purity of imported non-ferrous metal scrap must be imposed as non-ferrous scrap will have at least 2%-4% impurities. A series of representations have been made to the government regarding the issue, according to association members. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of a media briefing organised by ANMA in Ahmedabad, Jayant Jain, honorary secretary of the association said, “Non-ferrous metal scrap will have at least 2% to 4% impurities. Big companies which are into primary non-ferrous metal manufacturing are lobbying for BIS regulations requiring imported aluminium and other non-ferrous metal scrap to be 99% purity. This will not just hurt manufacturers of recycled aluminium but also pave the way for a duopoly of primary non-ferrous metal manufacturers in the market.” According to ANMA, Gujarat has some 500 units recycling aluminium from scrap with production capacity of 35,000 tonnes of recycled aluminium per month. Of this, an estimated 5,000 tonnes is exported and the rest is supplied in the domestic market to industries such as automobiles, electric vehicles, steel plants and others. Jain also said that the recycling of aluminium leads to 20 times less carbon emission compared to production of primary aluminium. “Secondary aluminium costs at least 10% less than primary aluminium. Duty reduction will go a long way in encouraging recycling of metals and reducing our carbon footprint,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/anma-seeks-zero-duty-on-all-scrap-imports/articleshow/85606883.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Man posts abusive videos against MP||Ahmedabad: An engineer from the city has been charged by city Cybercrime police on Monday for posting abusive videos against a Lok Sabha MP and animal rights activist after he was allegedly not helped by her for treatment of his pet dog. The Cybercrime police swung into action only after the woman MP wrote to the Gujarat DGP Ashish Bhatia and city police commissioner Sanjay Srivastava about abusive videos being posted by the accused Palash Patel. A senior police officer of the city said that Patel had in April posted a video seeking the woman MP’s help to save his pet dog. “He had taken his pet to an NGO which was affiliated to the NGO of the woman MP. As Patel’s pet could not be saved there, he blamed the woman MP for his pet’s untimely death,” said the police officer. On April 19, his pet died and soon after that he had posted the first abusive video against the woman MP and a senior leader of the country. Since then, he used to post such abusive videos blaming the woman MP about his pet’s death and for allegedly conducting irregularities in animal welfare work. Patel also continued to troll the fans and followers of the woman MP by using abusive languages. After this, the MP sought a police action in the case and finally the cops filed a complaint against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-posts-abusive-videos-against-mp/articleshow/85606886.cms||---

Chief educational officer (CEO) of Madurai district R Swaminathan said that the camps have been organized in 13 schools, one each for 13 blocks in the district. “Around 30% of teachers in the district are yet to be vaccinated. The camps are functional between August 23 and 26. We are trying to get as many teachers to be vaccinated as soon as possible. On Monday, around 200 teachers were vaccinated through the camps. We are hoping for the numbers to improve,” he said. Swaminathan said that more than 20,000 teachers across primary, middle school and high and higher secondary school levels are being targeted for the vaccination drive. According to education department officials, there are as many as 16,087 teaching and non-teaching staff in high and higher secondary schools. Of them, 4,540 had received both doses vaccine while 7,697 received a single dose and 3,850 are unvaccinated as on Monday. “We are encouraging Covid-19 vaccination but in case it is not medically advisable for some teachers, they can get exemption. Those who have not received the second dose and those yet to receive the first dose are eligible to get jabs at the camps,” said Swaminathan. Private schools are also ensuring that all their staff are vaccinated. “With children not eligible yet, the responsibility is on teachers to get the vaccine. It is for the safety of both students and teachers. Most schools have made it mandatory for all teachers to be vaccinated before schools reopen,” said S Shanthi, a teacher at a private higher secondary school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/special-covid-vax-camps-for-teachers-in-madurai-dist/articleshow/85606880.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab exempts user charges in markets for petty vendors||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday announced exemption of the user charges at state’s fruits and vegetables retail markets for the remaining period of seven months of the current fiscal, showing concern over the plight of petty vendors of rehri and farhi. The decision was taken after mandi board chairman Lal Singh raised the issue at a meeting at the chief minister’s official residence. Lal Singh said this much needed relief to petty vendors of nearly 34 fruit and vegetable retail markets run by market committees across the state would cost nearly Rs 12 crore to the exchequer of the Punjab mandi board. The market committees collect user charges through contractors against the usage of infrastructure of mandis. A total of 27 market committees have allotted contracts for collection of user charges through e-tendering and the remaining committees personally collect such charges to provide various facilities to rehri and farhi vendors, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-exempts-user-charges-in-markets-for-petty-vendors/articleshow/85609002.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lukewarm vaccination response in Dharavi, only 11% inoculated||MUMBAI: Despite the BMC setting up dedicated vaccination centres in Dharavi and even roping in private players, the inoculation response in the slum colony has been lukewarm. Only around 11% of Dharavi residents have taken the jab since the vaccination drive kicked off in March. Dharavi, which is spread over 2.5 sq km, houses seven lakh-plus population—according to some estimates, the number is 8.5 lakh with unaccounted migration—but till date, only 76,180 residents have taken the jab at the one private and three BMC-run vaccination centres. Of these only 13,932 people have taken both doses. While the BMC has administered 45,060 vaccine doses, 31,120 have been given privately. According to BMC data, 17,657 doses were given in July, but the number dropped to 6,161 in August as of Monday. “In view of the third wave and the Delta virus threat, we are putting in more efforts to cover more people in the vaccination drive,” Kiran Dighavkar, BMC assistant municipal commissioner of G-North ward, said. “Initially, there was a lot of vaccine hesitancy, but now vaccination is picking up, especially among the working class. We are hoping to rope in more CSR to vaccinate more people in a quick span of time.” “Many residents have also taken doses outside Dharavi and they are not counted in this data for centres in the slum colony. Around 25,000-30,000 residents were inoculated in private vaccination camps,” Dighavkar added. In July, the BMC had announced that one lakh Dharavi residents will be vaccinated for free within a month through a CSR initiative. Subsequently, Jaslok Hospital has been inoculating residents with doses procured by Citibank. “We are proud to be associated with the Dharavi vaccination drive and are committed to achieving 1 lakh vaccinations at the earliest. I think the very fact that we crossed 31,000-plus vaccinations in a month speaks highly of the commitment of our partners, whom we found in Jaslok Hospital and the NGOs,” said Ashu Khullar, CEO, Citi India. Meanwhile, for the eighth time this month, Dharavi didn’t report a new Covid-19 case on Monday. Currently, the slum colony has 11 active cases. Of the 7,005 infections recorded in Dharavi, 6,596 patients have been discharged after recovery, officials said. Dharavi’s first Covid-19 case was reported on April 1, 2020, nearly 20 days after the first patient was detected in Mumbai on March 11, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lukewarm-vax-response-in-dharavi-only-11-inoculated/articleshow/85609019.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Schools must ensure that all SOPs mandated are in place as per the checklist given to them,” said Swaminathan. He also said that to ensure social distancing, only 20 students will be allowed in a classroom. Schools are being checked for availability of teachers in such case. The CEO also discussed identifying dropouts, measures taken to get them back to school and educational management information system (EMIS) enrollment etc. Government, aided, and private schools across the district have also been making preparations by carrying out disinfection and sanitation work. “It is reassuring to see that the government is also keen to ensure that schools are reopened safely. With only 50% attendance, we can easily ensure social distance and even allow classes on grounds if weather permits. Parents are also now more open to sending their children to school,” said the principal of a matriculation school. Meanwhile, Swaminathan also said that discussion is on to shift of the Covid-19 vaccination special camps that are being organised in some school campuses, including Elango Corporation School, which functions as the vaccination centre for Government Rajaji Hospital. “The camp is being conducted in an isolated area of the school, so there is no issue. However, it will be a concern once schools are reopened. We will be discussing with the district administration on making alternate arrangements,” said Swaminathan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ensure-all-safety-norms-before-reopening-ceo/articleshow/85606926.cms||---

A survey is going on in the city to compile kitchen-wise data on the basis of which garbage charges will be fixed. To roll-out the system, the MC also plans to enroll private garbage collectors (informal sector), who will be given e-rickshaws to collect garbage from houses. The MC officials have been told to first compile a report on kitchens in houses. There are many houses that have two to three kitchens as per the number of family members. The garbage collection charges will be on the basis of waste generated per house. The officials said they were given 30 days to complete the survey. The field survey has been going on from the past 15 days.One of the officials said, “We first studied the Chandigarh model for a few days and now we are conducting a study in the city. The informal sector people are mostly collecting garbage from houses. They will be enrolled with the MC, which will ensure they are paid the same as they are being from the houses.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “The detailed project report on source segregation and door-to-door waste collection with e-rickshaws is being prepared. We are also conducting a survey in the city to check door-to-door collection kitchen-wise. Very shortly things will be implemented.” Meanwhile, despite several claims, the authorities could not achieve 100% door-to-door segregated waste collection in Ludhiana. In the beginning, the authorities tried their best to achieve cent per cent target and it was implemented in some of the areas. But it fizzled out as soon as the MC checking in fields ended in 2019. Residents have again started mixing the dry and the wet waste. The MC officials did not issue challans to defaulters for not segregating waste and might not do so in the near future too due to the upcoming elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-plans-to-go-chd-way-collect-segregated-garbage-door-to-door/articleshow/85604318.cms||---

Two brothers, Anilsinh and Jayendrasinh Jadeja, were booked in June by Lakadiya police station for their alleged encroachment on government land and running hotels on three parcels of land along the highway. The FIR was registered by the village sarpanch. A sessions court in Bhuj has granted interim protection against their arrest in response to their anticipatory bail application. The brothers moved the HC through advocates Utkarsh Dave and Shweta Lodha demanding quashing of the FIR and also challenging the provisions of the anti-land grabbing laws, to hold and declare sections 2(d), 2(e), 4, 9, 11, 15, 17 of the Act with rules as in violation of Articles 14, 20, 21 and 254 of the Constitution. In their petition, they contended that the main dispute involved the land, which was granted by the government to their great grandfather and his family upon their arrival in India from Pakistan. It was part of the refugee resettlement scheme. The family has got possession over this land since 1979, when the deputy collector passed an order of allotment. There has been a civil dispute pending with regard to the land in a Bhachau court. The second dispute is with regard to a canteen run near sub-station of the Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation Ltd. After the demise of their uncle, Anilsinh has been managing the eating outlet. They claimed that they have nothing to do with the third disputed plot. The petitioners have contended that the provision of the Act is drastic, arbitrary and unreasonable. It is susceptible to misuse because no exception has been carved out in it. The bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath stayed the proceedings on FIR considering earlier orders passed in petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-stays-land-grabbing-charges/articleshow/85606929.cms||---

The data will be used for assessing children with comorbidities in preparedness of the possible third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, said senior health department officials. Ahmedabad district had started screening of children in July. Out of 1.59 lakh children screened, the officials had found 1,068 children with severe co-morbidities, who were put in ‘high-risk’ category. They included children with congenital disorders of heart, kidney, etc. along with thalassemia, HIV, and diabetes among others. “As the third wave is likely to affect children more – the logic is, they are sans the protection of vaccination and thus vulnerable to the viral infection – the attempt is on in every district to identify the vulnerable population and take preventive measures. The RBSK data already is a good indication of the prevalent comorbidities. The teams will also carry out extensive survey, identify the children and provide health facilities,” said a senior state health department official. The School Health Programme is also extended to all below 18 years of age recently, bringing all children and teens under the umbrella for free health services at government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rbsk-data-to-be-used-for-comorbidity-scan/articleshow/85606936.cms||---

All the accused were booked for allegedly giving inflammatory speeches in the buildup to the widespread communal clashes in 2013 which left at least 60 dead and scores of others injured. Police have already filed a charge sheet against the 10 accused in the case. In the charge-sheet, local police have accused them of delivering inflammatory speeches during a panchayat in minority-dominated Khalapar area. Now, all the accused, including three from BSP-- former MP Kadir Rana, former MLA Noorsalin Rana, and Maulana Jameel-- and former Congress MP Saiduzzaman will come for hearing on September 1.

---||Ahmedabad||Traffic: Smart citizens’ intel for smooth ride||Ahmedabad: Daily commuter experience is being transformed into tangible talking points to help the government take crucial decisions on traffic flow, road safety, and parking problems. A group of Amdavadis have united to form brigades of volunteers who will carry out traffic audits of several areas. These include RTO Circle, Indira Bridge Circle, Ghatlodia, and Nirnaynagar. The group’s delegation held a meeting with joint commissioner of police (traffic) Mayanksinh Chawda on Tuesday and made a presentation on the stretches already audited. “We have asked the group to send workable solutions to the traffic issues,” Chawda said. “Also, we request citizens to send their issues and solutions to the traffic department of the city. We will evaluate the issues and try to work out solutions.” Traffic experts Amit Khatri and Samir Kakkad have taken up the initiative and have formed teams of volunteers to audit various parts of the city. The group has already begun the exercise in Ghatlodia and a few other areas. The group’s volunteers spread across Ahmedabad ensure that people track the traffic jams in their areas.“Minor solutions were found for some traffic problems. They included moving hawkers away from U-turns, trimming the centre verge, and keeping left turns free,” Khatri said. “People said that even those measures alleviated traffic flow problems and reduced noise pollution drastically.” Khatri said that the aim of the movement is not only to ensure people participation but also to raise awareness among citizens about the problems they face daily. The group has already urged authorities to make left turns free. The idea is being implemented. Khatri said that in line with the proposal, no encroachment will be allowed on a 50 metre stretch near the turns on either side. Autorickshaws will not be allowed to stop in that zone, the proposal says. Kakkad said the group has suggested that there should be proper signages 50 metres ahead of left turns so that no person takes a turn by mistake. He said that the group has requested traffic police to appoint an ACP-level officer as the nodal in-charge for a particular area. Khatri said that the group has identified the problems at RTO Circle and has offered solutions to smoothen the traffic movement. He said that in the second phase, CCTV-based surveillance on the free left turns will be proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/traffic-smart-citizens-intel-for-smooth-ride/articleshow/85606959.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

At the state-level protest rally of the CPF Employees Union of Punjab here for the restoration of the old pension scheme, Cheema said the AAP will accept all the legitimate demands of the working class. He said: “Employees are the administration’s backbone but the Congress government is suppressing them. First it discontinued the old pension scheme in 2004 and then closed the avenues for government jobs by implementing a contract system. It robbed lakhs of Punjab employees of their jobs in the name of restructuing advised by the sixth state pay commission.” He accused even the former Congress MPs and MLAs of “robbing the exchequer by keeping unnecessary advisers and allowances, while denying pension to those who had served the government for 30 years”. Cheema claimed that 1.5 lakh raw, ad-hoc, contract, and outsourced workers in the state had poverty-level wages for the last 12 years but the Congress government had not regularised their jobs despite its election promise. The LoP accused the state of abolishing allowances given for transport, urban housing, cash care, and family planning, besides scrapping NPAs of doctors, secretariat staff and drivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/old-pension-plan-to-be-in-aap-manifesto-lop/articleshow/85609028.cms||---

If homework is incomplete the next day, he feels like leaving class. Sometimes, he cries just because he feels the teacher has neglected him and not asking questions,” said Prachi, who feels online education is really stressful. Vijay Powar’s son Amit is in class 8 and he now owns a separate mobile phone. “While checking his phone another day, I was shocked to find some adult content saved in it. It’s not possible to stop giving a mobile phone to him. So, I am now worried about how to deal with this. Kids are more techno-savvy and they know how to hide files better than us,” he said. Not only students, but parents are also facing psychological problems while coping up the online schooling, online examinations. Especially, parents whose children struggle with distance learning are now experiencing depression, have trouble in sleeping and some of them are losing interest or pleasure in their work. Psychiatrist Dr Nikhil Pande said that he has seen several cases in which parents are under tremendous stress due to online education. “Those who have kids in KGs have to sit along with them all the time. School time used to provide some me-time to housemaker mothers. Now, they are doing double duty — house chores plus attending schools,” said Dr Pande. He said, parents of adolescent kids are under stress because they feel their wards may fall prey to adult content or online scams. A recent international study has found that heightened levels of mental distress were felt by parents across all socioeconomic categories, regardless of family income or the number of days that had passed since school closure. “While everyone is talking about the struggle of children and teachers during online classes, no one speaks about parents,” said Sakshi Patel, whose daughter is 12-year-old. “I have not given an individual cell phone to my daughter. She uses mine. Now my phone remains engage for three hours during class and three hours for homework. It’s full of school PDFs and study material,” she said. Psychologist Prashant Hiranwar said that school reopening will be the ultimate solution to parents’ issues. “Mothers are worst sufferers in this phase. Teachers want full school-like education and students really struggle in an online format. Mothers are sandwiched in between,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/online-school-affecting-parents-mental-health-too/articleshow/85606956.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

R M Patel, chief engineer SSNNL (Dam) in an official statement said, “Medha Patkar’s recent statement on seepage through Sardar Sarovar Dam has no significance and is a futile attempt to mislead.” Patel added, “Seepage through concrete is a usual phenomenon for any dam and accordingly the maintenance of dams is done. Sardar Sarovar Dam has been storing water for a long period and any man-made concrete structure requires maintenance and repair at the end of such a long period. The seepage is well within the permissible limits and normal maintenance of the same has been taken up in time by the dam authorities according to recommendations of the DSRP (Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP) and no endangerment to safety has ever been noticed.” The official further said, “Actually, the DSRP has advised lowering of the reservoir level for maintenance of dam surface from upstream side, which is a normal practice in any such dam. DSRP has been regularly monitoring the health of the dam and there is no need to make a fuss of it.” The chief engineer said, “The Sardar Sarovar Dam has been last inspected on 24th to26th July 2021 by DSRP and it has been found “primarily safe” ie. in category II as per the latest dam safety standards promulgated by the Central Water Commission.” “Sardar Sarovar Dam has been under constant criticism by some lobbies but the fact is that the dam has proven the life line of Gujarat and in the time of crisis due to lean monsoon like this year, survival of the people of the state depend solely of Narmada water”, Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ssnnl-rubbishes-medha-patkars-charges/articleshow/85606986.cms||---

---||Mumbai||When cops from three cities reached Ratnagiri to nab Union minister Narayan Rane||MUMBAI: BJP national president J P Nadda called the arrest of Union MSME minister Narayan Rane “a violation of constitutional values.” BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said, “The BJP does not support Rane’s statement against the chief minister. But we do not support the government’s actions. The government is misusing the police to take revenge. We are strongly behind him.” BJP also recalled the frequent use of violent language by Shiv Sena’s leaders against its rivals, especially a video of an Uddhav Thackeray speech in 2018 saying he “felt like hitting Yogi Adityanath with his own footwear” for allegedly disrespecting Chhatrapati Shivaji. Sena MP Sanjay Raut defended Rane’s arrest, saying, “When someone threatens to hit the chief minister, won’t there be action from police and courts?” Sena MP Vinayak Raut wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Rane’s removal from the Union cabinet. The NCP which is part of the MVA government also objected to Rane’s statement. “An insult to the chief minister is an insult to the people of Maharashtra,” said NCP minister Jayant Patil. Before his arrest, Rane said, “I said if I was there, I would have slapped the chief minister. I did not say I will slap him. So, this is not an offence. When the chief minister said a BJP MLC Prasad Lad’s face should be broken, why was no action taken against him?” The bad blood between Rane and the Shiv Sena goes back a long way. The Union minister had begun his political career with the Sena and rose to become chief minister in 1999. He had exited the party in 2005, after challenging Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership. The Sena had reacted immediately to Rane’s statement against Thackeray, with a party worker lodging a complaint against him in Raigad’s Mahad taluka on Monday evening. On Monday night, Rane moved to the adjoining Ratnagiri district. By Tuesday morning, over 500 Yuva Sena workers gathered outside his house in Juhu, ostensibly in response to a tweet from his son Nitesh, “daring" them to do so. The demonstration snowballed into violence as Sainiks clashed with BJP supporters resulting in police lathi charge. The two groups pelted stones at each other. The Sainiks broke police barricades leading to Rane’s residence. Ten policemen and two Sena workers were injured. In Thane, Kalyan and Ulhasnagar, Sainiks protested. In Kalyan, Sainiks ransacked the BJP office. Five FIRs were lodged against Sena and BJP workers in Mumbai and MMR. Protests were reported from Nashik, Solapur, Kolhapur and Vidarbha as well. By Tuesday afternoon, Rane had moved to the Golwalkar memorial project site in Ratnagiri after holding a party meeting. He was detained by Ratnagiri police superintendent Mohit Kumar Garg and taken to Sangameshwar police station where he was handed over to a Raigad police team. BJP workers protested inside the police station and later blocked the Mumbai Goa highway. Rane was later taken to Mahad where the controversial statement had been made. Police teams from Pune, Nashik and Raigad had sought Rane’s detention. He was arrested by Raigad police and produced before a magistrate in Mahad, who granted him bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-500-sena-workers-gather-outside-rane-home-10-cops-hurt-in-clash/articleshow/85609099.cms||---
---||Lucknow||4-yr flexible UG course plan gets LU academic body nod||Lucknow: Over 1.5 lakh students of Lucknow University and its 524 affiliated colleges will pursue four-year undergraduate course designed in accordance with the New Education Policy (NEP)-2020 from the next academic session expected to start from September. During a meeting on Tuesday, the academic council (AC) put the final stamp on the four-year syllabi prepared by the LU faculty members. With the academic council’s approval, LU is now among the first few universities to adopt four-year UG programme. In May this year, the government had prepared a Common Minimum Syllabus (CMS), claimed to be formulated in accordance with NEP-2020, and directed all state universities to adopt the syllabus. CMS faced strong opposition from LU faculty members who said the government’s syllabus did not offer students greater employability on taking an exit from the course at every stage. They said the concepts and practicals recommended in CMS were not suitable for affiliated colleges as they didn’t have the required infrastructure, expertise and resources. The teachers also claimed that the university was currently offering a better syllabus than CMS. The Common Minimum Syllabus was rejected by the commerce, science, law and arts faculty boards, while the education department accepted it with the condition that it would adopt CMS in future. Later, LU teachers drafted their own syllabus which was passed by all academic bodies – board of studies, faculty board and academic council. According to the four-year UG course structure and syllabus drafted by LU, a student will learn vocational skills, undergo internship and will have the flexibility to study subjects of other streams as well. Also, the four-year UG courses with multiple entries and exit options will allow students to build their own degrees. A student will get a certificate after a year’s programme, an advanced diploma after two years, a Bachelor’s degree after three years, and a Bachelor’s with research after four years of study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/4-yr-flexible-ug-course-plan-gets-lu-academic-body-nod/articleshow/85609061.cms||---

The government faced opposition from unexpected quarters, Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, Gujarat, a teachers’ union affiliated to the RSS. The outfit, registered in March this year, had called for a boycott of such surveys. Officials in the state education department, however, claimed that the survey was a success. “This is clearly a victory for our organization and the teachers of this state against the bureaucratic rule of this government,” said Ghanshyam Patel, the chairman of the mahasangh. “We had time and again asked the government to withdraw its decision but it did not listen to us. It is a waste of public money and resources.” Patel added: “Teachers were firm and stood united in their fight against this injustice.” Senior officials in the state education department had earlier expressed confidence that more than 80% of the teachers would participate in the survey. “This is the largest Diagnostic Training Need Assessment Survey of teachers ever done in any state of India. This data will be extremely useful in designing customized, targeted and focused training programmes,” said Vinod Rao, Gujarat’s education secretary. “Lakhs of man-hours of non-productive training will be saved. It is unprecedented for any state in India.” Rao went on to say: “The usual sample size of such assessments is 5-10%. We have achieved 35% which is huge.” Of the 1.51 lakh teachers eligible, about 56,000 took the survey on Tuesday. Cluster resource centre teachers, Divyang teachers, and school inspectors were exempt from the survey. Before the entry of the mahasangh, there was only one major organization for primary school teachers, called the State Primary Teachers’ Association. “They usually engaged in a dialogue with the government and such large-scale protests were not common,” an expert said. Members of the mahasangh said that such surveys are not carried out anywhere in India. In Ahmedabad West, of the 25 centres for teachers’ survey, 22 were vacant, said sources. In Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation run schools, only 27 teachers of the 4,400 participated, sources said. This first-of-its-kind survey was not compulsory, the government had clarified on Monday. The two-hour survey was run on Tuesday for teachers of Classes 1 to 8 of government-run primary schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teachers-quality-survey-govt-union-both-claim-win/articleshow/85607018.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 100% first dose by September may be a target too far||BHOPAL: Till date, around 3.35 crore people out of around 5.5 crore eligible people have already been vaccinated against Covid-19 with first dose in Madhya Pradesh. But administering at least the first dose of vaccine to all the eligible people by September end still seems to be a tough call, said sources. In the next two days —from August 25 to August 26 — the state government will be carrying out a mega vaccination drive, with a target to vaccinate at least 30 lakh people in two days. Health officials said, around 35 lakh vaccine doses are available for two days and target of vaccinating at least 20 lakh people on first day and 10 lakh people on the second day has been set. Though the government will be vaccinating around 30 lakh people in next two days, there are 48 lakh people whose second dose of vaccination is due, said sources. The entire month so far where MP has been among the top 3 states in the country on a day-to-day basis, only around 83 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in August. As there are around 5.5 crore eligible beneficiaries in the state and only around 3.35 crore have been vaccinated with the first dose, there are around 2 crore individuals who need to be vaccinated in September to ensure that every eligible individual in the state has at least received one dose, thus, vaccination will have to be done at double the speed of what was done in the month of August, added sources. Though it is not impossible but the major issue is availability of vaccines, sources said. Additional chief secretary health, Mohammed Suleman could not be contacted to comment over the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/100-first-dose-by-sept-may-be-a-target-too-far/articleshow/85607019.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Nagpur||Now, support pours in globally for Ganga Jamuna FSWs||Nagpur: Support is pouring in for the female sex workers (FSWs) of Ganga Jamuna from international activists, feminists and scholars in the form of an online signature campaign. They have expressed concern over the deprivation of livelihood which the women and their families are facing since August 11. The campaign initiated by National Network of Sex Workers (NNSW), an umbrella organization of various NGOs and community-based organizations, received support of around 3,000 signees, which included researchers from the UK. One of them is from the prestigious Essex university. English Collective of Prostitutes from UK and a research scholar from Utrecht University in Netherlands too were among the signees. Sex workers from other states too extended their support through the signature campaign. Meena Seshu, representing Sex Worker and Allies South Asia (SWASA), said the campaign got an impromptu support from various corners of the globe and the country. She had written in the signature campaign that ‘unbelievable that the Maharashtra police are so blind to the government policy of recognizing ‘Veshya Vyavasay’ and providing monetary assistance to sex workers as part of Covid-19 itself’. One of the sex workers from Sangli, Kiran Deshmukh, who is part of NNSW, said sex workers of Ganga Jamuna have passed a 10-point resolution of not supporting minors working in brothels and shall not solicit on roads, among others. “We have decided to alert police regarding minors engaged as sex workers at brothels here and shall stand at the doors of our houses to solicit customers, but not go on the roads. The resolutions were handed over to Lakadganj police,” she said, adding that the sex workers would continue to agitate peacefully. City police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said he welcomed the resolutions of not allowing minors and also refraining from soliciting on the roads. “I raised questions on the resolution as to why it is silent on the aspect of existence and operations of brothels which is illegal as per law. Let the sex workers take a stand on the brothels too now,” he said. City police, which had forced stop prostitution here and also curbed entries of visitors to the brothels, are now set to issue a fresh notification related to Ganga Jamuna under section 7 (1) (b) of the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act (ITPA), 1956. This notification would declare Ganga Jamuna as a ‘public place’ within the radius of an educational institute, MSEDCL office, few religious structures, schools and hospitals, where prostitution would be declared illegal under the law. In the past, Kumar had also issued a notification under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) prohibiting outsiders visiting the lanes of Ganga Jamuna to access brothels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-support-pours-in-globally-for-ganga-jamuna-fsws/articleshow/85607021.cms||Soumitra Bose

Almost all the tickets for viewing the monument under moonlight on Tuesday, the last day for such viewing, were sold out a day before. The monument was reopened for night viewing on Saturday after over one year. It was shut on March 17, 2020, when a lockdown was imposed across the country due to Covid-19. Since night curfew still continues across Uttar Pradesh from 10pm to 6am, only three slots out of the eight available for viewing were opened from 8:30pm to 10pm. ASI officials said that on the first day, only 135 tickets were sold. And on the second day, the count went down to 74 tickets. But the last day turned out to be a near house full as 147 tickets were booked by tourists to see the monument at night. In every slot, 50 tourists are allowed according to guidelines of the Supreme Court. The tickets for seeing Taj at night are booked one day in advance from ASI’s office counter. In December 1999, the Supreme Court had banned visitors’ entry into the monument after 7pm on grounds of security. However, after repeated demands from the tourism industry, the apex court in November 2004 made some amendmends in its earlier order and allowed ASI to start the facility at the Taj for five days in a month. However, it is not allowed on Fridays and during the month of Ramzan in accordance with the Supreme Court directive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/night-viewing-of-taj-mahal-all-tickets-sold-out-on-last-day/articleshow/85604434.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The education department in consultation with the district administration has prepared a circular mentioning the parameters to focus on by the school managements before reopening. They were instructed to ensure the cleanliness of toilets and overhead water tanks, the facilities to be cleaned, sanitised and chlorinated. Since several schools were utilised by the health department and Trichy Corporation to conduct vaccination drives, instructions were given to keep the furniture sanitised. “Most of the teachers were already vaccinated at least with one dose. If required, the district administration has assured to provide adequate vaccines to vaccinate the school education department employees before the reopening day,” a source said. “We will disinfect all the schools in our zones. Private schools which have helped us in holding vaccination camps, can also be disinfected, if sought,” a sanitary official said. The civic body has allotted four sanitary workers per school, all equipped with mechanised sprayers. In addition to the SOP, the education department will send another circular mentioning the mandatory practices required even after the schools are reopened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/540-schools-to-be-disinfected-in-next-three-days-in-trichy/articleshow/85607016.cms||---

This, because the affiliation of these colleges was transferred from Kanpur’s Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj University to LU a few months ago. “We were paying Rs 1000 as examination fees and around Rs 300 as enrollment fees. For us, LU’s new structure would be 2-3 times higher,” said a student. LU executive council on Tuesday decided to reduce exam fee in every semester by about 25% and enrolment fee up to 50%. The examination fee till now was Rs 4,000, which now has been reduced to Rs 3,000. The enrolment fees differ from subject to subject and the maximum amount charged was Rs 1000, which now will be Rs 500. Around a lakh students study in 344 affiliated colleges in Lakhimpur Kheri, Rae Bareli, Sitapur and Hardoi, while only 50,000 students study in 180 colleges located in Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-reduces-fee-but-all-wont-benefit/articleshow/85609094.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Trichy||Cloth bag manufacturers stare at uncertain future||Trichy: Cloth bag manufacturers are facing a bleak future as its demand has plummeted owing to its high costs apart from poor enforcement of ban on plastic bags. Several cloth bag production units and other environment-friendly bag production centres have shut operations due to the fall in demand. The restrictions on organising events after the pandemic has also dwindled the demand and has reduced production volume by half. During the 2019-20, as plastic ban was widely enforced, the need for alternative products was taken up by traders. Cloth bags and carry bags made of tapioca and corn starch were opted as alternatives fearing penalisation. But things changed after Covid-19 pandemic, as survival became a question, traders opted for ignored alternatives that are costlier than plastic bags. “Two years back, we were producing 1,000 cloth bags per day, now it is down to 300. We had six workers in our unit and three of them migrated to other well-paying jobs. Fall in demand is testing our survival and many have closed,” said Ramesh Karuppiah, a cloth bag manufacturer in Cuddalore. While big outlets still circulate cloth or paper bags, mid-level shops and hotels have returned to plastic carry bags available in abundance. “As plastic ban enforcement is missing, people and traders are not in a compulsion to use cloth bags. Our production volume is down by 75% now,” Yellow Bags Foundation co-founder Krishnan Subramanian said. A 15% price rise in the cost of cotton fabric is another factor for the drop in its demand. “Since April 2020, we gradually stopped circulating degradable carry bags made of tapioca starch. Distributors faced a huge loss as plastic carry bags are back,” said S Ram Prakash, tapioca bag distributor. As the sector remains highly unorganised, the cloth bag and environment-friendly carry bag manufacturers sought the state government and local bodies to pitch in and encourage the usage of environment-friendly products again through awareness drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cloth-bag-manufacturers-stare-at-uncertain-future/articleshow/85607020.cms||Deepak Karthik

The woman was admitted to the hospital after she became pregnant despite undergoing a tubectomy procedure three years back. Police sources identified the deceased as V Rani, from Alangudi in Pollachi. After delivering a baby three years ago at Pudukkottai government hospital, Rani, reportedly, underwent tubectomy, a birth control procedure.  On Monday, she underwent surgery to remove a portion of fallopian tube but was said to have developed allergies and succumbed during the surgery. The family members, who initially agreed to receive the victim’s body, later staged a protest on Tuesday.  As the hospital management explained the relatives the medical complication involved, the family members later received the victim’s body.

The move to expand Trichy and Thanjavur corporations will complement the growth of the two cities located at a close distance. “Trichy missed the recent metropolitan development authority proposal for the tier-ii cities. After the expansion, Trichy city should also get an authority to ensure equal growth in all zones,” Dr M A Aleem, member, Trichy district welfare fund committee, said. Residents said that the city area must be expanded covering Thuvakudi municipality and suburbs of Samayapuram to utilise the land bank available on Thanjavur and Chennai national highways respectively. Trichy Corporation sources said that a preliminary study on the expansion had already commenced by enumerating the population and area of the adjoining village panchayats. While Trichy Corporation is heading for an expansion after 2011, it is the maiden expansion plan for Thanjavur since it has been upgraded as a municipal corporation in 2014. It is said that urbanised town panchayats and village panchayats adjoining the corporation areas will be amalgamated. “The government should appoint an IAS officer as commissioner for Kumbakonam Corporation. The scope for urban development and fund availability will improve,” A Giri, a social activist from Kumbakonam, said. Thanjavur district has two municipal corporations now, which include Kumbakonam. Similarly, Musiri and Lalgudi town panchayats in the Trichy district were upgraded as municipalities. In Karur, Punjaipugalur and TNPL Pugalur will be merged to form a new municipality, the minister announced. Similarly, Adirampattinam town panchayat in Thanjavur district was also upgraded as a municipality. An underground drainage project and a new bus terminus was also planned at Mannargudi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/central-region-hails-expansion-plan-for-trichy-thanjavur-corpns/articleshow/85607050.cms||---

On the first day, almost every third candidate appearing for Bachelor in Vocational Studies (BVoc) in renewable energy and every fourth candidate in Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communication (BJMC) skipped the test despite the fact that the university received an overwhelming response to its various UG courses this year as compared to last year. The entrance tests will continue till August 31. According to experts, the reason behind students skipping the test was the fact that a number of other universities and colleges have begun admitting students on basis of 10+2 marks. For such students, LU was just a backup option. In the two professional courses, a total of 133 candidates appeared for the test. Around 37% of the candidates skipped the BVoc examination held in the first shift. Only 26 candidates of the total 41 registered for the BVoc examination appeared. For the BJMC admissions, around 49% of the candidates skipped the entrance test. A total of 208 candidates had registered but only 107 turned up. “This time students have scored really well hence the creamy layer has only opted LU as a backup option. In other places, admission is through 10+2 marks basis and the creamy layer has already secured the place in the first cut-off list or is confident about getting admission due to high scores,” said an expert. The candidates, meanwhile, turned up on the campus wearing masks, holding sanitizers and maintained social distancing. Most candidates said the entrance paper was moderate to tough. “Covid-19 protocol could be easily maintained during the entrance test as less number of candidates had turned up. The examination was a tough one especially the section that tested candidates’ knowledge in general awareness,” said Ankita Singh, one of the aspirants. “The examination was held maintaining Covid-19 protocol. On Wednesday, in the first shift, the Bachelor in Elementary Education entrance test will be held from 11am to 12.30pm while in the second shift BSc (Maths) entrance test will be held from 3pm to 4.30pm,” said admission coordinator Prof Pankaj Mathur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/50-aspirants-skip-lu-bjmc-entrance-exam/articleshow/85609124.cms||---

We had been waiting to return home. In the first week of August, we were informed to keep the grab bag ready in case of an evacuation. We never expected to leave all of a sudden,” said Prasad Anand, 40, at his residence at Kaneer Thota near Thokottu on Monday. Prasad worked as an accountant in Kabul. He arrived in Delhi from Qatar on Sunday and reached Mangaluru on Monday morning. He told TOI: “I have been in Afghanistan since 2013 and had no problems. However, once the Taliban took over, there was uncertainty and tension. Out of about 130 employees working for the UK-based company, at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, a NATO base, 35 were Indians. A NATO evacuation was arranged and we were airlifted by the C-17 aircraft. We were worried if there would be visa or permit issues in Qatar. The company gave assurance they would take care of everything and did accordingly. We spent about three days in Qatar and were even given an RT-PCR test exemption. Representatives from the Indian embassy in Qatar were constantly with us and took good care of us and ensured that we boarded the India-based airliner and even provided us with food. We landed in Delhi on Sunday at 5am, but there was a delay in conducting the RT PCR test in Delhi,” he said. Prasad said that he will have to start looking for job opportunities. His wife Bhavila said, “We have spent a week in tension and uncertainty and praying for his safe return. Our kids Daivik, 9, and Medansh, 3, are excited about their father’s return.’’ Murali Raj, his brother, and businessman said, “Television reports had left us worried. Our family and friends kept inquiring about his safety. When he informed that he had boarded a flight to Mangaluru, we were relieved.” Meanwhile, four other Mangalureans including Jagadish Poojary from Moodbidri, Dinesh Rai from Bajpe, Desmond David D’Souza from Kinnigoli and Shravan Anchan from Urva are expected to land around 8.30pm on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/its-a-big-relief-to-be-back-home-from-afghan-returnee/articleshow/85573406.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Death of fish in Teppakulam tank at Rockfort has flagged up the increasing plastic pollution as an indicator of the lapses in waste management, environmental activists said. But, the civic body blamed it on the pandemic, saying that it was busy with the work to contain Covid-19. After December 2020, Trichy Corporation has not conducted any major enforcement drive to seize banned plastic products. Although the city has no plastic carry bag production units, inflow of the banned plastic products from other states and districts continue. Acknowledging the lapses in enforcement, corporation officials said that there is a 5% surge in plastic waste after the lockdown relaxations. “Plastic waste segregation is not happening. People use plastic carry bags to dump their waste in vacant plots and on roads,” K C Neelamegam, environmental activist, said. “There is a surge in plastic waste but we have not exactly quantified the change. We initially plan to warn the traders and vendors to stop using plastic carry bags,” a senior corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plastic-bags-in-use-sans-enforcement/articleshow/85607032.cms||---
---||Delhi||Decks cleared for 4-year undergraduate programme plan at Delhi University||NEW DELHI: Delhi University’s Academic Council approved the adoption of the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) as proposed by the New Education Policy implementation committee. After 16 members submitted their dissent against the recommendation of the NEP committee, the council passed the decision late on Tuesday night to implement the new system from the next academic session. The proposal will now go to the university’s Executive Council. There is much dissent against the adoption of the four-year system. Throughout the day Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) protested outside the meeting venue. Inside, three AC members belonging to the Democratic Teachers Front broached the subject of DU immediately liaising with the University Grants Commission to facilitate relief to ad hoc teachers over the stipulation that they must have a PhD degree to qualify to teach in the university departments. DUTA president Rajib Ray said, “We warn the university against repeating the fiasco of 2013 when FYUP was approved in a top-down manner without discussing its desirability and feasibility. DUTA demands that the FYUP decision be referred to the statutory bodies at all levels for wide discussions. These provisions will lead to a drastic cut in workload and retrenchment of teachers. Fixing 2022-23 as the year to implement the new system showed DU was ready to go ahead without discussion.” The protesting teachers also pointed out that the Union government, which is pushing the New Education Policy, has not assured of grants required for the expansion of the undergraduate programme to a fourth year. As Ray claimed, “The university and its colleges are still awaiting grants for additional infrastructure and faculty promised for EWS expansion in 2019.” He added, “The addition of an extra year will place a huge burden on expenditure for students without substantive gain over the current Honours programme.” DUTA also feels that the multiple entry-exit system (MEES) will lead to an increased dropout rate, affecting more women and students from the marginalised and underprivileged sections. “Certificates and diplomas are paper documents. Students will always be considered dropouts in the job market,” Ray maintained. AC also discussed at length other issues such as absorption of ad-hoc teachers into permanent faculty, promotions, relief to families who succumbed to Covid-19 and an increase in the scholarships for PhD programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/decks-cleared-for-4-yr-ug-plan-at-du/articleshow/85607083.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Ludhiana||‘Measurement books not being maintained’||Ludhiana: City activist Rohit Sabharwal has raised the issue of poor maintenance of measurement books (MBs) with the local bodies department principal secretary. He says according to rules, the MBs, which are for development works, are to be filled on the spot on a daily basis by the officers concerned of the municipal corporation bridges and road branch. The books mention the date of the execution of work to ensure transparency.“But it is not being recorded in the MBs on a day-to-day basis that how much work has been carried out and how much material has been used. It is also mandatory for the officers concerned to put their initials against the dates on which the MBs are filed,” he says. “Instead of filling the required particulars on a daily basis, the MC officers concerned provide the information later on. An expert can check this practice… if all MBs are filed with one pen, then these were filed in one day and not daily. Besides, the officers concerned have failed to verify in the books that how much work (percentage-wise) has been checked by them,” he adds.Admitting that they could not fill the MBs regularly, an MC official says, “Staff paucity makes it difficult to visit every site where work is going on. The authorities are not hiring more technical staff to execute things properly.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal says, “When the issue of missing MBs had come to my knowledge, I had marked an inquiry and many of these were deposited in the MC records. Now, I will get this issue checked on the ground.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/measurement-books-not-being-maintained/articleshow/85604447.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Dhote, Pande raising same issue differently, says NCP city chief Pethe||Nagpur: NCP’s city urban cell president Jwala Dhote and her party’s state general secretary Abha Pande targeted each other without mincing any words on the issue of closure of the red-light area Ganga Jamuna last week. However, NCP city president Duneshwar Pethe tried to explain away the differences with a more ‘politically correct’ reaction to the face-off. Pethe also denied there was any rift or increasing discord in the city NCP as their mentor, ex-home minister and Katol MLA Anil Deshmukh was out of action due to the ED probe. Dhote was raising a voice against police action to close down the red-light area and declare brothels illegal, which had jeopardized the livelihood of sex workers. Pande and her group were clamouring for a complete end to prostitution and removal of their dens. Pande was also underlining the issue of rehabilitation. Pethe said Dhote and Pande may be sounding different in front of the media but their objective is similar. “One group (Dhote) is protesting police action of barricading and locking down the place, which is hampering livelihood. The other group is talking about rehabilitating the prostitutes elsewhere, so that their basic necessities are met. I don’t find much difference in their views,” said Pethe, who is also the only corporator of his party in city. On his party’s stand, Pethe said the NCP supports the police crackdown on minors in prostitution, trafficking of women and girls, illegal activities and any anti-social elements at the red-light area. At the same time, he said there should be a viable alternative to their livelihood. “We have decided to call for a coordination meeting on the issue of Ganga Jamuna among the leaders. We will decide on an amicable line of action and also meet senior police officers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dhote-pande-raising-same-issue-differently-says-ncp-city-chief-pethe/articleshow/85607064.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Hyderabad||‘Fix your health first, then attend to others’||Q. We know how difficult it is for the family when a member contracts Covid-19, especially if he/she is hospitalized. It has serious implications on their mental health. What can they do to tackle this? -- Bhasker Chintala A. It is quite natural to feel stressed and worried when someone in your family or a close relative contracts Covid-19. Anxiety is paramount when one of them is hospitalised and you are caught in the dilemma of being concerned about their health on the one side and the stress of your own well-being on the other side. It is extremely important that in such a situation you take care of your health first so that you are better equipped to take care of your family. The focus should be on a balanced diet, exercise and plenty of sleep. Hospital visits to meet the family member should be done only in case of an emergency and courtesy visits by all family members to hospital should not be encouraged (which is an Indian tradition). It is best to leave it to the hospital staff to take care of the hospitalized family member. You can connect with the person over mobile or on video chat, whenever possible. It is also extremely important to assess the level of exposure of family members if one member is tested positive -- like testing and quarantining. Once precautions are taken, ensure regular communication with other family members not staying with you and neighbours, while taking adequate precautions. Special care should be given to children in the family and should communicate to them about the situation and encourage them to follow Covid-19 guidelines, while strictly being in quarantine. It is also best for our mental health in this situation to avoid frequent messages on social media, like WhatsApp groups, which do not always offer authentic information. Q. What lifestyle changes do people need to make now to keep their mental health in check? --Nishtha Raghuwanshi A. Covid-19 has already brought major lifestyle changes in the past one-and-half years -- work-from-home, less physical contact with colleagues, friends and relatives, online schooling etc. Adapting to these changes has itself taken a lot of time and induced a lot of mental stress. However, we need to adhere to these lifestyle changes as the new normal. It is important to maintain a healthy routine and keep up with it on a regular basis -- good sleep, healthy food habits, exercise, relaxation, adequate rest etc. It is important to have social contact with some of your close family or friends either online or in person, but while adhering to all Covid-19 appropriate behavior. The pandemic has also taught us the importance of community engagement and such social engagements, to support frontline workers, can also give a lot of satisfaction. There should not be any fear about Covid-19 and discriminating against those affected by the virus should be completely avoided. They should, instead, be provided with support and respect. The children in the family must also be supported to adapt to this new environment and parents must give them extra time to make this process smooth. It is important that they stay in touch with friends and relatives to avoid excess dependency on gadgets although most of their schooling will be in online mode. Q. Some people are scared of taking the vaccine because of side effects. Are these fears reasonable? Should everyone get vaccinated against Covid-19? -- Nandikanti Sai Kumar A. As of now the vaccination for Covid-19 is voluntary. However, it is now being accepted that all get the full dose of the vaccine as it’s the only available major protection against the virus along with appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and maintaining social distance. All this is important for your own protection and to limit the spread of the disease among family, friends, co-workers and close contacts. There is now evidence available to ascertain that deaths are being averted among fully vaccinated populations as compared to those who are not vaccinated and ICMR has also reiterated that the new variants of Covid-19 may be prevented with the existing vaccines. There have been no major side effects of the vaccines and all countries are encouraging all their citizens to take the shots at the earliest. Q. Now that the government has officially said that the second wave is over, do we still need to follow the protocol of sanitizing/disinfecting surfaces at home? -- Priya Rao A. It is true that disinfection of surfaces is being recommended in high touch surfaces like door and window handles, kitchen, taps, gadgets, computer keyboards etc. This is being practiced not just at homes but also offices, schools, gyms, markets, public transport, restaurants etc. However recent studies from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shown that Covid-19 spread through surfaces poses very little risk as compared to it being spread as aerosols when affected persons cough, talk or breathe. Hence sanitizing and disinfecting surfaces need not be a compulsory procedure. However, if a family member is in quarantine or there are frequent visitors in the house, sanitizing and disinfecting surfaces at high touch surfaces can be followed. Washing hands regularly while at home will also give adequate protection. Q. When it becomes inevitable for someone to visit the hospital during these days, what factors do they need to bear in mind? -- P Narayan Reddy A. If it is inevitable to visit a hospital (especially one with Covid-19 patients) one must take extra precautions. Sanitise hands at regular intervals (most hospitals have provision for that) and strictly follow hospital advice on protocols (to visit a patient). Clean your hands before and after meeting the patient in the hospital and maintain adequate distance. If you are visiting the hospital for your non-Covid-19 related illnesses, follow all protocols provided by the hospital. Most hospitals carry out sanitization at regular intervals but there is still a possibility of catching an infection. Hence, apart from regular hand washing or using sanitizers, always wear a mask (preferably double mask). High-risk category people like pregnant women, the elderly and those with comorbidities should take extra care while visiting hospitals. Most hospitals have all their quality protocols in place so there is no need to fear about contracting the virus if you take all precautions. Q. What precautions do we need to take while using public transport apart from SMS (social distance, mask & sanitiser)? -- V Nagendra Kumar A. Public transport is one of the safest ways to commute across cities. With the right safety measures, public transport like trains, buses, and the metro can be Covid-19 safe. Apart from wearing masks and using hand sanitisers, the most prudent measure is to maintain social distance and avoid crowds. There is evidence from other countries to show that if adequate space is there between travellers in public transport, the risks are minimum. Authorities should ensure adequate supply of transport facilities during peak hours, frequent sanitising of the public transport and ensure contactless payment mechanisms. Q. What are the food habits (best diet) that one must follow to improve immunity levels in the present circumstances? -- Krishna Prasad A. It is well documented by international organizations like UNICEF that a good and balanced diet with high nutrition content is crucial for providing immunity and can help in reducing the impact of Covid-19 by fighting the virus. Individuals consuming well-balanced diets develop better immune systems that, in turn, lowers the incidence of chronic diseases and infections. The diet must include a high intake of fruits and vegetables, healthy snacks especially for children and no processed food (to be avoided as much as possible). Home-cooked food is the best as it provides maximum benefits. It has been recommended by nutritionists that a balanced diet must also include fish (for those who eat it), whole grains and nuts apart from adequate water. Q. When experts suggest living a ‘balanced life’, especially in a post-Covid-19 world, what do they mean? How does a social being balance his/her social life while adhering to new protocols? -- Prabhakaran A A. It is true that we need to adjust to the new normal and lead a balanced life by combining our social life and Covid-19 protocols. This is going to be the norm not just during the next potential third wave but also in any other pandemic situation that presents itself in the future. We need to remember that along with lives, livelihoods are also important. Our country has already made a few such changes over time. Many offices are now functioning at 50% capacity, restaurants and cinema theatres have opted for social distancing protocols, colleges and schools are partially opening for different batches and classes etc. There are efforts to better utilise open outdoor spaces for activities than to be in closed spaces, to prevent risks. Overcrowding at marriages, tourist places and other events – that can lead to the spread of the virus – have been reduced and the focus is on smaller manageable events. While working from home is the new normal to prevent risks of Covid-19, connecting with others during special and important events is also being encouraged. Q.9: Is our state prepared to handle a third wave, in case it hits us? -- Ritendra Mallick A. States and Union Territories in India are definitely prepared to tackle the third wave unlike the second wave where we were not fully equipped and had to face a lot of shortage in terms of beds, oxygen etc. The study by ASCI and FICCI on the lessons learnt from Second Wave of Covid-19 and recommendations for third wave highlight the need for focusing on treatment facilities – like beds for children in anticipation that children could be affected in third wave, proper referrals, avoiding shortage of oxygen, drugs and other essential items. It’s now evident that states with good healthcare systems are able to handle the crisis better as it affects not just the urban areas but also rural areas. Most of the states and UTs including Telangana have focused on improving health infrastructure, addressing shortages, enhancing vaccinations to prevent the impact of third wave while continuing testing and contact tracing especially in the wake of Delta variant. However, the challenge is we still have no clear idea as to when, where and who will be affected in the third wave. The health department of Telangana, public health experts and scientists have already cautioned citizens and asked them to not let their guard down and focus on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour as the third wave is inevitable. Healthcare communication is the key to creating awareness and many health departments have collaborated with organizations like UNICEF to provide effective communication in rural areas. Q. Should we worry more about seasonal ailments now more than Covid-19? We are hearing more about dengue and malaria now. -- Sumithra S A. Dengue and malaria are seasonal ailments that can be seen during the monsoon season. Health departments usually take precautions to prevent these illnesses each year and dedicate preventive programmes. However, the challenge now is that many of the symptoms for dengue, malaria and Covid-19 are the same. This makes diagnosis and subsequent treatment a tad difficult. Precautions taken against Covid-19 like wearing masks have led to reduced respiratory illnesses. Similarly, as per protocol, personal hygiene and keeping the house and nearby areas in good condition and thus preventing mosquito breeding will not only help in preventing Covid-29 but also help fight malaria and dengue. From a health policy point of view, the department should definitely give continued importance to vector borne diseases along with Covid-19.

The objective of the initiative is three-pronged: Regulation of tourism activities, generation of revenue for the locals and managing eco-tourism activities with assistance from locals. Eco trails allow the forest department to control the number of people flocking to a natural destination, depending on the capacity of each such spot. Enthusiasts can buy these tickets on the forest department website. Given its proximity to Bengaluru, Bisle Ghat has the potential to evolve into a major natural tourist destination. Deputy conservator of forests KN Basavaraju said that the proposal to notify the three trekking trails would be submitted to the Karnataka Eco Tourism Development Board (KEDB). “We are working on the technical glitches. The idea is to rope in the locals and help them garner income through this initiative. Village forest committees will be formed under the supervision of the forest department. Members of these committees will monitor trekking activity, and alert us in case any illegal activity such as felling of trees or poaching is afoot in the woods. The committees will also be entrusted the responsibility of issuing tickets. One of the committee members will be trained as a guide by the KEDB, and receive renumeration from the forest department,” Basavaraju said. However, the boundaries of these paths are yet to be decided, the DCF added. He further added that a list of ‘dos and don’ts’ would be erected on a board, and tourists’ belongings would be screened to ensure they did not carry plastic into the woods. “They should return with all their belongings that they carried into the forest,” Basavaraju added. Sakleshpur-based environmentalist Kishore Kumar welcomed the initiative, which he said would ensure that visitors’ activities were monitored, and mischief prevented. Arasikere-based trekker Yuvaraj and Ravish Hulikal, a hiker from Sakleshpur, too welcomed the forest department’s move. “Trekking must help create awareness about the environment, and help study biodiversity. Roping in locals is laudable since they play a vital role in the conservation of forests,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/forest-dept-to-notify-three-trekking-paths-at-bisle-ghat/articleshow/85573463.cms||---

While science says they don’t need to get jabbed for three months at least, the state requires people to be fully vaccinated in order to board local trains or even enter a shopping mall. It means that a recovered person would have to wait a minimum of four to six months before they can get both the jabs and produce a vaccine certificate showing their eligibility for relaxations such as for train travel. The first three months being the waiting period for vaccination post recovery and the next one to three months being the interval between vaccine doses. “A person who has recently recovered from the infection has the antibodies and is as good as being vaccinated,” said Dr Sunil Arora, professor of immunology at PGI Chandigarh and president of the Indian Immunology Society. In his opinion, such individuals should be allowed to board a local train. Government decisions are based on scientific advice, which can be reconsidered based on emerging evidence, he said. A civic official also acknowledged that the full vaccination mandate was a hurdle for recent Covid patients. “Some of them have already spent a lot of time and money to recover and now they cannot return to work or businesses using a train,” an assistant municipal commissioner told TOI. In Mumbai, around 250-300 people test positive for Covid-19 daily. In August, over 6,000 people tested positive, although there is no data to show how many had taken single or both doses. The state’s decision to allow only fully vaccinated people into local trains has been contested by a few public health experts too. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a public policy expert, had previously told TOI that such a decision should have had exceptions, including allowing people who have taken a single dose to take trains. The state Covid-19 task force had backed the full vaccination mandate saying it was a “global yardstick” to allow relaxations. A state official said there were also concerns of lower antibodies in people who had a mild infection or were asymptomatic.  Dr Arora, though, is clear a person who has recovered from Covid-19 is protected for three months at the least. “The Centre’s decision is based on scientific evidence, so why push a person to get vaccinated early even if it’s harmless,” said Dr Arora. Epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil took the debate further and said India’s vaccine policy has undermined the role of natural immunity completely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/post-covid-limbo-no-access-to-trains-malls-as-vax-mths-away/articleshow/85602992.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The police have added sections of Prevention of Atrocities Act-1989 to the charges slapped on the accused belonging to non-scheduled caste and non-scheduled tribe communities. Police sources informed that 13 accused arrested on Sunday night were produced before the JMFC court on Monday. The court had sent four accused — Santosh Panchal, Amol Shinde, Dadarao Kotambe and Datta Kamble — in police custody for one day, while the remaining were sent in magisterial remand. The 10 accused arrested on Tuesday include Shashikant Karade, Dinesh Sonkamble, Sahebrao Paud, Keshav Kamble, Manohar Dise, Bhagant Shinde, Vaijnath Shinde, Datta Telang, Vitthal Shinde, and Vitthal Panchal. They were produced before the JMFC court in Rajura and sent in police custody for two days. The four accused, whose PCR ended on Tuesday, were also produced before the court and sent in MCR. Four women, who went into alleged spirit possession and named Kamble and Huke families for practising “back magic”, are still under treatment of psychiatrists in Chandrapur GMCH. Their arrest is learnt to be imminent on discharge, if the doctors declare them sane. Sources informed that more people, including some women from the village, are likely to be arrested. Additional superintendent of police Atul Kulkarni confirmed atrocity charges being slapped on some non-SC and non-ST accused.

Two people, including a woman have been arrested in connection with the murder. According to police, the deceased has been identified as Selvakumar, a native Thillankadu village near Sethubavachathiram in Thanjavur district. He was found dead near a crematorium in Karambakadu with multiple injuries. Police arrested the victim’s relative Ramalingam, 38, and another relative Sudha, 44, a resident of a nearby village Poongudikadu on Tuesday. Police said Selvakumar’s wife had died eight years ago. Two months ago, Ramalingam’s wife Subashini, 32, had died by suicide. Meanwhile, Sudha had told Ramalingam that Selvakumar’s sexual harassment was the reason for Subashini’s death. Ramalingam, who was enraged at this, hatched a plan to eliminate Selvakumar. He waited near the crematorium on Monday night, intercepted Selvakumar while he was returning home and hacked him with a sharp weapon. On information, deputy superintendent of police Sengamalakannan and his team rushed to the spot and conducted an inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmer-58-hacked-to-death-by-relatives/articleshow/85607092.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Vision 2022: Medical college in every district of India||By Arun TiwariOn August 15, India celebrated its 75th Independence Day. It was a great occasion for 1.4 billion people living with freedom in peace. While I was an Independence Day enthusiast since childhood – it used to be like a festival -- as I grew up, I saw festivities regressing into superficial ceremonies. Even now, we play 50-year-old patriotic songs, as new songs are not being composed. Have we outsourced our nationalistic fervor also to event managers? I want to believe that we have not. But I am a little confused about which ‘we’ do I belong to. There is immense disparity among people. During the economic slowdown enforced by the pandemic, the stock market rose to new heights, migrant workers who walked hundreds of kilometres on deserted streets meekly returned as if they were indentured labourers of the colonial era. Election rallies, cricket matches, and religious gatherings returned, and people thronged hill stations as if Covid-19 was some bad dream. Rabindranath Tagore’s famous poem ‘Where the mind is without fear...’ has now been condensed to: A house for every family, oxygen cylinder in every hospital and everyone vaccinated for Covid-19. It is not into any heaven, but to a world where corporations rule, money decides political loyalties and revolutions happen on the internet, that India has awakened. There is no cynicism here, but no optimism either. House for every family, drinking water from taps, internet connectivity in every village, universal education ... There is hardly any goal that has been missed by the well-intended leadership. But when these goals are implemented, there are glaring holes. Privatisation has hijacked public education and healthcare. The great PDS is being eyed now. So, where have we gone wrong? It is a sordid fact that the political class, administration, and the elite liberals have all become self-serving machines. So, whatever we do, there are loops and delays and wishful procrastinations. Our business people seem to have mastered the art of rotating money within the system and money is invested within companies very cleverly to multiply by itself. Apparent owners of private universities, hospitals and industries are mere custodians of real owners who are faceless and hidden from public view. What could be our resolve in this 75th year of independence? Let’s go back to the five areas that Dr APJ Abdul Kalam identified in his book, India 2020. He saw five areas to measure the development of India: Agriculture and food processing; Education and healthcare; Information and communication technology; Reliable and quality electric power, Surface transport and infrastructure across India; and Self-reliance in critical technologies. What work do the five areas need? Firstly, self-sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds. The Green Revolution has led the country into grain production and most of the money goes into this ‘machine’, neglecting other critical segments. Let us work towards zero imports of processed food items. Secondly, dismantling of the commercial education system by scrupulous technology-based monitoring of fees, quality of teaching and integrity of the examination system. Thirdly, freeing up of the Indian telecom from Chinese investment and technology. Fourthly, operationalising waterways by cleaning all major rivers of silt and construction of canals. And finally, making India a leader in producing nuclear energy from thorium technology. It was Dr Homi Bhabha’s dream, and succeeding generations of scientists know how to do it. Let it be done without ifs and buts. For, if we continue with ‘business-as-usual’, there is no hope of India becoming a developed nation even by 2050. Let Independence Day in 2022 see India sitting in the UN Security Council; be a part of the G-10 (expanding the current G-7); and every district in India have a government medical college with a 500-bed teaching hospital. Let us seek nothing more, and not settle for anything less. (The writer is an eminent missile scientist.

From installing sansitiser dispensers at the entrances of the store to keeping one arm’s distance from people visiting the store – by tying long ropes across the store – we are following every protocol to ensure we can continue to serve people and protect ourselves. Wearing masks, face shields and gloves is challenging, but we have prepared ourselves to face it. In the new normal we are ensuring that we have ample stock of sanitisers, gloves, masks, face shields, surface sanitizers, medicines that are commonly prescribed to Covid-19 patients and also attending to the most important task -- delivering goods to families who are quarantined in their homes. Some patrons even ask us for essentials like bread and toiletries, which we also deliver. While it is challenging for us to keep up with the new normal and adjust to our daily chores of stocking up medicines and everything that may be requested by patients and attendants, we continue to do so. Some geriatrics who live all by themselves – their kids are away in the US – are most important to us. We ensure that medicines and other things are delivered to them, in the comfort of their homes. Pandemic has taught us to be more compassionate than just being calm. It has taught us to excel in our field of work and to enjoy our work rather than complain about our hectic schedule. I have heard about people losing their loved ones in the pandemic for whom they cared and served with their full strength. What we learn from them is their spirit to move on and to continue caring for those who are left behind. While the pandemic has thrown life out of gear for many, it has also taught people to be resilient and fight back with all the humility and love they have inside them.

The spokesperson said that five Korean electronics companies have acquired land in Greater Noida recently to establish factories at a cost of Rs 1,154 crore. The companies will provide employment to 8,706 people. “We already have Chinese majors like Oppo, Vivo and Formi setting up their units in Greater Noida. Now, five have bought 3.51 lakh square metre land in Greater Noida. These include Samkwang India Electronics, KH Vatech India, Sentech India, Dreamtech and Stereon. These companies are involved in mobile phone parts manufacturing,” he said. An official of Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority said that Samkwang India Electronics is setting up its unit at an estimated cost of Rs 440 crore and will employ 4,000 people. KH Vatech India is investing Rs 247 crore and Sentech India Rs 34 crore to establish their units which will provide employment to 786 and 350 people respectively. Dreamtech and Stereon have acquired land in sector Ecotech 10 to establish their plants at a cost of Rs 433 crore. The two units will employ 3,570 people. “A major reason for Korean companies to come here is the recent investment of Rs 7,429 crore and Rs 2,000 crore respectively by Chinese majors Vivo and Oppo in Greater Noida. The entry of Chinese electronics companies into Greater Noida to manufacture laptops, mobile phones and other gadgets has paved the way for Korean companies to establish their own plants in order to compete with their Chinese rivals,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/5-korean-firms-acquire-land-in-greater-noida-for-rs-1154-crore/articleshow/85609155.cms||---

They held a demonstration on Tuesday in Thanjavur, urging the government to issue orders immediately, saying that their dues were meagre. Former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had announced in the assembly to waive off Rs 12,110 crore crop loan disbursed to 1.64 lakh farmers by cooperative banks. Followed by the announcement made under Rule 110, a notification was issued. However, a section of farmers claimed their names were not included with the list containing 1.64 lakh beneficiaries. All these left out farmers had got loan conversion privilege announced by the same government in 2016-17 when the state was declared drought hit due to worst rainfall. When the farmers had appealed to the government to waive their entire crop loan, it converted the same as a medium term loan, secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said. In the case of short term, farmers have to repay the loan within 8 to 10 months. However, it was three years if it was medium term. Even after the conversion, most of the farmers could not repay their loan to the tune of up to Rs 482 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-urge-govt-to-waive-rs-482cr-crop-loans/articleshow/85607104.cms||---

According to latest details, the state has so far vaccinated close to 1.26 crore beneficiaries (figures up to August 23), while 43 lakh beneficiaries have received the second dose. In Hyderabad, out of the 26.66 lakh population, 25.96 lakh were administered the first dose up to last week, while the coverage of second doses stands at 35 percent. The Greater Hyderabad area has recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases so far, including Ranga Reddy, Medchal and Sangareddy. The first dose coverage has reached 90 percent of people, while 27 percent of the eligible population has received the second doses, according to official figures. “We are targeting coverage of the entire GHMC by September 9, 2021 as fully vaccinated with one dose at least. A total of 4,846 colonies in the GHMC limits will be covered and declared fully vaccinated,” said a health department official. Health officials are using 50 static vaccination centres catering to 15,000 beneficiaries per day. About 90 mobile vaccination vans ensure jabs to roughly 20,000 people per day. Over the last few days the number of mobile vaccination vans has increased too, officials said. While officials concentrate on GHMC area, several districts have just around 50 perc ent coverage of first doses so far. “Some of the districts are lagging behind in vaccination and we are trying to tackle the vaccine hesitancy issue as well as streamline vaccine supplies. We have already identified low coverage areas are sent an update to the department. Earlier supplies were directed more to the GHMC areas, but we will get more supplies once GHMC is fully vaccinated,” said a district medical and health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1-35-cr-yet-to-take-first-jab-as-hesitancy-remains-a-concern/articleshow/85608208.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Bareilly||Accused of theft, man tied up, beaten, neck trampled on by UP mob||BAREILLY: At a busy bus stand in the city on Tuesday, Mohammad Sahil, 20, an out-of-work labourer, was accused of theft by bystanders. A mob soon gathered around him, tied up his feet so he couldn’t escape, dragged him by his hair, beat him up and stamped on his neck to make him “confess” to his alleged crime. He was assaulted for nearly 30 minutes before police arrived. Cops found no stolen goods with him. One Devendra Kumar, who lives in Shahjahanpur, said in his complaint that while waiting for a bus to Rudrapur he found his phone had gone missing from his pocket. As he started looking for it, another man, who has not been identified, said his wallet, too, had been stolen. They started questioning those standing around them. When Sahil fumbled, they accosted him. They asked him his name and then the assault began. In one of the videos shared on social media, he is seen crouching on the ground as a person asks him what he stole and keeps slapping him. And in a series of photos, a man in a light blue shirt is seen standing over him, his foot on Sahil’s neck to choke him as he is visibly gasping for breath. By the time police got there, Sahil was badly bruised. They took him to the district hospital, where a medical checkup was done. He was discharged and taken straight to the police lockup. On the basis of Kumar’s complaint, an FIR was registered against an “unidentified” person. “We found Sahil was involved in the crime (of theft),” Kotwali SHO Pankaj Pant told TOI. But no phone or wallet was found on Sahil. “We found a phone from a person called Sabir, his friend. He has also been arrested … We will decide on the action after ensuring Sahil’s role in the theft.” Until Tuesday evening, however, no FIR had been registered against the mob. But when images of the assault were shared on social media, Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan ordered an FIR. He told TOI, “We took suo motu cognizance and filed a complaint under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (offence committed by any member of an unlawful assembly, 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC against unidentified persons. Those who assaulted Sahil will be identified through videos and pictures.” This was the fourth such case in Bareilly since 2019. In August 2019, a mentally ill Muslim man slipped into a coma after he was assaulted by a mob on cattle theft suspicion. He died in hospital. In September last year, an inebriated Muslim man was “mistaken for a thief”, tied to a tree and beaten up by a mob. He, too, died during treatment. And in February this year, a Muslim taxi driver, 31, was accused of cattle theft and lynched. He died of head injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/accused-of-theft-man-tied-up-beaten-neck-trampled-on-by-up-mob/articleshow/85604488.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The region, on an average, receives 679.5 mm rainfall during the official four months of monsoon. This year, the region has recorded 584.4 mm rainfall since June so far. With 103% normal rainfall Jalna district has already received season’s quota of rainfall followed by Nanded (90%), Parbhani (89%), Hingoli (87%), Beed (85%), Aurangabad (84%), Latur (76%) and Osmanabad (70%). Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of city-based APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, said Marathwada was expected to get more showers especially during the withdrawal phase of Monsoon. “Besides four months of rainy season till September, the region also witnesses rainfall activity during October to early November. The tally of rainfall will go further by the end of overall rainy season,” he said. While downgrading Monsoon 2021 forecast, Skymet has said, “The Southwest Monsoon had a timely onset and made a good start with June ending above normal at 110% of the LPA. July started on a weak note and the month was marred with a pronged break till July 11. Therefore, the month finished with below normal rainfall at 93% of LPA. June and July ended with 110% and 93% of LPA against Skymet’s forecast of 106% and 97% respectively.” Earlier, Marathwada reported 7 mm rainfall during past 24-hours ended by Tuesday morning with Beed district recording the highest 20 mm rainfall. As per IMD, no noticeable rainfall activity is likely over Aurangabad during the next 24-hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amid-forecast-of-downgraded-monsoon-mwada-gets-86-average-yearly-rainfall/articleshow/85611116.cms||---

However, this time, no such interviews were held and there has been no transparency on how the nominations were selected,” said a teacher from the district. The teacher added that many applicants had been waiting to be called for interview.

In a memorandum to the divisional railway manager of Trichy Manish Agarwal, the association said that since no southern districts are connected with Nagapattinam district so far, the new day time express between these destinations would be immensely helpful for tourists of both districts. It also sought for the immediate restoration of the suspended train services due to Covid-19, including the Bengaluru and Trichy passenger. The proposed Ernakulam – Velankanni – Ernakulam bi-weekly express via Tiruvarur, Pattukottai, Karaikudi should also be introduced at the earliest, by posting the required number of gatekeepers between Tiruvarur and Karaikudi, the memorandum added. At present, only one overnight express is operated between Karaikal and Chennai Egmore via Nagore, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur junction. Moreover, the link express in this train to Velankanni was also cancelled by the authorities. Hence, tourists and locals from Karaikal, Nagore, Nagapattinam and Velankanni are entirely dependent on the lone train service, S Mohan, president of the association said. Karaikal - Peralam and Nagapattinam – Thiruthuraipoondi new line projects should also be expedited besides gauge conversion work between Thiruthuraipoondi and Agasthiyampalli via Vedaranyam, he added. He also demanded to repair Nagore and Velipalayam station platforms which are in a pathetic condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/demand-for-velankanni-madurai-day-train-service/articleshow/85607117.cms||---

After the unified development control rules came into effect earlier this year, the KMC earned Rs 20 crore through premium and fees charged for building permission proposals. This was until the online system came into effect on experimental basis in five municipal corporations across the state. After the online system was activated and developers were asked to submit proposals online, the KMC could collect only Rs 8 lakh. Vidyanand Bedekar, president of Kolhapur CREDAI, said, “Recently, we held a meeting with district guardian minister Satej Patil who also happens to be minister of state for information and technology. We are facing several difficulties in submitting the building proposals which is the first stage of the whole process. The system demands original plans and layouts that are available with the KMC and not with the developers. We have requested the minister to ask the KMC to upload all the earlier layouts of the plots. Also, there are other items that are sought for completing the submission, but these items create more confusion.” The developers have demanded that both online and offline modes should be adopted. They even claimed that some other municipal corporations have allowed offline mode of submission of the layouts. However, the claim was denied by the state town planning officials and the demand was rejected as going back to the offline mode will be a regressive step and does away with the transparency required in the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-civic-body-clears-only-15-of-75-building-proposals-in-last-3-months/articleshow/85611138.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Rule of law prevails in Madhya Pradesh: BJP to AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi||BHOPAL: The political storm over the assault of a bangle-seller in Indore continued to rage on Tuesday with AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi calling it the result of “narrow-minded” thought and home minister Narottam Mishra asking him to stay out of it. Owaisi accused the MP government of not taking action against those involved in the assault. “The home minister is openly making excuses to save criminals. There is no difference between elected governments and extremist mobs,” he tweeted. Mishra hit back at Owaisi by saying: “Please do not interfere. There is rule of law in Madhya Pradesh. No one will be allowed to spread enmity here. I want to tell Owaisi that those who carry two-three different identity cards are criminals. Those who hide their names are criminals. Cops have filed a case against those who have beaten up the man and arrested them.” Four persons have been arrested and remanded in jail for beating the bangle seller, who too was arrested on Tuesday on Pocso charges. Mishra has said that the government is considering a ban on Popular Front of India (PFI), some of whose members are alleged to have “instigated” the gherao of a police station in Indore. Muslim society has demanded a ban on the activities of the organization, which is being considered by the authorities, Mishra said. Cabinet minister Vishwas Sarang accused Owaisi of divisive politics. “Those who are involved in playing divisive politics are anti-nationals. They do not have the right to make fun of the people of Madhya Pradesh. Owaisi is a small and insignificant leader. He works to please a particular class. Madhya Pradesh is an island of peace and those involved in appeasement keep creating controversies,” said Sarang. Congress MLA from Bhopal Central Arif Masood joined the war of words, calling the home minister’s statement “unfortunate”. “The Shivraj government is pressuring the police not to take action in the case. The statement of the home minister is unfortunate. Everyone saw the video that the youth was brutally beaten up while he was pleading,” said Masood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/rule-of-law-prevails-in-mp-bjp-to-owaisi/articleshow/85607123.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Minister gets bail at midnight, will move HC to quash case||Mumbai: Union Cabinet minister Narayan Rane, 69, arrested on Tuesday after a Ratnagiri court refused him transit pre-arrest bail in FIRs over his ‘slap’ remark against CM Uddhav Thackeray, was granted bail by a Mahad magistrate minutes before midnight. The procedure in filing the case diary was not as mandated and custodial interrogation of Rane was not needed, said the judicial magistrate first class in his order. The court granted Rane cash bail of Rs 15,000, and imposed a condition to appear in the Mahad City police station on August 30 and September 13. The police were asked to issue him a seven-day notice for seeking his voice sample. Minutes after midnight, Rane walked out of the court. He was present throughout the remand and bail hearing, which began at 9.30 pm. The court had rejected a seven-day police custody plea and remanded Rane to magisterial or judicial custody after which it heard his bail plea and granted him bail. Rane, recently inducted in the Union cabinet as minister of micro, small and medium enterprises, was produced before the Mahad local court in Raigad district around 8pm and there was a 45-minute hearing, where district government pleader Bhushan Salvi sought seven days’ police custody arguing that the remarks made by the minister were aimed at lowering the reputation of the CM and more investigation was needed. Senior counsel Rajendra Shirodkar, who appeared for Rane in Mahad, argued against custody, saying no custodial interrogation was required. He also said the case and Rane’s arrest were politically motivated. Even if his remarks are taken as alleged, there was no case made out of promoting disharmony or ill-will to attract the FIR. He said the arrest was unlawful as no notice was issued to him by the police first to seek his explanation, though mandated by the law for offences which, like the ones invoked against him, attract less than seven years’ imprisonment. Section 41A of CrPC requires a notice to be issued to a person for his or her appearance at the police station to give an explanation before an arrest. A person can be arrested only after citing reason. Lawyer Aniket Nikam had tried to file a plea for an urgent hearing in Bombay high court on Tuesday just before Rane’s arrest, but could not due to technical reasons. So, there was no hearing on Tuesday. “On Wednesday, we will approach the HC for an urgent hearing with a quashing petition,” advocate Shirodkar told TOI. Before the HC, he will be challenging the validity of the arrest and proceedings against him. The FIRs against Rane were registered in Mahad, Nashik Cyber police station and Pune, and also in Thane on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minister-gets-bail-at-midnight-will-move-hc-to-quash-case/articleshow/85609193.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Budget allocation to accelerate devpt in Bundelkhand, east Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: With UP Assembly elections just months away, BJP has drawn out a larger plan to step up developmental activities, especially in various districts of the socio-economically poor east UP and Bundelkhand region. The state planning department has released a budgetary amount of over Rs 25 crore under the ‘accelerated development programme’ for speeding up construction of not only polytechnics but also ITIs, besides lending a financial push to road connectivity in rural areas. The districts where the government has pitched for accelerating construction of polytechnics include Hardoi and Banda, while in the case of Sant Kabir Nagar, Jaunpur and Kaushambi, a budgetary push has been given to scale up construction of ITIs. Likewise, the planning department has made financial allocation for laying of pitch roads in rural areas of Chandauli and Maharajganj. Experts see this as a key move to reach out to the youth and arm them with technical know-how while grooming them for employment opportunities. The decision to speed up pitch roads in rural areas comes amid state government’s measures to expedite construction of rural roads under the PM Gramin Sadak Yojana. Officials said that the planning department dashed a communique to district magistrates last week suggesting them to follow rules and guidelines laid out from time to time—the latest being on March 23. The department said that the amount released by the state government will be drawn by the accounts officer with the permission of DMs for being made available to the working agencies. The state government has said that the amount released for the purpose will not be kept in bank or post office but be immediately utilized. In case any amount is left unspent, it would be deposited with the state coffers before March 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/budget-allocation-to-accelerate-devpt-in-bundelkhand-east-up/articleshow/85609195.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Ludhiana||Kin say farmer arrested in false case, SHO transferred||Ludhiana: Following serious allegations of corruption and implicating a man in a false case of drug peddling, Meharban police station SHO sub-inspector Simranjeet Kaur has been transferred to the police lines. The action was taken a few days ago after the family of the arrested man lodged a complaint with former commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal and also produced CCTV footage of the incident. A three-member special investigation team (SIT) was formed in the case. On July 25, the Meharban police had arrested Gurdeep Singh, a farmer of Noorwala village. The FIR stated that he was nabbed from a check-post at Noorwala Chowk when he was going in his Hyundai Brezza car (PB91E-2000) and 100g of opium was recovered from his possession. However, according to Gurdeep’s family, the SHO, along with her team, had visited their house and searched it for one-and-a-half hour and when she could not find anything, she took him along and later arrested him and lodged an FIR.Bachittar Kaur, 70, mother of Gurdeep, said, “The police have implicated my son in a case of drug peddling. We are farmers and belong to a well-to-do family. We don’t need to do such things. On July 25, SHO Simranjeet Kaur came to our house around noon in a private car and in civilian dress, though she was accompanied by her team. Till 1.30pm, she frisked our house and took Rs 1.5 lakh that she found. Thereafter, she took Gurdeep along, but did not tell us anything.”Bachittar Kaur said the SHO asked her elder son to come to the police station in the Hyundai Brezza car (PB91E-2000). “There, she made my elder son sit inside the police station and threatened to book him too in the case. The cop took Rs 1.5 lakh to release my elder son, but lodged an FIR against Gurdeep for possessing 100g opium. The car has been impounded. For the past one month, my son has been lodged in jail for a crime he did not commit,” she added. The mother alleged, “The Meharban police have implicated my son by taking money from our neighbour, who nurses a grudge against us. When Meharban cops were taking Gurdeep to the police station, SI Simranjeet Kaur had gone to our neighbour’s house to meet him. We then met former commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal and got a probe marked.”Additional deputy commissioner of police-IV Rupinder Kaur Sra said, “Rakesh Agarwal had formed a three-member SIT, headed by deputy commissioner of police (detective) Simratpal Singh Dhindsa. Dhindsa has been transferred, so the inquiry is on hold.” SI Simranjeet Kaur said, “The police had started an anti-drug smuggling drive under which search operations were conducted and several houses were frisked. It is confirmed that Gurdeep Singh has been consuming and peddling opium. I know the family has lodged a complaint against me and the inquiry is pending. All their allegations are false.” “I had asked the commissioner of police to transfer me to the police lines due to personal issues,” she claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/kin-say-farmer-arrested-in-false-case-sho-transferred/articleshow/85604551.cms||Payal Dhawan

As per the complaint registered with the police, the couple was heading back to Trimbakeshwar from Nashik at 1 pm in a bus from Central Bus Stand. When the journey started the complainant’s wife opened her bag to get her purse for getting money to buy tickets. However, to her surprise, the purse was missing. The complainant stated the purse contained gold jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh — 30 gram gold chain, 20 gram gold rings, and nine gold bangles worth Rs 3 lakh. “We have requested for closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of the bus stand for the purpose of investigation. However, the gold jewellery was stolen from the couple before they arrived to the Central Bus Stand in an autorickshaw. They realized about the theft only after sitting in the bus,” a police officer said, adding the case is being investigated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gold-jewellery-worth-rs-5l-stolen-from-couple/articleshow/85611150.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Goa coming in way of Mahadayi: HDK||Hubballi: The Union government is bowing to the pressure from Goa and hence it is not issuing unconditional gazette notification to implement Mahadayi verdict, said former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy. The JD(S) leader alleged that the Centre is biased against Karnataka, especially the northern part of the state. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Kumaraswamy said that the Union government, which issued notification in favour of Tamil Nadu over Cauvery issue, is delaying the notification on UKP irrigation project. “Though 25 BJP MPs are from Karnataka, the state is getting step-motherly treatment, he said. He warned that if the Union government continues its apathy, he will launch a padayatra at Almatti, Yettonahole, Belagavi and Kodagu. “If Covid situation is under control, we will begin a padayatra during Dasara over the Mahadayi issue,” he stated. He alleged that BJP and Congress are organising mass events without adhering to Covid norms. “BJP is spreading Covid by organising Janashirvada Yatra while Congress is spreading it with its zonal level meetings. Though the state has lost many lives to the Covid, the government is not serious to prevent the pandemic. It’s inviting third wave by neglecting Covid norms,” he said. He said that his party is fielding over 60 candidates for HDMC polls, 54 for Kalaburagi City Corporation polls and a few candidates for Belagavi City Corporation polls. “We will conduct workshops at 120 assembly segments, where our chances of winning are high and will strengthen the party by visiting villages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/goa-coming-in-way-of-mahadayi-hdk/articleshow/85573546.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM took final call on Narayan Rane arrest||MUMBAI: After the Mahad police registered a criminal case against Union minister Narayan Rane for offensive speeches against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, leaders of the MVA government were in two minds about whether to arrest him. They were aware that in most cases registered under section 153 of the Indian Penal Code --- provocation with intent to cause riot --- rarely is an accused arrested. However, after prolonged deliberation among Thackeray, his deputy Ajit Pawar and transport minister from Sena Anil Parab, it was decided that if an offence has been registered against Rane, the law enforcing agencies should be given a free hand. “NCP took the view that in larger public interest and also to protect the image of the CM, Rane should be arrested, so that in future, no politician will dare make derogatory statements against the CM. Accordingly, law enforcing agencies were asked to proceed according to the provisions of law,” a senior NCP minister told TOI. The process of arresting Rane was expedited after the Ratnagiri court rejected the BJP minister’s anticipatory bail application and his team did not make any headway in the Bombay high court on Tuesday. Now, the significant decision was where to arrest Rane, who is on a Jan Ashirwad Yatra. In a bit of muscle flexing, the government prompted that he be detained in his home turf, Konkan. “Rane considers Konkan his stronghold, hence it was decided to arrest him in Ratnagiri and bring him to Raigad for producing before a magistrate,” said the senior minister. Revenue minister from Congress Balasaheb Thorat too condemned Rane’s statement, saying it was not the culture of Maharashtra. “One may not like the CM, it does not mean you abuse him. Since a case has been registered, I am sure it will be taken to its logical end,” he said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik endorsed Rane’s arrest, saying no one is above the law. “Rane exceeded his brief when he passed derogatory remarks against the CM. It appears that he is making the statements out of frustration.” BJP is trying a West Bengal experiment in Maharashtra, continued Malik. “They have destroyed peace in West Bengal, but we are warning, any such attempt in Maharashtra will be thwarted.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhav-dy-cm-took-final-call-on-rane-arrest/articleshow/85609222.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Nagpur||RPI supports caste-based census: Athawale||Nagpur: Republican Party of India (A) will support caste-based census to know exact population of OBC and other communities, said party chief and Union minister of state Ramdas Athawale here on Tuesday. Speaking to media during his visit to the city, the Rajya Sabha member downplayed fears that caste-based census would lead to increased demands for reservation from different communities. “The last such census was conducted by the British in 1947, after which the practice was discontinued,” he said. The minister was in the city to welcome new members from various villages like Mouda joining his party for the local body polls. Many activists from other parties switched over to the RPI (A) in his presence. Taking a dig at the opposition, Athawale said NDA government at the Centre led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already clarified that it would not change either the existing reservation system as finalized by the Supreme Court or the Constitution of India, yet the Congress and other parties were trying to mislead people. Explaining his stand on Maratha reservation, Athawale said the Centre has amended Article 102 and granted power to states to include castes in OBC category. “Now it is up to Maharashtra government to provide reservation to Maratha community, instead of blaming the NDA government,” he said. The minister also demanded stringent action against the accused who allegedly raped a mentally retarded girl in the city. Athawale would be visiting Chandrapur on August 27 where seven members of dalit community were allegedly beaten up on suspicion of practising “black magic”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rpi-supports-caste-based-census-athawale/articleshow/85607200.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Mucor treatment bill audit illegal, says VHA||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) are once again at loggerheads, this time over capping and audit of mucormycosis treatment cost incurred by patients at several tertiary care hospitals. Treatment of mucor, also called black fungus, is a costly affair with bills running into several lakhs. The high cost is mainly due to costly drugs such as amphotericin B beside removal of eyeballs, nasal sinuses, jaws, forehead bone or parts which have been infested by the flesh-eating fungus. Though the government had given unlimited coverage under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY), the scheme was not available at specialised hospitals. VHA defended the right of hospitals that are treating mucormycosis patients and termed NMC auditors seeking bills for audit as illegal. The association has written to municipal commissioner pointing out that the government order dated June 3, 2021 on mucormycosis rate capping and audit was valid only till July 31, 2021. “Since mucormycosis is a non-Covid disease, the said GR was already superseding the judicial orders in this regard,” the VHA added. Moreover, the validity date has also expired, it said. VHA said that Supreme Court on July 19, 2021 had upheld the high court decision dated October 23, 2020 in WP No.1936/2020 that no rate capping is applicable in non-Covid cases. The association has claimed that in such scenario the ongoing exercise of seeking bills for audit of mucormycosis treatment cost is totally unjustified and illegal. On behalf of the VHA, Dr Anup Marar, convener, Dr Alok Umre, secretary, and Dr Ashok Arbat, president, have signed the letter to the municipal commissioner. They have also forwarded a copy to amicus curiae in PIL No.04/2020 to draw his attention to the overruling of judicial orders. Dr Pramod Giri, Dr Shishir Kolhe, Dr Murli and Dr Tushar Gawad along with other VHA members backed the move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mucor-treatment-bill-audit-illegal-says-vha/articleshow/85607175.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP firmly with Narayan Rane, says bail order a rap for MVA govt||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: The BJP does not stand by Union minister Narayan Rane’s statement but will stand by Rane if the state government misuses the law against him, said BJP leader and ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis. He further said even if Rane is arrested, the Jan Aashirwad Yatra will not stop. BJP president J P Nadda stressed that the party will neither be scared nor suppressed, and Fadnavis alleged the act was driven by vendetta. Late in the night, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said the court’s order granting Rane bail was a rap for the MVA government and that the MVA government had “time and again been pulled up by the courts.” “The arrest of Union minister Narayan Rane is a violation of constitutional values,” Nadda said. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said some words Rane used to criticise CM Uddhav Thackeray could have been avoided but the arrest was a vindictive act.  “Anil Deshmukh is accused of extorting Rs 100 crore. Is he in jail? Police do not even question Anil Deshmukh. Democracy has been put to shame in Maharashtra today. [Shiv Sena MP] Sanjay Raut gave many statements against women but no FIR was registered,” Patra said. Terming Tuesday’s violence as “state-sponsored,” Fadnavis said there was now no difference between West Bengal and Maharashtra. Addressing a presser at his official residence in Mumbai as incidents of violence were reported from different parts of the state, Fadnavis said it is natural a person should get angry when the state’s CM forgets it is the ‘Amrut Mahotsav’ of the nation’s Independence.  “In the course of his speech he (Rane) probably made this statement, but I don’t think he planned to make this statement. The post of the chief minister is an important one, and therefore, while speaking about the post or the individual on that post, it is necessary to exercise restraint. This anger can be expressed in other ways,” he said. Criticising the government for the way it was going after Rane, Fadnavis said the action cannot be supported. He said, “If the government behaves in this manner and I want to make it clear that while we do not support the statement, the BJP stands by Rane.” Attacking police, Fadnavis said they failed to initiate action against Sharjeel Usmani, who came to Maharashtra and heaped abuses on India and Hindus. No FIR was registered against Usmani but police teams from Pune and Nashik are being sent to arrest Rane, he said. “In legal parlance this (Rane’s statement) is a non-cognisable offence which has been deliberately converted into a cognisable offence. I read the statement of the Nashik police commissioner, does he think he is Chhatrapati? Under which law has he been given powers to do so?” asked Fadnavis. “If cops start taking action to make government happy, it will besmirch Maharashtra’s image. As it is, police are wracked by the ‘vasooli’ scam. This is a police-jeevi Sarkar. It has been rapped by the SC on several occasions, be it Arnab, Kangana and even recent events, yet it continues to use cops to extract revenge,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-firmly-with-rane-says-bail-order-a-rap-for-mva-govt/articleshow/85609248.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Delhi||Delhi: Underground power lines hold key to unlocking Ashram woes||NEW DELHI: The completion of the Ashram underpass now faces the last hurdle in the form of underground power lines that need to be relocated by Delhi Transco Ltd (DTL). PWD officials said 96% of the civil work was complete from both sides of the approach road, but the pending work of installing the last concrete block now depended on the power line relocation. A senior official overseeing the project said once relocation was done, PWD would finish the remaining work in 20-25 days. The underpass is expected to significantly improve traffic woes moving from Nizammudin to Badarpur, while decongesting the busy intersection that has become a nightmare for commuters. Around 2.5 - 3 lakh vehicles use this intersection every day. The foundation stone for the underpass was laid down by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on December 24, 2019. It was expected to be completed by June 2021, but shortage of labour, pandemic induced lockdowns and financial woes led to several delays. Once complete, the underpass is expected to reduce vehicular congestion by 53.5%. The traffic impact assessment of the intersection shows that on average 11,600 vehicles pass every hour, out of which over 6,200 constitute commuters between Nizamuddin and Badarpur. “Once the underpass is opened, traffic movement will be signal-free, thereby reducing congestion on the surface-level intersection significantly. The completion of the work will depend on how fast DTL finishes its work,” said an official. Ashram Chowk is an important link connecting central and south Delhi with the satellite towns of Noida and Faridabad. The junction connects Mathura Road and Ring Road with Lajpat Nagar-Sarai Kale Khan and DND Flyway. Ever since construction began in December 2019, massive jams have become common on Mathura Road and the Ashram flyover during peak hours. The project’s initial deadline was December 2020, which was extended to March this year and then further pushed to June 30. The estimated cost of the project was Rs 78 crore. Commuters taking the busy Ashram crossing would get an easy ride towards Sarita Vihar, Badarpur and Faridabad from ITO. The Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre had approved the underpass in January 2016 for a signal-free ride from Nizamuddin to New Friends Colony on Mathura Road. The Public Works Department also plans to construct an extension of DND Flyway till the existing Ashram flyover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/underground-power-lines-hold-key-to-unlocking-ashram-woes/articleshow/85604641.cms||Paras Singh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 10 micro containment-zones in Rajpur-Sonarpur civic area||KOLKATA: Ten places across 10 wards of Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality were turned into micro-containment zones by the district administration after a sudden surge of Covid positive cases. In the last one week, 46 people were tested positive in these areas. The district authority said that it would take all necessary measures keeping in mind the imminent third wave. The ten zones include places like Srinagar Model Town, Dhalua police para, Dakshin Jagaddal, Pragati Palli, Rajpur government colony and Mahamayatala Green Park.  “Since Sonarpur-Rajpur Municipality area is densely populated and 70 per cent cases of Baruipur subdivision in the first and second wave were reported from here, we took no chance and declared them as micro-containment zones,” said Baruipur sub-divisional officer (SDO) Suman Poddar. Since the place is very well connected with the city by railway, metro and road, the district authority exercised maximum caution. “We are keeping a close watch on the zone. However, it’s hardly a blanket containment zone. Covid negative people can carry out their normal activities without hassle. We are carrying out contact tracing. We are also enforcing the Covid-appropriate behaviours like safe distancing, wearing masks and frequent hand sanitization,” added Poddar. In north 24 Parganas, the number of micro-containment zones has been reduced from 80 to 50 in the past week. Barrackpore has 22 containment zones, the highest in the district, followed by 10 at Bidhannagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/10-micro-c-zones-in-rajpur-sonarpur-civic-area/articleshow/85607190.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

State Entry road, linking the station with Connaught Place and with important railway offices on its stretch, is being envisioned as a pedestrianised, high-end shopping street and high-rise office towers that will seat the railway officials.Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), the government body engaged in the tendering of work on the railway station project, has submitted a plan to Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC), the regulatory body in Delhi for transport engineering, that sees 20% of the area around the railway station turning into a landscaped green space. Shopping malls and high-end stores are planned along with two multi-level car parks.V P Dudeja, vice-chairman, RLDA, told TOI that nine companies were currently in the race to redevelop the area. Each has been asked to submit a request for proposal. The aim is to utilise the ground-level parking area for buses in line with the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy that Northern Railway has adopted.“Keeping in mind the TOD policy, buses will be able to park in the bay on the ground floor of the buildings erected. No cars will be allowed on State Entry Road with the 800-metre stretch open only for pedestrians walking from Connaught Place,” said Dudeja. “It will act as an extension of the shopping streets of Connaught Place with a focus on corporate offices and high-end stores.”Dudeja said many of the current railway offices will be housed in the new corporate space, while others will be moved to the Ajmeri Gate side, where more buildings will come up.Elevated roads are being planned towards the station from Basant Road near Paharganj, Chelmsford Road and Bhavbhuti Marg. “The elevated corridor will connect Chelmsford Road, Basant Road, Bhavbhuti Marg and Ajmeri Gate Road with the parking lot planned on Bhavbhuti Marg.”RLDA said the redevelopment project was not only limited to the railway station but also involved the areas nearby. Railway officials said that once an executing firm was selected, work on the project could begin by next year. Work will be carried out in different phases. “This is being done to carry out construction without impacting the traffic,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-track-global-airport-feel-for-area-around-ndls/articleshow/85604598.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

While the Sangli district administration has already submitted crop damage report to the government, Kolhapur administration was yet to get the assessment finalised by Tuesday. As per the report submitted by Sangli administration, crops over 39,695 hectare land have been damaged due to the floods. The administration had estimated damage of over 41,000 hectare by ‘eye estimates’ method just after the floods. The final on-field assessment will be carried out by revenue department and agriculture department staff. The total cost of crop damage is Rs 54 crore from five talukas — Palus, Miraj, Shirala, Tasgaon and Walva. The assessment is categorised into three stages — damage to non-irrigated crops, damage to irrigated crops and damage to fruit crops. As many as 37,278 hectares of irrigated crops owned by 86,421 farmers have been damaged, followed by 1,716 hectares of non-irrigated crops owned by 12,571 farmers and 701 hectares of fruit crops owned by 2,217 farmers from Sangli. Sangli’s district agriculture superintendent Basavaraj Mastoli said, “We have calculated the damage cost as per the state disaster relief fund guidelines. It is up to the government whether to compensate as per SDRF rules or more. For permanent damage and de-silting, the farmers must be paid Rs 2.86 crore as compensation. For the sugar cane fields which have knee deep of siltation, policy is yet to be announced by government for restoration of fields.” Meanwhile, the farmers are demanding loan waiver as they are unable to repay the loans owing to permanent damage to the crops. Besides, they are also demanding compensation in excess of SDRF rules. The state is, however, yet to reach a conclusion on both the demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/permanent-damage-to-587-hectares-farm-land-in-sangli/articleshow/85611161.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad ZP first to offer Unani cupping therapy at dispensaries||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Zilla Parishad has become the first local self-governing body in the state to officially introduce Unani cupping therapy at the dispensary level. Found beneficial in treating musculoskeletal disorders, the therapy, known as hijama or mahaajim in Unani, has been introduced as a part of the National AYUSH Mission. Aurangabad district AYUSH officer Dr Shaikh Shakeel said a designated dispensary at Juna Bazaar area of the city will be offering the therapy from Thursday. “Unani cupping therapy is used in treating patients of sciatica, spondylolysis and general muscle pain related ailments in the human body. A health check-up of the patient will be carried out before offering the therapy,” he said. While the cost of the therapy runs into thousands of rupees at select private places, it will be available at a token price of Rs 2 per patient, authorities said. As per the National Health Portal, Unani cupping therapy is used as a method of regimental therapies, in which a local suction is created on the skin to mobilise the blood flow in order to promote healing or to cure diseases. As a part of the treatment, the skin is basically gently drawn upwards by creating a vacuum in a cup over the target area of the body in order to offer relief to patients. While few of the state-run district, sub-district and rural hospitals have staff qualified in Unani medicine, Aurangabad is the first to introduce the ancient treatment at a dispensary level, health authorities said. Considering the pandemic situation, the therapy will be offered on every Thursday and service days will be extended gradually in future, it was said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-zp-1st-to-offer-unani-cupping-therapy-at-dispensaries/articleshow/85611178.cms||Prasad Joshi

Sourcs said that people who wanted to travel to Karnataka, for several reasons were stopped by the police at Majali checkpost over Covid SOPs. Those people who have taken both the doses of vaccine were stopped by the police, after which people were agitated and retaliated by stopping people from Karnataka who were trying to cross Polem checkpost to come to Goa. Among the stranded were around 10 patients who were proceeding to Karwar for medical treatment. On hearing the news, some activists, including Congress general secretary Janardhan Bhandari, Canacona municipal council chairperson Mario Simon Rebello and others rushed to the spot. Activists sought to know the reason for the sudden and unexpected change in SOPs by Karnataka police at Majali checkpost. After the activists in retaliation also stopped Karnataka vehicles, the assistant commissioner from Karwar arrived on the scene and tried to pacify the people from Goa. Later, the barricade was lifted and vehicles were allowed to enter Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ruckus-at-majali-checkpost-over-covid-protocols/articleshow/85607254.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The girl’s father confessed the crime after the boy’s family lodged a missing complaint with police on August 10. The couple had been missing since July 31. A search operation has been launched to retrieve the bodies of the boy (20) and girl (18) from the river, police added. The girl’s father has been arrested while a search is on for four others. Senior superintendent of police Ashok Kumar said, “An FIR has been registered against the girl’s father, his brother and three others under the IPC section 302 (punishment for murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of the offence or giving false information to screen offender). The father of the girl was sent to jail on court orders. Teams have been tasked to arrest the other four accused who are absconding. We are trying to recover the bodies from the river.” According to police, Uttam Yadav and his neighbour, Neha Yadav, were in a relationship. Uttam was involved in his family business while Neha was a student. They eloped on July 31. Deputy superintendent of police Kamlesh Kumar said, “A missing complaint was received from Uttam’s family. However, the girl's family did not lodge any complaint. During the investigation, we came to know that Uttam and Neha were in a relationship. Later, we found the girl was also missing. On Tuesday, we brought the girl's father, Deviram, for questioning. Deviram said he came to know that his daughter was staying with Uttam in Delhi. He convinced them to come back home as he was agreeable to their relationship.” On August 2, he along with his brother and other family members strangled the couple to death and threw their bodies into the Yamuna. Deviram said he killed his daughter and her boyfriend as they were adamant to continue with their relationship despite family opposition, added DSP Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/father-kin-kill-girl-boyfriend-throw-bodies-into-yamuna-in-firozabad/articleshow/85604653.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad commissioner of police promoted as ADG||Aurangabad: Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta has been promoted to the rank of additional director general of police. The state home department has also elevated the Aurangabad police commissionerate from the special IG rank to ADG, and had retained Gupta, making him the first ADG-rank officer to head city police. Since the establishment of the commissionerate in 1991, this is the first time that the Aurangabad police commissionerate is being headed by an ADG-rank officer. “It is indeed an honour to serve this historically and culturally rich city as the first ADG. We pledge to make renewed efforts to ensure peace and harmony at all cost,” Gupta said. He added that bringing a check on different types of property offences, as well as activities of criminal elements, will continue to remain his top priority. The latest promotion order is part of the three lists of transfers and postings of senior police officers issued by the state government. The order read that the post of Aurangabad CP is of special IGP-rank, which is being put in abeyance. The order cited the Indian Police Service (uniform) Rules, 1954, for upgrading the post and retaining Gupta. Authorities said states use abeyance to accommodate officers. About four years ago, the post of Aurangabad police commissioner was downgraded to the rank of DIG to accommodate the then commissioner of police Yashasvi Yadav. After his mid-term transfer, Aurangabad range IGP Milind Bharambe took charge for a brief period, before Chiranjeev Prasad was appointed the CP. Prasad was succeeded by Gupta, a 1996 batch IPS officer, in September 2020. An engineering postgraduate with a doctorate in environmental engineering, Gupta also holds a degree in law. Apart from serving in Gadhchiroli, Sindhudurg, Aurangabad, Buldhana and Nashik, Gupta has served on central deputation at the National Police Academy, Hyderabad, for several years, before being appointed the 17th commissioner of police to head Aurangabad city. Known for his impeccable integrity, Gupta has been decorated with the Union home ministry’s police medal for excellence in training, DG Insignia and National Police Academy Insignia. With the latest elevation, chances of the almost a decade-old pending proposal to upgrade the Aurangabad CP post to ADG rank getting the final nod have brightened. The proposal pending at the DG office includes extending the city police’s jurisdiction to the extent of four police stations in Aurangabad rural, allotting a post of joint CP and two additional deputy commissioners of police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-commissioner-of-police-promoted-as-adg/articleshow/85611192.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Mandatory twin-dose rule for Metro travel irks commuters||Nagpur: Citizens are upset over denial of entry into Nagpur Metro for those who haven’t received two shots of Covid vaccine. The commuters argue that no such restrictions are imposed for travel in city buses and want MahaMetro to follow suit. “Security guards at stations deny entry to passengers and their children if they fail to produce two-shot vaccine certificates. As the government has not started vaccination for children, they will not be able to use the Metro,” commuters told TOI. A Nagpur Metro spokesperson said, “We are only following the NMC’s ‘Break the Chain’ order.” Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B clarified that the guideline was issued by the state government for local trains. “NMC has asked Metro to give a representation in this regard and we will approach the state government seeking relaxation,” he said. Asha Patil, a resident of Bansi Nagar, said she recently wanted to take the Metro to Sitabuldi with her two children, but none was allowed entry. “I have got one dose of vaccine and my children have not been vaccinated. I had to travel by city bus, which took double the time and cost twice as much,” a miffed Patil said. Sanjay Yadav, a student from Khapri village, was also not allowed to board the Metro because he had received only one shot. “I had to go to Zero Mile station as I had some work at my college. I went to Khapri station to board the Metro but was denied entry. As a result, I had to walk back to Wardha Road and take a bus. I wasted one hour for nothing. The vaccination rule makes no sense and Nagpur Metro should immediately drop it,” said Yadav. BB Sharma, a senior citizen from Chinchbhuvan who had to go for a medical check-up, went to Shankar Nagar station to take the Metro. He was accompanied by his grandson, who had not received any vaccine and, hence, was not allowed to board. “I am an old man and can’t endure travel by city buses. Senior citizens can’t travel alone and those accompanying them must be allowed to use the Metro,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mandatory-twin-dose-rule-for-metro-travel-irks-commuters/articleshow/85607246.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The matter has also been informed to the Baguiati police and the civic authorities will be conducting an inquiry as to how the nuisance was being committed and who were behind the masterminds. BMC authorities sent a team of civic officials to the spot at Kestopur’s Majherpara area for inspection. “As per the initial report, we have not found anything to prove that the pond was being filled up intentionally. Some building rubbish was getting dumped in the pond. The rubbish will be removed and the entire water body will be restored. The Baguiati police have been asked to keep watch on the area to prevent any further nuisance,” said a BMC building department official. Locals did not want to say much. “We do not know whether anybody was trying to fill up the pond or not. This has been going on for some time,” said a local. There have been several complaints of illegal filling up of water bodies and unauthorised building construction in BMC area, as stop work notice have been issued to many. A few weeks back Calcutta High Court criticised state government and BMC for not being able to take steps against such illegal constructions, particularly in ward 35 and 36 consisting areas Naobhanga, Shantinagar and Nabapalli. The matter came up at court following a public interest litigation filed by locals. “A task force has been formed which will keep watch on all such illegal water body filling and unauthorized building constructions ,” said BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/partially-filled-pond-in-kestopur-to-be-restored/articleshow/85607217.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Many in BJP are no longer sure about betting on former Sainik Narayan Rane||MUMBAI: Narayan Rane’s arrest is being viewed as a setback for BJP, particularly for former CM and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. Rane is the first union minister from Maharashtra to have been arrested under stringent provisions of the Indian Penal Code, and a large number of BJP supporters feel in the wake of his statement against CM Uddhav Thackeray that it was an error on the part of the BJP leadership to induct him into the party. Fadnavis was keen on Rane’s induction into the BJP in view of elections to the Shiv Sena-controlled BMC. In BJP it has been believed Rane may help the party in wresting control of the BMC in view of his influence over the voters of Konkan who have been settled in Mumbai for decades. But now, many in the BJP are not so sure, despite the court order granting him bail in the night. Read AlsoUnion minister Narayan Rane gets bail at midnight, will move high court to quash caseUnion Cabinet minister Narayan Rane, 69, arrested on Tuesday after a Ratnagiri court refused him transit pre-arrest bail in FIRs over his 'slap' remark against CM Uddhav Thackeray, was granted bail by a Mahad magistrate minutes before midnight. The procedure in filing the case diary was not as“Rane is a good leader, but no one will accept his comment against CM Uddhav Thackeray, who is mentor and guide for several hardcore Sena workers,” a senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity. In the 2017 BMC elections, Fadnavis had made efforts to gain control of the BMC but had not succeeded, and now he is making a fresh attempt with the help of Rane. In addition, BJP is planning to strengthen its base in the coastal Konkan region. But the perception is that Rane stands completely isolated since even Fadnavis, who was instrumental in his induction into the BJP, has distanced himself from his statement. “We are with Rane but we do not endorse his statement against the chief minister,” Fadnavis said. Most senior BJP leaders in the state have endorsed Fadnavis’s view. Narayan Rane: Live updatesRane’s arrest also assumes political importance since it had been assumed that even if an offence had been registered against him, it might not be possible for law-enforcing agencies to arrest him in view of his position and clout in the NDA government led by Narendra Modi. A firebrand Sena leader, Rane quit the party in 2005 and joined Congress. Later, in 2017, he formed his own party, which he merged with BJP at the instance of Fadnavis. Subsequently, he was nominated to the Rajya Sabha as an independent and in July this year, he was inducted in the Modi government as a cabinet member. Ever since Rane merged his party with BJP, he has been targeting the Sena, particularly Uddhav Thackeray. In the past six months, he did not miss a single opportunity to criticize the CM and his son Aaditya Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-many-in-bjp-are-no-longer-sure-about-betting-on-former-sainik/articleshow/85609299.cms||---
---||Delhi||Hope rises for missing link of Barapullah Phase-III, 790m gap may finally be bridged||New Delhi: The holdup in the third phase of the Barapullah elevated road project due to problems in acquiring land to breach a 790-metre gap may now end. A Delhi government official said on Tuesday that the matter has been resolved and a new notification for work is likely to be issued in the next couple of days.The state government began the process of acquiring land for the project’s Phase III in 2015 but faced opposition from farmers in Nagli Razapur village, which falls along the alignment of the bridge between Sarai Kale Khan in the west of the Yamuna and Mayur Vihar in the east. “As soon as the acquisition of the required land is announced, the award for compensation to owners will be issued in the next one year. Once the award is done, the land & buildings department will hand over the land patches to Public Works Department for constructing pillars to connect the bridge," a PWD official overseeing the process revealed.PWD officials said it would take another year and a half to complete the project once it gets access to the acquired land. “The notification is expected to be issued in the next couple of days. August 31 is the deadline for the declaration in public of the land acquisition,” said an official. The new work will consist of putting in four foundation bases in the Yamuna floodplain, for which a total of 8.5 acres have been acquired. “Once the foundations have been laid, they will have to be left alone for seven months to enable them to settle in on the floodplain soil,” a PWD engineer explained. “This will prevent any possibility of future damage to the bridge due to a loose soil base. The overall process will take at least 18 months.” In Phase III, a flyover was being added to the existing elevated corridor to provide connectivity between Mayur Vihar Phase 1 and Sarai Kale Khan. The 3.5-km section will then be linked with the existing structure near Sarai Kale Khan. After the work started in April 2015, the elevated road was to have been completed by October 2017. This phase of the Barapullah project will improve connectivity between east, south and New Delhi and decongest the Nizamuddin Bridge, Bhairon Marg and Ring Road via Ashram Chowk. It is likely to halve the travel time between east and south Delhi to about 20 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hope-rises-for-missing-link-of-barapullah-phase-iii-790m-gap-may-finally-be-bridged/articleshow/85604702.cms||---

The child’s body was traced by the rescue team of the Ichalkaranji municipality. The police have arrested Salokhe, a resident of the Yalgud village in Hatkanangle taluka of Kolhapur. The accused works at a silver ornament factory in Hupari. He is a two-time divorcee. Salokhe had recently married the divorced mother of the 9-year-old girl. At the time of the wedding, Salokhe had assured the woman that he would accept and take care of her daughter from the previous marriage. However, once the woman got pregnant with Salokhe’s child, the couple started quarelling over the older girl. Frustrated, Salokhe finally decided to get rid of his stepdaughter. On Sunday, when the accused came home from work he found the girl playing alone. He then took her on his bike went to a barren stretch of land near the Khachnal village in Nipani area of Karnataka. His plan was to leave the girl there. However, the girl started crying loudly and he could not leave her there. He put her back on the bike and went to the bridge across the Panchaganga river at Ichalkaranji and pushed her into the water. Once returned home, his wife told him that the girl had been missing. Salokhe pretended to search for the girl and later filed a missing complaint with the Hupari police station on Sunday night. The police filed a missing complaint case and started looking for the girl. The accused also got involved in the search operation, however, his movements made the police suspicious. They questioned him extensively on Monday and Salokhe finally confessed that he had thrown the girl into the river. Police tried looking for the girl on Monday evening, but after sunset, the search operation was halted. On Tuesday morning, police restarted the search operation and with the help of a rescue team from Ichalkaranji, the girl’s body was recovered. Police carried out the panchanama and have sent the body for post mortem. A case has been registered with the Shivaji Nagar police station and the police have arrested Salokhe on a murder charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/stepdad-held-for-throwing-9-yr-old-in-river-body-found/articleshow/85611203.cms||---

The first day of school was witness to 50% of attendance in the state government run schools. While sending their wards to school, parents expressed concern over the demand for mandatory written consent of the guardians concerned that the school will not be held responsible in case a child falls sick. Government teachers said most of the parents have not given any written consent. Schools should have reopened after the vaccination of the children, they suggested. Additional director Basic education (Agra division), Mukesh Chand said, “Teachers have been strictly directed to ensure that students maintain social distancing. Classrooms will be regularly sanitized. Arrangements are being made for thermal screening and face masks. Students with Covid-19 symptoms in schools will be sent home immediately. Soon, Covid-19 testing of students will also be conducted.” Earlier this year, the state government had ordered for the opening of junior high schools with 50% attendance in the last week of February. But after the second outbreak of the Covid-19, schools were shut down after 10 days. Mukesh Verma, father of a Class VII student, said, “Schools have opened for the first time in the current session. My son wanted to go to school but I am worried about his health. Making the consent letter mandatory is suspicious. When the state government has ordered the opening of schools, then they need to take responsibility for the well-being of children.” Brajesh Dixit, a senior leader of the Uttar Pradeshiya Prathmik Sikshak Sangh, said, “The schools should have been opened after the vaccination of the children. Most of the parents are not willing to give a written consent as mandated by the state government. Arrangements for sanitation and thermal screening of the children have been made by teachers at their expense. State government should consider not opening of primary schools (Class I to V) without vaccination of the children.” The state government has ordered the opening of primary schools for Class I to V from September 1. In a letter to the DM on August 20, the Agra unit of the Indian Medical Association had advised against opening of schools till full vaccination of the children. “The number of Covid-19 cases has started increasing in different parts of the country. There is danger of the third wave of the pandemic. In this, children will be most vulnerable. We want the authorities to reconsider the decision and schools should continue with online classes for now,” said IMA Agra president, Dr Rajeev Upadhyaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/jr-govt-high-schools-reopen-in-up-after-2nd-covid-19-wave/articleshow/85604712.cms||---

The biggest skirmish unfolded at Juhu, where hundreds of Yuva Sena members gathered outside Union minister Narayan Rane’s bungalow in reaction to his son Nitesh’s “dare”. The demonstration snowballed into clashes, prompting the police to resort to a baton charge. About 10 policemen suffered minor injuries. Two separate FIRs were registered by the Santacruz police towards the end of the day but no arrests were made. The police will be going through CCTV footage to ascertain identities of those involved. Another FIR was lodged by Kasturba Marg police at Borivali (East) against Sena workers after about 60 assembled and raised slogans. Nitesh Rane had tweeted early on Tuesday morning that he had heard about Yuva Sena members being asked to gather outside his family residence at Juhu. “Don’t dare to walk into the lion’s den! We are waiting.” Around 11am, Yuva Sena members led by Varun Sardesai, Yuva Sena secretary and Aditya Thackeray’s cousin, began to congregate. Tight police security was deployed and the Special Reserve Police Force (SRPF) was also posted. “For several days now, derogatory comments are being made against our chief minister. We maintained restraint for long but our party workers couldn’t control their emotions any longer,” said Sardesai. Women workers were also a part of the Sena delegation. Soon, the police barricades outside Rane’s residence were pushed aside as the Sena protesters surged ahead. They jostled with the cops, and faced off with BJP supporters, with both groups pelting stones. Sardesai claimed the opponents were armed with tar balls and empty liquor bottles. “Two of our party workers were injured,” said Sardesai. A few vehicles were damaged and traffic was paralysed. Joint commissioner (law and order) Vishwas Nangre Patil was present on the spot. In Kalyan, Sainiks led by Vijay Salvi, Kalyan-Dombivli party president, ransacked the local BJP office and assaulted a worker. Salvi was arrested. In Ulhasnagar, Sena workers assaulted BJP corporator Pradeep Ramchandani and blackened his face. In Thane, an FIR was registered against Narayan Rane for defamation by Mayor Naresh Mhaske. Sena workers gathered in large numbers in front of the central BJP office in Khopat and tried to hurl ink-filled balloons and stones into it. Yuva Sena also agitated at various places, including Thane mental hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/party-workers-clash-at-juhu-police-lathicharge/articleshow/85609353.cms||Nitasha Natu

The rally started at St Anthony’s chapel junction and proceeded to the Dolphin circle where there was a brief meeting. Speakers at the meeting slammed the police and state government for failing to solve the mystery of the girl’s death, which they alleged was a murder and not a case of drowning as is being claimed by the police. “It is unbelievable that this girl took off all her clothes and jumped in the water to commit suicide,” the speakers said. “There are many people here in Calangute who live near the sea, and they say no woman will ever commit suicide after taking off her clothes. It is not suicide; she was put to death. It pains us to see what is happening in our village. Are we and our children safe anymore?” a speaker from Calangute asked. “How did they come to the conclusion of her death without conducting any proper investigations?” asked another local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/are-we-and-our-kids-safe-anymore/articleshow/85607329.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||‘No immunity from arrest in criminal matters’||New Delhi: A Union minister enjoys no immunity from arrest in criminal matters, according to former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary. Achary told TOI while Union ministers and MPs enjoy immunity from arrest in case of civil cases and cannot be arrested 40 days before, during, or 40 days after a Parliament session, there is “nothing in the rule book” that prevents a minister’s arrest in a criminal matter. “The Rule is that the Presiding Officer of the House, of which the arrested person is a member, must be informed upon his arrest. This information is then notified in the Parliament bulletin if the House is not in session, or informed to the House, if it is in session,” Achary said. The only exception is when a member or minister has to be arrested from the premises of Parliament, in which case permission of the Chair must be sought, he said. Under the Constitution, immunity from arrest in both civil and criminal matters extends only to the President and governors, who cannot be arrested even in criminal matters while in office. Any action, even in criminal matters, may only be initiated after they demit office.  Rane is the first Union minister to be arrested in nearly 20 years and the third to be arrested by state police. In June 2001, Murasoli Maran and T R Baalu, both Union ministers at the time, were arrested by Tamil Nadu police following the arrest of then TN CM Karunanidhi in connection with a Rs 12 crore ‘flyover scam’. Maran and Baalu were released on bail next day. But advocate Satish Maneshinde, who has appeared for Rane in the past, asked if he had committed a cognizable offence. “It is highly disputable what the cognizable offence is,” said Maneshinde, adding, “Where is the offence? He was answering a question posed to him, and it was a hypothetical situation he spoke of regarding an alleged faux pas by the CM. Does it amount to an offence of communal disharmony under Section 153 B or an offence under Section 505 (2) of IPC for promoting ill-will? The arrest was unwarranted, and the series of FIRs filed is something SC has deprecated in Arnab Goswami’s case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-immunity-from-arrest-in-criminal-matters/articleshow/85609328.cms||Swati Mathur

The event, to be held at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan in Lucknow, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. According to officials in the state urban development department, the event will be divided into three components: national exhibition, exhibition of 75 innovative constructed technologies and exhibition on UP transforming urban landscape. Officials said that UP is likely to be featured prominently in the exhibition which is expected to be a significant pointer to the rapid pace of urbanization of India and challenges like sanitation, civic infrastructure, congestion, pollution, mobility, housing etc. The Centre has launched various national urban missions for addressing various issues pertaining to urbanization. The event is proposed to be themed on projections like ‘clean urban India’, signifying zero open defecation, clean and hygienic public/community toilets, clean streets/public places and scientific processing of municipal solid waste. Besides this, the exhibition will throw light on water secure cities (cities with 100% tap water connections), housing for all (cities with dignified housing facilities), new construction technologies, Smart Cities development, sustainable mobility and cities promoting livelihood opportunities. Officials said objective of the event will be new urban development which happens to promote ‘ease of living’ and ‘ease of doing business’ and sustainability—social, economic, environmental and cultural—to facilitate cities to contribute to the economy to achieve the goal of $5-10 trillion-mark with minimal carbon footprint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-inaugurate-3-day-exhibition-on-urban-housing/articleshow/85609331.cms||---

---||Lucknow||2 UP labs in national Covid genomic surveillance grid||Lucknow: Virology labs at Lucknow’s Central Drug Research Institute and National Botanical Research Institute have been included in Indian Sars Cov-2 Genomic Surveillance Consortium (INSACOG) — a conglomerate of 28 laboratories across the country. The genomic surveillance consortium was set up by the Union health ministry, department of biotechnology with Council for Scientific Research and Indian Council of Medical Research in January to monitor genomic variations in Sars Cov-2. It also works to correlate whole genomics sequencing (WGS) data with clinical/epidemiological data for advance preparedness for public health interventions and better understanding of disease transmission, clinical severity, re-infections/immune escape, vaccine efficacy and available diagnostics tests (escape phenomenon). An official order by Union ministry of health and family welfare has listed the two labs as a satellite centre that will work in coordination with Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. “Over past few months, many variants have been detected through whole genome sequencing activity undertaken by INSACOG. The information obtained has been regularly shared with states and union territories to strengthen public health response to the pandemic,” the official order stated. For the exercise to become meaningful, it is necessary that timely clinical data and adequate number of RTPCR positive samples for genome sequencing and surveillance work is done by states too, it added. Experts say genome sequencing is crucial to countering the pandemic amid reports of an anticipated third wave and extent of damage will depend on the new strain. Indications are that if no new variant surfaces, the third wave may not be a lethal. But if the virus mutates again, the third wave may cause more harm. Officials at National Diseases Surveillance Programme unit of UP said, samples will be sent for genome sequencing to these labs as well. Earlier, a section of Covid-19 samples was being sent to Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences and King George’s Medical University. However, they said the association with CSIR labs will make normal patient care services faster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-up-labs-in-national-covid-genomic-surveillance-grid/articleshow/85609370.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Both camps wary but Narayan Tatu Rane will still be BJP’s booming gun for BMC polls||MUMBAI: Narayan Tatu Rane’s remark against CM Uddhav Thackeray and the MVA’s legal crackdown may fuel a political crisis in Maharashtra and bring the Sena-led MVA into direct confrontation with the Modi government in the coming weeks, said observers. Recently inducted into the Union cabinet, Rane was put in charge of Jan Ashirwaad yatra, the BJP’s mass contact drive, for Mumbai and Konkan. Judging from the high-voltage drama that unfolded on Tuesday, Rane will be BJP’s booming gun for the 2022 Mumbai civic polls. The BJP, which is licking its wounds 20 months after Thackeray formed the MVA government with NCP-Congress, is keen on wresting the cash-rich BMC from Sena in the 2022 elections. There were reports that the BJP high command has instructed the party’s state leadership to back Rane to the hilt. The NCP-Congress may want Thackeray to adhere to legal measures, while the latter may be under pressure from the party rank and file to pursue the Sena’s rough and ready politics to contain Rane, said analysts. “Rane is paying the Sena in its own coin. Don’t forget Rane is a product of the Sena’s ‘rada’ (street violence, in Sena’s lexicon) culture,” said a state BJP functionary. The BJP may well tap Rane’s resources and organisational skills to weaken Sena’s link with Konkan, which has sustained Sena’s Marathi votebank in Mumbai. A large slice of the city’s Marathi-speaking voters have money order ties with Konkan. Rane was a valuable help to Sena when the party was set to make inroads into the coastal Konkan belt, which once was a Socialist citadel, in the 1990s. Rane belongs to Malwan in the Konkan belt. But both BJP and Sena seem trapped in their own dilemmas following the Rane bazooka, sources said. The Sena is worried Rane’s political stock would go up following his arrest. On the other hand, if left unchecked, Rane could keep tearing into the Sena in the run-up to the BMC elections. Close Rane friends said he loves fish and a good fight, adding he has for long been nursing ire against Uddhav for disrupting his stint in the Sena. Equally worried are BJP strategists who think Rane may become a liability because of his penchant to shoot from the hip. He had, they said, made matters hard for state Congress leaders with his verbal attack on the party high command for not having made him CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-both-camps-wary-but-rane-will-still-be-bjps-booming-gun-for-bmc-polls/articleshow/85609383.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||Delhi||Conduct drill in Nehru Place: Delhi high court to fire department||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday ordered a fire drill in Nehru Place to identify problems likely to be faced by fire tenders in accessing the area in case of an emergency. A fire incident had recently taken place in the area. “The chief fire officer, Delhi is directed to ensure that the local fire station conducts a mock fire drill in Nehru Place on a working day and identifies the shortcomings/hindrances. The recommendations/suggestions mooted by the fire department shall be furnished to this court as well as to the committee headed by the chief engineer, DDA within three weeks,” a bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla noted. The court was hearing a PIL initiated by it after taking note of an incident of fire at a building in Nehru Place, District Commercial Centre on August 12. While there were no casualties, it said the enormity of the problem caused by hawkers and vendors in the area, which could be seen from a video circulated on social media, meant that it was difficult for fire tenders to access the building where the fire broke out due to short circuit. On Tuesday, the bench also made it clear that DDA, the south corporation and Delhi Police will ensure that “the approach/perimeter roads as well as internal roads are free from encroachments and are in good condition so that fire tenders can reach any part of Nehru Place complex within a short period of time in the event of an emergency.” The high court had earlier directed Delhi Police and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to ensure, on a daily basis, that there is no hawking and vending resorted to at Nehru Place, District Commercial Centre by any person who does not have an operative order of protection granted by any court. Delhi Police and SDMC informed the court that only 95 hawkers who have been granted protection by the courts carry on their business in the area even as the agencies were conducting anti-encroachment drives on a daily basis. Advocate Arjun Pant, appearing for DDA, said that a committee had been formed comprising chief engineer of DDA, DCP (South East) and DCP (Traffic) and other officers, to keep a watch on any issue that may emerge in relation to Nehru Place, including safety, smooth movement, ingress and egress of the public as well as vehicles. The court, meanwhile, issued notice to Delhi Jal Board after it was told that the authority was carrying out repairing work of existing sewage lines in and around the area. It also sought authorities’ responses on intervention applications filed by hawkers and traders operating in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conduct-drill-in-nehru-place-hc-to-fire-dept/articleshow/85604804.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Aurangabad||HC admits PIL on biodiversity heritage tag for Himayat Bagh||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench ofthe Bombay high court has admitted a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking ‘biodiversity heritage site’ status for the historic Himayat Bagh under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 — a move that has excited nature lovers and heritage experts alike. The petitioner, advocate Sandesh Hange, in his plea before the court has also sought directions to recognize the iconic place as an ancient monument and archaeological site under the Maharashtra Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1960. The two-member bench of Justices S V Gangapurwala and R N Laddha has admitted the aforesaid PIL and asked for issuing notices to different authorities who have been made party in the case. The respondents include central government, state government, state archaeological department, national biodiversity authority, state biodiversity board and Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, among others. The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), which is one of the stakeholders at Himayat Bagh, could not be made party in the case as its local biodiversity panel stands dissolved. The environmentalists, nature lovers and historians who have been highlighting alleged official apathy towards Himayat Bagh, which according to them was causing irrevocable damage to the historic site, have kept their fingers crossed for effective legal intervention. “We have now pinned all our hopes on the judiciary now for saving Himayat Bagh as pleas made in past before different authorities fell on deaf ears. We fear that the historic place will vanish in near future if no timely steps are taken,” Nilesh Dharashivkar, a wildlife enthusiast, said. While the fortification wall and some other parts of Himayat Bagh have already been damaged beyond repair, the site has been witnessing huge ecological damage that allegedly fails to get official attention. Nearly 400-year-old Himayat Bagh houses some of the old trees besides being home to different flora and fauna, including a large number of migratory and resident birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-admits-pil-on-biodiversity-heritage-tag-for-himayat-bagh/articleshow/85611237.cms||Prasad Joshi

They are survived by a son, a Class XII student, and a daughter, a Class IX student. The Singanallur police identified the deceased as M Mohammed Hanif, 44, and wife M Mumtaj, 39. Hanif was a lineman with Tangedco for a consolidated pay. A police officer said Hanif had fallen off an electric pole six months ago, injuring his spinal cord. “After that, he was not able to work and the couple had borrowed a few lakh rupees from various people. As they couldn’t repay the amount, they decided to end their lives.” As the couple didn’t come out of their house even at 11am on Tuesday, the officer said, neighbours knocked on their door. “As there was no response, they broke into the house and found the couple hanging from the ceiling using a sari. Their son was asleep, while daughter was at her uncle’s house in Tirupur.” When alerted, the Singanallur police recovered the dead bodies and sent them to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem.

---||Delhi||Civic polls in sight, AAP set to launch month-long drive from September 1||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party is likely to start its campaign for the 2022 municipal elections with a month-long drive from September 1 to corner BJP, which has been heading the corporations for the past 15 years, over corruption and mounting garbage. AAP’s Delhi convener, Gopal Rai, on Tuesday announced that 2,500 meetings would be organised under Aapka Vidhayak Aapke Dwar. The party MLAs will hold meetings with common people to understand their problems and discuss with them ways to make Delhi free of corruption and garbage. Preparation meetings will be held at all 272 wards from August 25 to 30.AAP, which has been running Delhi for over six years, is the main opposition party in all three municipal corporations. “People gave chances to BJP to run the municipal corporations, but BJP’s councillors gave only garbage and corruption to the people,” Rai said during a press conference. “If you go to any locality under any corporation in the capital, the first thing you meet there is garbage. Our Prime Minister ran Swachh Bharat Mission, yet BJP’s councillors and mayors failed to fulfil it in Delhi. Swachh Bharat Mission failed in Delhi and it remained filled with garbage.” The Delhi AAP convener alleged that BJP didn’t have the intention to do any work. “It seems as if they have an ego and believe that irrespective of whether they work, they will win the elections. BJP’s functionaries seem to have this arrogance that it is the compulsion of Delhi’s people to vote for the party. Corruption has taken over all corporations.” AAP has been claiming that it would make the civic bodies free of corruption and the capital free of garbage. “AAP’s MLAs will visit localities under all assembly constituencies. All meetings will follow the anti-Covid norms,” Rai said.AAP has appointed Lok Sabha constituency-level in-charges who will monitor the campaign, 14 in-charges at the district level and 70 at the assembly segment-level. They will centrally monitor the campaign to receive feedback from the ground level and sort out problems on a regular basis. “After its completion on September 30, we will review the outcomes and draw the outline for the next campaign on its basis,” added Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-polls-in-sight-aap-set-to-launch-month-long-drive-from-september-1/articleshow/85604813.cms||---

---||Delhi||Work on to ease waterlogging woes, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: The progress on the drainage master plan, which aims to make the capital free of the perennial waterlogging problem, was reviewed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday. It’s common to find roads, underpasses, key intersections and several residential areas inundated after heavy rain, which leads to chaotic scenes across the city. Mentioning that the government was fully committed to finding and implementing solutions to the problem, the CM said, “The drainage system will be further bolstered and made foolproof. Officials should conduct studies and find solutions for every storm water drain and sewer system. Every gap in the drainage system must be plugged. If there’s a fault in a drain’s slope, it needs to be fixed. If any drain meets a dead end, it needs to be corrected. A proper plan should be chalked out for connecting smaller drains to larger ones. Specific projects should be taken up for fixing each problem. The work needs to be expedited and every issue must be dealt with intricately and with proper care.” The high-level review meeting at Delhi Secretariat was attended by water minister Satyendar Jain, Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Raghav Chadha, chief secretary Vijay Dev and senior officials of various departments. Instructing the officials to implement the changes keeping in mind heavy rainfall, Kejriwal said the capital would soon get freedom from waterlogging as work was being expedited on the drainage master plan. Necessary changes suggested by IIT-Delhi would be implemented to bolster the drainage system and make it robust so that it could deal with heavy rainfall. Delhi government would hire consultants to plan and present project reports for all drainage lines to expedite the implementation of the projects. A report on the drainage master plan was presented to the CM and even he gave his suggestions to curb the waterlogging problem. There are around 2,850 drains in Delhi with a combined length of 3,692 kilometres. A majority of these drains are with the Public Works Department (PWD). Delhi is divided into three major natural drainage basins, Trans-Yamuna, Barapullah and Najafgarh. In addition, there are small basins like Aruna Nagar and Chandrawal, which drain directly into the Yamuna. The drainage master plan is to be made for 30-35 years compatible with Master Plan of Delhi 2021. An action plan would be formulated for its implementation in phases and feasibility reports for priority projects for the first five years along with future plans would be prepared. An expert committee has been working to decide design parameters and technical inputs, like rainfall intensity, return period, runoff coefficient and retention period for the drainage master plan, while experts from IIT-Delhi have been roped in to analyse the drainage system and suggest solutions for them. Studies are being conducted on the drainage system with the help of two high-quality digital models — hydrological and urban storm water management. The hydrological model stresses on soil and water assessment to find the total runoff in drains, while the urban storm water management model lays emphasis on providing drainage solutions and drain dimensions to resolve existing problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-work-on-to-ease-waterlogging-woes/articleshow/85604939.cms||AlokKNMishra

Appearing for CAG before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, standing counsel Gaurang Kanth stated that after 2015, no documents or records had been shared by DJB and there was no audit.The court’s query came while hearing a PIL seeking direction to CAG to audit the accounts of DJB claiming its financial audit had allegedly not been carried out for the last six years. The court decided to issue a notice and sought the response of Delhi government, DJB and CAG and listed the matter for October 4.Filed by Delhi BJP functionary Harish Khurana, the petition sought direction to DJB to maintain proper accounts and other relevant records and prepare an annual profit and loss statement with proper balance sheets from 2015 onwards as per Section 70 of Delhi Water Board Act and to direct CAG to conduct an audit.The plea stated that responses to RTIs of May 11, May 24 and July 22 this year revealed that the balance sheet from 2015-16 onwards was still under preparation. Senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose, appearing for DJB, opposed the PIL and contended that the plea had been filed by an office-bearer of a rival party with political motives and submitted that the audit was going on.“Since the authorities have failed to perform the functions laid down under the law, the petitioner is approaching the court. It is mandatory to maintain financial accounts and conduct an annual audit to ascertain effective functioning of the state and local bodies. Maintaining financial accounts and conducting an annual audit help secure accountability and transparency of the functioning of the state and local bodies towards the general public,” the plea added.The plea alleged that DJB and CAG had failed to perform the functions laid down under the law, which make it mandatory to maintain financial accounts and conduct an annual audit in order to ascertain the effective functioning of the state and local bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-audit-of-djb-since-2015-high-court-seeks-response-of-govt-cag/articleshow/85604852.cms||Abhinav Garg

The police have also recovered mobile phone of the angadia firm owner from the car that was abandoned near Chirai village about 30 km from Anjar. On Monday evening, angadia firm owner from Anjar Bhavin Thakkar was robbed of valuables worth Rs 65 lakh by three assailants.

One of the assailants then threw chilli powder on Thakkar's face and fled with his car, which had the cash and jewellery. The bike on which the accused had come turned out to be stolen. “We traced the movement of the accused on the basis of Thakkar’s mobile phone which the robbers had taken. It seems they abandoned the car and the mobile,” police said. “Prima facie, it appears to be the handiwork of local youths who may have got a tip from an insider,” police said. “Some gangs use this modus operandi of colliding with the target’s vehicle before robbing them,” police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/robbery-victims-car-found-30km-away/articleshow/85604953.cms||---

Senior counsel Rafique Dada, appearing for state, said there was a meeting with the senior-most officials of the state on the issue. He sought time and the bench of Justice S S Shinde and Jistice N J Jamadar adjourned the hearing of a plea by the CBI to Thursday. Last week, questioning why the state was not handing over the phone-tap report and documents requested by the CBI, the high court had sought a “congenial solution” by August 24. The CBI’s grievance was of non-cooperation by the state in its investigation against former home minister Anil Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-work-out-solution-with-cbi-on-call-tap-report-state/articleshow/85609418.cms||---

The works done by the Centre that would be highlighted include construction of flyovers, highways, National War Memorial, free rations, 884-acre eco-park at Badarpur, among others.Union minister Meenakshi Lekhi, North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari, West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma, Chandni Chowk MP Harsh Vardhan, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, former Delhi BJP presidents and all core committee members participated in the meeting.Delhi BJP in-charge Baijayant Jay Panda and national general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh guided workers on making the party stronger so that it could win the municipal polls.Sources said Santosh asked the Delhi BJP functionaries to focus on discipline and complement one another and make the party unit stronger. Internal rift is one of the key challenges before Delhi BJP and the party wants to address it before the municipal polls likely to be held in early 2022.BJP has been in power in the corporations for nearly 15 years. Despite a stiff challenge from AAP and Congress in 2017, it won by a majority in all three civic bodies. In the 2022 elections, it faces a bigger challenge with AAP having come to power in the state with brute majority for the second time.Bidhuri said it was discussed that the Modi government had invested a lot in the development of Delhi by giving flyovers, highways, peripheral expressways to take heavy vehicular traffic load off the roads. However, the AAP government did not invest in infrastructure.“The AAP government has not done anything substantial for the capital’s development. We will be countering it on this and highlighting the contribution of the Modi government for Delhi’s development. We will run an aggressive awareness campaign,” said Bidhuri. Better use of social media was also stressed upon in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-readies-counter-offensive-against-aap-govt/articleshow/85604872.cms||---

Addressing the airport advisory committee meeting, he said the city corporation would address the issue. Earlier, airport officials had explained to him how the birds in the locality may disrupt the flight movement. The meeting was attended by MP P R Natarajan, corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, deputy police commissioner T Jayachandran and airport director S Senthil Valavan. The collector said the administration in association with industrialists would make efforts to operate more flights to and from the city. “It will help overall development of the district, especially business activities.” Referring to the complaints that the traffic snarl on Avinashi Road was delaying travel to the airport, Sameeran said the city police would focus more on the stretches that lead to the airport. “Buses will be operated once in every hour to provide better connectivity to the airport. A bus shelter would also be installed closer to the airport.” Pointing out that the trade and business activities in the district was expected to grow faster in the days to come, he said the airport would be developed to meet the demand in consultation with all stakeholders. He said the acquisition of 628 acres for the airport expansion would be completed soon.

Describing the query as a bolt from blue, additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao assured the court that he will ascertain whether the CM had made any such statement. “Tell us by Wednesday,” said a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy while hearing a PIL seeking implementation of the GO and an implead petition seeking removal of those areas that were outside the catchment area of Osman Sagar lake. Agni Agro Tech Ltd, which has 17 acres near the lake, is now seeking a direction to the government from the high court to give effect to the recommendation made by the experts committee, contending that its land was outside the catchment area. “We have no quarrel with GO 111. We are aggrieved by the inaction of the government to act on a recommendation made by an agency commissioned by the state itself,” senior counsel Vivek Reddy said summing up the case of Agni Agro Tech. At this juncture, Justice Vijaysen Reddy referred to a report in a vernacular daily that quoted KCR saying that GO 111 would be scrapped soon. Meanwhile, the bench also sought to know the details of these plots and their proximity with the recently auctioned plots at Kokapet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-query-to-t-govt-did-cm-ever-say-hell-scrap-go-111/articleshow/85607457.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Rao requested Congressmen to submit names of aspirants through the block committee during the Congress block meeting at Sanguem held on Tuesday evening. Local Congress functionary Abijeet Dessai, indirectly hinting at local independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar, said that Congress must allot the upcoming assembly election ticket to a loyal Congressman. Gaonkar’s brother Sandesh along with his supporters joined Congress a month ago. There is a possibility of Prasad’s entry into the Congress fold before the assembly tenure ends. Yuri Alemao, who lost to BJP in the 2012 elections with just 300 votes in Sanguem constituency, also attended the meeting.

---||Lucknow||How India lost ground to Pak in export of footballs||Lucknow: India lost ground to Pakistan after the neighbouring country switched to manufacturing thermos-bonded balls and bagged the contract for supplying footballs at FIFA World Cup in 2014 and 2018. EXIM Bank report on sports goods manufacturing in India said, in 2010-11, football was the second largest sports good exported from India with a share of 12% of total exports of sports goods. However, this fell sharply to 3.7% by 2019-20. “Deceleration in export of footballs is due to rising demand for those made in Pakistan. Since FIFA 2014, Pakistan has been a major supplier of footballs and a major competitor for footballs manufactured in India. Also, growing preference for machine-stitched footballs from China has reduced demand for handstitched footballs made in India. Vietnam is also fast emerging as a competitor in manufacturing of footballs,” the report says. To regain lost ground, mechanization of the production process is important, the report adds, saying this would require investment in machinery and the government can consider providing capital subsidy of 15%. “As most enterprises in sports goods sector are MSMEs, the capital subsidy can be included under the scope of National Manufacturing Competitiveness Programme of Ministry of MSMEs,” it says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/how-india-lost-ground-to-pak-in-export-of-footballs/articleshow/85609459.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Mumbai||25% jump in 95%+ scorers seeking FYJC admissions in Mumbai division||MUMBAI: The 95% plus club of class X students seeking admission in first-year junior colleges (FYJC) in the Mumbai division has shot up by 25% this year. The provisional merit list released for the 2.02 lakh FYJC aspirants has 4,745 students scoring 95% and above compared to last year’s 3,802. A total of 28 students on the merit list have bagged perfect 100%. Of these, 22 have opted for science, four for commerce, and two girls have chosen arts. Among the 100% scorers, 24 are from the state board. Girls outshine boys among the top scorers with 23 getting 100%. This year, with no exams, results were based on internal assessment. The number of students with 90% and above seeking FYJC admissions has dropped by 4% compared to last year. “A jump in 95% and drop in 90% could mean that the top-rung colleges may get students with higher scores,” said a principal. In an indication of what is in store for cut-offs in top-rung colleges, a student with the 100th rank had scored 98.6% last year; this year, the same rank corresponds to 99.2%. However, the corresponding scores for ranks below 10,000 have dropped this year, indicating that the cut-offs may eventually drop in the second round. Kelkar-Vaze’s junior college vice-principal, Vidyadhar Joshi, said that the top-rung colleges may have slightly higher cut-offs or they may remain the same as there is only a marginal drop in 90%+ scorers. In the minority list released during the weekend, a few sought-after colleges have seen a drop in the cut-offs and in some others, they remained unchanged. While a CBSE student with a 100% is in the number two position on the provisional merit list, the first ICSE student is in 45th position with 99.6%. The number one slot for FYJC admission has been taken by an SSC student wanting to pursue commerce. On number three is an Economically Weaker Section student with 100% wanting to join the science stream. Since several students were bunching up with identical marks, the education department made use of date of birth as a tiebreaker. For instance, of two students with the same marks, the older one gets the higher rank. For students with the same marks and the same date of birth, the department made use of alphabetical order of the name and then the surname to decide the students’ position on the merit list. Corrections to the provisional merit list was carried out on Tuesday. The first merit list will be announced on August 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-25-jump-in-95-scorers-seeking-fyjc-admissions/articleshow/85609458.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Mumbai||‘No income, yet Gadchiroli case accused had Rs 10 lakh’||MUMBAI: A special NIA court that rejected the discharge and bail pleas of a 71-year-old accused in the May 1, 2019, Gadchiroli attack in which 15 policemen and one civilian died, said the fact that he was found in possession of a “huge amount” of Rs 10.3 lakh despite having no known source of income or paying income tax can be said to be prima facie material that he was involved in collecting funds for banned organisation CPI (Maoist). The defence for accused Sathyanarayan Rani had told the court the money was to be used by his wife and co-accused Narmada Akka for her cancer treatment in Hyderabdad. The couple was arrested in the case in June 2019. Narmada Akka, accused of heading the conspiracy, was recently allowed by the court to seek medical treatment. She is reportedly suffering from stage four cancer. The court said it was satisfied there is prima facie material available against Rani, which if remained unrebutted certainly would warrant conviction. The prosecution also submitted that during the couple’s house search, from electronic devices, Naxal literature, videos, Naxal praising songs, Mao, Lenin and Marx’s ideology, reports of Communist Party of Nepal and China and audio clips of revenge speeches were seized. The court said it was well aware that mere seizure of material is not sufficient to brand the possessor as a member of the banned organisation. “...if the material placed on record in the form of the confessional statement of the co-accused is considered, in that case it can be said that this is not the case of mere possessing the literature of the banned organisation, but the same is sufficient to prima facie conclude that the applicant was the active member of the banned terrorist organisation,” the court said. On May 1, 2019, an improvised explosive device was used to carry out the blast when the police team was travelling in a private vehicle to Kurkheda village to take stock of the situation after Naxalites set on fire vehicles and machines. The victims were allegedly killed in an attack by Naxals under a small bridge near Jambhulkheda village in Gadchiroli district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-income-yet-gadchiroli-case-accused-had-rs-10l/articleshow/85602502.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A mob soon gathered around him, tied up his feet so he couldn't escape, dragged him by his hair, beat him up and stamped on his neck to make him "confess" to his alleged crime. He was assaulted for nearly 30 minutes before police arrived. Cops found no stolen goods with him. One Devendra Kumar, who lives in Shahjahanpur, said in his complaint that while waiting for a bus to Rudrapur he found his phone had gone missing from his pocket. As he started looking for it, another man, who has not been identified, said his wallet, too, had been stolen. They started questioning those standing around them. When Sahil fumbled, they accosted him. They asked him his name and then the assault began. In one of the videos shared on social media, he is seen crouching on the ground as a person asks him what he stole and keeps slapping him. And in a series of photos, a man in a light blue shirt is seen standing over him, his foot on Sahil's neck to choke him as he is visibly gasping for breath. By the time police got there, Sahil was badly bruised. They took him to the district hospital, where a medical checkup was done. He was discharged and taken straight to the police lockup. On the basis of Kumar's complaint, an FIR was registered against an "unidentified" person. "We found Sahil was involved in the crime (of theft)," Kotwali SHO Pankaj Pant told TOI. "We found a phone from a person called Sabir, his friend. He has also been arrested ... We will decide on action after ensuring Sahil's role in the theft."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/for-confession-mob-tramples-on-neck-of-up-theft-accused/articleshow/85611703.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Delhi||Lights, camera and action! DDA wants you to take a closer look at revamped floodplain||NEW DELHI: For the last couple of years, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has been meticulously working on rejuvenating and ecologically restoring the Yamuna riverfront as part of its ambitious project Asita, which is another name of the river. Earlier this year, DDA’s efforts were chosen to be showcased at the prestigious London Design Biennale 2021, a global gathering of the designers, curators and design institutes. The authority now wants Delhiites to enjoy the beauty and serenity of the riverfront from close quarters, but without disturbing the flora and fauna of this ecologically sensitive zone. DDA plans to provide solar-powered illumination of the Yamuna floodplain from Wazirabad in north Delhi to Jaitpur in the south near the Delhi-Haryana border, a span of nearly 25km. DDA is first going to appoint a consultant for the project, which includes installation of infra-red CCTV cameras that will also operate on solar power. As part of the ongoing Asita project, which aims at both rejuvenation of the floodplain and protection of its flora and fauna, the authority also wants to provide basic amenities in the area so that public may visit the sites to know about the river and understand its importance, said a senior official. “For this, illumination of the Yamuna floodplain with minimum intensity is required, keeping in mind not to disturb its flora and fauna,” the official said. “Malba dumping will be checked and encroachers will also be deterred along the Wazirabad-Jaitpur stretch.” The project is expected to be completed in a year. “Nine CCTV cameras have been planned for three sites in coordination with the landscape wing of DDA and the number may increase with time,” the official said. “These will be used for 24x7 vigilance of the area.” As part of an initiative to protect land in the trans-Yamuna area, 81 CCTV cameras are already functioning. “These are for surveillance and monitoring of the Yamuna floodplain and work for installing 12 more CCTV cameras is in progress,” he said. As part of the overall Asita project, an area of up to 150 metres from the river is being developed as wetlands, where grasses and tree species that are natural in that environment are planted. For areas beyond this, which are closer to habitation, DDA has planned parks and other facilities that people would be able to visit. “However, such leisure areas are not allowed close to the river and the wetland and leisure areas will not be mixed up,” he said. While DDA will develop visitor’s zones, parks, nature trails etc, the wetlands will remain off limits for the public. As part of Phase 1 of Asita, DDA had taken over 494 acres of the Yamuna western riverbank between Old Yamuna Bridge and ITO Bridge and created wetlands and a green buffer area along the river, apart from parks, recreational areas, green walkways, cycle tracks etc. These facilities are already open to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lights-camera-and-action-dda-wants-you-to-take-a-closer-look-at-revamped-floodplain/articleshow/85605058.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation website needs monumental revival||AHMEDABAD: While we celebrated Ahmedabad being declared a World Heritage site back in July 2017, a look at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s official website would make one think that the civic body has not received the good news yet. “Ahmedabad will be the first Indian city to receive UNESCO’s World Heritage City status — tentative application accepted by UNESCO for the same,” claims its official website ahmedabadcity.gov.in. This excerpt belongs to a note that Padmashri and 2018 Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient B V Doshi had written for AMC when it was put on Unesco’s tentative list in 2011. And even four years after Ahmedabad bagged the tag of being India’s first World Heritage City, AMC has not shown much interest in updating the website with pertinent information. What is even more shocking is that except for Bhadrakali temple, no monument from the Walled City, not even a haveli or timber home from the centuries-old pols, has made it to heritage.ahmedabadcity.gov.in — the one-page sub-domain linked to AMC’s website that celebrates city’s Unesco status. Interestingly, no heritage site, including 65 Jain temples — some of which are as old as the city itself — and Islamic monuments that are known worldwide for their syncretic blending of Saracenic and Indian architectural styles popularly known as ‘Gujarat style’, has found a place on this webpage. The Siddi Sayed mosque, Rani Sipri mosque, Jumma Masjid, Jhoolta Minara, Rani no Hajiro and not even the 12 Ahmedabad gates which are part of Ahmedabad’s official dossier to Unesco have been acknowledged. Instead, if you click on the ‘World Heritage City’ banner on AMC’s website, the site shows buildings that are not part of world heritage list and are also outside the walled city. These include Kankaria lake, Gandhi Ashram, Vastrapur lake, Sardar Patel memorial, Calico museum, Kite museum, Lalbhai Dalpatbhai museum, Camp Hanuman Mandir, Adalaj ni Vav, Sarkhej Roza, Vaishnodevi Temple and even the Riverfront. But wait, there is even more disappointment in store when you click on the images of these “heritage monuments”. The link leads you to the ‘Way Back Machine on Internet Archive’—a site that stores images of front pages of websites from the past. If you really want to learn about city’s Unesco status, it is available on whc.unesco.org, details for which were provided by AMC. Rajesh Dave, chairman of AMC’s Recreation, Cultural and Heritage Committee told TOI that he was unaware of the issue and will look into it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-website-needs-monumental-revival/articleshow/85607597.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

A police officer said Moorthy had first molested the 15-year-old girl, who was his relative, two months ago. “He saw her watching videos on her mobile phone and then molested the girl twice by threatening to tell her parents that she was watching obscene videos. He had warned her not to reveal the incident to anyone,” the officer said. Moorthy, the officer said, had gone to her house two days ago and molested the girl again after sending her younger brother out to buy a cricket ball. This time, the officer said, the girl informed her parents about the incident. On Monday, her parents lodged a complaint with the east all-woman police, who registered a case against Moorthy under Section 9 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and arrested him.

---||Delhi||Give free foodgrain without insistence on ration card as long as the policy allows: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the AAP government and its agencies to distribute free ration to people without any insistence on ration card as long as the policy permits. During the hearing, the court also suggested linking free ration distribution to recipients being vaccinated to encourage vaccination against Covid-19. “Free ration isn’t to be given till everyone is vaccinated, that should be the order. Every day the Prime Minister is saying (get vaccinated). You come to court for free ration but don’t want to get vaccinated,” the judge remarked. The court was hearing a petition by seven people who were working in the unorganised sector and sought free supply of ration during the lockdown period in the absence of ration cards. “It is needless to state that the respondents will continue to provide free ration to the petitioners and other similarly placed persons as long as the scheme for free ration without insistence on ration card continues,” justice Rekha Palli observed. Delhi government told the court that presently, in accordance with its policy, ration was being duly provided to the petitioners without demanding ration cards. The Centre on its part added that even though it did not play any role in the distribution, foodgrains were being allocated to the state governments from the central pool under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. The court was told that this scheme will remain operational till November. Considering that the petitioners were receiving foodgrain even after the lockdown, the court said that nothing survived in the matter. The court proceeded to dispose of the petition and observed: “It not meant to be monitored forever. The government is doing its job.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/give-free-foodgrain-without-insistence-on-ration-card-as-long-as-the-policy-allows/articleshow/85604971.cms||---

NGOs Pricol and Siruthuli took up this initiative, known as ‘Aranyam’, with the support of Coimbatore city municipal corporation to plant trees on the reserve sites. Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara planted the first sapling on the reserve site. The uniqueness of this project is that a large number of Palmyra saplings were planted all along the perimeter of the parcel of land with a layered plantation of various native trees in a Miyawaki pattern that would soon form a mini forest. “This upcoming residential area where numerous concrete buildings are coming up with no green cover around, such small pockets of land with tree cover will soon become the much-needed lung space,” said Vanitha Mohan, managing trustee of Siruthuli, while expressing her happiness for permitting to carry out plantation projects in these reserve sites. Children from nearby areas actively participated in planting trees which they promised to nurture till they grow up into big trees filled with life, she said. For people in such residential units it will be a vital space to get along and carry out their daily heath regimes to stay fit and live a disease-free life. The members of the local community came up with ideas after seeing the activity in their neighbourhood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/miyawaki-forest-plantation-drive-begins-on-vacant-plots/articleshow/85607450.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kochi||Kerala: Soon, SOP to identify vulnerability in children||KOCHI: The state women and child development (WCD) department is finalizing a standard operating procedure (SOP) for staff and stakeholders involved in working with children and their issues. This SOP will also work as an early identification or a preventive system to alert the vulnerability of children in need of help and support. This could play a role in checking child suicides in the state. A total of 323 child suicides were reported in the state from Jan-Dec 2020, according to data with the state crime records bureau (SCRB). The rise in the number of child suicides has triggered a major concern during the Covid pandemic year as it exploded the myth that children are safe and happy in homes and under parental care. It exposed that parents were not able to either identify or flag off any behavioural issues that could trigger suicide tendencies in children. A report on the child suicides in Kerala Jan 1- July 31, 2020 by a five-member committee led by DGP R Sreelekha noted the failure in the functioning of ‘family’ as an entity as well as certain lacunae in the society in general cause serious problems in effective and healthy nurturing of children. Children lack the much-needed physical and psychological support they expect from home, society and friends. “Nowadays children are unable to cope with even minor forms of stress and often struggle to handle failures and rejection, unlike in the past, and this has led many of them to take the grave decision of ending their lives,” it said. “We are actually developing separate protocols for child protection functionaries, parents, stakeholders, officials, etc. A series of webinars, awareness programmes are also being coordinated to develop procedures for these functionaries. There are international protocols and we will customize it to our system,” said Anupama TV, director-WCD. The biggest challenge has been that parents or common people do not know how to identify symptoms which if ignored could turn tragic. “There will be different orientation programmes for community-level workers, teachers, counsellors etc. We will prepare them for identifying a child who is vulnerable and when an identification is made, what needs to be done. School counsellors will be equipped so that they can train the teachers,” said Kavita Manoj, state coordinator, Kaval Plus. This module or SOP will integrate all the WCD projects which are working to help vulnerable children. Yet another focus will be on child care institutions including homes and orphanages. When a child is brought in, the staff will be expected to follow a procedure which will identify any existing vulnerabilities. Unlike the earlier projects, this SOP and orientation will bring in all the agencies working together towards prevention of suicides among children, officials said. Projects like the ORC and Chiri are already working in that direction, but this will connect all the projects under an umbrella network for protection of children in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/soon-sop-to-identify-vulnerability-in-children/articleshow/85607520.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

One of the managements suspended six teachers who exposed a panel member’s bid to suppress their pay cut issue. Chaudhari didn’t respond to TOI’s calls. Around 60 aggrieved engineering teachers led by Nagpur University Teachers Association (NUTA) held a protest at the new administrative building on Tuesday, demanding revocation of suspension and compliance of the report. In its report, the five-member panel comprising management council members had recommended that VC Chaudhari issue directives to 10 engineering colleges that were found withholding salaries of teachers for the last two years. The panel had also visited the 10 colleges to verify complaints received from teachers about their harassment since the pandemic started, and before it. NUTA vice-president Nitin Kongre — who is a member of the panel too — and joint secretary Ajiet Jachak met Chaudhari and held a day-long discussion on the status of each college. “The VC is under pressure from the engineering faculty. We sat with him from 11am till 6pm and told him that none of the 10 colleges had yet restored the pay. But he refused to haul up the college principals or management, despite having powers to do so,” Kongre said. Some years ago, Kongre and Jachak had ensured that then VC SP Kane order revocation of adverse decision against some teachers, using his special powers as per the Act. Kongre added that Priyadarshini Indira Gandhi College of Engineering suspended the six teachers without due cause. “Misbehaviour with panel has been shown as cause of action,” Kongre said. He further added, “We are the panel and the six teachers complained against the member-secretary for suppressing their grievance. We demanded revocation in two days.” The aggrieved teachers said they had complained about the pay cut in 2018, which was to be clubbed with the ongoing redressal process. “The college came to know about it and suspended us,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unpaid-teachers-suspended-vc-refuses-to-order-revocation/articleshow/85609542.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Agra||Calcutta Univ colleges deny admission to student from AMU board school||Calcutta Univ colleges deny admission to student from AMU board schoolAnuja.Jaiswal@timesgroup.com Agra: A student from a school affiliated to the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) Board of Secondary and Senior Secondary Education has been denied admission to two colleges of the Calcutta University because UP’s list of approved school boards has still not been updated. Last month, an AMU board student had also been rejected by the Army because of this. Sajidul Haque Laskar, 18, passed his Class XII AMU board exams from the Saiyyid Hamid Senior Secondary School in Aligarh this year. “I applied for a BCom degree at Maulana Azad College and Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration, both under Calcutta University. Neither accepted my application because I am from the AMU board,” he said. The AMU board is listed by the Council of Boards of School of Education in India but is not on the UP state list. When Mursalim Khan, 20, was rejected at an Army recruitment drive because he, too, had studied at an AMU board-affiliated school, a senior UP secondary education board official had told TOI that the board had been on the state’s list till March 2014 but was dropped for “some reason” after that. On Tuesday, Major (Dr) Syed Mohammad Mustafa, principal of Laskar’s school, checked with the education board officials again but was told the state list of approved boards is still being processed. “We have written to the Calcutta University vice chancellor to get the AMU board listed as soon as possible. The last for applications is August 27,” he said. The vice chancellor, Sonali Chakravarty Banerjee, said the decision was up to institutions. “We have 154 affiliated colleges. They have their own administrations and their own guidelines,” Banerjee said. She declined to comment on why individual colleges denied admission to a student from the AMU board. The AMU board was set up under the Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920, which gave the university power to “establish and maintain high schools and other institutions” within a “15-mile radius from the university mosque. It was recognised by the UGC in 1984.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/calcutta-univ-colleges-deny-admission-to-student-from-amu-board-school/articleshow/85604976.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Apart from its exiting investor Roots Venture, the Ahmedabad-based startup also saw investors such as Sharrp Ventures, Survam Partners and Waao Partners participate in the series A round of funding. The startup intends to utilize fresh investment primarily to scale up the user base and build many industry-first tech and data solutions to optimize the marketing funnel for D2C brands starting from new product development to consumer acquisition and retention. Also, the platform is going to invest in creating servicing infrastructure across the country, to widen the product trial touchpoints and strengthen the online service delivery to better the pre-purchase buying experience for consumers. Founded by Swagat Sarangi and Siddhartha Nangia, Smytten allows users to try products at minimal or no cost before they decide to buy them. It has more than 5 million users. “Pre-purchase buying experience will be the biggest enabler and will fuel the burgeoning D2C market which is projected to touch $100 billion in next 4-5 years,” said Siddhartha Nangia, co-founder, Smytten. “We believe this sampling-led tried-and-tested method of customer engagement will change the way D2C brands and consumers interact, making it more immersive,” added the platform’s co-founder Swagat Sarangi.

---||Kolkata||3 days to go, Presi, Scottish, Bethune on top of UG students’ demand list||Kolkata: Three more days are left to the deadline for undergraduate applications but trends indicate that Presidency University, Jadavpur University and Calcutta University’s Scottish Church, Bethune and Lady Brabourne colleges are on top of students’ demand list. Presidency received 57,000 applications till last Friday and JU over 50,000. But with only 665 UG seats, against 1,066 at JU (excluding engineering and pharma faculties), Presidency has a higher application-to-seat ratio of around 86 to JU’s 47. At CU-affiliated Scottish Church, more than 50,000 applications were submitted on Tuesday, while Surendranath College, logged over 50,000 applications till last Friday for its 2,450 seats. Madhumanjari Mandal Choubey, principal of Scottish Church, which has 765 UG seats, said, “Till Tuesday, we received 56,778 applications, but the number of students who have applied is 40,466. This is because a candidate can apply in four subjects. On final analysis, the number will dip. We had anticipated a surge in applications but even then, the figure is unexpected, especially since three more days are left to the application deadline.” Bethune College, which has 480 seats, had received 35,000 applications till Monday, while Lady Brabourne College received more than 30,000 applications till last Friday for its 600 seats. Lady Brabourne principal Siuli Sarkar pointed out, “Submission of forms and selection of candidates are two different issues. The number of high-scorers this time is more than that of last year. So, many more could make it to the application cut-offs for multiple subjects.” Ashutosh College indicated that they would release the final application figures by Friday, but an official said, “The trends were similar to last year’s.” Maulana Azad College has received more than 40,000 applications for its 1,000 seats, while St Xavier’s College received over 25,000 forms for 2,300 seats. Presidency registrar Debajyoti Konar dismissed the suggestion that the deluge of applications might impact the admission deadline. “Last year’s admission was based on merit. So, this isn’t any issue. The higher education department’s admission timeline has been issued in students’ interest. This will be complied with,” he said. Officials pointed at the various reasons for the high number of applications this year, which turned out to be the highest in recent past. First, they said, was the high scores awarded to Plus-II candidates across boards. Secondly, free admission forms had removed the financial hurdle, they said. Also, there was no restriction on the number of subjects or institutes candidates could apply to, they pointed out. Sohom Banerjee, a student who passed Higher Secondary exams this year, said he had applied in eight institutes so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-days-to-go-presi-scottish-bethune-on-top-of-ug-students-demand-list/articleshow/85607560.cms||---

Rai said he was witness to the incident of US forces firing in air to stop Afghans at the Kabul airport. “I have seen American forces firing in air. They did it to protect Afghans. I have recorded the visuals on my cellphone. They started firing when Afghans crowded the airport in a desperate attempt to leave the country, after the Taliban took over the country,” he said. Rai spent time celebrating his homecoming with wife Chithrakala Rai and daughter Medha. “We were anxious till Dinesh reached the airport in Qatar. We were extremely happy after receiving his call from the Delhi airport. Now, we are relieved that he is back home,” Chithrakala said. Desmond David D’Souza from Kinnigoli, who was also airlifted from Afghanistan, said Indians at the NATO base were confident of returning home safely. “We were safe in Afghanistan, when we were working at the NATO base, but the situation turned turbulent soon after the Taliban took control of the country. Though the people were apprehensive, we were all confident of returning to our country, as the evacuation process had begun,” said D’Souza, who worked for a service providing firm, at the NATO base since 2011. D’Souza said the situation outside the NATO base was unstable. “We were never allowed to leave the base. We used to come out of the base only during vacations, to return home. On August 17, a US military flight airlifted us to Qatar airport. We landed in New Delhi on August 22, and then headed home,” he added. Demcy Monteiro, a resident of Uliya in Ullal, who too was working in at the NATO base, reached home on Tuesday. His elder brother Melwyn Monteiro, who was working as an electrician at the military hospital in Kabul, had returned on August 18. Demcy said: “We were apprehensive after seeing news on TV channels about Taliban attacks. We were not allowed to go out. I have seen troops firing shots in air at the Kabul airport.” Khader demands govt support Mangaluru MLA U T Khader, who visited Monteiros on Tuesday, said the state and the central governments should extend support to those who have returned from Afghanistan. “The governments should intervene and ensure benefits are available to those who quit jobs and returned from Afghanistan. Many of them were working in firms of America, Germany and other foreign countries. They have left Afghanistan without waiting for any relief from their employers, due to the turbulent situation. So the Indian embassies in those foreign countries should hold talks with the companies and make available all benefits to those who returned to India,” Khader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/return-of-loved-ones-from-afghanistan-celebrated/articleshow/85602601.cms||---

The woman, who was killed trying to resist rape, could only be identified because of a tattoo on her wrist. “The arrested accused, Kanifnath Kamble, hails from Latur. He was zeroed-in from the CCTV footage at the traffic signal near the mall. Since the victim was unidentified, our teams contacted several police stations in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane, and also looked into 150 missing persons complaints. The only identification mark was a tattoo of a crown on her right wrist which matched the victim’s missing complaint at Govandi police station. Her family members claimed she was suffering from memory loss,” said senior inspector of Vashi police station Ramesh Chavan. “A blurred image of a man accompanying the victim was captured by a CCTV camera near the mall. Our teams traced him to a spot under the Sanpada flyover late in the evening on Sunday,” added Chavan. Kamble confessed to his crime and revealed that he had spotted the victim alone and offered her food. When he attempted to sexually assault her, she retaliated by kicking him. In a fit of rage, Kamble picked up a glass shard and slashed her neck. He then smashed her head and face with a stone and stuffed her body in a gunny bag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/vashi-man-who-killed-70-yr-old-for-resisting-rape-arrested/articleshow/85609554.cms||George Mendonca
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Big cat trinity in Gandhinagar's Indroda Park||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat is India’s lion capital and now the state’s capital Gandhinagar has made Indroda Park a landmark wildlife attraction by bringing together all the three big cats of the country — lions, tigers, and leopards. From Wednesday, visitors will be able to observe the majestic felines at the park. Each of the big cat’s separate enclosure is open and moated, recreating habitats that are unique to the individual species. The new enclosures were inaugurated on Tuesday. The park now has 214 mammals, 93 reptiles, and 172 birds. A 13-year-old lion and an 11-yearold lioness are the royalty of the menagerie. These Asiatic lions were brought from Sakkarbaug Zoo in 2018. The park also has a pair of white tigers. The tiger is 2.5 years old and has been brought from Rajkot, while the tigress is a 17-year-old former resident of Kevadia. The park has six leopards, of which four will be housed in the exhibit section. Park officials said that the enclosures of the leopards are open to the sky. Lion and tiger enclosures have a moat. “The park’s design was finalized after studying other zoos,” said U D Singh, the director of Gujarat Ecological Education and Research (GEER) Foundation. “Insights from other zoos were incorporated into the new design for the park,” Singh said. Indroda also has herbivores such as sambar, white buck, black buck, spotted deer, and chinkara. Also, due to the park’s proximity to the Sabarmati, nilgai are often seen grazing around it. A senior official said that Indroda Park receives about 6.5 lakh visitors annually. Most of them are children and college students. The moated enclosures for the big cats will give visitors an unimpeded view. The lion enclosure has a natural stone casing. The enclosure has a grass gazebo as well as bamboo, mango, and other trees. Flowering plants too are part of the enclosure; the animals sometimes rub their bodies against the plants to relieve itching. Officials said that tigers love water and hence a waterfall has been developed for them. Since urination generates ammonia, the night shelter is open. Besides, separate enclosures have been set up for observation, treatment, and feeding of the animals. An officer said that it took two months to get the animals acquainted with their environs. Now that acclimatization has been successful, visitors are being allowed in. Rishit Shroff, the architect who designed the enclosures, said that normally moat slopes are made of RCC (reinforced cement concrete) which are not aesthetically pleasing. But at Indroda Park, stone pitching combines with creepers and trees to present a more natural ambience. The moats are 10 metres wide and five metres deep, and have been designed to eliminate any blind spot. Also the elevation of the night enclosure of lions has hollow spaces which provide breeding spots for common birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/big-cat-trinity-in-one-place/articleshow/85607598.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Nagpur||City police disposed of 79 cases a day in 11 months||Nagpur: City police have set a new benchmark for themselves by disposing of 21,822 cases, including accidental deaths, and another 4,554 applications in a span of 11 months between September last year and July this year for an average of 79 per day. Barring a few cases with legal tangles, city police have disposed of almost all the cases of last year and also cleared pendency till April this year with zonal deputy commissioners of police acting as the nodal officers to ensure that police stations wrap up probe on time and finalize the related documents. Verifying complaints made at the police stations and investigating them was supposed to be supervised by assistant CPs, who would report the progress to the zonal DCPs. The DCPs had been tasked to supervise preparation of chargesheets in crucial cases. CP Amitesh Kumar said quick disposal of cases is transparent most of the time. “Police stations were given specific deadlines for probing each type of cases,” said the top cop. “It was either 60 or 90 days for crimes as per the mandates of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Accidental death cases were supposed to be probed within 30 days and applications had to be disposed of within 15 days,” said the CP. During a marathon session spanning seven hours, Kumar had also instructed and guided investigation officers regarding the manner in which each case was supposed to be dealt with and disposed. “We had instructed the investigation officers in cases of cheating to summon both the complainant and the accused before sending chargesheet to ascertain whether they felt justice was not denied to them,” said Kumar. The CP had also urged zonal DCPs to organize ‘takrar nivaran diwas’ or grievance redressal day at different police stations to ensure that all applications/ complaints are handled in a speedy manner. Kumar had himself chaired a daylong grievance redressal session during which 153 complaints were handled and instructions were issued to respective police station in-charge regarding the disposal of the cases. “We had decided to deal with complaints in the quickest possible time to inculcate a feeling of faith. It is also a legally laid down norm to address the grievances and dispose of cases at the earliest,” said CP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-police-disposed-of-79-cases-a-day-in-11-months/articleshow/85609572.cms||Soumitra Bose

The court denied the defence contention that since the other accused were acquitted in a separate trial, Rajan could not be booked in the case. “Only because the offence… is not proved against the arrested accused, it is premature to comment about conspiracy hatched by the accused,” the court said.  “If the accused is released on bail, the possibility of his absconding and tampering with the prosecution witnesses cannot be ruled out,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/97-murder-case-chhota-rajans-bail-plea-rejected/articleshow/85609594.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Partly gutted, Jaya Cinema pads up to start second innings in multiplex format||Kolkata: More than a month after Jaya Cinema got partially damaged in a fire, the owner has decided to convert it into a multiplex. Established in 1967 by Gouranga Chandra Barik, the cinema added the Mini Jaya auditorium in the late 70s. While the 442-seater Mini Jaya was gutted in the fire on July 2 this year, the 774-seater Jaya was spared. Jaya Cinema, however, didn’t reopen this month along with others after the state government relaxed the norms and allowed cinemas to reopen in Bengal. “My father owned three cinemas in Assam. Subsequently, he opened the Jaya Cinema in 1967. The first Bengali film to have premiered there was ‘Jeevan Mrityu’. This fire cost us a lot of damage,” said Manik Barik, its current owner. The reason for the fire is still unknown to Barik. From the seats, screen, sound system to AC ducts – everything of Mini Jaya has been burnt. “I am yet to get the forensic reports,” he told TOI. The approximate losses might run into Rs 4 crore-Rs 5 crore. On being asked about his plans to resume operations, he said the cinema will certainly reopen. “However, I will not want to reopen in the current format,” he said. Instead of spending money to rebuild the cinema in the current format, he would want to remodel it and increase the number of screens. In place of the existing two screens, he might opt for three screens. Recently, Prachi Cinema remodeled itself. The ground floor, which was earlier converted into a food court, now hosts the franchise of a retail chain. The first floor is now devoted to a single screen. From the original capacity of 784 seats, it successively reduced to 500 in 2016 and 200 now. While Barik is very keen on bringing down the number of seats, he doesn’t want to follow the Prachi model. “I don’t want to have a single screen operational at Jaya. Rather, I want to increase the number of screens. Each might have a capacity of 200-215 viewers,” he said. The iconic Metro cinema has been remodeled and is currently operational with a store of a retain chain as well as a multiplex chain. Will Jaya cinema also follow in that footstep? “I do not want to rent my screens out to any other multiplex brand. Rather, I want to have a Jaya multiplex there,” he said. He is also toying with the idea of increasing the number of floors from the current three-storied building. But all that will require permissions and time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/partly-gutted-jaya-cinema-pads-up-to-start-second-innings-in-multiplex-format/articleshow/85605074.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Coimbatore||All college staff will be sent on forced leave if not vaccinated fully: Official||Coimbatore: The regional joint director of collegiate education, Coimbatore, R Ulagi on Tuesday issued an order to all government, aided and self-financing colleges in the district to send their both teaching and non-teaching staff on compulsory leave if they were not fully vaccinated from September 1. The order follows a direction issued by the district collector on Monday to education institutions to allow their staff, who had taken both doses of vaccine against Covid-19, to resume work from September 1. As per the relaxations laid by the state government, all schools and colleges can resume offline classes on a rotational basis from September 1. While schools will allow students from Class IX to XII, all college students except first year will report to class. The order from Ulagi came as a shock for many college staff, who were yet to get their second dose. Staff from self-financing colleges called the decision ‘harsh’ and stated that they were already facing pay cuts. Speaking to TOI, Ulagi said that the order was only a reflection of the direction from the collector during a meeting on Monday. The collector has clearly mentioned that colleges and schools should ensure that the staff were fully vaccinated before coming to the institutions. She further added that those who were yet to receive their second dose of Covid -19 vaccine can make use of the vaccination camps to be held in education institutions on August 29 and 30 as planned by the district administration. To this, a few teachers opined that not all were due for their second dose on the specified dates. S Prema, an assistant professor from a private art and science college, said, “I am due for my second dose only by the second week of September. Therefore, the special vaccination drives in educational institutions must relax the duration between the two doses for the staff,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/all-college-staff-will-be-sent-on-forced-leave-if-not-vaccinated-fully-official/articleshow/85607535.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Prominent among the damaged roads was the road leading to Kondapur from Hi-Tec City that abuts a flyover which is currently under construction. On Tuesday morning, commuters were seen trying to navigate their way out of a narrow road that had multiple potholes brimming with rainwater. “The entire stretch which has already become so narrow due to the construction work has now become uneven and prone to accidents due to the rain. We have seen two-wheeler riders risking their lives trying to navigate the potholes filled with murky waater,” said P Gopal, a security guard stationed outside an apartment complex in the area. Sharing a video of a road filled with sludge, Mohammad Fasiuddin said, “Heavy rain wrecked roads in Hyderabad turning commuting into a nightmare. Stretches near construction sites were the worst affected (sic).” While one GHMC official said that the monsoon emergency teams are constantly working to identify damaged roads and repair them, mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi who was addressing the issue of roads damaged by rain recently said, “Stretches that have been damaged due to incessant rains would be repaired once dry weather prevails... Taking up restoration work during rains is not possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/commuters-face-hard-time-as-rain-floods-dug-up-roads/articleshow/85607563.cms||Moulika.KV

The administrative committee of the bank comprises 11 members, of which eight belong CPM and the rest CPI. In July, the CPI members S Chinnaswami, K Paraman and Alphonsa Kalimuth had given a letter to the administrative committee raising 12 questions, including the details of the alleged shady deals in purchasing land and setting up a petrol bunk. However, they are yet to get a reply from the committee. In the letter, the CPI members had sought the details of the loan disbursed under fake names, the details of the land the bank had bought in Biyalram, Muttukad and Vilakk, and the details of the land the bank had bought for setting up a petrol pump in Chinnakkanal. The CPI members alleged that the CPM-ruled bank had illegally issued large loans under fake names and did not keep them posted on the major decisions taken. They also said that the bank had bought land without title deed to set up a fuel station and the revenue department rejected the application to set up the facility for want of proper title, the CPI members said. CPI Chinnakkanal local secretary A Yesudas said that the administrative committee conducted major dealings without consulting the CPI members. “They constructed a resort and bought land without title deed to set up a petrol pump. They did not inform us about any such developments. They took unilateral decisions in the matters connected to the bank and implemented them. They even refused to provide a reply to our letter. We demand that the CPM leadership should take steps to reveal the actual details of the dealings done by the bank,” said Yesudas. Meanwhile, bank president Alakarswami said that the allegations raised by the CPI were baseless. “The auditors are inspecting the details of the dealings done by the bank. The land dealings and resort construction happened years ago and CPI did not raise any complaint then. We will take further steps after completing the auditing process,” he said. Idukki DCC president Ibrahimkutty Kallar alleged that Karuvannur model bank fraud has happened in Chinnakkanal bank and demanded a detailed probe to bring to light the actual fraud. “We will stage a protest before the bank on Wednesday,” Kallar said. Earlier, a social worker had filed a complaint before the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau against the bank secretary demanding a detailed probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpi-releases-letter-given-to-chinnakanal-co-op-bank-committee/articleshow/85607570.cms||---

Under the influence of a trough extending from Madhya Pradesh and its neighbouring areas to Bay of Bengal, many parts of Telangana are likely to receive light to moderate rains for the next four days. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS), Macha Bollarum recorded 33.5 mm of rainfall up to 7 pm. Many other areas in the central, eastern and northern corridors recorded 10-30 mm of rains. Even as the southwest monsoon is reviving over Telangana, analysis by the TSDPS indicates that the state has recorded 45% of deficit rainfall for the month of August. The TSDPS figures indicates that Telangana has recorded 95.2 mm of rains in August so far as against normal of 171.7 mm as on date. Last year, Telangana had recorded 368.6 mm of rains in the month of August. However, this year, due to a prolonged break in southwest monsoon, the rainfall activity over the state was subdued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monsoon-revives-in-t-more-rain-likely-in-next-few-days/articleshow/85607594.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC first in India to shun virtual hearings, move divides legal fraternity||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Tuesday became the first high court in the country to completely do away with virtual hearings even as a plea against the move is pending in the Supreme Court. The court had resumed in-person hearings earlier this month and has now stopped all virtual proceedings. High courts in most other states, meanwhile, have continued with a hybrid model of functioning. Local courts in the hill state are also holding both online and in-person proceedings. The Uttarakhand high court had issued an administrative order through registrar general, Dhananjay Chaturvedi, on August 16 saying that it will abandon virtual hearing from August 24 and function only through physical mode. The notification added that no request for virtual hearing will be entertained by the court. On Monday, a petition filed by a lawyers’ body called All India Jurists Association and legal journalist Sparsh Upadhyay challenged the Uttarakhand high court’s decision to stop virtual hearings, demanding that virtual hearings be declared “a fundamental right” because of their ease of access and the pandemic. The petition added that this decision sounds the “death knell” for the development of virtual courts in the country and goes against the core elements of the vision document of the Supreme Court e-committee, which has been working towards setting up e-courts across the country since 2005. The legal fraternity itself is divided over the issue. While the Uttarakhand HC Bar Association has come out in support of the court’s decision to stop virtual hearings, some lawyers were of the opinion that keeping in mind the third wave of the pandemic, the court should not abandon virtual proceedings. A lawyer who did not wish to be named said, “Advocates are divided on the issue. We realise the importance of physical hearings, but the threat of the pandemic is far from over. Also, virtual hearings are better for petitioners and advocates from other cities who may find it difficult to travel to Nainital (where the Uttarakhand high court is located) each time the case is listed.” Avtar Rawat, president of the bar association, told TOI that no advocate had made a complaint demanding a return to virtual hearings. “Physical hearings are ideal. The institution thrives on the physical presence of judges and lawyers in the court premises," he said. The Uttarakhand high court had adopted the virtual mode in April 2020 when the first wave of the pandemic swept the country. When the number of Covid cases started coming down, the court moved to a hybrid model. But the second wave struck and the court went back to virtual hearings. Finally, it was on August 2 that physical hearings resumed along with virtual ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-1st-in-india-to-shun-virtual-hearings-move-divides-legal-fraternity/articleshow/85602729.cms||Prashant Jha

The decision was taken by the department amid allegations of ‘flawed handling’ of the case. The investigation team had registered two cases in connection with seizures of MDMA made at the same apartment within a gap of 24 hours. In the second case, registered in connection with seizure of more than 1kg of MDMA, the accused were not named in the FIR. Excise enforcement and anti-narcotic special squad and customs preventive unit had jointly raided the apartment late at night on August 18 and seized 83g of MDMA. Seven persons, including two women, were taken into custody. But, the arrests of two persons, including a woman, were not recorded. A case was registered against others early on Aug 19 and they were later remanded in judicial custody by court. The charges were filed under Sections 25 (Whoever having the control or use of any house knowingly permits it to be used for the commission of the offence), 22(c) (possession of drugs in commercial quantity) and 29 (party to criminal conspiracy) of the NDPS Act. Later, another extensive raid was held in the same apartment which led to the seizure of 1.085kg of MDMA. But, the case was registered only under Section 22(c) and no accused persons were named in the FIR. Many officials cited this as a fault of the investigation team and allegations of an attempted sabotage arose. “Though seizure of MDMA above 10g is considered a commercial quantity, the punishment of the accused would vary as per the quantity of contraband seized. Here, five persons accounted for only 83g, while 1.085kg were seized from their flat,” said an official. Excise commissioner Anantha Krishnan said ‘technical mistakes in handling the case can be remedied and there is no attempt to sabotage it. The case will be handed over to the excise crime branch’. Refuting allegations, Ernakulam deputy excise commissioner Ashok Kumar said that all the accused were charged under non-bailable sections under NDPS Act. “Those are not weak charges. Earlier, seven persons were taken into custody but only five were arrested as there were no leads on the involvement of the other two. They could be arraigned as accused if they are found connected with the case,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/excise-crime-branch-to-probe-mdma-seizure-in-kochi/articleshow/85607676.cms||---
---||Nagpur||127 inlets discharge sewage water in Nag and Pili rivers||Nagpur: Illegal discharge of sewage water in Nag and Pili rivers is increasing. A study commissioned by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) in 2011 had identified 107 polluting streams that empty into the two rivers. Now, this number has increased to 127, confirmed a senior official from the NMC’s river and lake rejuvenation department. A major part of the 525MLD of sewage water generated by the city is discharged in three rivers — Pili, Nag and Pora. As per Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s study, Pili and Nag rivers carry around 360MLD sewage water. “To check the release of polluted water into these rivers, the NMC will lay 610km pipeline along Pili and Nag rivers,” said the official. This is part of the Rs2,117.56 crore Nag River Pollution Abatement project. The project, approved under the National River Conservation Plan, will be implemented by the National River Conservation Directorate. It will reduce pollution level in terms of untreated sewage, solid waste and other impurities flowing into Nag river and its tributaries. “The work on this front is awaiting approval by the expenditure finance committee headed by Union finance secretary and a notification will be issued after the Union cabinet decision,” he said. “The process to appoint project management consultancy will be completed within two months,” he said. The second stage will be of developing the Nag riverfront later — the signature river of the city. Under the pollution abatement project, NMC aims to treat 102MLD sewage water. Apart from installing sewage treatment plants to treat around 90MLD water, the NMC will also rehabilitate two mini STPs already installed at Mankapur ghat on Pili river and at Mokshadham ghat on Nag river. Once the first project is complete, the NMC will release 85 to 90MLD treated sewage water into Nag river to ensure its perennial flow. Six STPs will be set up at various locations along both the rivers. The officer pointed out that the civic body has covered all the three rivers under the pollution abatement project, which pegged its cost to around Rs4,000 crore. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) refused to finance such a huge amount. “So, the NMC excluded Pora river from the project. Now, it will be the responsibility of the NMC to treat polluted water in Pora river,” he said. Central and state governments will repay JICA loan by bearing share of 60% and 25%, while NMC will pump in 15% funds, he added. The NMC will take up the Riverfront Development Project on Nag river only after pollution abatement project is finished, said the official. The second project will comprise 15-metre landscaping on either side of Nag river. At A Glance Project cost | Rs 2117 Share of Centre, state and NMC is 60%, 25% and 15% * Main (out fall) sewer or interceptor | 60 KM * Secondary and tertiary sewer | 550 KM * All inlets of sewage into Nag and Pili rivers will be tapped * Pipelines will be laid alongside both the rivers * Sewage from some inlets will be treated at STPs and treated water to be flown in the two rivers||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/127-inlets-discharge-sewage-water-in-nag-and-pili-rivers/articleshow/85609629.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had already alerted the officials to keep infrastructure — including oxygen supply — ready in case the third wave hits within a month or so. Dwivedi asked the DMs to ensure that mothers with children within 12 years should be properly inoculated so that the chance of spread of the disease can be minimized. The CMOHs are to see that during vaccination, there is no chaos at the vaccine centres. Moreover, the officials were also asked to increase the number of camps for testing. The state government wants 75%-80% vaccination in all urban areas and at least 50% in the rural belts. Howrah’s urban area has got almost 80% vaccination – the highest in the state. As the positivity rate is highest in North 24-Parganas, the chief secretary asked about the steps taken and in reply North 24 Parganas DM Sumit Gupta conveyed that all protocols were strictly followed. In Murshidabad, there have been 14 cases in last three days and one person died in Nabagram last week. Moreover, the chief secretary also took stock of the on-going Duare Sarkar camps and as there was a mad rush for the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme, so the DMs were asked to increase manpower at camps.

---||Coimbatore||City lacks bus stops at right places||Coimbatore: The city has undergone a massive change in the past couple of years with better road infrastructure and multiple flyovers easing the traffic congestion. But for commoners what matters most is the access to public transportation, mainly buses. And authorities have failed to address their requirement by putting in place more bus stops to suit the revamped road infrastructure. Most of the bus stops, activists said, were planned and set up years ago based on the requirements of that period. According to them, a study to determine the locations of bus stops and requirement of new ones is long overdue. The activists said places such as the city railway junction, Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), Singanallur bus terminal signal and Sidhapudur Junction had turned into major traffic choke points, because of stoppage of buses at wrong places. Pointing out that bus shelters were set up at many places, the activists said most of them had proved to be wastage of money as buses don’t stop there or passengers don’t wait there. “Many places lack bus shelters to protect passengers from rain and sun. People mostly use trees as shades in such places.” B Parinaman, a passenger, said the bus stop should be shifted some distance away from CMCH as buses, which halt there for passengers to board and alight, were blocking the way for other vehicles, creating traffic snarls. “The road is narrow on this stretch. Vehicles can move freely, if buses stop a few metres away. Similarly, something needs to be done at the city railway junction, where too buses create traffic bottlenecks.” L Devika, a resident of Sungam, said while many people were boarding buses near Sungam flyover on Trichy Road, the area still lacked a bus shelter. “Bus shelters are set up in places where they don’t serve any purposes. And in places where a bus shelter is required, there isn’t one.” K Kathirmathiyon, a member of district road safety committee, said it was high time that the transport department officials reviewed the location of bus stops in the city. The district administration, he said, was yet to map the bus stops in the city. “It is the first step that needs to be taken to bring about a change. There are many bus shelters in the city, where buses do not stop. The distance between existing bus stops should be studied before planning the new ones.” A traffic policeman, who is posted at Singanallur junction, said buses were halting close to the junction in violation of directions not to do so. “It’s difficult for us to watch buses all the time.” Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said a comprehensive study was underway to sort out the traffic-related issues in the city. “It will also cover placement of bus stops.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-lacks-bus-stops-at-right-places/articleshow/85607618.cms||V Devanathan

The university officials said their arrival to the campus is uncertain, due to the ongoing crisis. MU vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya said this academic year, 350 applications were received from Afghanistan. Of them, MU had finalised 156 applications. Of them, 31 students will be undergraduates, 111 postgraduates and 14 doctoral students. “We aren’t sure whether they will be able to make it to the campus on time. Even if they do, it may be late,” said Yadapadithaya. A source who is in the know of Afghanistan student admissions, said their arrival will be difficult, given the current situation. “With the Taliban opposing education, studies in foreign universities may be a big no, especially in India. We have to just wait and watch,” the source added. Sources also said that students from Afghanistan would study under the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) programme. Seven-hundred aspirants from Afghanistan had applied to study at MU, when it opened its doors for foreign students in the academic year 2014-15. This number is an all-time high from Afghanistan. Besides Afghanistan, MU also has students from 35 other countries, including Ethiopia, Iraq and Yemen. They study under self-finance mode. MU is also constructing a separate hostel for foreign students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/no-clarity-on-afghan-students-arrival-to-mu/articleshow/85602665.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Police said that the accused Iqbal Sheikh and his wife Salma Sheikh were arrested on Tuesday while they were planning to target another person in Por. In February, they had cheated a retired bank employee. The couple had asked the victim Ambalal Vankar to hand over his gold necklace and money to them and count four streetlight poles. Vankar was told that by the time he returned, the cash would double, and the gold necklace would turn into two gold necklaces. Vankar did as he was told but when he turned back, he did not find Iqbal and Salma. Realizing that he had been cheated, Vankar had lodged a complaint of cheating. Police said that they were looking for the duo, but their whereabouts were not known. On Tuesday, during patrolling the couple’s actions were found suspicious near Por so they were taken in for questioning. Later they were arrested when they admitted their crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/couple-that-duped-elderly-man-arrested/articleshow/85604715.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Shiv Sena, BJP take to streets over Rane’s comments, arrest||Nagpur/Amravati/Yavatmal/Chandrapur: Union minister Narayan Rane’s comments on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, and his eventual arrest by police, has led to sharp reactions on the streets by both BJP and Shiv Sena party workers across Vidarbha. In Nagpur, Shiv Sainiks held protests at various areas while some even tried to file FIRs in police stations here. Nitin Tiwari, Sena city president, said, “We started the day with protests at prominent places in the city and filed a complaint at Jaripatka police station. Later, when we heard about Rane being detained by police, our party members distributed sweets in Manewada area.” Party spokesperson Kishore Kanhere also submitted a complaint at Pratap Nagar police station against Rane. BJP leaders allege the state government is using the police to target Rane. Nagpur city BJP president Pravin Datke said, “It is clear they are afraid of Rane and that’s why the state machinery is being used in an undemocratic way. Have such words or language not been used in Maharashtra before this? But rather than following protocol, the police are arresting a Union minister.” Datke said the BJP’s protest at various places today is to show the party firmly stands behind Rane. Tiwari brushed aside Datke’s allegation, saying, “We are not misusing the state machinery, simply following the law of the land. A state’s CM has been threatened with violence, so should the police not act?” Early in the day, Sena workers in Amravati vandalised a closed BJP office and set posters afire. Shiv Sainiks led by party city chief Parag Gudadhe reached Rajapeth BJP office around noon, where no saffron party worker was present, and pelted stones at the building. Some tore down posters and set them on fire. Gudadhe said, “BJP leaders must mend their tongue. We were patient for now because our leader is the CM but we won’t tolerate any indecent criticism anymore.” BJP party leader in Amravati Municipal Corporation Tushar Bhartiya reached the spot soon afterwards and said, “This act by Shiv Sainiks is undemocratic and nothing short of vandalism.” In Yavatmal, Sainiks gathered at Datta Chowk and held protests and set Rane’s poster on fire. Party district chief Parag Pingle said, “We won’t allow Rane in our district and if needed we will thrash him in public.” Another party leader Rajendra Gaikwad has challenged Rane to speak in Yavatmal and cautioned him of “befitting answer”. In Chandrapur, Shiv Sainiks took out a protest march and slapped the effigy of Rane with chappals and shoes. The BJP, on the other hand, staged protests to flay Rane’s arrest. District chief of Shiv Sena, Sandeep Girhe, gathered his supporters at Ramnagar office and took out a protest march up to Old Warora Naka Square. A delegation submitted a memorandum to SP Arvind Salve. BJP mayor Rakhi Kancharlawar and city president Dr Mangesh Gulwade led protests at Gandhi Chowk against Rane’s arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shiv-sena-bjp-take-to-streets-over-ranes-comments-arrest/articleshow/85609606.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Rehman, through his counsel, claimed before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that there had been a systematic violation of his fundamental rights. “Why has he (Rehman) been roped in? There is a fundamental right to protest… Why are (you) putting him in the bracket of rioters and not protester… If a certain section of society is aggrieved by certain legislation and protests against it, that is not a crime. They can protest,” advocate Abhishek Singh argued. Seeking Rehman’s bail, the advocate said the accused had allegedly made financial arrangements for protesters and asked if it was an offence under UAPA. Singh further referred to a complaint filed by him on January 30, 2020, seeking registration of an FIR against a few BJP functionaries for allegedly instigating the riots. “Did the prosecution even bother to call them as witnesses or accused or issue a notice? Because they said ‘shoot xyz’, so they know who those people are. They will at least have some evidence. Why was no FIR registered against them?” Singh asked. He argued that being a member or president of AAJMI or WhatsApp group Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) was not an offence. The lawyer alleged that the sanction granted by the authorities for prosecution under UAPA was a nullity. There was no instigation of violence in the WhatsApp group and the members made appeal for peaceful protests, he claimed. Rehman “is shown to have given speeches. Why has the prosecution not bothered to bring on record any of his speeches? Because that would destroy the prosecution case because he always advocated that protest has to be in a peaceful manner”, Singh alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jamia-ex-student-in-court-being-peaceful-protester-not-a-crime/articleshow/85605189.cms||Usha Das

Within a week, six projects worth Rs 6.5 crore have been approved for these areas. The projects include construction of a new Rs 2 crore health centre equipped with modern diagnostic equipment. Civic authorities had received several requests from Bopal residents for a new drainage link from Swapneel Elenza to Arohi Twin Bunglows and from Vibrant Silver to Swaminarayan Temple Road. “We have issued works worth Rs 29.35 lakh for drainage links. This work will begin in a month,” says a south-west zone AMC official. A similar drainage line between Shaktimata Temple and BRTS Road was also cleared for Rs 29.40 lakh, the official added. “Drainage would frequently overflow during monsoon due to which waterlogging became a major issue in cerain parts of Bopal. We have issued work orders to raise these drainage chambers, especially closer to the BRTS corridor,” added the AMC official. Also over next two months, a project to provide drainage and stormwater linkages will be undertaken on a 3km stretch on Iskcon-Ambli road that falls under R2 zone where construction of high-rises is allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nod-for-drainage-stormwater-works-in-bopal/articleshow/85607634.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The issue before deputy collector was for the land of Sardhar and Madhapar villages of Rajkot. The land in Madhapar village’s survey number is around 23.28 lakh sq m and Sardhar village’s survey number land is around 4,047 sq m. Ambalika Devi’s advocate argued before deputy collector Charansinh Gohil that this property is an ancient property of her ancestors. The will of her father late Manoharsinh Jadeja was produced before the deputy collector by her brother but Ambalika Devi argued that her father had no legal right to make a will of ancestral property. She also argued that her father’s will itself is dubious because he was highly educated and he did not discriminate between a son and a daughter. She also argued that after mutation of inheritance entry into the revenue records, the process of release deed (to waive her rights) should be initiated but in this case the process of waiving of right was done before the entry was made into the revenue records. Ambalika Devi also challenged the will of her father in a civil suit and prayed to declare the release deed she was made to sign on the basis of alleged false information null and void. After hearing the argument of both the parties, deputy collector in his two separate orders of both the parcels of lands dated August 23 allowed objections of Ambalika Devi and rejected application of deletion of the rights in revenue records. The parties can file an appeal against this order before the collector in 60 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dy-collector-upholds-objections-of-rajkot-royals-sister/articleshow/85605247.cms||---
---||Dehradun||29 Covid hosps in U’khand fleeced patients, health dept starts recovery of 'crores'||DEHRADUN: Twenty-nine dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Uttarakhand’s capital overcharged patients — some by as much as 50% — and amassed “crores” during the pandemic despite a government cap in place on charges of coronavirus treatments, a state health department investigation has found. The Uttarakhand government had issued a government order (GO) in September 2020, capping per-day prices of Covid treatments. Health officials have started recovery of the amount charged over and above the government mandate and the amount is being distributed to those affected. Dr Manoj Upreti, Dehradun chief medical officer (CMO), told TOI that so far Rs 1.5 crore have been recovered. “The investigation is on. We expect to recover more in the coming days. As of now, we know of 290 cases where patients were overcharged,” he said. The matter came to light after a brother-sister duo filed a complaint with the CMO office in November 2020, alleging exorbitant treatment charges by a Covid centre. The hospital was among 30 private hospitals that had been turned into Dedicated Covid Hospital Centers (DCHCs) in Dehradun. Medical centres in Dehradun cater to the entire Garhwal division which has threadbare infrastructure in the hills. Officials then sought a record of bills of all Covid-19 hospitals to check their pricing. Several anomalies emerged. Instead of the government-mandated charges of Covid packages, all the hospitals, barring one, had charged several times over during the first and the second Covid wave, even for things such as oxygen that were supposed to be free under the package. According to Dr Sanjeev Datt, deputy chief medical officer of Dehradun district, the government had capped per-day package rates for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals between Rs 6,400 and Rs 12,000. “This included the cost of medicines, pathological tests, X-ray, CT Scan, doctor consultation, doctor visit, room rate, food, nursing care and transfusion of blood and plasma. But these hospitals were found charging extra for all these services,” he said. Consequently, many families ended up emptying their savings for treatment. Rashmi Chauhan, who filed the initial complaint, told TOI that her family incurred a bill of Rs 8 lakh after her father was admitted to the hospital for a month. “We got him admitted to the centre and prices for treatment were supposed to be capped. But we had to pay whatever they asked. After our complaint, the health department investigated the matter and recently we have recovered Rs 2 lakh from the hospital,” said the 27-year-old. Jyoti Verma, a mother of two, also had to struggle to arrange money for her husband’s treatment. “He passed away in May this year after catching Covid-19. He was in the hospital for a week and we were charged nearly Rs 5 lakh,” she said. Dr Sudhir Pandey, district immunisation officer involved in the investigation, said the CMO office has also written to the Dehradun SSP to lodge an FIR against one of the hospitals that has failed to comply with its directions and return a total amount of Rs 15 lakh to patients it had fleeced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/29-covid-hosps-in-ukhand-fleeced-patients-health-dept-starts-recovery-of-crores/articleshow/85602771.cms||Shivani Azad

Bidyut Biswas, Palas Sarkar and Prabir Sarkar of Bongaon’s Gopalnagar and Ajay Majumdar of Ashokenagar’s Bonbonia returned home late on Monday. They had gone to Kabul in March, 2019, to work for a catering company that operated the canteen in a camp for the US-allied forces. They were airlifted to Qatar by the US troops on August 18 after which they were flown back to India. “After leaving the canteen, we took shelter in a second-floor room in a building in the Kabul airport with the help of US-allied army. But we couldn’t dare to step out for four days. All the time, there were bursts of gunfire,” Biswas told TOI. “Though we were under the protection of US troops, the kind of things happening all around was really sad,” Majumdar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/four-more-return-from-afghanistan/articleshow/85605238.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

According to the Telangana Welfare Association Qatar (TWAQ) women’s wing, Sayeeda Farheen was duped by the agent who had taken QR 15,000 (equivalent to over Rs 3,00,000) from a Qatari to provide a maid but instead sent the beautician for the job.  Farheen reached Qatar in June and had no choice but to work as a maid as she had to repay the amount borrowed for her Gulf dream “I had to work as a housemaid despite being promised a beautician’s job. My financial problems forced me to bear unexpected torture. When I told the agent to get me home, he said he would get a maid’s job at some other place,” said Farheen. Farheen then contacted TWAQ and told the women’s wing general secretary Venkata Soujanya about her ordeal. Later, TWAQ member Lufti Kakar took her to the Indian Embassy to lodge a complaint. “All work in the Indian Embassy and police station were finished in a couple of days and even the passport, which takes some time, was arranged in a day thanks to the efforts of TWAQ member Swarna,’’ Kakar told TOI. Mohammed Taha, advisory committee member, said that Farheen safely landed in the city on August 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-beautician-duped-by-agent-to-work-as-maid-in-qatar-rescued/articleshow/85607697.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Crowd build-up forces Kolkata Municipal Corporation vaccination centres to tweak schedule||KOLKATA: Large crowds at several Kolkata Municipal Corporation-run vaccination clinics on Tuesday morning forced medical officers overseeing the clinics to desist from following the new schedule that would have led to a single queue and time slot for recipients of both doses. The officers chose to continue with the old schedule to prevent crowding at the gates. A KMC clinic at Kasba, for instance, kept its old schedule intact, inviting the recipients of second dose to get their jabs from 2pm onwards, thus averting a long single queue at the clinic. Vaccination for recipients of the first dose was completed by 1.45pm. Several clinics in Tollygunge followed the same model. A visit to some of these clinics by a TOI team on Tuesday revealed either long queues or large gatherings of recipients outside the vaccination clinics. At a civic clinic located close to Regent Estate, chaos broke out as recipients of both doses were first asked to stand in a single queue but later the civic team arranged a separate queue for the recipients of the second dose. At noon, Tarak Saha, a resident of Baghajatin, complained of inaction on the part of civic staffers in controlling the crowd. “I have been waiting here since 9am to take my second Covishield dose. Recipients of the second dose have gathered here in large numbers compared to the past few days. Since the allocation for the second dose is not sufficient, I fear I may miss the jab today,” Saha said. At Sree Colony’s Vivekananda Park vaccination centre, recipients of both doses were asked to submit their documents by 9am to become eligible for the jab on Tuesday. “We have arranged separate queues for the recipients due to space constraints. We will hardly be able to introduce separate queues as we don’t have enough space to accommodate them at a time,” a KMC official said. Similar scenes were witnessed in vaccination clinics and mega centres in areas such as Ultadanga, Maniktala, Beliaghata, Bidhan Sarani, Burrabazar, Bhowanipore, Harish Mukherjee Road, Chetla and Rashbehari Avenue, among other areas. However, major problems could be avoided as the civic brass on Tuesday allocated additional vials for each vaccination clinic and mega centres. “Today, we allocated 200 doses for each of 144 vaccination clinics. Yesterday, the allocation stood at 150 doses per clinic. The additional doses bailed us out from public fury,” said a KMC health department senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crowd-build-up-forces-kmc-vax-centres-to-tweak-schedule/articleshow/85605216.cms||Saikat Ray

Contract of all the counselling centres had ended on August 20, 2021. The NMC will spend Rs33.60 lakh per annum on these centres. The civic body spends Rs3.36 lakh every year towards remuneration of two counsellors (Rs9,000 each per month), a lawyer (Rs9,000 per month) and administrative expenses (Rs1,000 per month) per zone. The standing panel also okayed Nehru Nagar zone public works department’s proposal to spend Rs66.73 lakh to asphalt two roads in ward number 28 (D). Now, the PWD will float tenders for the work. The first tar road will be asphalted at a cost of Rs40.52 lakh in Amba Nagar Three Star Cooperative Housing Society and another road worth Rs26.21 lakh in the same ward 28-D, which is the constituency of BJP corporator Rekha Sakore.

---||Chennai||Madras HC verdict in Kodanad case on August 27||CHENNAI: The Madras high court will deliver its verdict on a plea for further investigation into a case relating to murder and burglary at Kodanad estate, former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s summer retreat in the Nilgiris, on August 27. Justice M Nirmal Kumar, after listening to animated arguments of Tamil Nadu advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram and two other senior counsel, reserved the verdict on Tuesday. “This issue must not be used for some other purpose, that is my only concern,” the judge said. The matter relates to a petition filed by prosecution witness, N Ravi, seeking day-to-day hearing in the case and early conclusion of trial in the Nilgiris sessions court. Allaying apprehensions, advocate-general Shunmugasundaram justified the police inquiry held with the key surviving suspect KV Sayan, and said: “We are ultimately going to place the truth. We have no intention to malign anyone.” Ruling out any motive behind commencing further investigation in the case, the AG said it was a poll promise of the ruling DMK. “The government has promised to find a logical conclusion in the case. We have no intention to harm anyone.” Shunmugasundaram said Section 173 (8) of CrPC does not specify that prior permission of the magistrate is required to commence further investigation. “The proviso nowhere states that any prior permission must be sought for further investigation,” he said. The investigation officer is only duty bound to inform the court and seek formal permission. They are not mandated to obtain permission, the AG clarified. Earlier, representing Ravi, senior advocate I Subramaniam argued that police had commenced further investigation in the case even without the prior approval of the magistrate concerned. “The Supreme Court has made it clear that such prior approval is a must to commence further investigation,” he said. Supporting his argument, former advocate-general A L Somayaji said such further investigation could be allowed only till the trial commences in the case. “In the present case, the trial has already commenced. Therefore, there is no question of granting permission for further investigation,” he said. There is a prima facie case for the court to stay further investigation, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-verdict-in-kodanad-case-on-august-27/articleshow/85605240.cms||Suresh Kumar

---||Mumbai||No bail in brownie case; court says ganja quantity small, but not gravity of matter||MUMBAI: In a detailed order rejecting the bail pleas of a 19-year-old Malad baker and her 20-year-old friend arrested for baking “weed brownies”, the special NDPS court has held that sympathy could not be shown only because of their tender age. The court said their age could not be a deciding factor to grant them relief. The court observed that even if the quantity of ganja allegedly recovered is 35 grams, the gravity of the matter is much more. Special public prosecutor for the NCB Advait M Sethna had submitted that selling weed brownies was on the rise in the city and it was required to be “nipped in the bud”. The prosecution claimed that more and more young people seemed to be involved in such dealings, so the ramifications were serious and deleterious on society at large. He said an application was moved for ascertaining the quantity of “Tetrahydrocannabinol” in the 830 grams of weed brownies allegedly recovered. “The special public prosecutor has also submitted that, as per CA (chemical analysis) report, Tetrahydrocannabinol found in the brownie cake and the report has been positive and, therefore, I am of the prima facie view that, gravity of the matter is much more than what is reflected from the small quantity of the contraband ganja recovered from them,” the court said. Among the offences the accused were booked under was the charge under Section 27A, which attracts a maximum sentence of 20 years. The charge relates to illicit trafficking and harbouring of offenders. The defence submitted that Section 27A is not attracted in this case as quantity of 35 grams of ganja and 830 grams of brownie was allegedly recovered. It was submitted that as per provisions of the NDPS Act, small quantity of ganja is 1kg and commercial quantity is 20kg. The defence said that the alleged activities of the accused do not constitute financing. It was submitted that as the quantity was small, the alleged offences were bailable. The prosecution submitted that the accused had sold and purchased the brownies for a living and for making quick money. “They are involved in such activities with other persons involved in serious offences and it amounts to illegal trafficking in the drugs. The brownie cake, ganja, weed are sold through internet, Instagram and all consumers of the applicants are young or adults,” the prosecution submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-bail-in-brownie-case-court-says-ganja-quantity-small-but-not-gravity-of-matter/articleshow/85609741.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Police registered a case against the bus driver, who suffered a leg fracture in the accident. The deceased were identified as M Mallikarjun, 40, K Nageshwar Rao, 44, of Prakasam district, and S Vijay Rao, 42, of Guntur, all from Andhra Pradesh. According to police, Mallikarjun and Nageshwar Rao were construction workers and Vijay Rao a farmer. “There were 45 passengers in the private travels bus moving from Kondapi in Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh to Hyderabad. Shortly after crossing Edulaguda X Roads in Miryalaguda town at 2.45 am, the bus rammed into a truck parked on the roadside from the rear at high speed. The front portion of the bus was completely damaged due to the crash,” Miryalaguda I Town circle inspector (CI) Ch S Nagaraju said. Most passengers in the bus were construction workers returning to the city from Prakasam and Guntur districts. Mallikarjun and Nageshwar Rao died on the spot, while Vijay Rao succumbed to injuries in a nearby hospital. “It took us some time to pull out the injured passengers from the bus and shift them to hospital. Of the 15 injured, six persons suffered fractures. All the injured are out of danger and they were shifted to various hospitals in Miryalaguda and Hyderabad,” the inspector said. During the investigation, police found that the truck was parked on the roadside due to a tyre burst. “The truck driver turned on the parking indicators and while he was about to replace the tyre, the speeding bus coming from behind crashed into it. It appears like bus driver K Venkateshwarlu might have dozed off,” the inspector said. A case was registered under sections 304-A, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-killed-15-hurt-as-bus-crashes-into-stationary-truck/articleshow/85607750.cms||---

Rajesh Paduwalkar reached Karwar from Goa airport around 11am on Tuesday. He was tired and emotional as he recalled his last days in the war-torn country. “I stepped in Kabul airport two years ago, hoping to open a new chapter in my life, but over the last seven days, what I experienced was hellish. I’m one of the lucky persons to have returned to India in a short time,” said Rajesh. He worked at EcoLog, an European company which was into catering services for the US Army units based in Kabul. “Everything was right till August 14, when the Taliban was about to capture Kabul city. I was working at the army base then. Around 4pm the next day, army sirens went off, and we were asked to enter bunkers fearing air attack. I rushed to a bunker which was already overcrowded. I stayed there for more than six hours, without sitting,” he said, adding that their company asked them to pack their bags the same day. “The US Army base is adjacent to Kabul airport. We were expecting to leave Kabul on the evening of August 15, but what unfolded was out of the blue. Over five thousand Afghans, including women and children, rushed to the airport and occupied the runway. The plane which was to ferry us to India did not land, and the crowds swelled. For two days, we were stranded in the airport with no planes. I thought it was the end,” he said. “However on August 17, the US army arranged a plane, and we left for Qatar. Even there, sights of horror greeted us. Over 20,000 Afghans were seen crammed in temporary shelters. Forget getting food on time, we even waited in a long queue to attend nature’s call. To avoid this, we stopped drinking water, while we subsisted on pieces of bread. Officials of the Indian embassy took care of us.” On Monday night, he reached Karwar via the Delhi-Goa route. “The dreams of the Afghans have been shattered, and I’m sorry for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karwar-returnee-recounts-afghan-ordeal/articleshow/85602811.cms||Deepak Kumar Shenvi

Talking to TOI after the review meeting, the MD of National Health Mission’s unit, Umashankar Singh, said, “Our preparedness for the third wave is fully in sync with the expected progress. We have completed the setting up of paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds in all 24 districts. There are a few gaps in a few districts regarding the ICUs and the district authorities concerned have been directed to ensure that these gaps are completed within a month.” As per state health department records, a total of 1,180 oxygen-equipped beds for paediatric patients have been set up across the state and a total of 307, out of 455 high dependency unit (HDU) beds, have been arranged for adult patients. In ICUs, a total of 12,795 beds have been set up across the state. A few districts, however, have lagged behind in completing the work as per their set target and they have been asked to expedite it. “Six districts are falling short of their target by 30 beds. They have been asked to complete the work within a month,” a senior official, who attended the meeting, on condition of anonymity said. The meeting also took stock of manpower requirements, the availability of ventilators and medicines, among others, and the deputy commissioners and civil surgeons concerned have been asked to fill in the gaps at the earliest. Upon contact, state IDSP head Dr Praveen Karn said, “All aspects of our preparedness for the impending third wave were reviewed in the meeting and we are focussing not only on improving our infrastructural facilities but also hiring adequate manpower and making sure that medicines are available.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-reviews-preparedness-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/85605296.cms||---

The bench also asked how can an ordinary citizen respect the court when the government fails to do so. Orders of the court are not mere institutional orders but must be respected and complied with in accordance with law, the court said. The bench is considering a contempt of court petition filed by Kerala Administrative Tribunal Ernakulam Advocates Association alleging non-implementation of the court’s order to appoint a chairperson for KAT. After considering the contempt case, the court had issued notices to Union cabinet secretary and secretary of department of personnel and training (DoPT). The petitioner had named Deepak Khandekar, who heads DoPT, as the respondent. During Tuesday’s hearing, a counsel representing the Union government submitted that no instructions have been received from the government in the matter despite communicating the directive more than once. He sought two more weeks to respond to the petition. In addition to the contempt plea filed by the advocates association, two other petitions filed by lawyers are also pending before the court. The Union government has been named as opposite parties in them. A contempt of court petition was filed citing that the division bench’s directive of June 1 to decide on the appointment of KAT chairman within three weeks has not been complied with yet. The advocates’ association had contended that the functioning of KAT, which decides service matters, would come to a standstill if there is any further delay in appointing the chairman. The terms of chairman, administrative member, and two judicial members have already ended and the post of the chairperson has been lying vacant since September last year, it was pointed out. The court said it would issue notices for personal appearance of the officers concerned cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and DoPT secretary Deepak Khandekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/show-some-respect-to-court-orders-hc-to-centre/articleshow/85607745.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: If 18 years is okay for voting, then why not drinking, says AAP government in high court||NEW DELHI: The AAP government on Tuesday defended its decision to reduce legal age for drinking in the capital. It opposed a PIL filed in the Delhi high court in this regard. “If a person can vote at the age of 18 years, to suggest that above 18 can’t drink is to live in an ivory tower. Just because it is permitted for a person to drink doesn’t mean drunken driving is also allowed. There are laws to prevent drunk driving and these are being enforced,” senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi told a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh. The government referred to drunk driving because the organisation that filed the plea is named ‘Community Against Drunken Driving’. The plea raised apprehensions that lowering the age from 25 to 21 years may lead to more cases of drunk driving and sought mandatory age check at places selling and serving alcohol, including bars, pubs, liquor vends and any food and beverage outlet. The plea wants government to put in place a robust mechanism for mandatory age check at liquor shops, bars and restaurants serving alcohol with government identity cards and also sought to restrain the Delhi government from giving effect to the new Excise Policy 2021-22 that reduced the age of consuming alcohol from 25 to 21 years until a robust age verification mechanism is put in place. The AAP government maintained that this was an attempt to stall the policy under one pretext or the other. The petitioner claimed that the PIL was filed after the government failed to take action on the previous petition filed by him in 2017 where the court had directed the state to form a policy on age checking at alcohol points of sale. The plea also sought that “the government be restrained from giving effect to the recent amendment made in the excise rules which permit doorstep delivery of liquor until a robust age verification mechanism is instituted even for door delivery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/if-18-yrs-is-okay-for-voting-then-why-not-drinking-govt-in-hc/articleshow/85605358.cms||---

Guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar had ordered the MPCB to investigate into the pollution caused by CSTPS and take action to curb aerial emissions. Wadettiwar, while reviewing environmental degradation in Chandrapur city and surrounding areas, had blamed CSTPS for high pollution levels. He charged the mega power plant, having installed capacity of 2920MW, of not taking measures to curb pollution despite Supreme Court orders. Expressing concern over the rising diseases like skin ailment, asthma, cancer and other respiratory disorders, he had directed MPCB regional office to check pollution caused by CSTPS and take appropriate action to bring the situation under control. Following Wadettiwar’s directives, MPCB started monitoring air pollution caused by the mega power plant from Monday. “We have started 74-hour-long continuous monitoring on the CSTPS premises. A team of eight operators, headed by two sub-regional officers (SROs) of the department, is monitoring the emissions from the plant,” said Ashok Kare, regional officer of MPCB. He informed that three ambient air quality monitoring machines have been deployed on CSTPS premises to gauge the pollution from the plant. The first ambient air quality monitoring machine has been placed at effluent treatment plant-IV in unit 8 and 9, while second one has been placed near railway cabin located close to Tukum area of city. The third machine has been place near effluent treatment plant–II in unit 3 to 7, said Kare. He also claimed that SRO Ajit Patil and Bahadure are heading the monitoring operations and have been stationed in CSTPS for three days for the task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mpcb-starts-pollution-monitoring-at-cstps/articleshow/85609749.cms||Mazhar Ali

They also suggested the authorities to design bus shelters afresh to give them a uniform look. Most of the bus shelters, they say, do not protect them from rain and sun because of the poor design. They say the right design should be selected for future bus shelters and replacing the existing ones. G Parthiban, a regular passenger on Trichy Road, said many bus shelters were on their last legs and they needed to be replaced. “In some shelters, the seat is so high that people cannot rest their feet on the ground and in some others the seating height is too low, causing inconvenience. A standard design should be selected, while ensuring that the bus shelters are user-friendly and serve their purposes properly. People’s convenience should be kept in mind while designing the shelter.” K Kathirmathiyon, a member of the district road safety committee, said the existing bus shelters were designed keeping in mind the advertisements. “Digital advertisements are banned by the Indian Road Congress, but they were kept in violation of the rule. While the advertisements have been removed following court orders, the provision for the same still exists at bus shelters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/make-bus-shelters-user-friendly-say-passengers/articleshow/85607770.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||BrahMos manufacturing unit to be set up in Lucknow soon||LUCKNOW: In a major development that could give a major push to economic and social development of the state, Lucknow node of UP Defence Corridor could soon start manufacturing the state-of-the-art BrahMos missiles. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has given his go-ahead to the project. The BrahMos Aerospace’s director general Sudhir Kumar Mishra met the CM on Tuesday. In his letter to UPEIDA CEO and additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi, Mishra has sought 200 acre land for the project in the Defence Corridor. "We have decided to provide land to BrahMos Aerospace. The delegation from aerospace also met the CM today," Awasthi told TOI. The project is expected to generate employment for around 10,000 personnel, including skilled, semi-skilled non-skilled workers. The unit alone would be needing around 500 engineers and technicians while the rest others would be at ancillary units. BrahMos Supersonic Cruise Missile is the only unique, precise and the state-of-the-art cruise missile in the world. It has been designed, developed and produced by BrahMos Aerospace, a joint venture of DRDO, government of India and NPOM, government of Russia, Mishra stated in the letter. At present, all the three services of Indian defence forces have this weapon system, he further stated and added that defence minister Rajnath Singh has already given his consent to go ahead with the project. The DRDO, which is a major shareholder of the joint venture proposed to establish production facility for BrahMos-NG in UP defence corridor, the letter stated and added that being the project of national importance, there is a requirement of establishing such a facility in location having strategic depth as also connectivity to air, rail and road. The requirement of land would be approximately 200 acres. It is based on the technology of Russia's P-800 Oniks cruise missile.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the creation of a defence corridor in UP during the Investors' Summit in January 2018. Further, it was announced that the state government was setting up defence corridors at Lucknow, Kanpur, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, Agra, and Aligarh nodes. During the Defense Expo-Lucknow in February 2020, many domestic and foreign companies making products related to defence had signed MoUs worth Rs 50,000 crore for investment in the corridor. Most of the MoUs had been signed for the corridor being built in Andla on Khair Road in Aligarh. After this, various companies have shown interest in investing in the Lucknow node. According to UPEIDA officials, around 29 companies submitted their proposals to the government for setting up factories in the Aligarh node and requested for land. Similarly, 11 companies in the Lucknow node, six in the Jhansi node, eight in the Kanpur node have requested to provide land for setting up factories. Acting on the proposals received from various companies, UPEDIA has so far allotted 55.4 hectares of land in Aligarh node to 19 international companies. As per the BrahMos project proposal, the company has production facilities at Hyderabad, Nagpur and Bilani and has order value of Rs 35,000 crore placed by Indian Army, Navy and Air Force. The proposal also states that Indian Airforce has confirmed interest in BrahMos-NG missiles costing around Rs 8,000 crore to be delivered in the next five years. Similarly, discussions are on with the Indian Army and Navy for such orders. The venture is also seeing the possibility of additional export orders worth Rs 10,000 crore in the next five years. The anticipated order would be to the tune of Rs 42,000 crore. The proposal also intends to manufacture the above order in UP itself. According to the project proposal estimate, Rs 300 crore would be invested in civil infrastructure and the construction work would begin within three months of getting possession of land. The project is expected to produce 300 missiles by the third year and the same is expected to produce GST worth Rs 360 crore each year. The research and development activity would get completed is estimated to begin by 3rd year, the proposal report stated. Sources said that the letter of approval from the chief minister Yogi Adityanath is expected soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/brahmos-manufacturing-unit-to-be-set-up-in-lucknow-soon/articleshow/85609736.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Posta flyover demolition zone faces parking challenge||KOLKATA: The Posta flyover demolition work - which will see the launch of its second phase come September 1 when the demolition work will begin between Ganesh Talkies and Girish Park - is facing some small challenges which cops say need to be solved quickly to ensure smooth flow of traffic in the Posta-Girish Park central Kolkata alignment. The demolition work will see a new no-parking provision set in around the 300 metre stretch of Vivekananda Road - lying between Ganesh Talkies and Girish Park - once the work begins. “Residents have been informed that they would be able to use the footpaths but cannot bring their cars on to Vivekananda Road. The cars will have to be parked on the bylanes off Rabindra Sarani, Balaram Dey Street or Rajendra Mullick Street,” said an officer. The two parking lots on Vivekananda Road and KK Tagore Street, managed by the KMC, thus will be removed for the next three months. But sources said they are officially not marking out any particular parking lot. "These are not cars headed to business centres like Posta. We are mostly talking of property line vehicles and several locals are seeking assurance from us that only property line vehicles are allowed parking in the bylanes. Given the area's proximity to Burrabazar-Posta, this might not be a feasible demand," said an officer. The cops say they are planning to provide special parking passes, if required. "We will react as and when required," said a senior officer at Lalbazar. The Jorabagan traffic guard sources said that a private vaccination centre located within the demolition area is likely to be their biggest challenge. "We have to ensure that those coming for vaccination get priority. We have decided to deploy our men at the spot in the initial days to sort out this issue. We have sought help from the private guards of the facility in this regard. We will pick the parking spots depending on the exact spot where the demolition work will be carried out. In other words, the parking spots for the vaccination centres will keep changing," said an officer. Similarly, even as the KMDA appointed demolition agency has removed all their equipment from Strand Road (the Strand Road portion lying between Mirbarai Ghat Street Crossing- KK Tagore Street Crossing is presently shut for traffic) on Tuesday, traffic has still not resumed on Strand Road. The Howrah Bridge traffic guard sources said that unless the road is repaired immediately by KMC, it will not be possible to reintroduce vehicles on this stretch. Prodded by the police, the KMDA has now sent a letter to KMC to carry out the necessary repairs as heavy machinery had damaged the corners of the road. Till reports last came in, The KMC had agreed to undertake an inspection of the damaged portion of the road either on Tuesday or Wednesday after which repair work can begin in earnest. Police sources said that unless the Strand Road is reopened, the entire Posta area is likely to witness major snarls once the Ganesh Talkies side is shut down from August 27. The police are happy that the traders have come forward and agreed to solve another major challenge - removing the milk Mandi located within the restricted zone. The milk market at Ganesh Talkies is likely to be shifted to an open space available near Lohia Matri Seva Sadan Hospital on 302, Rabindra Sarani. BOX: The challenges: Parking * The two parking lots on Vivekananda Road and KK Tagore Street, managed by the KMC, thus will be removed for the next three months * The cars will have to be parked on the bylanes off Rabindra Sarani, Balaram Dey Street or Rajendra Mullick Street * Property line vehicles will have to be accommodated in the restricted space available on alternate roads * A private vaccination centre located within the demolition area is likely to be their biggest challenge Reopening of Strand Road: Unless the road is repaired immediately by KMC, it will not be possible to reintroduce vehicles on this stretch (between Mirbarai Ghat Street Crossing- KK Tagore Street Crossing) Traffic police plan diversions between Ganesh Talkies and Girish Park on the Vivekananda Road in order to carry out demolition of the Vivekananda Road flyover: Duration: 3 months Start date: August 27 tentatively * The cops will be diverting vehicles coming from Posta and towards Girish Park from the Ganesh Talkies crossing. * All vehicles will turn left onto Rabindra Sarani, and then turn right on to Beadon Street instead of going straight before reaching CR Avenue. * Smaller vehicles will also have the option of using Beadon Square as an alternate route * All three bus routes - 43, Shyambazar-Babughat minibus and Shyambazar-Metiabruz minibus will be plying via CR Avenue. None of the buses will use the Vivekananda Road alignment * The hand Pulled carts of various wholesale markets like GaRLIC and Ginger will be asked to use Strand Road north-Nimtala Ghat Street-Beadon Street alignment||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/parking-challenges-near-girish-park-before-posta-flyover-demolition-work-kmc-urged-to-complete-road-repairs-at-strand-road/articleshow/85605407.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Dehradun||Cashless jails: 700 inmates at Haldwani prison to get 'smart cards'||NAINITAL: At least 700 inmates at Haldwani sub-jail will now get 'smart cards' to make purchases from the jail canteen in a bid to encourage cashless transactions. With this drive, the Haldwani sub-jail joins a fast-growing league of prisons across the country that have rolled out such initiatives. These include jails in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Maharashtra. Some also allow smart cards to be used in ATMs to withdraw money or as “health cards” with medical histories stored on them. Haldwani sub-jail superintendent S K Sukhija told TOI the smart cards are meant to replace a coupon system that exists at present and encourage cashless transactions. “Earlier, prisoners had to get coupons from the jail administration and take those to the canteen. Now the families can deposit money in the bank accounts of the prisoners and a card will be issued to them,” he said. The card will contain biometrics of the inmates so they can’t be misused, said jail officials. They will also have the prisoner’s names and other details. The cards can be used to make purchases of up to Rs 4,500 a month from the jail canteen which sells essentials as well as snacks and clothes. Jail officials said that more inmates will get the smart cards in the next phase. At present, the jail houses 153 convicts and 1,503 undertrials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cashless-jails-700-inmates-at-haldwani-prison-to-get-smart-cards/articleshow/85602856.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Thiruvananthapuram||KU senate to decide on recalling certificates||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala University senate meeting scheduled on Thursday would consider an amendment proposal to empower the varsity to recall the certificates issued by it if they were later found to have issued wrongly. The amendment said the university was necessitated by the issuance of certificates to several students after they got excess marks allegedly due to error in the tabulation software. In 2019, 23 students were issued degree certificates by gifting them additional marks. It was found out that the user ID and password of a deputy registrar was misused to manipulate mark list. The deputy registrar was then suspended and a section officer who was identified as the kingpin behind such manipulations was later dismissed from service. Though the university had initially sought a crime branch inquiry to the ‘inadvertent awarding of marks’, the varsity is yet to hand over the documents to the probe agency. The university has been facing severe criticism for the delay in annulling the certificates issued to the 23 students. The agenda of the special meeting of the senate plans to pass amendment in the Kerala University first statutes so that “degrees, diplomas, titles, etc, may be recalled at any time after it is made where evidence is placed before the syndicate to show that any person whom such degree, diploma, certificate, title, etc, was awarded by mistake of fact....provided that every person affected by the recalling of the degree, diploma, certificate, title shall be given sufficient opportunity as determined by the syndicate to complete the prescribed course of study and pass the prescribed examination if the situation warrants correction and reissue of the degree, diploma, certificate, title, etc. and if otherwise the syndicate may take such decision as it deem fit,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ku-senate-to-decide-on-recalling-certificates/articleshow/85607794.cms||---

Both the man’s wife and his daughter turned hostile in court and denied the allegations. The court found the family members were against his drinking habit and dominance, hence they decided to lodge the complaint. The court also said there were no evidence to show the girl was a minor at the time of the offence. “Thus, the prosecution has failed to prove that Pocso Act is applicable,” the court said.  In court, the mother denied that her daughter was sexually assaulted. She deposed her husband is a drunk and used to beat them. The mother said as he was harassing them, therefore, she complained to the cops in anger. “The victim has deposed that her father needs mental treatment, but he would not take his medicine... The medical report also did not point any sexual assault,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dad-acquitted-of-sex-harassment-kin-just-wanted-drunk-in-jail/articleshow/85602589.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: 400 families in Sector 92 society spend 17 hours without power||GURUGRAM: Around 400 families of Raheja Navodaya, a housing society in Sector 92, faced outage for more than 17 hours since Monday evening. According to the residents, power supply to the housing society went off around 7pm on Monday and could be restored only by 12.30pm on Tuesday. Officials said there was a technical fault in the transmission line, which needed time to be rectified. The residents, however, alleged that discom officials started repairing the fault the next morning itself. The society, the residents pointed out, does not have a permanent connection and power is supplied through a shared feeder line from Hayatpur village. The uneven load, they said, leads to frequent tripping, voltage fluctuation and long outages. The flat owners said they had repeatedly lodged complaints with the developer as well as the discom, DHBVN, but to no avail. “When we informed the discom officials about the power cut on Monday evening, they said they did not have enough manpower and resources to tackle the problem then. The repair work started around 10 the next morning and electricity was restored two and a half hours later. This is despite the fact that the discom is levying fixed charges on us apart from user charges,” a resident said. According to the flat owners at Raheja Navodaya, power cuts happen for around 2-3 hours daily, prompting them to rely heavily on diesel gensets. The use of gensets not only has an effect on the environment, but also forces the housing society to spend Rs 2-3 lakh on fuel and maintenance of the machines every month. The outages, the residents said, have been posing problems for students attending online classes and those working from home. “When people are working from home, uninterrupted power is a must. Using DG sets for hours at a stretch not only has an effect on the environment but also burns a hole in our pocket. However, since the DG set installed by the developer is not equipped to take the load of all the flats, we have to take gensets on rent during the summer. Of the 666 flats in total, around 400 are occupied,” said an RWA member. But outages are nothing new for residents of the society. “It is an issue we are facing since 2017. The society only has a temporary connection of 11kV from a shared feeder. This leads to frequent tripping, outages and voltage fluctuations. Till now, the developer has not set up the 33kV electric infrastructure that he is supposed to. This is despite multiple requests from us,”said Dheeraj Sharma, the RWA vice-president of the society. Despite repeated attempts, a representative of the developer remained unavailable for comment. Told about the 17-hour-long outage, Joginder Kaushik, the SDO of Farrukhnagar, said, “An electricity pole got uprooted on Monday. We could rectify the problem only the next morning. The connection to the society is a temporary one and we have also asked the developer to set up the 33 kV infrastructure. But there has been no response from the builder. There are bills pending too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/400-families-in-sector-92-society-spend-17-hours-without-power/articleshow/85610173.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Pune||Maharashtra ready for third wave, last Centre letter in June, says Rajesh Tope||PUNE: Urging residents not to panic about the probable third wave of Covid-19, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the Maharashtra government was developing the requisite infrastructure to handle it. The minister categorically told TOI that he had not received any fresh letters from the Centre or Niti Aayog regarding the third wave this month. “The last letter from the Centre regarding the third wave was issued in June. Accordingly, the state has given instructions to all the districts to prepare for the required oxygen supply, hospital infrastructure and medicines,” he said. After receiving the letter from the Centre, Tope said, the state health department had written a comprehensive letter to all the district collectors, zilla parishad chief executive officers (CEOs) and district civil surgeons about the estimated number of cases. Against this backdrop, the state task force members stressed on continuing with the Covid protocols. They prescribed double-masking and complete vaccination to curb the intensity of the probable third wave. While bracing for the probable Covid spike, Tope said the only thing he expected from the Centre was more vaccines. He said he had written a letter to the central government seeking an appointment of the Union health minister. “I have even taken help of the leader of opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, to arrange the meeting so that the state could get more vaccines,” he said. Tope said, “Both, the legislative assembly and the council, had passed a resolution to procure three crore doses monthly from the Centre. We are hoping that the Centre will accept our request.” On the feasibility of procuring vaccines directly from the manufacturers, Tope said the entire rollout of vaccines was controlled by the Centre. “We cannot talk to the companies directly and they cannot supply doses to us directly. It has to be routed through the Centre. So, I have sought an appointment with the Union health minister,” he said, iterating that Maharashtra could vaccinate 10 lakh beneficiaries per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-ready-for-3rd-wave-last-centre-letter-in-june-tope/articleshow/85605396.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The orders assume significance as thousands of students from EWS sections would benefit during the hectic admission schedule ahead for the current academic year into polytechnic, engineering, agriculture, pharmacy, MBA, MCA, LLB and LLM courses and also filling up of 50,000 jobs in the government sector. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar issued the orders on the EWS guidelines on Tuesday. Only those from EWS are eligible for the 10% quota who are not covered under the scheme of reservations for SCs, STs and BCs and whose family has gross annual income below Rs 8 lakh. Income includes from all sources — salary, agriculture, business, profession etc. for the financial year prior to the year of application. The guidelines stipulate that 33.3% of the initial appointments under the state government earmarked for EWS category would be allocated to women among them. The maximum age for direct recruitment to a post would be raised by 5 years for EWS candidates on par with SC, ST and BC candidates. The benefit of reservation under EWS can be availed upon production of an ‘income certificate’ issued by tahsildar. If in any recruitment year any vacancy earmarked for EWS cannot be filled up due to non-availability of a suitable candidate, such vacancies for that particular recruitment year would not be carried forward to the next recruitment year as backlog. Exemption from exam fees shall be given for EWS candidates on par with SC/ST/BC candidates in respect of direct recruitments. If any person gets an appointment on the basis of false claim, his/her services would be terminated invoking the conditions contained in the offer of appointment. As per the guidelines, the appointing authorities should, in the offer of appointment to the candidates claiming to be belonging to EWS category, include the following clause: “The appointment is provisional and is subject to the income certificate being verified through the proper channels and if the verification reveals that the claim to belong to EWS is fake/false the service will be terminated forthwith without assigning any further reasons and without prejudice to such further action as may be taken under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code for production of fake/false certificate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-releases-norms-for-ews-quota-33-jobs-for-women/articleshow/85610509.cms||Roushan Ali

Seema Naik, a mother of two, had lost her husband Anil Naik in the accident on September 23, 2020. The woman had approached the high court in December stating that the defence authorities were willfully impeding the investigation into the FIR so as to protect its servicemen. Earlier this month, the court disposed of a petition after the military officials informed the court that they will cooperate with police in the case. The vehicle does not belong to the Goa unit but belongs to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Transit Facilities at Karwar, said S Karpe, central government standing counsel representing the secretary, ministry of defence to the court. Recently, the military produced the vehicle driver, Kuldip Singh, and other occupants before the police, and their statements were recorded. “We left for our native place after the incident, and returned 17 days after performing the last rites of my husband. To our dismay, there was no progress in the police investigation. I ran from pillar to post, met local politicians and ministers, as well as senior police officials. But we only got sympathies, nobody came forward to help me,” Seema told TOI.

State surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said testing would have to be improved in Amravati, Bhandara, Yavatmal and Gadchiroli districts, from where Delta-Plus cases emerged. Of the 27 new Delta-Plus cases, six each were reported from Amravati and Gadchiroli, five from Nagpur, four from Ahmednagar, two from Nashik and one from Bhandara. “Most of these districts have been testing between 1,000 and 4,000 samples in a week. There is a need to ramp up testing there after the detection of Delta-Plus variant cases,” said a public health official. Awate said the usual testing, contact tracing and early treatment, along with vaccination, were the key to address the Delta-Plus variant cases. “The genomic surveillance is helping us gather the necessary epidemiological details and prevent the spread of the Delta-Plus variant. Besides, contact tracing and early testing and treatment are keeping the cases under control,” he told TOI, adding that there was no active Delta-Plus variant case in the state at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-dept-to-ramp-up-tests-at-places-with-delta-reports/articleshow/85605413.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Surat||Vadodara youths’ SUV stunt ends up in sea, locals save two||Bharuch: Around seven friends from Vadodara had gone to the Stambheshwar Mahadev Temple near Kavi Kamboi, 90km away from the Banyan City, in their SUV on Monday. After their pilgrimage to the shrine was over, the entire group of turbaned Sikh youths decided to have some fun on the beach. Incidentally, the beach was filled with visitors who had come to the pay their obeisance during the ongoing holy month of Shravan. The beach, which is actually part of an estuary from the Mahi river, is a little muddy near the Stambheshwar shrine and tide water leaves both the shrine and the beach totally submerged. Local folklore has it that the sea water rises to cleanse the Stambha and this has made the temple’s popularity rise manifold among devotees’ for the past many decades now. The youth, overwhelmed to see the large crowd, decided to put their skills to test and entertain themselves as well as the gathering with some daredevilry and stunts with their four-wheeler. While two remained in the vehicle, the other friends got down to make videos of the stunts in the sea. Unmindful of the dangers that they were putting themselves and crowd into, the motley group of invigorated youths started showing off their feats at full speed. They drove their SUV at break-neck speed on the shores risking other devotees’ lives and other similar stunts for video effect. While the young men were at the crescendo of their fun, nature too decided to add some colour of its own and soon, high tide rushed in rapidly engulfing the whole beach in matter of minutes. While the ones who were filming the stunts could get out of the rising seawater, the two inside the SUV got trapped as the vehicle got stuck in the mud. Panicked youths then started to shout for help and locals had to rush in to save them from a possible disaster. According to the mahant of the Stambheshwar shrine, Vidyanandji, several local youth along with police personnel who were on the beach rushed in to rescue the youths and managed to bring them out to safety. The vehicle, which got totally submerged in the water, could be pulled out only the next morning when the tide water receded on Tuesday. While the SUV got damaged from the water, no human casualty or injuries had been reported in the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vadodara-youths-suv-stunt-ends-up-in-sea-locals-save-two/articleshow/85605415.cms||---

Rs 2000 and Rs 500 rupees notes were found on the tracks. Police confirmed that the notes were fake and they were used in board games. According to the railway police officials, the notes were scattered on the Salem-Bengaluru track. “When we checked the notes, we found ‘micky mouse’ faces and ‘Children’s Bank of India’ was printed on it,” said Rathna Kumar, inspector (in-charge) of Dharmapuri railway police. The officials however, doubted that people, who are usually involved in money ‘doubling’ activities, may have brought these notes on train. “They may have thrown the notes when railway police conducted checks in the coaches,” the inspector suspected. A case was registered by Dharmapuri railway police and further inquiry is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/fake-notes-found-on-railway-track/articleshow/85607812.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu BJP general secretary K T Raghavan quits as ‘sleaze clip’ is released||CHENNAI: BJP state general secretary K T Raghavan resigned from the party post on Tuesday after a YouTuber released visuals of a video call between a man and a woman. Madan Ravichandran, who posted the video with his comments charging the BJP leader with indecent behaviour, identified himself as a BJP member and a journalist. The face of the woman was blurred in the video which appeared to have been recorded from her end. Soon after the video was released on social media, Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai said a panel headed by state secretary Malarkodi would investigate the authenticity of the video. “This team will study the truth behind the allegations and will initiate appropriate action against those who are proven accused,” a statement from Annamalai said. Raghavan denied the allegations and said he would face them legally. “I came to know about the video circulating in social media since morning. The video was released to tarnish me and my party. I met state president K Annamalai and discussed with him. I am resigning my party post,” he tweeted. Raghavan added that people of Tamil Nadu and those close to him know him. “I have been serving for the past 30 years without any expectations,’’ he said in the tweet. Annamalai said he had accepted Raghavan’s resignation. “I’m confident that he would face the issue legally and prove himself,” Annamalai said in a statement. On his YouTube page, Madan said he had informed Annamalai about his ‘sting operation’ and the video. “The video is being released with the knowledge of Annamalai,’’ he said. To this, the state BJP president said that Madan did meet him, but he was not shown the content of the video. “Madan approached me twice and demanded action against Raghavan. I asked him to furnish the video and told him action cannot be taken without seeing the contents, ascertaining its authenticity or seeking an explanation from the person concerned. I advised him to hand over the video evidence,” Annamalai said. “Later, Madan sent a text message asking if any action was taken against Raghavan. I stood firm in my stand that disciplinary action cannot be taken without knowing facts of the charges. Therefore, I replied to him, saying he could proceed if he wanted justice,” Annamalai said. On Madan’s claims that he has more such videos, Annamalai said such statements raise questions on the intention behind his activities. “This act of his is purely unacceptable,” he said. He, however, said the BJP was taking the allegations seriously and the inquiry commission would find the truth. Annamalai said women functionaries were safe in the BJP, a party built on strong traditions and culture. “Women are treated with utmost care, respect and love,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gen-secy-quits-over-video-bjp-orders-probe/articleshow/85607811.cms||---

They repaired a one km stretch of a mud road and celebrated the festival by tying rakhis to each other, acknowledging the bond towards each other and responsibility towards the village. A group of nearly 25 men engaged themselves in shramadhan by repairing the road connecting Bolugallu, Bengathamale and Chakote. Prashanth Bolugallu, from the Bolgallu village told TOI that locals, on several occasions, have been requesting the panchayat to get the road repaired. “When the panchayat agreed to provide all the necessary material, a team of youth came forward to work. It was a day-long activity. The entire stretch is about 2 km, but certain stretches have been concretised. Due to the monsoon, the road had become uneven in certain places, making it difficult for the movement of vehicles. The shramadhan will continue next week too. Mandekolu panchayat development officer Ramesh P said that such activities have been undertaken at several places. “The panchayat provides necessary materials, including stones and equipment. Food for volunteers is also arranged by the panchayat. This activity also helps in building a healthy bond,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/youths-celebrate-rakhi-by-rebuilding-village-road/articleshow/85602937.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi government not letting guard down on Covid-19 situation: Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Even though the national capital recorded zero Covid-19 death for the fifth day in a row and the positivity rate was 0.06%, health minister Satyendar Jain said Delhi government was not dropping its guard and was closely monitoring the situation to avoid a third wave. Jain, who inspected the preparations for the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the city on Tuesday, said that while no death had been caused by the novel coronavirus infection in the past few days and the positivity rate was also very low, Delhi government was consistently working to avoid a possible outbreak of the third Covid-19 wave in Delhi. “The Kejriwal government is concerned about the health and safety of children and the elderly. We are constantly monitoring the Covid-19 situation in Delhi and also observing the situation of other states that have reopened schools,” the minister said after the inspection. “We are making all necessary arrangements, but our focus is on ensuring that an outbreak of the third wave doesn’t arise in Delhi. However, vaccination is the prime key to make the situation better,” Jain said. “With each passing day, the supply of vaccines should be increased and vaccinations should be done expeditiously to make the prevailing Covid-19 situation better in Delhi,” he added. “The Kejriwal government has also directed the manufacturers to boost the manufacturing of drugs being used for the treatment of Covid-19 and no company should charge any extra amount for any drug,” Jain said. “Delhi government is making all necessary arrangements to counter the third wave and 37,000 Covid-dedicated beds, including 12,000 ICU ones, are being set up and medical facilities, including the availability of sufficient oxygen and essential drugs, have also been taken care of,” Jain said. “The Kejriwal government is determined to provide a safe and healthy environment to the people of Delhi.” The government is trying its best “to ramp up the medical infrastructure and prepare it for a possible outbreak. But our primary focus is to ensure that a third wave doesn’t even arise in the first place”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-govt-not-letting-guard-down-on-covid-19-situation/articleshow/85605469.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kochi||In 6 years, 474 elephants electrocuted in India: Ministry of environment and forests||KOCHI: An RTI reply from the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) to activist K Govindan Namboothiry stated that 474 elephants were electrocuted in the country from 2014 to 2020. Maximum deaths were reported in 2018 at 81, while the average, yearly figure was 70 every year until then. As many as 65 elephants died till December 2020; 13 in Assam and 10 in West Bengal. Maximum elephant deaths were reported in Assam (90), followed by Odisha (73), Tamil Nadu (68) and Karnataka (65) respectively. Kerala reported 24 elephant deaths during this period. Forest officials said that most electrocutions happen after individuals opt for illegal power fencing for their homes or farms. Sometimes, large animals also come in contact with high-voltage overhead power lines passing through forests and get electrocuted. Namboothiry said that forest officers used poor quality materials for their fences, thus leading to electrocution of elephants. Noted ecologist Dr Raman Sukumar explained his views citing instances. “For 20-30 years, wild elephants have been increasingly wandering outside forest areas in order to raid agri landscapes. To keep them and other wild animals away, farmers are erecting power fences around their farms. Elephants come in contact with the fence and get electrocuted. In the second instance, elephants come in contact with low-hanging power lines or main transmission lines in settlements, villages and other areas and get killed,” he said. Sukumar felt that the government should focus more on the management of Project Elephant scheme to prevent man, animal casualties. “Lot of landscapes have been identified under the project. These landscapes are major habitats with interconnections of elephant corridors. We should try our best to keep the elephants inside these landscapes by formulating appropriate measures. Allocation of funds under the scheme is negligible now,” he added. There are also other instances too. “Sometimes, branches fall on powerlines during heavy rain and wild animals come in contact with them. An incident happened in Neriamangalam a few years ago when some animals, including an elephant and a bison, were electrocuted after they came in contact with a broken branch that fell on a powerline during rain. The carcasses were charred beyond recognition and we found only the remnants at the spot. We also noted some individuals give direct connection from their homes or farms to fences to keep animals at bay,” said a forest official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/in-six-years-474-elephants-electrocuted-in-india-moef/articleshow/85607875.cms||T C Sreemol

They opined that fans would turn up only to watch new movies. The state government allowed cinema theatres to function with 50% occupancy starting Monday (August 23). Following the announcement, theatres in the districts were cleaned and sanitized on Sunday. While many waited for a large footfall, only a few turned up to watch movies, they said. “In the first show in our theatre on Monday, only five people came to watch the movie,” K Srinivasan, a partner of a theatre in Salem city, said. He said that the theatre management later cancelled the remaining shows after seeing less number of people. They further hoped that a few Tamil films might release on Friday. “We expect more people after new releases,” Srinivasan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/film-shows-cancelled-across-salem/articleshow/85607833.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||With a herd of 200 netas, Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao plans mega show for Delhi office event||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who drew national attention with the launch of Dalit Bandhu scheme in the state recently, is gearing up for another big show to get traction at the national level. The TRS president will lay the foundation stone for his party office in Delhi on September 2. About 200 leaders, including ministers, party MPs, MLAs, MLCs and TRS state executive committee members will take part in the event. Sources said the party leadership is planning to hire a special flight to take the contingent to Delhi. Though the party leadership is playing coy on the mega event, sources said it will lay a road map for the next elections and set an agenda for the entry of KCR into national politics. Refusing to dwell much, party working president KT Rama Rao said: “This is only a foundation laying for the party office in Delhi.” On the party’s entry at the national level, he said: “We will see how it pans out in future.” KCR tried to play a bigger role during the 2019 general elections by floating a ‘federal front’ by uniting non-Congress and non-BJP parties. But, his plans did not move forward as many parties which he consulted and met either were aligned or had friendly ties with Congress. Now, Congress has started efforts to unite all the opposition parties to fight against the BJP at the Centre. “KCR is watching the developments at the Centre and will take a decision at an appropriate time,” a TRS general secretary said. He said the BJP’s image was waning now and a leader like KCR would certainly fill the void at the Centre. The Centre had allotted 1,200 square metres of land to the TRS at Vasant Vihar last year. “Many parties, including TDP, got land allotted in Delhi. But, none of the parties has conducted the foundation laying event in a grand manner. This is one of the ways to showcase our party strength,” a TRS MP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-a-herd-of-200-netas-kcr-plans-mega-show-for-delhi-office-event/articleshow/85610512.cms||Koride Mahesh

Chopra, India’s only second individual gold-medallist, had much knowledge to impart to the eager youngsters, but none better than this pearl of wisdom: “Enjoy your game — this is most important. If you can’t, you won’t be able to give it your 100% in the competition. And treat success and defeat equally — this attitude will make your think positively.” Among the awe-struck youngsters were Manu D P (21) — whose personal best is 78.14 metres — a silver-medallist at the Indian Grand Prix; and Vikas Yadav (20), gold-medallist at Khelo India in 2018. During the interaction, Chopra was asked about going head-on with 2017 German world champion Johannes Vetter in Tokyo. The champ merely said, “Just focus on your game and try to give it your all.; don’t worry about competitors.” Chopra, an Army subedar, had trained in his early years at ASI in 2016. He also met athletes of the Boys Sports Company at ASI. “Neeraj has been in contact with them and shares his inputs regularly. The athletes are now motivated to do their best in upcoming competitions,” Kashinath Naik, Chopra’s former coach and current ASI coach, told TOI. Chopra paid a visit to Naik’s house. Chopra, accompanied by other Tokyo Olympians like boxer Satish Kumar, steeplechaser Avinash Sable and archer Tarundeep Rai, also visited the Paraplegic Rehabilitation Centre (PRC) in Khadki. These retired soldiers are skilled at various sports like badminton, basketball, swimming, and athletics. A few of them are national champions as well. Sureshkumar Karki, captain of India’s wheelchair basketball team, and a badminton player, said, “It was very motivating for all of us to meet the Olympic gold medallist. He appreciated our achievements and even said we were a source of inspiration to him.” Anthony Parera, who won silver medal in the wheelchair javelin throw category at an Asia-Pacific para competition at Bangkok in 1999, said, “He spent nearly two hours with us.” Chopra also visited the Army Public School at Ghorpadi and interacted with a group of students. “Chopra arrived in Pune on Monday morning to a rousing reception. He was supposed to attend the naming ceremony of the athletics stadium, which is to be named after him, at ASI. However, the event got postponed as the chief guest, defence minister Rajnath Singh, could not make it,” a senior Army officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/olympic-champ-chopra-floors-budding-athletes/articleshow/85605468.cms||Sandip Dighe

Micro irrigation has been in vogue for tea for many years though. Smart IoT irrigation is an innovative Israeli technique that uses water judiciously and helps farmers achieve higher levels of crop yield with minimal amount of water. The irrigation system has been installed on a 5-acre tea garden in the United Nilgiri Tea Estates Company Pvt. Ltd. (Chamraj group) in Allada Valley near Ooty. Nilgiris collector J.Innocent Divya, who inaugurated the project said, “It is a path breaking project for tea plantations. If government considers subsidy for the project, it will go a long way.” Jonathan Zadka, consul general of Israel to south India, said, “This installation, which is a first-of-its-kind to be used in tea plantations in India, is an attempt to introduce a robust irrigation solution,” he said. Zadka met CM M K Stalin recently in connection with the project. The CM assured him that if the project is successful, it would be implemented across the state for other crops too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/iot-irrigation-project-in-tea-estate-near-ooty/articleshow/85607874.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan

He is said to be only Indian with double amputee to conquer three major peaks of three different continents. Sahu has started his initiative ’Mission Inclusion’ to complete seven summits across seven continents with an objective of bringing behavioral change in society for People with Disability (PwD). He has already successfully climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa and Mount Kosciuszko in Australia. The 28-year-old mountaineer hoisted Tricolor on the Mount Elbrus on Monday morning giving a message of ‘Mission Inclusion and Plastic-Free Nation’. “I believe that life is like a mountain—full of ups and downs and we have to struggle continuously moving forward in our lives. Moving forward with a positive mindset and thinking rather than focusing just on the negatives always bring results of our efforts,” Sahu said. Speaking about his expedition Sahu said it was quite challenging to reach the peak, the weather was not suitable for hiking with -25°C body freezing temperature and with snow storm gusting upto 50 to 70 km per hour. He also got his one leg injured but didnt lose hopes. “You have to put 65 per cent more strength and energy than a normal person, having a prosthetic leg and when you are at a higher altitude in the mountain the oxygen level is also low and you are a little slower than the rest, so it becomes more difficult,” he explained. Speaking about ‘Mission Inclusion’, he said, “We are not less than anyone, nor are we different, so we want all to treat us equally. We don’t want any mercy.” Sahu will now start preparations for his fourth expedition soon. Meanwhile, the US-based NRI organization NACHA (North America Chhattisgarh Association) of Chhattisgarh supported this mountaineering expedition. They described his expedition as a matter of pride for the country and extended best wishes for the upcoming campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/meet-indias-1st-double-leg-amputee-to-scale-these-peaks/articleshow/85600140.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Akhilesh Yadav missing at Kalyan Singh homage to please Muslims’||LUCKNOW: The BJP on Tuesday mounted a fresh attack on the Samajwadi Party leadership accusing it of not paying tributes to former UP CM Kalyan Singh fearing the loss of Muslim votes. The charge was led by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh who said that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav did not come to pay homage to 'Babuji’ despite being just a kilometre away from his residence. “Was it because of the Muslim vote bank that he did not come to pay tribute to tallest leader of backward castes,” Singh questioned. BJP MP from Unnao, Sakshi Maharaj said that Akhilesh “insulted” the backwards by not paying tributes to Kalyan. Deputy CM Keshav Maurya too said that the SP has lost the right to speak about the OBCs. BJP’s jibe at the SP leadership came a day after its MP from Kannauj, Subrata Pathak, said that the sin of firing at kar sevaks would have been washed away to an extent had Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh come to pay tributes to Kalyan Singh. It is believed that as SP joined hands with Kalyan, who had quit BJP the second time, in 2009 LS polls, a big chunk of Muslim votes drifted towards Congress, resulting it its success on 21 seats. Political experts interpreted BJP’s jibe at the SP as an attempt to draw a defining line to isolate the SP leadership which has been making an outreach at Brahmins.

This has connected development block Sahaspur Lohara and Kabirdham district headquarter with Bhainsbod. Now, school children will not have any to face problem in commuting to school during rainy days. Besides, the villagers will also be able to travel anywhere without any hassles.

This is the fourth time that the servers of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) have “frozen” in as many months. Many devotees rue that every time the monthly quota is released, slow TTD servers make it difficult to book the online quota. TTD, which manages the richest Hindu temple in the world, releases the quota for darshan every month. Sources said that TTD’s websites registered 1.1 lakh concurrent hits immediately after the tickets were released on Tuesday morning and the servers couldn’t manage the rush. P Srikanth Reddy, a devotee from Tirupati who tried to book special entry darshan tickets for his family, old TOI that he kept waiting and refreshing the website for hours on Tuesday, but eventually could not book his tickets. “Many websites have been handling huge traffic. It is surprising that the TTD could not fix the problem even after repeated failure,” he said. Though TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Reddy reviewed the issue with the IT department and tech major TCS, which helps implement various projects under the temple’s digitisation project on a donation basis, the issue could not be resolved. TTD’s IT chief PV Sesha Reddy told TOI that after a similar incident was reported last month, the temple body scaled up its servers and roped in experts from the digitisation project to set right the glitches. “This is not a crash. With 1.1 lakh concurrent hits, which is higher than the concurrent hits last month, our websites froze for a while when the online darshan tickets quota was released”, he said. Sesha Reddy said the temple body consulted the senior management of TCS to help in testing and upgrading the websites to handle a higher number of users. TTD has plans to utilise the services of a third-party consultant for testing all its IT capabilities through a comprehensive audit. Bheema Kumar Atmakuru, head of the digitisation project at TTD, clarified that though the number of servers had been scaled up to 21, the unprecedented queue of 1.1 lakh users within a specific time-frame resulted in the situation. “Various options including increasing the number of servers or migration to cloud technology are also being explored to further enhance the user interface on the TTD websites,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/glitches-in-ttd-site-hold-up-online-darshan-ticket-sales/articleshow/85610526.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Jupiter Hospital is the first health hub responding to the state government’s request to private facilities having over four lakh unused vaccine doses to supply some of their stock to the government sites in lieu of equal number of doses to be returned later. Ajay Thakker, the chairman and managing director, Jupiter Hospital, told TOI, “We decided to lend our vaccine doses to Pune ZP on humanitarian grounds, as they would be vaccinating rural population free of cost.” Pune ZP CEO Ayush Prasad said, “After the MoU is signed with Jupiter Hospital, the stock transferred from Jupiter to Pune ZP will reflect on CoWIN and eVin. The state immunisation officials are helping us do that with help from national digital health authorities.” He said, “The hospital would not be able to provide us with the syringes with the doses. The state will supply us additional syringes,” Prasad said. The transfer would be on the condition that the ZP would return Jupiter 40,000 doses every 15 days from the surplus stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-sites-to-get-vials-from-jupiter/articleshow/85605527.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Dehradun||10 yrs on, no safety arrangements made to prevent drownings in Tehri Reservoir||Dehradun: The government was asked in the assembly on Tuesday why 10 years after the Supreme Court had asked the state to erect fences and tin sheds around the Tehri reservoir, as safety measures to stop people from drowning in it, the job was still not done. Irrigation and PWD minister Satpal Maharaj explained the government was yet to receive a proposal from any gram sabha on how to go about building the fences and once it was received, work would start. He added that steps were already being taken to prevent such mishaps. Members of the Opposition said that the response was underwhelming and the government had clearly not addressed the problem. From 2017 to 2021, a total of 14 people and 10 cattle have drowned in the reservoir. In 2011, on directions of the Supreme Court, the then joint secretary of Union Energy Department convened a meeting and it was decided that tin sheds and fences would be made around the reservoir to safeguard nearby residents. However, 10 years down the line, the project remains a non-starter. Maharaj said, “We have not got a proposal for any gram sabha and on setting up of the fences, which is why the project is pending.” The question was raised by independent MLA Pritam Singh Panwar and a supplementary question was posed by BJP lawmaker Munna Singh Chauhan. “On one hand, the government says 14 people and 10 cattle have died. They agree that fencing and tin sheds have been directed to be built and work has not started for 10 years. Their explanation is that no proposal has been received from the gram sabha on building these fences. My question is did authorities ask the gram sabha for their input in the first place,” Panwar said. Chauhan asked Maharaj what steps the irrigation department had taken to identify black spots and dangerous locations near the reservoir. To this, Maharaj replied he would later get back with the information. Apart from this, BJP MLA Khajan Das asked Maharaj about road widening and construction projects which could not start due to lack of an NOC from the forest department. Maharaj replied that the process to get NOCs for 416 roads was underway. BJP legislator Munna Singh Chauhan said that to get an NOC from the forest department, a state was required to have additional land for compensatory afforestation. He asked the minister in how many cases did the state have land for the afforestation. Maharaj replied that the delay in getting NOCs from the forest department was due to the absence of land bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/10-yrs-on-no-safety-arrangements-made-to-prevent-drownings-in-tehri-reservoir/articleshow/85603126.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Malabar Rebellion, a part of Indian freedom struggle, says CPM acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan||Kozhikode: CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan said on Tuesday that Malabar Rebellion was a part of Indian freedom struggle. Responding to the move by ICHR to remove the names of the leaders of Malabar Rebellion from the Directory of Martyrs of Indian freedom struggle, Vijayaraghavan said in Malappuram that those who are trying to communalise history would be finding the combative spirit of Malabar rebellion upsetting. He also added that the ICHR move was in line with the interests of the present central government. He said that RSS was now endorsing the interpretations of the events provided by Britishers. “There were several resistance movements in the country which shaped the foundations of the national movement. If we repudiate such agitations from the ambit of freedom struggle, it will pose limitations. Malabar Rebellion is part of the freedom movement of the country,” he said. When asked about the remarks by speaker MB Rajesh comparing Malabar Rebellion leader Variyamkunnath Kunhammed Haji with Bhagat Singh, he said that CPM leader AK Gopalan had compared Malabar rebellion to Paris Commune in 1946 and he was jailed by the British for that remark. “It is the people who are having the same mindset who are levelling such criticism,” he added. Vijayaraghavan said that there have been several studies and research on the Malabar Rebellion by historians and scholars from both within the country and outside and all of them had stressed on the anti-British, anti-imperialist and anti-feudal character of the agitation. “Also anyone who has a basic idea of land relations in India would know that it was the Britishers who gave legal sanctity to feudal landlordism and it led to severe exploitation and untoward incidents. Naturally, it would have sparked off agitations against it. Malabar Rebellion was one of the most-organized agitations and also the one which was brutally clamped down by the British,” he added. However, he added that at one stage of the Malabar Rebellion, some communal incidents had taken place. Meanwhile, Muslim Youth League (MYL) and Muslim Students Federation took out public protests in Malappuram against the ICHR move to remove the names of the Malabar rebellion leaders from the list of martyrs of freedom struggle. Also, MYL announced that it would undertake a state-wide protest on Thursday by installing lists of all leaders of the Malabar Rebellion at the unit-level in protest against the ICHR move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/malabar-rebellion-a-part-of-indian-freedom-struggle/articleshow/85608009.cms||---
---||Surat||Passengers, cleaner foil major diamond robbery bid in Gujarat||BHARUCH/SURAT: A group of robbers travelled over 350km to loot diamonds worth crores of rupees. But instead, they found themselves on slippery ground after a few passengers of a private luxury bus resisted their sinister bid, and they were forced to escape with their lives from the spot empty-handed! While three of the robbers posed as passengers, the fourth gang member was trailing the private luxury bus in a car. The group had made elaborate plans to target four angadiya firm employees, who were travelling in the bus, carrying diamonds worth crores of rupees from Bhavnagar to Surat, early on Tuesday morning. According to police, when the bus from Bhavnagar for Surat was about to reach Ankleshwar, the trio sprung into action and one of them asked the driver of the bus, Vajrang, to stop as they wanted to get off. When he stopped, another robber pulled out a gun and pointed it at Vajrang threatening him not to start the bus. Terrified of the gun, Vajrang opened the door and fled outside, while the cleaner, Safi Abdul Raiji, went out of the cabin quickly and locked the door from outside. Stuck inside the cabin, the three robbers started banging on the door to break it open. A couple of passengers swiftly came to the cleaner’s help to ensure that the robbers could not open the door. In the meantime, when no amount of banging opened the door, one robber fired at the glass door twice. One of the passengers, Anil Dangar, who was helping Raiji guard the door, got injured. When Raiji took the injured man to the back seat, the robbers managed to enter the passenger area. However, by then, their fourth accomplice also reached the spot in a car and the trio escaped with him. Later, an ambulance was called to the spot and Dangar was taken to Bharuch Civil Hospital and later shifted to Surat while Raiji lodged a complaint at Ankleshwar Town police station. Police said that an offence of attempt to murder, attempt to commit robbery, wrongful restraint and criminal conspiracy was registered against the four unidentified robbers. “Due to resistance from the passengers as they did not let the robbers enter inside the passenger area and shouted, the robbers realized that they will not succeed and fled. We are searching for them based on the description of the car given by the cleaner of the bus,” said inspector V N Rabari of Ankleshwar town police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/passengers-cleaner-foil-major-diamond-robbery-bid/articleshow/85605600.cms||---

---||India||Asset monetisation plan: Govt set to gift away assets created over 70 years, says Rahul Gandhi||NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Tuesday dubbed the government's "asset monetisation plan" as a deal to gift the crown jewels created over 70 years to select industrialist friends, warning that it will lead to creation of monopolies and hurt the future employment for the youth. He said PM Narendra Modi was working for 2-3 industrialists, and not people of India. Addressing a press conference with P Chidambaram who dubbed the plan a "scandal" and "grand closing down sale", Rahul said Modi used to say that Congress had done nothing in 70 years but the assets being given away to industrialists were created over seven decades using public money. Rahul said the central government destroyed the economy built by the UPA and was now "selling everything" as a last resort, calling it a "tragedy which every patriotic person should oppose". "I want to tell the youth of the country that the government snatched your jobs, did not help you in the pandemic, gave three laws to farmers, and now the PM wants to sell public assets to his friends," he said. The Wayanad MP said strategic areas like railways were being given to private players and warned railway employees about their future. "Everybody knows who will get airports, ports, highways, pipelines...," he said . Chidambaram said the exercise was done without setting any criteria and objectives, and without any consultation with stakeholders like railway unions, port workers, farmers. "No public sector will be left after this," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/asset-monetisation-plan-govt-set-to-gift-away-assets-created-over-70-years-says-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/85611750.cms||---

As many nine locations in Hyderabad, Guntur and Tanuku in Andhra Pradesh were searched. TOI has published series of stories on illegal human hair smuggling in April and June, giving details of how the racket was run. ED is investigating the case with help from customs department and GST officials. Sources in ED said the searches were conducted on Vikas Hair Enterprises, Naresh Women Hair Enterprises, Hrithik Exim at Ishaqu Colony, SS Impex, Shiva Keshav Human Hair, Lakshmi Enterprises and R K Hair Products Limited at Tanuku. Officials found Rs 2 crore unaccounted cash at Naresh Women Hair Enterprises in Hyderabad and are now looking into FEMA violations. Andhra Pradesh MSME Development Corporation chairman Vanka Ravindranath, who runs RK Hair Products, said, “We have filed a complaint on behalf of our association. ED officials visited our company as part of a routine check. There are no violations in our company.” TOI contacted Lalit Grover of Hrithik Exim as well, but he was not available for comment. There are allegations that some companies and individuals are declaring good quality human hair as hair waste or cotton and exporting it to avoid tax. Huge stocks are shipped from Hyderabad air cargo to China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The human hair export market is valued at between Rs 6,000 crore and Rs 8,000 crore annually. A TOI investigation has revealed that Hyderabad has become a hub for raw human hair under-invoicing racket. Smuggling from Hyderabad to Myanmar is taking place through Moreh in Manipur, Aizawl in Mizoram and further into China. Human hair is auctioned from temples, churches and shrines in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Raw hair is also collected from domestic households and saloons which is then smuggled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-searches-on-hair-exporters/articleshow/85610534.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Nagpur||Nilgai, 3 wild boars drown in Asolamendha canal||NAGPUR: The death of six animals, including three wild boars, one nilgai, and two goats, in the swollen Asolamendha irrigation canal at Saoli in Chandrapur district on Monday evening has once again led to demands to expedite wildlife mitigation measures. “The carcasses of some animals were found stuck in the stop gates near Pathri, while a nilgai was floating on the water. It is not known whether more animals died as the flow of water was fast,” said Suraj Bommawar, a local. Saoli RFO Vasant Kamdi confirmed putrefied carcasses of one nilgai and three goats were found floating on the water. “The canal is adjoining Pathri forest and it is difficult to track from where the animals slipped in the canal. I could not trace wild boars. We have already written to construct wildlife underpasses,” said Kamdi. State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe said, “The incident reiterates the need to expedite mitigation measures over the Gosikhurd canals.” Rithe had raised the issue of mitigation measures over canals in Bhandara and Chandrapur districts in the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) meeting on June 7, 2012. Taking note of it, the state government formed a committee on June 23, 2014. “We identified 11 such irrigation projects in Vidarbha where wildlife mitigation steps are needed, but owing to lack of funds the measures were not constructed. In 2018, Rs18 crore was sanctioned for passes on Gosikhurd canals,” said Rithe. The 11 irrigation projects fall in tiger corridors between Umred-Karhandla-Tadoba, Pench-Navegaon-Nagzira, and Navegaon-Brahmapuri-Tadoba. In the first phase, such passes were constructed near Bor Tiger Reserve in Wardha district. However, Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) superintending engineering Ankur Desai told TOI, “Though mitigation measures have been constructed on the right bank canal (RBC) of Gosikhurd, similar steps have not been proposed on Asolamendha canal as it is still under construction.” “Of the 60 wildlife passes suggested by the state-level committee on the right bank canal (RBC) of Gosikhurd, VIDC has completed 43. Work order for 4 passes has been issued and estimates for 8 are being prepared. There is opposition from local villagers to construct wildlife passes at 5 places, where they fear animals might cross over to the village and cause conflict,” said Desai. The Gosikhurd RBC canal mostly passes through dense forest patches. The said canal is an express canal being directly connected to the dam at Paoni. In 2018, the dominant tiger of Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary Jaichand slipped in the main canal due to lack of mitigation steps. Forest officials admit there have been over 200 incidents in the last 5 years where chitals, sambars, gaurs, nilgais, and wild boars have been rescued from the canal. “The incidents of wild animals slipping in canals are frequent. Though we rescue several animals, it is difficult for herbivores to come out due to hooves on each foot,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nilgai-3-wild-boars-drown-in-asolamendha-canal/articleshow/85607961.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

As per the complaint, the incident occurred between June 16 and 23, when the suspects led the complainant into believing he would be awarded a contract by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for the supply of Covid-19 medication. “The complainant had a readymade garments business, but it floundered during the lockdown. He was exploring options when he saw an online advertisement, purportedly issued by the BMC, inviting bids from private contractors for the supply of Covid-19 medication,” senior inspector Anagha Deshpande said on Tuesday. Deshpande said the complainant contacted a phone number mentioned in the advertisement. The suspect put the complainant in touch with two others. “They tempted the complainant by promising to help him secure the contract. One of them shared a GST number and other details and told him to pay charges. He even went to Mumbai and met one suspect,” she said. “When he failed to land the contract and the suspects avoided his phone calls, he realised he was duped,” Deshpande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trio-dupe-garments-trader-of-rs-22-lakh-over-bmc-deal/articleshow/85605680.cms||---

Sleuths of anti-corruption bureau on Tuesday caught the 55-year-old Hitesh Joshi after he had demanded bribe for payment of aid amount received under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna. The trap was laid after the complainant provided information to ACB on 1064 toll free number. Accused was caught at his home while accepting the bribe. Joshi had earlier taken Rs 51,000 from the complainant and continued demand for more money. The complainant, a construction contractor, got work allotted to develop 60 houses under the PMAY project. “The beneficiary receives an aid of around Rs 3 lakh for each house. The contractor got work from the beneficiaries to undertake construction work of the houses,” said an ACB officer, adding that the contractor was directly receiving the money from the sarpanch. At the beginning, Joshi demanded Rs 11,000 which was paid to him by the complainant. But Joshi then demanded Rs 40,000 more, which again the complainant fulfilled. “However, the accused continued to demand for more money after which the complainant approached the ACB,” said an officer, adding that ACB will conduct a search at the residence of the accused for more evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/sarpanch-nabbed-accepting-bribe-for-pmay-aid/articleshow/85605807.cms||---
---||Goa||Selection panel to choose Goa University VC comes under cloud||PANAJI: Eyebrows have been raised in academic circles over the selection criteria adopted for the post of vice-chancellor (VC) of the Goa University, as the selection committee is not in accordance with norms laid out by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The commission’s rules mandate that the selection committee must have one member nominated by it, a criterion that the present panel — which will interview candidates on Wednesday — has not adhered to. The committee constituted by the governor for the selection of Goa University’s VC comprises former NCERT director Jagmohan Singh Rajput who is the chancellor’s nominee, DRDO’s G Satish Reddy who is the state government’s nominee, and CSIR director general Shekhar Mande who is the university’s executive council nominee. A senior government officer, however, said, “The committee formed for the selection of VC is not as per the UGC guidelines.” Defending the constitution of the present selection panel, Goa University registrar Radhika Nayak said, “While a UGC-nominated member is required as per the 7th Pay guidelines, the current committee has been constituted according to an earlier statute that requires only a three-member committee.” She said a fourth member would have been required only if the statute had been amended, but explained that since no amendment has been made yet, the panel still comprises three members. “The Goa statute was amended with regard to most of the provisions of the 7th Pay Commission, except the provision pertaining to the selection committee for a VC. It was proposed to be done nearly three months ago but was kept on hold,” Nayak said. UGC’s regulations of 2018 also provide that selection for the post of VC should be through proper identification by a panel of three to five persons through a public notification, nomination, or a talent search process, or a combination thereof. They further mandate that members of such search-cum-selection committees should be persons of eminence in the sphere of higher education and should not be connected in any manner with the university concerned or its colleges. “The search-cum-selection committee shall give proper weightage to the academic excellence, exposure to higher education systems in the country and abroad, and adequate experience in academic and administrative governance...One member of the search-cum-selection committee shall be nominated by the UGC chairman for selection of VCs of state, private and deemed universities,” the regulations state. As the term of the Goa University VC, Varun Sahni, ended on August 18, the varsity had begun the procedure to identify a new candidate for the post. It has received over 260 applications for the position, possibly the first case of such an overwhelming demand for the vacancy. The GU vice-chancellor holds the position for a term of five years. Of the 260 candidates, 23 have been shortlisted. These have now been invited for a personal interview with the search committee on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/selection-panel-to-choose-varsity-vc-comes-under-cloud/articleshow/85608004.cms||Murari Shetye

Starting Monday, the chopper did six sorties on the first day and ferried nearly 30 people from both sides, and transported essential items in the Niti valley, said Nand Kishore Joshi, disaster management officer, Chamoli. However, Tuesday’s weather wasn’t ideal for flying and the service was halted. The Joshimath-Malari highway is crucial as it connects the China border. A 11kv power line was damaged, cutting off power supply to villages in Niti Valley. District authorities said it might take a couple of days more to open the highway for traffic as hostile weather has been delaying efforts of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). “Till now, of the 500-metre landslide-affected stretch, debris have been cleared from 250 metres. SDRF and NDRF personnel are helping local residents take a detour made along Dhauliganga river,” said Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/malari-highway-blocked-for-10-days-chopper-deployed-to-reach-stranded-residents-of-niti-valley/articleshow/85603171.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Sawant, however, played down his absence and said that he would join later. Parsekar organised a separate function during the CM’s visit, adding that people attended the function without accepting money. Sawant said that when the schedule was prepared, there was no mention of meeting Parsekar. Both Sopte and Parsekar, in the race for the party ticket for the 2022 assembly polls, tried to show the CM their strength, and are working in the constituency. Parsekar’s supporters and BJP karyakartas demanded that the former CM be given the party ticket. “It is good to see that you have raised the issue of party organisation in Mandrem,” Sawant said, reacting to Parsekar’s supporters’ demands. “BJP president should have listened to those grievances. Decision is not taken in the state, but in Delhi. Whatever grievances are raised, they should be placed before the state and central leadership.” Parsekar said that the chief minister called him at 11pm on Monday to inform him about his constituency visit. Parsekar said that rumours are being spread that if he becomes MLA, it may be problem for Sawant to become the next CM, “but there is no difference between us”. Sawant inaugurated a cycle track and some beautification projects in the constituency, and Parsekar urged him to open a hospital in Mandrem, for which the building is ready. “What is the reason the hospital is not open? Who is taking revenge? Why is the Tuem electronic city not functioning for four years? I am raising these issues to bring them to the notice of the CM,” Parsekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cms-mandrem-visit-brings-out-rift-in-party-cadre-there/articleshow/85608022.cms||---

Around 4.5 lakh students are supposed to attend the exams. The model test for Plus One is scheduled from Aug 31 to September 4. This means that all 4.5 lakh students will have to collect examination hall tickets from their schools on a single day–September 5. This would trigger the spread of Covid-19, KPSTA said. KPSTA pointed out that education minister V Sivankutty’s promise that students would get enough opportunity for clearing their doubts after the model test won’t work as there is only a day’s gap between model tests and terminal exams. Also, the first allotment for Plus One admission is fixed on Sept 13. Owing to the terminal exam, service of teachers won’t be available for admission procedure work in office, it added. Since there are complaints about the quality of education imparted online, the government should conduct Plus One exams after ensuring at least two months offline class, said KPSTA president M Salahudhin and general secretary C Pradeep. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kpsta-wants-govt-to-defer-plus-one-exams/articleshow/85608044.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Hry Assembly passes 5 Bills on concluding day of Monsoon session||Chandigarh: Amidst heavy debate among the members and leaders of opposition and treasury benches led by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar over presentation and passing of bills, Haryana assembly on Tuesday improved upon the time spent on legislative business during the concluding sitting of the monsoon session of the state Assembly here. According to the information, it took more than two hours and 25 minutes for Speaker Gian Chand Gupta to complete the process of presentation, discussion and passing of the bills. Notably on Monday all five bills were passed in 22 minutes. Largely it were Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Rehabilitation and Resettlement for Land Acquisition (amendment) Bill; Haryana Parivar Pehchan Patra Bill; and Haryana Public Examination ((prevention of unfair means) Bill where both opposition as well alliance and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu had an active participation. While the other two bills namely, Haryana Appropriation Bill 2021 and Panchkula Metropolitan Development Authority Bill were passed within gap of 10 minutes. Tempers ran high and heated debate among opposition MLAs Kiran Choudhary, Jagbir Malik, B B Batra, Aftab Ahmed and their leader Bhupinder Hooda and CM Manohar Lal Khattar, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, JJP MLA Ram Kumar Gautam and BJP MLA Dr Abhay Singh Yadav ensued during the discussion on bill related to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Rehabilitation and Resettlement Amendment Bill. The Congress MLAs said the bill was targeted to ruin farmers and the poor and it would not be surprising if this bills would emerge as fourth anti-farmer, anti-tenant bill. Kiran Choudhary said this bill would take away ownership rights of the land owner and would empower the agencies involved acquisition to complete process overnight while Malik, Batra and Hooda raised question over the object related to acquisition of land for projects under PPP mode. On the defensive mode, Dushyant Chautala elaborated upon the welfare works done by government by acquiring the land through portal and developments carried out therein. At the same time he talked about acquisition done by the NHAI for construction of roads. Haryana Pehchan Patra Bill that was passed with voice note, too, attracted heavy discussion. Kiran Choudhary was the first to start the discussion and had expressed apprehension about data theft of families. She questioned CM Khattar to elaborate upon the action in case of incident of data theft and the urgency that forced government to bring the bill. She elaborated as to how the families were forced to get registered as they were not able to get their properties registered. Khattar who took 20 minutes to explain that the Bill was targeted to identify the real beneficiaries of government schemes. He added that taking the scope of PPP wider it would be linked with property details as well. “The rich and those above middle class don’t require government schemes. We are targeting to identify the poor who are the real beneficiaries. Hence, the bill. Moreover, we are not forcing anybody,’’ said Khattar. At the same time during discussion on Haryana Public Examination (prevention of unfair means) Congress MLAs Geeta Bhukkal, Jagbir Malik, B B Batra and Bhupinder Hooda raised the issue of inclusion of universities and commission under its ambit. All of them alleged that this will dilute the independence of universities. Hooda and MLAs welcomed the bill, but suggested a few changes. Khattar, however, made it clear that this bill was targeted to punish those involved in unfair practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-assembly-passes-5-bills-on-concluding-day-of-monsoon-session/articleshow/85608038.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Ranchi||Most students in rural areas of Jharkhand lack access to online education: Survey||RANCHI: A survey on primary education carried out by a non-governmental organisation, Gyan Vigyan Samiti (GVS), in rural parts of Jharkhand has revealed that a vast majority of students have not been able to access online classes during the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey found that there has been a general decline in the learning level of students as well. The outfit will soon submit its report to the state government along with its recommendations. Releasing the report, the national general secretary of GVS, Dr Kasi Nath Chatterjee, batted for the reopening of schools with necessary precautions. Chatterjee said, “The GVS members conducted a survey among students and parents in 17 districts. The survey revealed that 93.6% students belonging to the weaker sections of society do not have their own mobile phone. Only 5.3 % of them are actually studying online while others have to depend on different modes like videos.” According to the report, among the students attending online classes, only 12.8% said that they could understand the subjects properly. A large majority of students are detached from their studies and they have also forgotten the knowledge they had acquired earlier. The report said that the learning level has fallen considerably among the students, adding that if they were promoted for the second time in a row without examination, then several students would likely drop out of the classes. The GVS survey further stated that 93.1% people said that the standard of education has declined in the state while 92% said that schools should be reopened with proper precautionary measures. It said that renovation of school buildings, vaccination of teachers and supply of masks and sanitizers were essential for restarting schools. It added house-to house survey must be carried out to ensure that children go to school after the reopening. The survey was carried out in 877 villages under 620 panchayats in 17 districts among farmers, daily workers, small traders, contract labourers and permanent employees. The districts surveyed were Giridih, Palamu, Dhanbad, Koderma, Khunti, Bokaro, Latehar, Garhwa, Godda, Dumka, Jamtara, East Singhbhum, Sahibganj, Ramgarh, Lohardaga, Ranchi and Pakur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/most-students-in-rural-areas-lack-access-to-online-education-survey/articleshow/85607938.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Dhirabhai Damor, who is posted in SRP group 18 at Kevadia, registered an offence against the unknown cheaters at Kevadia police station.  According to police, Damor’s grandnephew Tirthraj came to Kevadia on Sunday and expressed his wish to see the SoU. Damor gave him his mobile phone and asked him to book tickets online. Tirthraj opened YouTube and searched for SoU payment following which some advertisements appeared. He clicked on one of them and then called up the phone number mentioned in the advertisement.  The phone numbers were of West Bengal and the person on the other end was talking in Hindi. “The person asked Tirthraj to download Any Desk app and then asked for the app code. He then asked the victim to start a new account on Phone Pe. He asked for the name of tourists, SBI card number, validity date of the card and CVV,” the police said.  He also asked for the OTP and within minutes, Rs 1.58 lakh were withdrawn from Damor’s account. When Damor got sms, he learnt that he has been duped. When he tried to call the phone numbers mentioned in the advertisement, both were switched off.  Tirthraj again searched for SoU payment on YouTube and got new phone numbers. When he called on one of the numbers, the person on the other end said that they had debited Rs 1.58 lakh by mistake and wanted to deposit it back in Damor’s account. Damor again gave the debit card number and details of his other bank account and this time he lost Rs 1.47 lakh. “We are trying to track down the fraudsters with the help of the mobile numbers and the bank accounts in which the money was transferred,” said Vani Dudhat, deputy superintendent, Kevadia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/trying-to-book-sou-ticket-srp-constable-loses-rs-3l-in-online-fraud/articleshow/85604771.cms||---

Incidentally, CD Girls High School, which is exclusive for Class IX and X students, is located at Jhmiri Telaiya area in the constituency of local MP and Union minister of state for education, Annapurna Devi. In the past, former MLA Neera Yadav from the constituency was the state education minister. The school’s principal-in-charge, Krishna Kumari, said, “The school has produced meritorious students who are well placed in various fields today but we are battling manpower crunch. We have already informed the higher authorities of our problems.” Sanya Praveen, a Class X student, said, “Due to the shortage of teachers, we are called to school only three days a week. For the remaining three days, we are asked to study at home.” Praveen added that she aspires to become a doctor but she has to struggle in biology as there is no biology teacher in the school. Another Class X student, Renu Kumari, said, “There is a science practical lab in our school but I've never been to it as there are no faculty members. I don’t even know how a practical class is conducted.” Other students said they don't get their turn in computer classes because of the inadequate number of computers and instructors. DC Aditya Ranjan, however, said CD Girls’ High School is on the list of model schools in the district and the administration is planning to appoint an adequate number of teachers as per the rules. “The district administration is working out plans to sort out the gaps at the earliest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/only-six-teachers-for-1400-students-in-govt-run-koderma-school-for-girls/articleshow/85607900.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Centre’s asset monetization plan a grave concern: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha||RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), one of the constituents of the incumbent mahagathbandhan government in Jharkhand, on Tuesday expressed grave concerns over Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement of the Centre’s asset monetization plan of Rs 6 lakh crore by 2024-25 FY. “It has become crystal clear that every asset owned by the nation will be sold to corporate groups. Do not become surprised if Jharkhand becomes ‘Adani’khand overnight,” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said on Tuesday. Bhattacharya said: “The Centre’s announcement implies that everything that is owned by the nation will be sold to the corporate houses. Airports, railways, stadiums, public sector units and every asset owned by the country will be up for grabs. It is being done under the watch of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who while addressing an election rally after the Pulwama terror attack (in 2019) had claimed: ‘Desh Nahi Bechne Dunga’”. Bhattacharya also claimed that on Monday, Odisha police intercepted JMM’s Odisha chief Anjali Soren and her associates while she was on her way to Rajgangpur in Sundergarh district. Anjali, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren’s elder sister, was headed to Rajgangpur to speak to the tribal families that are about to be displaced due to the upcoming projects of Jindal Group. “The incumbent BJD government is behaving exactly like the BJP government at the Centre. But we will not abandon the movement,” Bhattacharya added. “Now, senior leaders of the party will join the movement. Party vice-president Champai Soren will visit Rajgangpur soon and if need be, party president Shibu Soren and working president Hemant Soren will also lend their voices to the movement,” Bhattacharya claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/centres-asset-monetization-plan-a-grave-concern-jmm/articleshow/85607776.cms||---

---||Delhi||Sending legal notice does not amount to abetting suicide, says Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Sending a legal notice and filing a criminal complaint does not amount to offence of abetment to suicide in spite of the presence of a suicide note, Delhi high court has observed. “Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing,” explained Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri. The court’s ruling came in a case where a seller had committed suicide after receiving a legal notice and facing a criminal complaint from a buyer for an alleged non-delivery of a product. “The deceased had felt harassed but, in these facts, the act of petitioner (buyer) could not be held to have abetted the deceased in committing suicide. The filing of a criminal complaint by the petitioner was his legal recourse, as advised to him,” the judge said in August 23 order. The court noted that the act of suicide didn’t have any “live link” or proximity with acts of the buyer who filed a plea before high court for setting aside a trial court order refusing to accept police's closure report in the case. The court noted that as per the call data record, it was the deceased who had called the buyer twice during the relevant time duration and the only call received by the deceased was from the police station with regards the criminal complaint which was yet to be registered as an FIR. In the case, the buyer, a US resident, entered into a transaction with the deceased for purchasing an antique vintage motorcycle. As per the buyer, in spite of complete payment, the deceased did not handover the possession of the vintage motorcycle for two years, following which the petitioner came to India and sent a legal notice and filed a criminal complaint with the police for cheating and other offences. After the buyer left the country, the seller committed suicide and left behind a suicide note naming him as the reason for taking the extreme step. An FIR under Section 306 IPC was subsequently filed by the police on the deceased's wife’s complaint, it was stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sending-legal-notice-does-not-amount-to-abetting-suicide-says-delhi-high-court/articleshow/85611754.cms||---

The gathering, which included AICC general secretary in-charge organisation K C Venugopal and state in-charge P L Punia, met in the wake of Singh Deo's strong push to be made the CM by replacing Baghel. However, Punia told reporters that the issue of leadership change was not discussed. All the leaders said they will abide by the decision of the leadership with indications that there may not be a change of guard yet. Congress functionaries said the three-hour discussion turned out to be a feedback session on governance and airing of grievances by the two senior members of the Chhattisgarh government, while discounting the possibility of Baghel being replaced. Deo claims the leadership had agreed to a split the term between him and Baghel and the CM's post should come to him after the completion of half of the government tenure recently. However, Congress leaders as well as Baghel have repeatedly denied any such arrangement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-meets-chhattisgarh-cm-minister-amid-leadership-tussle/articleshow/85611821.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rape case: UP woman who immolated self outside Supreme Court dies after 8 days||NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: The woman who had set herself on fire outside the Supreme Court last week, along with her male friend, died of her burn injuries on Tuesday. She was undergoing treatment at RML Hospital after suffering 65% burns. The male friend had died of burn injuries early on Saturday. The woman, who had accused a BSP MP of rape, had been battling for life for the past eight days and was on ventilator support. Her condition deteriorated on Tuesday morning and she was declared dead around 11am. Her body was handed over to her family and the last rites were performed at Nigambodh Ghat. The woman'’s father had died many years ago and she has a brother, who studies in Class X. The man who died earlier was her senior in college and a former associate of BSP MP Atul Rai. The two, who were in their mid-20s, had set themselves on fire outside the Supreme Court on August 16 after pouring kerosene on themselves. The police had rushed them to the hospital with 65-70% burns. They were declared unfit for making any statement. The woman belonged to Ballia and the man to Ghazipur, both in UP.  They had accused UP police officials, politicians and judges of driving them to take the extreme step. They had done a Facebook live of over 10 minutes, just before the incident, in which the woman had accused Rai, MP from Ghosi, who is lodged in Naini jail, of harassing her and the man by implicating them in a false case after she had filed a case against Rai for allegedly raping her. The woman had filed the case in May 2019, alleging that the incident took place on March 7, 2018, at his apartment and Rai had recorded a video which he threatened to circulate on social media. Following this, Rai’s brother, Pawan Kumar, had lodged a complaint in November 2020 with the Cantonment police station of Varanasi, accusing the woman of having forged her date of birth in documents attached to her rape complaint. A non-bailable warrant was issued against the woman and her companion in this case by a Varanasi court in the first week of August. The complainant had also filed one more case against the jailed MP and his companion, Sudhir Singh, with the Lanka police in December 2020, accusing the two of defaming her through propaganda on social media. “The possibility of conviction of the accused in the rape case following the death of the complainant and also the prime witness has increased as both had given evidence before the MP-MLA court,” district government counsel (criminal) Prayagraj, Gulab Chandra Agrahari, told TOI on Tuesday. A senior cop, who is monitoring the prosecution in this case, said: “The statement of other witnesses has already been recorded before the MP-MLA court. Now, the recording of the statement of the accused is due.” The self-immolation bid had resulted in former Varanasi SSP Amit Pathak being attached to the DGP headquarters by the state home department. The Varanasi Cantonment police station in-charge, inspector Rakesh Singh, and sub-inspector Girija Shanker Yadav were suspended and the state government formed a special investigation team to probe the incident. Former circle officer Bhelupur Amaresh Singh Baghel had been suspended by the state government on December 30, 2020, for laxity in investigating the rape case after parts of his investigation report had leaked, showing the BSP MP as victim of a conspiracy hatched by a jailed gangster. Rai, who had filed his nomination as a BSP candidate from the Ghosi parliamentary seat, won the elections as an absconder and later surrendered before a court on June 22, 2019. He has been in jail since then. The police have filed a chargesheet against Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-woman-who-immolated-self-outside-the-supreme-court-dies-after-eight-days/articleshow/85611818.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Goa||Goa: Second wave plateaus, yet to touch low of first one, say experts||PANAJI: Goa got a five-month breather when the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic receded post-September 2020. The daily case count remained below 100 on most days in January and dropped to less than 50 in February till mid-March.  When contrasted with the more fatal second wave, however, the state’s Covid-19 graph is yet to touch the low it saw during the first wave of the pandemic. This is despite the fact that the caseload plummeted in June-July after the rapid spread of the virus wreaked havoc in May. The daily cases average is presently hovering around 85 since the beginning of August, a slight dip from the 100-odd fresh infections recorded every day in July. But although the graph appears to have plateaued, it is unclear whether it will drop further or move upward. Experts opine that the daily cases haven’t gone below 50 as the second Covid-19 wave was triggered by the lethal and infectious Delta strain. “The virus evident during the first wave was not as transmittable as seen in the second wave. Although cases have now reduced, they are not as low as what we saw during the first phase of the pandemic,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI. Consultant pathologist Dr Eugene D’Souza said the Delta variant also has an immune escape, leading to reinfections and infections in vaccinated individuals. It will be difficult to predict what turn the pandemic will take, said Betodkar while adding that it was possible that the existing pattern would continue. “The cases may not touch zero and we may remain on a plateau for a while,” he said. Predictions that the third wave may become evident in August-September was based on the trend that has been observed in H1N1 spikes during the month of September, Betodkar said. D’Souza said that since most infections in the community are due to variants of concern (VOC), Covid-appropriate behaviour can’t be skipped and vaccination should continue till the target population is covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/second-wave-plateaus-yet-to-touch-low-of-first-one-experts/articleshow/85606260.cms||---

---||India||Explain Punjab netas' J&K, Pakistan remarks: Nadda to Congress||NEW DELHI: BJP president JP Nadda and other party functionaries on Tuesday asked the Congress leadership to explain their stand on remarks made by their Punjab leaders about Kashmir and Pakistan which, the party said, reflected the opposition outfit's divisive and 'anti-India' approach. In a series of tweets, Nadda said silence on the matter will be seen as "implicit support" to such objectionable remarks. "Recent comments by Punjab Congress leaders, who enjoy the patronage of the topmost state leadership as well as the high command in Delhi, are reprehensible. They are repeatedly making irresponsible statements that have grave implications on national security," the BJP chief said. Comments by two advisors of Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu have stoked a controversy. Malvinder Singh Mali had claimed that, "Kashmir is a country of Kashmiris" while another advisor, Pyare Lal Garg, had taken a swipe at Punjab CM Amarinder Singh for criticising Pakistan, alleging it is not in Punjab's interest. Later, party spokesperson Sambit Patra said such remarks could not have been made by the Congress leaders without the approval of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. "The remarks made by advisors of the Punjab Congress chief clearly show that the party has a divisive and anti-India approach towards Kashmir," Patra said. Taking on Congress over Garg's remark that Pakistan should not be criticised, Patra said that "these people earn their livelihood in India but sing Pakistan's tune". Patra asked why Sidhu, who hugged the Pakistan Army Chief, had been made Congress' Punjab unit chief and "on whose behest". "Sidhu claims that he follows the directions of Rahul Gandhi. Now Rahul should explain whether he considers J&K as part of India," Patra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/explain-punjab-netas-jk-pakistan-remarks-nadda-to-congress/articleshow/85611853.cms||---

The court found that there was no situation of “disaster”. “According to us, the provisions of the Disaster Management Act cannot be invoked to deal with civil disputes involving two sets of persons or civil disputes involving a citizen and the government by elevating such disputes to the status of a disaster,” the division bench comprising chief justice of the Bombay high court Dipankar Datta and Justice Mahesh Sonak stated. The order dated May 13, 2020, has directed the executive engineer, works division-II, PWD, Panaji “to undertake the work of repair and reconstruction of the said road with immediate effect”. The court found the collector’s affidavit “as sketchy as the impugned order”. It held that the dispute between the petitioner and residents of the locality in Bainguinim on the issue of access “cannot be elevated to the status of disaster as defined under Section 2(d) of the Disaster Management Act”. The respondents had complained about alleged blockage of their access and stated that, if not cleared, it would affect over 1,000 school children, teachers and staff. They also said that water tankers, ambulances and fire tenders would also face difficulty if the access is not restored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-quashes-order-for-road-widening-under-disaster-act/articleshow/85606523.cms||---

The driver from Devgadh Baria has made a video that has gone viral among colleagues and others. Gulabsinh Chauhan (48) drives the bus from Baria to nearby villages. But on weekends, he drives a bus to Pavagadh to take care of the rush there. The video that is becoming popular was shot at Pavagadh on one of his trips there and went viral recently. In the video, Chauhan can be seen singing ‘Upar aabh ne niche dharti, aa ST maari sam sam sam sarakti.’The song that has been composed by Chauhan himself promotes state transport buses as a safe mode of transport. It also asks people to visit Pavagadh in the service. Chauhan said that he has been writing poems on various topics. “I write about people, relatives and mothers and many other aspects,” he said. But this particular song came to his mind in wake of the dangerous manner in which people travel in private transport. “One can see people hanging out of such vehicles and drivers driving the vehicles dangerously. ST buses are a safe and cheap mode of travel and the song tries to promote this,” said Chauhan. Chauhan said that the people have liked the song. “It was recorded some time back, but went viral only recently,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gsrtc-bus-driver-on-a-song-promotes-safe-st-with-video/articleshow/85604999.cms||Sachin Sharma

---||Gurgaon||Nine-year-old, parents among 4 hacked to death in Gurugram house||GURUGRAM: Armed with a sickle that wasn’t an unfamiliar tool in his hands — as avid planter and pruner, he was “tree man” to the neighbourhood — a 65-year-old property dealer allegedly went on a killing spree in his Rajendra Park house in Tuesday’s early hours, hacking to death his daughter-in-law, and a couple and their nine-year-old daughter who lived as tenants on the second floor. The lone survivor in the tenant’s house was a three year-old, their younger daughter, who is being treated at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital for lacerations on her neck and arms. The murders, which are believed to have taken place between 3.30am and 4am, were discovered in the morning when the suspect, Rao Rai Singh, walked to the local police station 500 metres away and surrendered around 7am. He had taken the murder weapon with him, which he handed over to the cops. There were two others in Singh’s house at the time of the murders — his wife and their eight-year-old granddaughter. Singh’s son Anand Yadav, a practising lawyer at the Gurugram district court, is believed to have been in Rajasthan, on a trip to Khatu. The populated neighbourhood, with kothis next to each other and familiar faces in most of them, slept through the frenzy of violence. There are tenants in the ground floor of Singh’s house as well, but they are currently away. The Singhs live on the first floor. Singh had served in the Army as a naib subedar, police said. The murdered tenants — Krishan Tiwari and his wife Anamika — had only moved in four months ago from another Gurugram neighbourhood and allegedly had an ongoing dispute with Singh over their rent agreement, according to a relative of the Tiwaris. Police said they were looking at other aspects to find the murder motive. Prima facie, according to investigations, Singh’s daughter-in-law Sunita Yadav (32) was the first to be murdered. The broken latches on the door of the tenant’s house showed the killer had entered by force. Police teams that first reached the spot found a macabre crime scene — Krishan lay in a pool of blood on the floor while Anamika and the two children were on the bed. All four had bled heavily. Sunita’s body was found in her room on the first floor. "There were multiple injury marks on the upper body of the victims. It seems the suspect swung the sickle freely and attacked whoever came in the way," said ACP Rajeev Yadav, adding the injuries suggested the victims had met a painful death. "We are still trying to find the motive," said the ACP. Sunita’s brother Ashok Kumar alleged she was harassed and subjected to physical assault for dowry. "They kept demanding something or the other and tortured her," Kumar claimed. Krishan’s brother-in-law Ashwani Mishra, who works with a private company in Delhi, was the first from his family to reach the spot after getting a call from police. "Last we met was on Rakhi when Krishan, my sister and the kids visited our house in Delhi. He had told us about a dispute over the rent agreement with his landlord," said Mishra. He said Krishan had prepared the rent agreement and asked Anamika to get it signed by Singh. Anamika had apparently given the document to Sunita, who got Singh’s signature and returned it to Anamika. But after a few days, according to Mishra, Singh had some doubts about the document on which Sunita had taken his signature and had asked Krishan to show it to him again. Krishan had, however, misplaced the rent agreement, Mishra said. Krishan, who was from Siwan in Bihar, had moved to Gurugram 10 years ago. He worked with the sales team of a private bank but lost his job during the lockdown. A relative of Sunita said she and Anand got married around 12 years ago. "Sunita was working as a nurse with a city hospital, which she quit earlier this year. She was at her parents’ place in Mahendergarh for the past six months and had returned to Rajendra Park a week ago," said the relative. Based on Mishra’s complaint, a case was registered under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and sections of Arms Act at Rajendra Park police station. DCP (west) Deepak Saharan said the probe was focusing on forensic and technical evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/nine-year-old-parents-among-4-hacked-to-death-in-gurugram-house/articleshow/85611886.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Delhi||18-year-old shot dead by two for delay in order at southwest Delhi eatery||NEW DELHI: An 18-year-old man was shot by two unidentified men at a restaurant he worked in on Monday night. The deceased, Aman alias Ghulam Sabir, was a resident of a JJ colony in Bawana. Prima facie, it appears that Aman might have been murdered because of the delay in giving the takeaway order to the culprits. However, police are probing other angles, including personal enmity. They have registered an FIR and formed multiple teams to arrest the shooters. The PCR received a call around 7.14pm about two bikers shooting a man at Heaven on Earth restaurant in southwest Delhi’s Chhawla. The investigating officer rushed to the spot with his team and questioned the restaurant owner, Vikas Yadav, and the other staff. The team found that Mahesh (19) worked as the regular waiter at the restaurant and had taken a day off for his birthday. He had requested Aman to fill in for him. Around 7pm, two men on a bike arrived at the restaurant and ordered chilli potato and momos. The order took around 10 minutes to arrive during which it was alleged that an argument broke out between Aman and the bikers, following which one of the bikers whipped out a pistol and shot Aman. The gunshot created panic at the restaurant and people ran for cover even as the bikers fled. Aman was rushed to a nearby RTRM hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Police have obtained CCTV footage from the cameras around the crime scene and are conducting raids to nab the accused. The bike’s registration plate was captured in one of the cameras, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/18-year-old-shot-by-2-for-delay-in-order-at-sw-delhi-eatery/articleshow/85607037.cms||---

None in the group of 30 has yet leaked a word about who they want as his replacement. Besides Bajwa, the names rebelling against Amarinder include jails and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, technical education and industrial training minister Charanjit Singh Channi, revenue minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and MLA Pargat Singh. Since all these disgruntled ministers had come out in support of Sidhu before he became the PCC chief, they fear being dropped from the cabinet during the impending reshuffle. Congress has 80 MLAs in the 117-seat Punjab assembly. One cabinet berth has been vacant since Sidhu, long at loggerheads with Amarinder, resigned in July 2019 after being stripped him of the key local bodies department portfolio. For his part, Sidhu has been regularly highlighting the 18-point to-do list that the Congress high command handed CM Amarinder in July. Rebel minister Bajwa said he and his colleagues would first try to "wake up" the Congress high command. "If the high command does not listen to us, we will decide the next course of action," he said. On who could be the alternative to Amarinder, he said it was the high command's prerogative to pick a new CM. His colleague Channi said, "We are not getting solutions to our problems from this chief minister." Questioning Amarinder's ability to lead the government, Randhawa, who was once very close to the CM, said, "Wars cannot be fought by sitting in a drawing room or just by tweeting. Wars are fought on the ground. Day by day, SAD and AAP are attacking Congress on the Bargari sacrilege issue. People ask us about the cancellation of the power purchase agreements and other unfulfilled promises."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/five-member-team-representing-rebel-camp-to-seek-captain-amarinders-removal/articleshow/85611908.cms||---
---||Business||Packaged, health foods get e-comm push||Kolkata: There has been a renewed interest in packaged food items and immunity booster products because of increasing urbanisation and the convenience of ordering on e-commerce platforms. As a result, new vistas of opportunities have opened up for the industry compared to sectors like hospitality, travel & tourism, garments, and textiles, which are struggling to recover from the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic, said Subrata Gupta, state food processing and horticulture secretary. Addressing a session on developments and opportunities in food processing and the horticulture organized by industry body MCCI, Gupta stated that although West Bengal has immense potential to have a well developed food processing industry because of abundance of raw materials and the presence of six agro-climatic zones, yet it is severely restricted due to scattered markets. “In west Bengal, 2.8% of the cultivation is processed, while the national average is about 2.2%. However, in the process, the farmers suffer a loss of 27% because markets are often scattered. Most of these farmers are small farmers, who practise subsistence farming and therefore have little left for the market,” he added. In order to improve the durability and shelf life of harvests, the government has set up low-cost cold onion storages. “We have also planned to set up a centralized common facility with the presence of a centralized cold room along with five-six small food processing units with where people can access the local producers and get the materials for processing. We are hopeful that the approval will come by October, following which, we will be able to set up these units by next year,” he said. Additionally, the government is willing to tie up with private entities to set up packaging units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/packaged-health-foods-get-e-comm-push/articleshow/85607017.cms||---

---||India||Gupkar revives demand for J&K special status||SRINAGAR: The People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) revived its demand for restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K in a resolution it adopted on Tuesday, which also highlighted that "deep uncertainty" and a "big political void" have been created after the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A in 2019. At a meeting held at PAGD chairman and National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah's residence in Srinagar, the alliance members said full statehood of J&K as it existed prior to August 5, 2019, "must be restored". This assumes significance as none of the leaders of the five parties that constitute the Gupkar alliance, barring ex- J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti, had raised the issue of restoration of Articles 370 and 35A at the all-party meeting with PM Narendra Modi on July 24. All the alliance's constituents adopted the resolution, which among other issues, highlighted that "nothing substantial" has emerged after the PM meeting with J&K leaders. "No confidence-building measures have been taken to provide some relief to the distressed people of the region," the resolution said. "It's unfortunate that the judicial challenges against this abrogation as a violation of the Constitution continue to remain pending before the SC even after two years," it said. "All political prisoners must be released immediately. Indiscriminate use of draconian laws must be put to an end," the alliance said. PAGD members said the people of the UT are being humiliated, which must be stopped as its consequences can be dangerous for nation. "We have decided not to be mute spectators to the humiliation being faced by people of Jammu & Kashmir," they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gupkar-revives-demand-for-jk-special-status/articleshow/85611946.cms||M Saleem Pandit
