Closer home, in Mysuru, a group of Afghani students are distraught about the situation in their country and fear for their loved ones. Their futures look bleak as they are unsure about returning home after completing their education. “My parents are living anxiously. They are asking me to stay safe and concentrate on my studies. The leaders of the Taliban have said that human rights will be restored under the purview of Islamic law, which is the only glimmer of hope to restore peace in my country," says Halima Akbari, a student. Another student, Ali Seena Sarabi, who is studying in Mysuru for a year now, is yet to come to terms with losing his uncle in the violence. “I am not able to speak to my family members who are struggling to save their lives due to the sudden change in the political scenario.” Globally, one of the biggest concerns now, is the safety of women in Afghanistan under the new rule. A petrified Ali Sina Raisi says, “An incident of a woman being killed for stepping outside without being accompanied by a man has already been reported. We don’t know whether the Taliban will allow women to go to school, offices and college anymore.” For Amanullah Dadgar, it is hard to put in words the precarious situation back home. "We have seen what happened when the Taliban was in power between 1996 to 2001. There was no freedom of speech and expression and many civilians were killed for not following Taliban rules which resulted in complete anarchy.” Students seek visa extensionAs they come to terms with the situation back home, many students are seeking a visa extension until normalcy returns in their country. Halima Akbari says, “My visa has expired which has put me in a dilemma. We met the University of Mysore vice chancellor Hemanth Kumar recently. He has assured that he will speak to the Ministry of External Affairs to solve the issue. One I get a visa extension I will stay here for a few more months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/students-from-afghanistan-in-karnataka-face-a-bleak-future-as-crisis-unfolds-back-home/articleshow/85454029.cms||Vinay Lokesh
---||World||Three dead, four missing in Malaysian floods||KUALA LUMPUR: Three people were killed and four others are missing after floodwaters swept down a mountain in northern Malaysia and surged through villages, authorities said Thursday. Water packed with mud, rocks and logs hit settlements close to Mount Jerai on Wednesday, leaving streets and houses swamped and washing away cars. Properties in the two affected districts suffered severe damage while some people were left trapped inside their houses, emergency workers said. "I grew up in this village and this is the first time I've seen such an incident," one local resident, Salwa Mohamad Isa, told state news agency Bernama. "Bridges and roads collapsed, cars washed away and people dying." Forty people have been evacuated from their homes to community centres, and the search and rescue operation is continuing. Local NGOs said clearing of forests and mining in the environmentally sensitive area could have played a role. "All these destructive activities in this fragile ecosystem have to be stopped urgently," they said in a statement. But a senior official has denied that logging caused the floods, instead blaming the intensity of the downpours. Flash floods are common in tropical Malaysia. But scientists say climate change increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall, because a warmer atmosphere holds more water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/three-dead-four-missing-in-malaysian-floods/articleshow/85468465.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata relives the big screen experience||It was a morning filled with hope for single-screen theatre owners and multiplex managements in the city, as two brand new releases – BellBottom and Mukhosh – hit the screens. And the footfall, especially in the morning shows, fuelled the hope even further. “The 10 am show of BellBottom had footfall of around 20%. It was way better than the footfall post reopening last year. Back then we had to cancel shows due to a lack of audience,” said Satadeep Saha from a theatre in Behala. Even CT observed a similar scene at a south Kolkata multiplex. Speaking to us, Amitava Guha Thakurta, regional director of the multiplex chain, said, “We hope that the momentum built by BellBottom will help us overcome the dark phase. Even the Bengali releases should draw audiences.” Navin Choukhani of a south Kolkata single screen said the initials for both releases are satisfactory. “We are hopeful that business will go up this weekend,” he added. To this Arijit Dutta of another prominent theatre said, “I feel vaccination has made a huge difference this time.” Anusuya Roy, who had come with her mother to catch the 11.15 am show of the Akshay Kumar-starrer at the multiplex, said, “It feels really nice to watch a film on the big screen after so long. It has been a really long gap.” We also caught Suruchi Khandelwal queuing up at the ticket counter of the multiplex. “We’re here to watch BellBottom. While we’re yet to experience sitting in the hall, it really feels nice to be back in a movie theatre after what seems like ages,” she told us. In the afternoon, we spotted a good crowd braving the rains to attend the premiere show of the other Bengali release this weekend, Binisutoy: Without Strings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-relives-the-big-screen-experience/articleshow/85459490.cms||Ruman Ganguly

The state currently has six detention centres in as many central jails with 177 inmates. A standalone detention centre, with a capacity to house 3,000 foreigners, is under construction at Matia in Goalpara district, around 150 km from here. A notification, signed by Niraj Verma, principal secretary of Assam’s home and political department, on August 17, stated that “the nomenclature of a detention centre is changed to ‘Transit Camp’ for detention purpose” in partial modification of an earlier notification dated June 17, 2009. When contacted, Verma told TOI that, “The government will shift the detainees to the Matia centre once it is ready. It will be like a transit camp where the detainees will wait for the outcome. Either they will be deported to the country of origin or as per the Supreme Court order, if they complete two years in detention they will be released.” Another senior home department official, who doesn't want to be named, told TOI that the name has been changed so that the negative connotation is ‘neutralised to a certain extent’. “The inmates in the detention centres are not criminals as such. They deserve a human condition. The phrase detention centre appears like a negative connotation. The Assam chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, basically wants to humanise the whole thing,” the senior official said. Detention camps in Assam are housed within district jails but the detainees are kept separately from other inmates. The first detention centre was set up in 2009 during the Congress government, prodded by a high court order in a case dealing with ‘illegal foreigners’. Government data revealed 29 declared foreigners died during their detention since 2009, while many were granted bail over the years. Following the Supreme Court’s May 10, 2019, order, which stated that declared foreigners could be released after three years in detention subject to certain conditions, 273 people were released. In April 2020, another order reduced the detention period to two years and due to this 481 others were released. In October 2020, the Gauhati High Court, while hearing pleas on how authorities are required to operate detention centres, asked the state government’s home and political affairs department to submit the report detailing the steps that have been taken to set up detention centres outside jails. During the latest hearing in these pleas on August 11, the Advocate General, D. Saikia, submitted before the court that expeditious steps are being taken to complete the construction work of the detention centre at Matia within a period of one month. The court granted 45 days’ time to the state to complete the construction of the proposed detention centre and to shift the detenues to the said centre. The high court had said the state government has to ‘ensure that the places where they are being kept must have basic facilities of electricity, water and hygiene and that there is appropriate security at these places’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-renames-detention-centres-as-transit-camps/articleshow/85469196.cms||Rokibuz Zaman
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Girls in govt schools, colleges to get free sanitary napkins||BENGALURU: The government will distribute sanitary napkins among adolescent girls in schools and colleges under the Shuchi project to help maintain hygiene and curb infections. The cabinet on Thursday decided to procure and distribute 10 pads per girl student in all government and aided schools and colleges. “A sum of Rs 47 crore is being provided for this scheme,” said law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy. Initially, around 3 lakh girls in government and aided schools and hostels of various government departments will get the napkins. Officials expect the number to increase as this is a demand-driven scheme. The state cabinet also approved the Karnataka State Mental Healthcare Rules, 2021 for implementation of the Centre’s Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. The aim is to provide healthcare and services to persons with mental illness and to protect, promote and fulfil the rights of such individuals. Madhuswamy said under the rules, a state mental health authority will be constituted, and a committee headed by the director of Nimhans, Bengaluru, has been formed to draft the rules. The authority will maintain a register of clinical psychologists, nurses and psychiatric social workers registered to work as mental health professionals and publish the list. “Issues related to mental health assumed importance during the Covid-19 pandemic. Social and economic concerns such as job loss, loss of income, death of family members and fear, have triggered mental health conditions among people,” the minister said. The cabinet also decided to upgrade 2,859 health sub-centres at a cost of Rs 479 crore in partnership with the Union government. The Centre will bear 60 per cent of the scheme’s cost. Under the project, the sub-centres will be upgraded with necessary manpower and infrastructure, Madhuswamy said, adding that the exercise will be completed in three years. “Post upgradation, these centres will be brought under the National Rural Health Mission programme. Sixty per cent of the grant will come from the Centre...Wherever there are vacancies, staff nurses and auxiliary nurse midwifes (ANMs) will be outsourced or BSc nursing graduates will be taken for three years and they will be given a consolidated salary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/girls-in-govt-schools-colleges-to-get-free-sanitary-napkins/articleshow/85469317.cms||---
---||World||Record delta wave hits kids, raises fear as US schools open||The day before he was supposed to start fourth grade, Francisco Rosales was admitted to a Dallas hospital with Covid-19, struggling to breathe, with dangerously low oxygen levels and an uncertain outcome. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, thought his frightened mother, Yessica Gonzalez. Francisco was normally healthy and rambunctious. At 9, he was too young to get vaccinated, but most of the family had their shots. She had heard kids rarely got sick from the coronavirus. But with the highly contagious delta variant spreading across the US, children are filling hospital intensive care beds instead of classrooms in record numbers, more even than at the height of the pandemic. Many are too young to get the vaccine, which is available only to those 12 and over. The surging virus is spreading anxiety and causing turmoil and infighting among parents, administrators and politicians around the US, especially in states like Florida and Texas, where Republican governors have barred schools from making youngsters wear masks. With millions of children returning to classrooms this month, experts say the stakes are unquestionably high. Very high infection rates in the community “are really causing our children’s hospitals to feel the squeeze,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a Vanderbilt University infectious disease specialist who is a helping lead research on Moderna’s vaccine for children under 12. Creech said those shots probably won’t be available for several months. “I’m really worried,” said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a pediatrician and public health expert at the University of Florida. “It’s just so disappointing to see those numbers back up again.” While pediatric Covid-19 hospitalization rates are lower than those for adults, they have surged in recent weeks, reaching 0.41 per 100,000 children ages 0 to 17, compared with 0.31 per 100,000, the previous high set in mid-January, according to an Aug. 13 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, calls the spike in cases among children “very worrisome.” He noted that over 400 US children have died of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. “And right now we have almost 2,000 kids in the hospital, many of them in ICU, some of them under the age of 4,” Collins told Fox News on Sunday. Health experts believe adults who have not gotten their shots are contributing to the surge among grownups and children alike. It has been especially bad in places with lower vaccination rates, such as parts of the South. While it is clear the delta variant is much more contagious than the original version, scientists are not yet able to say with any certainty whether it makes people more severely ill or whether youngsters are especially vulnerable to it. As experts work to answer those questions, many hospitals are reeling. Those in Texas are among the hardest hit. On Tuesday, they reported 196 children being treated with confirmed Covid-19. That compares with 163 during the previous peak, in December. At Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, the nation’s largest pediatric hospital, the number of youngsters treated for Covid-19 is at an all-time high, said Dr. Jim Versalovic, interim pediatrician-in-chief. In recent weeks, the vast majority have had delta infections, and most patients 12 and up have not had shots, he said. “It is spreading like wildfire across our communities,” he said. At times this month, his hospital system has diagnosed 200 children with Covid-19 a day, with about 6% of them needing hospital care. On some days, the number of children in the hospital with Covid-19 has exceeded 45. Versalovic said he suspects hospitalizations of children are up simply because so many are getting infected, not because the delta variant makes people more seriously ill. At Children’s Medical Center in Dallas, where Francisco is being treated, the number of patients with COVID-19 climbed from 10 during the week of July 4 to 29 during the week of Aug. 8. Francisco is improving and expected to recover, but his mother is worried and is considering home-schooling him. The virus “is really dangerous," she said. The delta surge is yet another test for the nation’s schools, which are dealing with students who fell behind academically as a result of remote learning or developed mental health problems from the upheaval. Outbreaks have already occurred at reopened schools in the South that are facing resistance to mask-wearing. In Texas, some school administrators are mandating masks in defiance of the governor and state Supreme Court. Among them is Michael Hinojosa of the Dallas school system, one of the state’s largest districts. “This delta variant is different, and the numbers are really significant in the county,” he said. “We’re going to continue our mask mandate to keep students safe, to keep parents safe, to keep families safe and most importantly our teachers, who are on those front lines.’’ Although dozens of students and staff have already been sickened by the virus since the Dallas district’s 180 schools began reopening on Aug. 5, the numbers are far lower than when in-person learning resumed in the spring, Hinojosa said. Knowing the toll the pandemic has taken on children, Hinojosa is determined to keep his schools open. “We know they’ve been scarred by it,” he said. “That’s why they need to be back with their friends and teachers.” In DeSoto, a Dallas suburb, schools are also requiring masks, and Superintendent D’Andre Weaver said there has been no pushback from parents, perhaps, he added, because many are Black and know their community was hit hard earlier in the pandemic. Some considered keeping their children home because of the governor’s opposition to school mask requirements, Weaver said. As a parent and an administrator, Weaver said the delta surge “is a major concern, it’s a major frustration. It’s a big fear.” His own two girls started first and second grade this week, and the first thing he has been asking when he picks them up after school is “How do you feel? Do you have a sore throat?” Weaver said. “I know many parents are in the same boat.” While he knows many children suffered during virtual learning last year, Weaver said, ‘’We have no choice but to prepare that as an option.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/record-delta-wave-hits-kids-raises-fear-as-us-schools-open/articleshow/85469275.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Six ministers, council chairman vie for two plush bungalows in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: After allotting ministerial berths and cabinet portfolios, BJP chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has another tough task at hand — allocating ministerial bungalows. Sources in the government told TOI as many as eight ministers, new and old, apart from legislative council chairman Basavaraj Horatti, have sought an official government bungalow in Bengaluru. But more importantly, six of the eight ministers and the council chairman have asked for the same two bungalows, which may be due to vaastu concerns or probably the scenic backdrop of the houses. These bungalows were allotted to former tourism minister CP Yogeeshwara and former industries minister Jagadish Shettar — 03, Kumara Krupa Layout and 03, Crescent Road — respectively. “The two former ministers are yet to vacate the houses as they have two months’ time after demitting office. The ministers are eagerly waiting to get the bungalows allotted to themselves,” said a government official. As of Thursday, CM Bommai is said to have officially sought bungalow-1, Race View Cottage, along Race Course Road and asked higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan to vacate it. Narayan, who was deputy chief minister in the BS Yediyurappa government, will be shifting out and is one of the three ministers seeking allotment of Shettar’s bungalow. Bommai has, in fact, forgone all the three designated chief ministerial bungalows as Krishna is the work office, Cauvery is occupied by his mentor Yediyurappa, and Anugraha, considered unlucky by politicians, is occupied by Lokayukta P Vishwanath Shetty. Others seeking allotment of Shettar’s bungalow are textile and sugar minister Shankar B Patil Munenkoppa and transport minister B Sreeramulu. In fact, Sreeramulu who has already been allotted a bungalow in 7 Ministers Quarters (No. 06) has sought either Shettar’s or Yogeeshwara’s bungalow, which have number 03 in their names, leading to speculations that vaastu experts are being consulted. Sports minister KC Narayan Gowda, tourism minister Anand Singh and mines and women and child welfare minister Basappa Halappa Achar are eyeing Yogeeshwara’s official residence. When it comes to other bungalows, energy minister V Sunil Kumar wants to be allotted the official residence of industries minister Murugesh Nirani in the Yediyurappa government (31, Sankey Road). Primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh has asked for allotment of former deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi’s official residence in Jayamahal Layout. According to government officials, the file of allotting these bungalows has reached the CM, who has to take a final call on the matter. It’s said that Bommai has decided to allocate Yogeeshwara’s bungalow to home minister Arga Jnanendra. 03, Kumara Krupa is council chairman’s house: HorattiThe contest over Yogeeshwara’s official bungalow has got ugly with legislative council chairman Basavaraj Horatti claiming that 03, Kumara Krupa is the official residence of the person in the constitutional post. “There is a precedent of the bungalow being passed on from Veeranna Mathikatti to DH Shankarmurthy and then to Pratap Chandra Shetty for 12 years continuously. It is only when Yogeeshwara got it sanctioned by former CM Yediyurappa that it got transferred to the former minister,” said Horatti. The seven-time MLC went on to add that when Yediyurappa was CM, Bommai was law and parliamentary affairs minister, who was tasked with getting the house for the chairman. However, it was not possible as Yogeeshwara refused to vacate it. “Till date, I am using the legislator house as my official residence. This is an insult to the council chair,” added Horatti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/6-ministers-council-chairman-vie-for-2-plush-bungalows/articleshow/85469368.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Hubballi||Workers in some villages of North Karnataka consume liquor to avoid getting jabbed||YADGIR/BELAGAVI: In some villages of North Karnataka, residents are consuming alcohol in a bid to avoid vaccination. This is hampering the efforts of officials working towards meeting the 100% target in gram panchayats. In many villages of Yadgir district, at least 5-10 people have been drinking liquor before Asha workers and health staff land there. “Do you know what happens if you vaccinate me when I’m drunk?” a villager reportedly told health staff at Honagera village. A health worker said she has been reaching out to him for the past week and every day, he comes up with the same excuse. “How can we meet our targets if people don’t cooperate?” she asked. Yadgir district health officer Dr Indumati Patil said in every gram panchayat, health workers have been reporting five to six such cases. When she went to a hamlet for a reality check, she found five drunk men using liquor as an excuse to not take the vaccine. The health department now plans to tell wine shops to sell liquor only to those who can prove they’re vaccinated. “We’ll do our best to vaccinate all in villages,” she said. In Belagavi villages, health workers are facing similar problems. District health officer Dr Sashikanth Muniyal said: “A few months ago, some persons used the liquor excuse not to get jabbed, but we have been able to convince them.” In Raichur district, daily wage labourers say vaccination side-effects like fever prevent them for working for a week. A health official said labourers say they cannot afford to lose their daily earnings just to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/workers-consume-liquor-to-avoid-getting-jabbed/articleshow/85469428.cms||Shreyas HS

The terror attack that claimed Ghulam Hassan Lone's life – and the three other political killings that preceded it – appeared to trigger at least one fear-induced resignation by a BJP constituency in-charge from Noorabad in the same district. Mubarak Ahmad Bhat quit both his post and primary BJP membership with a statement that had a familiar ring to it. "I hereby resign from the party. I request people to forgive me, if my actions have hurt them in the past. I have small kids, I have no concern for or affiliation to any political party, especially BJP," he said, echoing what several others from various parties had cited while resigning in the wake of a wave of similar political killings in the Valley last year. BJP worker Javaid Dar, who was killed outside his house in Kulgam last Tuesday, was also a constituency in-charge. On August 9, two Lashkar terrorists had barged into a house in Anantnag and shot dead BJP sarpanch Ghulam Rasool Dar of Kulgam's Redwani panchayat and his wife and colleague Jawahira Begum. Four days later, terrorists hurled a grenade at the Rajouri house of BJP's Jasbir Singh, leaving seven members of the family injured. A four-year-old nephew of the BJP functionary died later in hospital. At least 43 members of various political parties have been killed in terror strikes in J&K since the nullification of Article 370 took away the erstwhile state's special status. J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha took to Twitter to condole the Apni Party functionary's death and promised that "the perpetrators of this heinous act will be brought to justice very soon". National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti and People's Conference chief Sajad Lone joined Apni Party president Syed Altaf Bukhari in condemning Ghulam Hassan's killing. "...This renewed trend of targeting mainstream politicians by militant outfits is very worrying & I condemn the same in the strongest possible terms. May Allah grant the departed Jannat," Omar tweeted. Mehbooba said "there seems to be no end to the spree of political killings in Kashmir". In a statement on behalf of Apni Party, Bukhari said his slain colleague had paid with his life for "just trying to resolve the pressing issues of the people of his area". Sajad Lone tweeted that "such killings only create more widows and orphans".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/apni-party-member-shot-dead-in-jk-4th-politician-to-be-killed-in-11-days/articleshow/85470004.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Security forces had launched a search operation in the Kangota area of Thanamandi belt following inputs on the presence of terrorists. On seeing the army personnel approaching their hideout, the terrorists opened fire, leading to an encounter. Jammu zone ADGP Mukesh Singh said one AK-47 rifle, one pistol, magazines and other ammunition ere recovered from the encounter site. Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “During the search operation, the search party led by Subedar Ram Singh was fired upon by terrorists. The armymen retaliated and in the ensuing firing one terrorist was neutralised while Subedar Singh suffered a gunshot wound. The valiant junior commissioned officer was provided immediate first aid and evacuated to the nearest hospital, however, he succumbed to his injuries.” Ram Singh, 46, hailed from Salana village in Pauri Garhwal area of Uttarakhand. “He is survived by his wife, son and daughter,” Col Anand said. This is the second encounter in the area in August this year. Earlier, two terrorists were gunned down in the forest area of Thanamandi on August 6.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: NMCRR seeks report on steps taken to address concerns of project-hit||VIJAYAWADA: The National Monitoring Committee for Rehabilitation and Resettlement (NMCRR) on Thursday ordered the state government to submit a report addressing the concerns of the displaced residents at Polavaram project area. Hearing a plea filed by social activist Pentapati Pulla Rao, the NMCRR reviewed the implementation of Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) schemes for various projects, including that of Polavaram at a virtual meeting. The representatives from the AP government stated that they have so far rehabilitated 5,000 people and assured to further add 15,000 more to the tally in the next two months with R&R colonies already being set up. The state government explained that they would be completing the R&R for the remaining residents by the end of next year. Pulla Rao’s petition alleged forcible eviction of tribal people from the Polavaram project area without appropriate compensation and implementation of the R&R package. In this regard, Rao also recently wrote to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), pleading to revive his case related to the rights of the tribal people in view of the non-fulfilment of their mandatory requirements by the state government. Rao also alleged that the upstream cofferdam has caused water stagnation across 50 tribal hamlets in East and West Godavari districts forcing tribals to leave the place in the wake of submergence issues. The NMCRR sought to provide fair rehabilitation to Polavaram victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nmcrr-seeks-report-on-steps-taken-to-address-concerns-of-project-hit/articleshow/85465394.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Civil Supplies Co struggling to recover dues from rice millers||AMARAVATI: The AP State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (APSCSL) is struggling to recover dues from millers as it failed to secure enough bank guarantee from them while allotting paddy stocks for custom milling of rice. Sources said the corporation allotted paddy quota for a few millers more than the bank guarantee produced by them. There are allegations that several rice millers duped the state government to the tune of Rs 300 crore by selling paddy stocks allotted by the department in open market. The millers have neither returned the rice stock after milling nor paid the value of the material to the government. “An investigation is on. We will recover the dues,” said a senior official of the Civil Supplies Department. As a practice, the Civil Supplies Corporation has been allotting paddy to different rice mills after procurement of the stock from farmers. Under Custom Milling of Rice (CMR), the millers would return the finished goods to the department for disbursement to the Public Distribution Scheme (PDS), social welfare hostels, mid-day meal programme and anganwadi centres. The department would pay CMR charges to the millers for milling the paddy. During the allocation of paddy, the department would take bank guarantees from the mills as security till the return of the rice stock. 4 millers duped government to the tune of nearly 30 crSources said that a few millers, particularly from Nellore district, have sold the paddy stocks in open market and did not return the rice to the corporation. The officials started issuing notices to the millers in 2018 and are still waiting for a response. Sources said that stocks worth over Rs.100 crore were diverted by 20 millers in different districts. Sources said that six millers from Nellore district had to clear over 50 per cent of the total due. It is alleged that four millers duped the government to the tune of 30 crore. Though the corporation imposed stiff penalties, the millers have ignored the demand over the last two years. The Civil Supplies Corporation recently allocated paddy worth 8 crore to a rice mill in West Godavari district against a bank guarantee of 1.4 crore. The miller has not returned the stock to the corporation. The scandal came to light after the banks tried to auction the properties of the miller to recover their dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/civil-supplies-co-struggling-to-recover-dues-from-rice-millers/articleshow/85467982.cms||Samdani MN

---||Kolkata||As restrictions ease further in Bengal…Kolkata ditches online shopping for handpicked gifts this Rakhi||Unlike last year, when all of us had to make do with online Rakhi shopping and skip family celebrations with a heavy heart due to rise in COVID cases, things seem to be looking up this year a bit. Now that the West Bengal government has also allowed all shops and business establishments, including bars and restaurants, to stay open till 10.30 pm, Kolkatans are all out to make the most of it. High Demand for custom-made, gold and silver rakhisWith just a couple of days left for Raksha Bandhan, which is on August 22, people are thronging the local markets for last-minute shopping. Sarika Chowdhary, who has been making rakhis for the past 15 years, said, “Last year, most of us celebrated Rakhi virtually, but this year people seem more enthusiastic with the dip in COVID cases. There’s a demand for both handmade traditional and theme-based rakhis. Moti (pearls) and zardozi rakhis are selling like hotcakes. As per tradition, the sister ties a rakhi on her brother’s wrist and a lumba on her bhabi’s. These lumba rakhis are made keeping what her sister-in-law is fond of. Chocolate hampers decked with childhood photos of the brother are also in demand.” Ranjit Sarkar, who has been selling rakhis for the past 10 years at Gariahat market, said, “There are people who prefer big rakhis. But these days, youngsters like smaller and sleeker ones that look more like friendship bands. Stone-studded rakhis are also selling quite well.” Not just those, the demand for gold and silver rakhis is also on the rise this year. “The mentality of people has changed after the second wave. There is so much uncertainty about the future that people are now willing to spend more. They want to make every occasion a special one. Customers are asking for rakhis with small gold or silver Ganesh inscribed on them. These look more like bracelets. That apart, there are rakhis with cartoon characters for kids,” said Manoj Nahata from a shop in Camac Street. Ever heard of plantable rakhis?In a bid to make this world a better place, Smita Bhatter, who has been selling sustainable gift products for the past five years, has decided to go green this year. She said, “We are making plantable rakhis, especially for this pandemic year. For children, we give animal-shaped terracotta pots, along with other things required, to paint and then plant seeds. A lot of people are picking up microgreen boxes too. It only shows that people are now aware and prefer to gift environmentally-friendly stuff.” Sweet SurrenderThis year, orders for Rakhi thalis have been pretty satisfactory, feels Sudip Mallick, owner of a popular sweet brand. “The thali comes with a rakhi and various types of sweets and can be customised too,” he informed. Echoing Mallick, Anil Pandey from a savoury shop, said, “People are pre-bookings rakhi platters that include sweets, samosas, dhokla and other items.” Priyanka Gupta, who makes customised gift trays with food items, said, “These days, we all miss going on vacations. The thrill of riding on a train during summer or winter holidays and the excitement of having junk food at different stations are something we all remember! To relive this fond memory, we are making a hamper that includes soft drink bottles, chips, chocolates, dry fruits, phantom cigarettes and a lot more.” According to Urvashi Shivnani, cupcakes can be the sweetest gift for any brother or a sister. “We make different toppings for each of these gooey fudge brownies. One also has the option to add their favourite flavour,” said Urvashi, who runs her own bakery in Kolkata. Special offers at restaurantsThough some prefer to serve homemade food to their brothers on Raksha Bandhan, there are many who love to treat their siblings at their favourite restaurants. And there are options galore. “We are introducing a new combo platter, comprising Murgh Musallam, vegetable biryani, shirmal and shikanji. That apart, siblings will get a discount if they plan to dine together,” said Dalia De, who represents five food brands in Kolkata. Keeping in mind the food preferences for the vegetarians, Priyanka Dhanuka Lohia from a local restaurant said, “We will serve a platter, comprising idli, upma, dosa, two types of chutneys, sambhar and a sandesh.” No meal is complete without sweets, right? “So, dessert is on the house for siblings who will be there at our café on Raksha Bandhan,” said Nikhil Chawla, spokesperson of a café in south Kolkata.

The actress missed being with her brother, Pradipta, on Rakhi. So, this time, she is going to compensate for it by treating him to chicken biryani and mutton kosha. “Those are his favourite dishes and I love cooking them myself. Also, I prefer to tie a rakhi made of flowers on his wrist. We do a small puja at home for my brother’s good health,” said Rituparna. Actress Pallavi Chatterjee too is planning a surprise for elder brother Prosenjit Chatterjee on Rakhi. “Dada is in Mumbai now. So, I am flying off to be with him on Rakhi. I will make karela (bitter gourd) chutney, samosas and halwa for him. He loves having homemade samosas with tea. I have also decided to gift him plants this year as rakhi gifts. I prefer a traditional rakhi to a modern one,” said the actress. For model-actress Richa Sharma, it’s double celebrations this time. An excited Richa said, “My brother, Sandip, who stays in Kanpur, is coming all the way to Kolkata to celebrate the occasion with us. Last year, we missed being together due to the pandemic, but this time we’ll celebrate Rakhi in a grand way. I have bought a customised rakhi for him and his gift hamper includes shirts, perfumes and sweets, which I have personally selected from his favourite shops in New Market. I will also make churma and kheer, as these are what we must have on Rakhi. Lunch will be simple — poori, dahi aloo, paneer malai and besan ka gatta. We generally prefer to serve ghar ka khana to our brothers on Rakhi.

---||India||Gujarat HC stays some sections of ‘anti-love jihad’ law||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday stayed six amended provisions in the anti-conversion law covering interfaith marriages, popularly known as “anti-love jihad law”. The court clarified that the amended sections would not apply in cases of inter-religious marriages, which take place without force, allurement or fraudulent means. Staying the amended sections in the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav said, “The interim order is to protect the parties of interfaith marriage from being unnecessarily harassed.” The stay on these sections effectively means that an FIR under this law cannot be lodged merely on the basis of an interfaith marriage. “We are of the opinion that pending further hearing, rigors of Section 3,4, 4a to 4c, 5, 6, and 6a shall not operate merely because the marriage is solemnised by a person of one religion with person of another religion without force, allurement or fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriage for the purpose of unlawful conversion,” the court said. Advocate general Kamal Trivedi, seeking a clarification, asked whether the provisions of the amended law will apply if interfaith marriage results in forceful conversion. To this, CJ Vikram Nath said that the provisions cannot be applied if there is no force or allurement involved in conversion. The Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, which penalises forcible or fraudulent religious conversion through marriage, was notified by the state government on June 15. According to the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act (2003) conversion by “or any fraudulent means” was a punishable offence. This clause was replaced with “or by any fraudulent means or by marriage or by getting a person married or by aiding a person to get married” in the 2021 amended Act. The amendments were challenged by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and an activist Mujahid Nafees by terming them to be in violation of various constitutional provisions, including Article 25. The petitions were filed through advocate Mohammed Isa Hakim and senior counsel Mihir Joshi contended that the provisions are an encroachment on a citizen’s right to privacy in her decision of marriage. They argued that the law effectively rendered interfaith marriages illegal, unless permission is sought from competent authority. During the hearings, the court repeatedly questioned the government whether it intended to prohibit interfaith marriages because it is a matter of personal choice. The court was also concerned about the government’s bid to shift burden of proof on the accused that after lodging an FIR, a person has to go to jail and then has to prove that the marriage has taken place without coercion. This is because the amended law provides for any relative of the victim to file a complaint. Jamiat Ulema Gujarat, in a media statement, said that with the HC’s stay, FIR under this law cannot be filed until the elements of force or allurement are not proved for conversion after interfaith marriages. Following the amendment in the Act, three FIRs have been registered till now. In one case, the woman, after filing a complaint against her husband and in-laws, has approached the HC for quashing the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-hc-stays-some-sections-of-anti-love-jihad-law/articleshow/85471295.cms||Saeed Khan
---||India||It’s same scene ‘bees saal baad’: IC814 pilot||NEW DELHI: “Bees saal baad, ya bees saal pehle?” Images of Taliban militia taking control of Kabul earlier this week left Devi Sharan, captain of the hijacked erstwhile Indian Airlines IC 814 in December 1999, wondering as he watched the events unfold on TV. For there was no change in the visuals now from what he recalls seeing through cockpit of the hijacked Airbus A300 that had remained parked in Kandahar for almost a week. “They are roaming around in open jeeps with rocket launchers on Kabul streets, just like they did when surrounding our aircraft in Kandahar. It was as if nothing has changed,” Captain Sharan (59), who recently retired fom Air India, told TOI. What were the Taliban like? Sharan, a national hero who remained calm during those tumultuous days, recalled an incident to describe that. “On the second or third day in Kandahar, a diabetic passenger took very ill. The Taliban took him to a hospital on our request. This passenger returned to the aircraft the same day as the situation in the hospital was very bad and he didn’t feel safe there,” he said. Captain S P S Suri, who travelled on an IA Airbus A320 relief flight from Delhi to Kandahar with negotiators and a team of extra crew members on December 26, 1999, had spent another night there after the crew and passengers left on the evening of December 31. He was left behind with Captain J R D Rao and two engineers to fly back the hijacked A330. Then and now photos of Captain Sharan (L) and Captain S P S Suri (R)File photo: Taliban militants race towards the hijacked Indian Airlines plane IC 814 at Kandahar airport.“‘Hamara commander bolta hai hum nahin jaane denge tak jabtak isme se hamara ek tohfa nahin utaroge. Cargo hold kholo’,” captain Suri recalls the Taliban telling him. There was a bag in the cabin in which valuables taken from passengers were kept. Suri thought they are talking about that bag. They, instead, force opened the aircraft’s cargo hold and took one particular check-in bag from there. “This possibly had explosives timed for the Millennium which were detonated at the far end of Kandahar Airport. We could hear the loud boom,” Suri says. On the morning of January 1, 2000, — by when Taliban had let the hijackers go — Captain Suri said he wanted to leave but was denied permission to take off. After landing in Kandahar, Suri (64) — who retried from AI in 2014 and now flies with SpiceJet — and the 25-30 other crew members used to sleep in the A320. But on December 31, that aircraft took off for Delhi and sleeping inside the hijacked A300 that had terrible stench by then was not possible for the four IA crew left behind. “The Taliban said rooms in Kandahar airport were taken by the hijackers and ISI.” They allowed the four of us to spend the night by a bonfire in a verandah. “We were shivering there. ‘Sardar, badaam kha le. Raat kat jayegi’, Taliban leader Mullah Omar said to us, the four IA crew members, while giving us almonds,” said Suri. The next (January 1) morning, an air traffic controller told this four-member crew that they will not get permission to leave for India. “The plane battery was at 7%. Taking Wahe Guru’s name, we started one engine and it miraculously came to life. While taxiing out, we started the other engine. The ATC kept telling us we didn’t have clearance to take off but we got airborne anyway,” Suri said. Pakistan ATC warned the aircraft did not have permission to overfly. And the crew of Delhi-bound IC 814 (D) — a delayed flight in aviation parlance — kept saying they were unable to hear anything. “The best thing we heard was IAF controller telling us ‘welcome home, you are cleared straight for Delhi,’ just before entering the Indian airspace,” Suri recalled. He had got married in the summer of 1999 and had operated a Sharjah-Calicut-Mumbai-Delhi flight on December 26 when asked if he would be on an aircraft to Kandahar to fly back the hijacked A300. “I said yes at the airport itself because I felt my family will not allow me to do so if I went home,” Suri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/its-same-scene-bees-saal-baad-ic814-pilot/articleshow/85471890.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||India||‘No instigation, no cruelty by Shashi Tharoor’||NEW DELHI: There is nothing, even prima facie, to suggest that there was any wilful conduct on the part of Shashi Tharoor that was likely to drive his wife, Sunanda Pushkar, to suicide or to cause injury or danger to life, limb or health. Making this observation, a Delhi court has discharged him in the case of death of his wife. The court said that Pushkar might have felt distressed or mentally disturbed over the alleged extra-marital relation of Tharoor, but mental disturbance does not amount to the offence of abetment. Special judge Geetanjali Goel discharged him for offences under sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment to suicide) of IPC. The court observed that it cannot be said that suspicion, much less grave suspicion, existed in the present case to charge the accused for the offence under section 302 (murder) of IPC. “There is nothing on record to show that the accused did some act in order to irritate or annoy the deceased until she reacted or strongly persuaded or advised the deceased to do some act with the intention to provoke, incite, urge or encourage the latter to commit suicide,” the court said in its order. Pushkar was found dead in a room of a five-star hotel in Delhi on January 17, 2014. An FIR had been registered by the police on January 1, 2015, against unknown persons for murder. Tharoor was later booked for subjecting a woman to cruelty and abetment to suicide. The court said there was nothing to show prima facie that the accused had subjected Pushkar to physical cruelty. It pointed out that none of the reports, either of the doctors or of the psychological autopsy board, had confirmed that the death was a suicide. It said that even if it was assumed that the death was a suicide, there was no material whatsoever against Tharoor, much less any positive act, to instigate or aid his wife in committing suicide. The court said the chargesheet appeared to have been filed in the hope that the court would find some material to proceed with the trial against the accused, but criminal trials require evidence. “No doubt a precious life was lost. But in the absence of specific allegations and sufficient material to make out the ingredients of the various offences and on the basis of which the court could, at this stage, presume that the accused had committed the offence, the accused cannot be compelled to face the rigmaroles of a criminal trial,” it observed. It noted that though the public prosecutor, appearing for the police, had referred to the accused leaving the deceased at the airport, not calling a doctor and not paying attention to her, the same cannot be described as having been done with the intention to goad her or instigate her to commit suicide. “While it may be reiterated that the statements of the witnesses show that the deceased was agitated, distressed, felt betrayed and cheated due to the alleged affair of the accused, the prosecution has not brought anything on record to show that the accused had provoked, incited or induced the deceased to commit suicide. There is nothing to demonstrate any overt act on the part of the accused, and only on the ground that he continued the alleged affair (even if it is assumed) and exchanged messages with her, it cannot be presumed that he had abetted the commission of suicide by the deceased,” it said. The prosecution had examined 97 witnesses in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-instigation-no-cruelty-by-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/85472204.cms||Usha Das
---||India||SC: Arrest shouldn’t be done as routine||NEW DELHI: Holding personal liberty as an important aspect of constitutional mandate, the Supreme Court has said that arrests should not be done in a routine manner when the accused is cooperating in a probe and there is no reason to believe that s/he will abscond or influence the investigation. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said arrest causes incalculable harm to a person's reputation and self-esteem and police should not resort to such an action just because arrest is allowed under law. "The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises when custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused may abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful does not mandate that arrest must be made. A distinction must be made between the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for exercise of it," the bench said. The bench lamented that despite comprehensive guidelines issued by the apex court way back in 1994, routine arrests are being made and even lower courts insist on such a course when a chargesheet is filed in a non-bailable and cognisable offence. "If the investigating officer has no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation, we fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the officer to arrest the accused," it said. While interpreting Section 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code under which trial courts insist on arrest of the accused, the bench said it does not impose an obligation on the officer-in-charge to arrest each and every accused at the time of filing of the chargesheet. The bench elaborately referred to various judgments of HCs which held that criminal courts cannot refuse to accept a chargesheet simply because the accused has not been arrested and produced before the court. "We are in agreement with the aforesaid view of the high courts and would like to give our imprimatur to the said judicial view… We have, in fact, come across cases where the accused has cooperated with the investigation throughout and yet on the chargesheet being filed, non-bailable warrants have been issued for his production premised on the requirement that there is an obligation to arrest the accused and produce him before the court," the bench said. "The word custody appearing in Section 170 of the CrPC does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the investigating officer before the court while filing the chargesheet," it said. The court passed the order on a plea of an accused seeking anticipatory bail as an arrest memo was issued against him after a trial court in UP took a view that unless the person was taken into custody, the chargesheet would not be taken on record in view of Section 170 of the CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-arrest-shouldnt-be-done-as-routine/articleshow/85472657.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||To strengthen grassroots connect, Madhya Pradesh BJP to appoint page pramukhs||BHOPAL: Emulating the successful Gujarat election model, the Madhya Pradesh BJP will appoint "panna pramukh" and "ardh panna pramukh" to strengthen the party at the grassroots level ahead of the upcoming bypolls to one Lok Sabha and three assembly seats, apart from the 2023 state polls.  The BJP has decided to appoint one "panna pramukh" (in-charge of one page of electoral roll) for every 20 to 30 families, along with sakriya mandal and polling booth.  Each panna pramukh is given the responsibility of one page in the electoral rolls, containing names of the members of eight to 12 families. Every "panna pramukh or prabhari" is required to focus on these families.  This model is popular in Gujarat and the party had extensively used it in Karnataka and West Bengal. On a micro level, the Gujarat BJP has further divided the responsibility among the workers by appointing "ardh panna pramukh", which is now being followed by the other saffron-ruled states.  As per the strategy, the role of every "panna pramukh" is to update and mobilise 20 to 30 families on the party’s social welfare schemes. The panna pramukh will also be assigned a task to build social connections of the families with the party and keep other leaders in the organisation updated on beneficiaries of the welfare schemes. They will hold regular discussions with the family members and make them aware about the party’s stand, said party insiders.  "Our organisation is different from other parties. In the BJP, a booth worker can also be elevated to a higher post. We have to work for the formation of "panna samiti", along with "panna pramukh" on the lines of Gujarat," said BJP state president Vishnu Dutt Sharma, addressing the party workers in Burhanpur and Khandwa, on Wednesday.  Sharma was all praise for the Centre's "Ayushman Bharat" and "Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana”, which have helped several people, especially during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The central government has so far provided relief and ration to around 80 crore people under its ambitious "Anna Mahotsav".  State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said the panna pramukh also achieves the task to ensure that on the day of polling all these voters come out and cast their votes. “In one booth which has around 1000 voters, there could be 10 to 20 "panna pramukh".  Sources said, the "panna pramukh" also becomes an important conduit for disseminating the party's political message. The informal conversations of the "panna pramukh" have a cascading effect. If a "panna pramukh" succeeds in convincing a voter to support the party candidate, then that voter tends to persuade his family and friends to do the same. This also has helped many times to contain the discontentment among the workers and disgruntled leaders in blocks and mandals who feel that they are an important part of the party.  In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP is currently facing a few challenges like 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes, welfare of tribal people and Scheduled Castes and issues related to inflation, unemployment and poor health facilities in rural areas, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-strengthen-grassroots-connect-madhya-pradesh-bjp-to-appoint-page-pramukhs/articleshow/85472674.cms||Rajendra Sharma

Both the CBI and the special probe team — comprising senior IPS officers Suman Bala Sahoo, Soumen Mitra and Ranveer Kumar — will have to submit their reports in six weeks and will have to work under the court’s supervision. A five-judge bench, led by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, also directed the NHRC, the state government and any other commission or committee that received complaints to hand over all records relating to murder and crime-against-women cases to the CBI. But all cases not related to poll violence would have to be handed back to the local police, the court said, adding that “any obstruction to investigation shall be taken seriously”. Three members of the bench — Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon and Soumen Sen — gave their “concurring judgments” separately. The court declined to specify any particular period for “post-poll violence” but included all complaints made during the entire election process, starting from the first day of polling (March 27). “If any offence was committed before declaration of results and had a connection with the election process, it too can be considered as part of post-poll violence,” the bench said. The state government was considering filing an appeal against the judgment in the Supreme Court “on some specific points”, Sanjay Basu, an advocate for the Bengal government, said. “Many aspects (of the judgement) vindicate our stand,” he claimed. The acting CJ, in the lead judgment, recorded the NHRC report, the state government’s “exception” petition to the NHRC report, the procedure adopted by the NHRC and commented on the allegations of “bias” against the NHRC and EC’s responsibility. HC also noted the contradictions between the NHRC and the state government. The NHRC reported 13 rape cases, including two gang rapes where complainants had moved the SC; the state government reported one attempt-to-rape case. The NHRC reported 59 murders; the state government acknowledged 29. The bench also noted that police “closed” some cases after initiating FIRs suo motu. The judges dealt separately with the allegations of bias against three members of the NHRC because of their affiliation to a political party. “The allegation against the committee is not material because this court has considered not only the report but other materials, including the arguments of the counsels,” Justice Mukerji observed in his judgment. But, on some of the controversial NHRC observations, he observed that the NHRC panel “had no jurisdiction to make any recommendation or to express any opinion”. He said, “We did not vest them with that power.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-orders-cbi-to-probe-bengal-post-poll-violence-cases/articleshow/85472799.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

The direction by a division bench of the court’s Madurai bench, comprising Justices N Kirubakaran and Justice M Duraiswamy, came on a public interest litigation filed by Madurai MP Su Venkitasan seeking English alone be used in all communications between the Centre and state governments. Venkitasan had approached the court after the junior home minister replied in Hindi to a letter from him seeking setting up of examination centres for CRPF paramedical staff recruitment at Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Justice Kirubakaran, citing Article 350 of the Constitution, said that every person is entitled to give representation in any languages used in the Union or the state. He said that once a question is given in English, it is the duty of the Union government to reply in English only. He added that this was in consonance with the Official Languages Act. The court also directed the Union government and all its instrumentalities to follow the Official Languages Act, especially its Section 3, which says that both Hindi and English should be used for official documents. Justice Kirubakaran also said “there are several languages in India which are hundreds or even thousands of years old” and that governments should take efforts to preserve them. ians||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/answer-queries-in-english-in-same-language-hc-to-centre/articleshow/85472909.cms||---

Meanwhile, Fred - now a post-tropical cyclone - was pushing through New York and New England with drenching rains, and tropical storm Henri was sending dangerous waves onto East Coast beaches. Forecasters said Henri will likely strengthen into a hurricane as it approaches the northeastern US early next week.  In western North Carolina, Haywood County Emergency Services announced Thursday that two people were confirmed dead after the flooding that prompted dozens of water rescues. Their identities were not immediately released. The storm that blew through the area Tuesday made roads impassible, washed out bridges and swamped homes and businesses.  Another Fred-related death was reported earlier in the week in Florida, where a driver hydroplaned and flipped his car into a flooded ditch.  More than 200 people searched flooded areas along the Pigeon river. At least 10 bridges were damaged or destroyed in the Cruso community, where engineering teams worked to construct temporary bridges to allow people in and out of their homes.  "Our search crews are actively working, searching for more victims and more survivors," Travis Donaldson, emergency services director for Haywood County, said at a news conference.  Kevin Sandefur, Chief Executive Officer and founder of BearWaters Brewing Company in Canton, told reporters the flooding wiped out an outdoor seating section the brewery added to make customers feel safer during the pandemic.  "It was very frightening. I was more concerned for everybody's safety," he said. "My partner was the last one out of the building and barely made it out of here in his truck before they closed the bridges and the streets because it was up that high. It's very scary how quickly it came up and overwhelmed us."  An emergency shelter at a nearby high school housed 11 people Thursday. Republican Senator Thom Tillis toured the area earlier in the day.  Farther north, about 10 families evacuated their homes in the rural town of Western in central New York as waters rose.  "I've got three roads that are closed and 15 that have flooding," said Western town Supervisor Diane Butler who noted the town is still recovering from a tornado last month that downed trees and damaged homes.  Butler said there were no injuries.  Officials from the Cayuga County sheriff's office in the Finger Lakes tourist region said they were barricading roads as they warned on social media that flooded roads may be washed out or have heavy currents.  Strong winds brought down trees, utility poles and power lines in northeastern Connecticut. Thompson, Connecticut First Selectman Amy St. Onge, the town's top elected official, said authorities were investigating reports of a possible tornado in the area around 10 am. No injuries were reported.  As of late Thursday morning, Fred was blowing through upstate New York with maximum sustained winds of about 25 mph (34 kmph), according to the US National Hurricane Center. Forecasters said it was expected to produce between one and three inches of rain (2.5-7.6 cm) across New York and New England, with isolated spots getting more. The flood threat was expected to diminish by Friday. Its centre was about 50 miles (75 km) west-northwest of Albany.  Swirling in the Atlantic was Tropical Storm Henri, which is expected to become a hurricane offshore late Friday along a path that will likely take it parallel to the East Coast. Its centre was forecast to approach southern New England by Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/2-dead-20-missing-in-north-carolina-county-flooded-by-fred/articleshow/85473097.cms||---

This assumes significance amid concerns about rising breakthrough infections in the country with many wondering whether there are new variants emerging and are existing vaccines going to be effective against them. The INSACOG report underlines that vaccination continues to be very effective in reducing severe disease and death, whereas the continuing outbreaks across India are related to Delta and reduced vaccine effectiveness in blocking transmission, among other factors. “Continuing outbreaks across India are attributable to Delta, a susceptible population, reduced vaccine effectiveness in blocking transmission, and opportunities for transmission. Vaccination continues to be very effective in reducing severe disease and death. Public health measures to reduce transmission and vaccination remain critical,” the consortium said in its report. It also highlighted that while investigations for new variants are ongoing, concern regarding appearance of new variants should be calibrated in the context of global outbreaks of SARS-CoV2 infection after Covid vaccination. The UK, with a population of about 6.7 crore, has reported about 18 lakh cases and 1.2 lakh vaccination breakthroughs with Delta, since April 2021, it noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/breakthrough-infection-common-due-to-delta-report/articleshow/85473220.cms||Sushmi Dey

It is likely to shoot up more in the wake of the ensuing festive and winter seasons if the trade doesn’t commence soon. Indian importers, however, are of the view that this suspension is temporary and regular import-export will resume in the next few days. The president of the Indo Foreign Chamber of Commerce, B K Bajaj, on Thursday said the increase in prices “was expected” under such circumstances, pointing out that dry fruits were a luxury item and not essential commodities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shortage-drives-up-dry-fruit-prices/articleshow/85473399.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||India||Covid vaccination for kids may start only by March ’22||NEW DELHI: The government is likely to start vaccination of children against Covid-19 only by March 2022, even as three-four vaccines are likely to be approved for the Under-18 age group by December, official sources said. Zydus Cadila's Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, is expected to get an emergency use authorisation for the 12-18 cohort by end of August, whereas Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin – the world’s only vaccine being tested for use in the age group of 2-18 yrs - is also likely to get a go-ahead by September. There is also an mRNA vaccine being developed by Gennova Pharmaceuticals. Though the mRNA vaccine is currently under clinical trial for use in adults, it is likely to be approved for children without separate trials. These vaccines are already being given to children in other countries, an official said. The Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, named Covavax in India with Serum Institute of India (SII) as its manufacturing partner, is likely to be approved for emergency use by December. The government aims to vaccinate the adult population by the year-end, but officials are aware that this also depends on persons being willing to be vaccinated apart from availability of the shots. The government will prioritise children with co-morbidities - estimated to be around 30 lakh - to receive the vaccines initially and then include others depending on availability. Overall, there are around 40 crore young persons below 18 years. “Covid vaccination among children will start only once all adults are vaccinated. We also have to ensure that there is adequate supply of the approved vaccines to cover all children,” the official said. Total of over 57 crore doses have been administered across the country till 8pm on Thursday with over 49% of 94 crore adult population getting at least a first dose of the vaccine. Around 14% of adults are fully vaccinated. Officials say vaccination of children should not stop schools from opening if staff is immunised. “Children are not severely impacted by the infection. In most cases, it is mild. Primarily they spread the disease. So, if school staff and parents are all immunised, it is safe to open schools,” the official said. Though the pace of vaccination has increased of late, limited supplies and the upcoming festival season are seen as challenges that may again impact the speed of the programme. Even though new vaccines like ZyCoV-D are expected to enhance supplies, it will depend on by when these vaccines are actually available and in what quantity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-vaccination-for-kids-may-start-only-by-march-22/articleshow/85473460.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||No democracy, only Sharia law in Afghanistan: Taliban member||Afghanistan may be governed by a ruling council now that the Taliban has taken over, while the Islamist militant movement’s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, would likely remain in overall charge, a senior member of the group told Reuters. The Taliban would also reach out to former pilots and soldiers from the Afghan armed forces to join its ranks, Waheedullah Hashimi, who has access to the group’s decision-making, added in an interview. How successful that recruitment is remains to be seen. Thousands of soldiers have been killed by Taliban insurgents over the last 20 years, and recently the group targeted US-trained Afghan pilots because of their pivotal role. The power structure that Hashimi outlined would bear similarities to how Afghanistan was run the last time the Taliban were in power from 1996 to 2001. Then, supreme leader Mullah Omar remained in the shadows and left the day-to-day running of the country to a council. Akhundzada would likely play a role above the head of the council, who would be akin to the country’s president, Hashimi added. “Maybe his (Akhundzada’s) deputy will play the role of ‘president’,” Hashimi said, speaking in English. The Taliban’s supreme leader has three deputies: Mawlavi Yaqoob, son of Mullah Omar, Sirajuddin Haqqani, leader of the powerful militant Haqqani network, and Abdul Ghani Baradar, who heads the Taliban’s political office in Doha and is one of the founding members of the group. Many issues regarding how the Taliban would run Afghanistan have yet to be finalised, Hashimi explained, but Afghanistan would not be a democracy. “There will be no democratic system at all because it does not have any base in our country,” he said. “We will not discuss what type of political system should we apply in Afghanistan because it is clear. It is sharia law and that is it.” Hashimi said he would be joining a meeting of the Taliban leadership that would discuss governance later this week. On recruiting soldiers and pilots, Hashimi said the Taliban planned to set up a new national force that would include its own members as well as government soldiers. “Most of them have got training in Turkey and Germany and England. So we will talk to them to get back to their positions,” he said.

---||India||Amid Afghanistan concerns, India slams Pak’s ‘state hospitality’ for terror groups||With concerns mounting about the possibility that Afghanistan could now be used as a terror launch pad, India said at the UN Security Council Thursday the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the country since the Taliban takeover would only embolden terror groups active in the region, including Pakistan-based LeT and JeM, which continued to enjoy “state hospitality”. Chairing a UNSC event on the threat from terrorist acts, foreign minister S Jaishankar asked the council to not take a selective view of the issue as he underlined India’s concerns about developments in Afghanistan and its continued efforts to fight terrorist activities emanating from safe havens and sanctuaries from across its borders. Official sources said UNSC member-states joined India’s call for a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism in all its forms and manifestations leading to the adoption of a “very strong, substantive and forward looking” press statement that outlined key concerns, especially to ensure a “strict check on terror financing and bringing the perpetrators of terror attacks to justice”. “Whether it is in Afghanistan or against India, groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammed continue to operate with both impunity and encouragement. It is, therefore, vital this council does not take a selective, tactical or even a complacent view of the problems we face,” said Jaishankar. “We must never countenance sanctuaries for terrorists or overlook the raising of their resources. And when we see state hospitality being extended to those with innocents’ blood on their hands, we should never lack the courage to call out this double-speak. We heard from the briefers of the aggravating attack of the pandemic. What is true of Covid is even more true of terrorism: none of us are safe until all of us are safe,” he added. He said some countries continued to subvert the collective resolve to fight terrorism. While the minister didn’t directly name Pakistan, he said it was a serious cause of concern that various terror organisations like ISIL, al-Qaeda, LeT, JeM, Haqqani Network and their frontal organisations were growing in strength and gaining new grounds “with impunity, encouragement and state sponsored hospitality”. The minister said In India’s own immediate neighborhood, ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K) had become more energetic, seeking to constantly expand its footprint and that heightened activities of the proscribed Haqqani Network justified growing anxiety about Afghanistan. Jaishankar recalled 2008 Mumbai terror attack, 2016 Pathankot airbase attack and the 2019 suicide bombing at Pulwama and expressed solidarity and sympathy with victims and their families. He said India has been in the forefront of global counter-terrorism efforts including under the auspices of the UN. The minister was chairing UNSC Open Briefing on ‘Threats to International Peace and Security Caused by Terrorist Acts’. As a country which has borne the brunt of cross-border terrorism, sources said, this will be priority issue for India during its remaining term in the security council as well. India will be chairing the UNSC counter terror committee in 2022, and hopes to build upon the gains from this event. Jaishankar also called for a swift adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism – piloted by India, which is seen as the key to future global counter-terrorism efforts. He also asked for council’s consideration of his “eight-point action plan” on terrorism that he had announced earlier this year and encouraged member states to collectively build on these principles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-afghanistan-concerns-india-slams-paks-state-hospitality-for-terror-groups/articleshow/85473614.cms||---

The staffers also did not approve the compensation offered by the consortium with little over 3,000 (35%) of the nearly 9,000 employees voting in favour and 5,500 (61%) abstaining from voting. The Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS) and Jet Airways Cabin Crew Association (JACCA) filed an appeal before the NCLAT on Wednesday against the consortium, the former resolution professional, Jet’s committee of creditors and monitoring committee. Arvind Sawant of BKS said: “We have two worries, one is the Jet staff’s pending dues and the second is about their jobs, their reinstatement.” Last month, TOI had reported that the Jet staffers had planned to file an appeal. Of the 4,000-odd staffers who remained with Jet for over two years after it suspended operations in April 2019, only 50 have been retained in Jet 2.0. The remaining staffers have been hived off to a yet-to-be formed ground handling company, according to the consortium’s resolution plan. To gain support for its resolution plan, the consortium had floated a proposal for Jet staff under which they were to get equity stake and management control of the said ground handling company. Among the other benefits, the proposal included a cash payment of Rs 22,800 to each staff, which included Rs 11,800 as reimbursement towards their parent’s medical expenses, their children’s school fees, stationery purchase and mobile recharge. But the consortium’s condition was that the proposal would be valid only if at least 95% of Jet staff voted in support of the resolution plan and not challenge its approval. Since only 35% voted in favour, the proposal has lapsed, said the consortium, in a communication on voting results, sent on Thursday. Advocate Rahul Oak, representing BKS and JACCA in NCLAT said: “Our appeal is not against the revival of Jet, it’s about violation of major provisions of the labour laws. The workers have been moved to a company that currently has no operations and which could be liquidated at the discretion of the new owners.” The benefits listed in the now-defunct proposal was over the above payments mentioned in the resolution plan. The NCLT order had mentioned Rs 52 crore as payment towards staffers’ dues. Apart from this, whatever would be left of the liquidation value owed to the staff will be paid to them on a priority basis, the order had said. Last month, the consortium had said that the liquidation value—the estimated realizable value of Jet Airways 1.0 assets on the insolvency commencement date—owed to the workers and employees is about Rs 100 crore. That is about 8% of the Rs 1,254 crore accepted claims Jet owes to its staffers towards payment of provident fund, gratuity, leave encashment and about six months’ salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jet-employees-move-nclt-over-compensation/articleshow/85473941.cms||Manju V

The cabinet, which met here on Thursday, decided to convene the session for 10 days by strictly adhering to Covid-19 protocols. This will be the first legislature session after the government led by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai took charge. The government was earlier planning to hold the session at Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi. Legislative council chairman Basavaraj Horatti, who is from Dharwad, too was in favour of the session in Belagavi. But the government reportedly decided against it keeping the pandemic in mind. This is said to have upset MLAs and people of North Karnataka as they were expecting a session in their region after a long time. In the upcoming session, BJP is likely to face attack from Congress over what the opposition calls the government’s failure in handling the Covid second wave and providing relief to flood-hit families in North Karnataka. Opposition parties are also expected to corner the government on alleged corruption in procurement of PPE and Rapid Antigen Test kits and other medical equipment. The public accounts committee headed by Congress MLA Ramalinga Reddy has already sought an explanation from officials about inflated rates at which the government is said to have procured these items. Law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said the cabinet has approved seven of the 11 Amrit projects announced by the chief minister on I-Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-to-host-10-day-session-north-karnataka-mlas-upset/articleshow/85468239.cms||---
---||India||Punitive cost be imposed or builder be sent to jail for not refunding homebuyer despite our order: SC||NEW DELHI: Taking serious view of real estate companies for not complying with its order to refund money to homebuyers, the Supreme Court on Thursday said that a stern action needed to be taken against them for taking its order lightly and warned them that their promoters would be sent to jail for non-compliance of its order. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said that not only homebuyers are harassed by non-compliance of its order but also precious court time was wasted in such cases as fresh round of litigation started with contempt petition against builders. The Court noted that only when the contempt proceedings is initiated then the builder are found ready with money to be handed over to the buyers, "I think one should go to jail for a week only then people would take our order seriously and we should also impose punitive cost on builders," Justice Chandrachud said while hearing contempt proceedings against Ireo Grace Realtech for not complying with its January order to refund around Rs One Crore to a buyer who was forced to approach SC again through her lawyer Niraj Gupta to get refund. The counsel appearing for the company tendered unconditional apology and told the bench Rs 58 lakh had been transferred in morning and a draft of Rs 50 lakh was ready to be handed over. The bench, however, said that the apology was not acceptable and it was an intentional and clear breach of its order. "We are of the view that penalty be imposed so that they realise the need to take the order of the court seriously.... We must send a message," the court said. It directed the company to pay Rs Two lakh to the buyer as compensation as she was forced to approach the court again and Rs 15 lakh to National Legal Services Authority as a punishment. It is the second time in this week that court imposed punitive cost on builders for not-compliance of its order. The court had on August 11 directed a developer to fork out Rs 15 lakh as fine in addition to refund amount. In that case also SC had directed in January to refund the amount to a homebuyer in January but the builder did not comply with its order and the homebuyer filed contempt petition against the builder through advocate Piyush Singh. "The developer has compelled the petitioner to adopt another round of litigation to secure the repayment of dues. Moreover, the conduct of the developer has involved this Court being required to entertain the contempt proceedings and to eventually secure relief to the flat purchaser. We, therefore, direct that apart from the refund which is directed in the above terms, the developer shall pay costs quantified at Rs 5 lakhs to the petitioner and shall, in addition, deposit an additional amount of Rs 10 lakhs with the National Legal Services Authority within a period of two weeks from today," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punitive-cost-be-imposed-or-builder-be-sent-to-jail-for-not-refunding-homebuyer-despite-our-order-sc/articleshow/85474175.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

We are advising exporters to take a credit cover for their shipments and in cases where there is time to meet the deadline, they should wait for things to stabilise,” a key functionary with trade body Federation of Indian Export Organisations told TOI. India’s trade with Afghanistan was not large, with the country accounting for less than 0.3% of India’s exports and 0.1% of imports, with overall trade during the last fiscal year pegged at $1.4 billion. Read AlsoNew Taliban regime casts shadow on India business in AfghanistanTaliban seizing control in Afghanistan presents a fresh challenge to Indian companies inking new business deals in the strife-torn nation. While the existing projects are financed by international agencies and are insured, Indian companies are wary of business prospects under the Taliban regime.But it may lead to temporary impact on some segments such as dry fruits, which accounted for 63% of all exports from Afghanistan. Over the next few weeks, traders expect other countries to fill the gap. For India, sugar and textiles were the two largest export items with pharma, cereals, tea, coffee and spices making it to the top seven products (see graphic).

---||World||Guard against Afghanistan payment defaults, exporters warned||NEW DELHI: Amid a freeze on fund flow kicking in, Indian exporters have been advised caution while dealing with their partners in crisis-hit Afghanistan, where the Taliban government has taken over the reins. “There is a fear of default in payments due to banking-related issues and the overall impact on lives. We are advising exporters to take a credit cover for their shipments and in cases where there is time to meet the deadline, they should wait for things to stabilise,” a key functionary with trade body Federation of Indian Export Organisations told TOI. India’s trade with Afghanistan was not large, with the country accounting for less than 0.3% of India’s exports and 0.1% of imports, with overall trade during the last fiscal year pegged at $1.4 billion. Read AlsoNew Taliban regime casts shadow on India business in AfghanistanTaliban seizing control in Afghanistan presents a fresh challenge to Indian companies inking new business deals in the strife-torn nation. While the existing projects are financed by international agencies and are insured, Indian companies are wary of business prospects under the Taliban regime.But it may lead to temporary impact on some segments such as dry fruits, which accounted for 63% of all exports from Afghanistan. Over the next few weeks, traders expect other countries to fill the gap. For India, sugar and textiles were the two largest export items with pharma, cereals, tea, coffee and spices making it to the top seven products (see graphic). Besides, some aspects such as EPC contracts that were executed by Indian firms and project exports had slowed down in recent years.

While the party’s national general secretary (organisation) said “satyameva jayate”, I&B minister Anurag Thakur said there should not be a place for violence in democracy. “...Court monitored CBI probe into all murder and rape cases and SIT probe headed by retd Supreme Court just about all other violence cases. Satyamev Jayate ....!!! Karma always haunts,” BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh tweeted. At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said the only aim of the party was to bring justice to the families of the victims as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was not able to prevent the post-poll violence in the state, nor was she able to bring justice to the victims. “Welcome Calcutta HC’s judgment ordering CBI probe into the murder and rape orchestrated in West Bengal post the poll,” Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said and added, “West Bengal police has already exposed its allegiance to the TMC and cannot be trusted to provide justice for the heinous atrocities and barbarism, that was inflicted upon countless women and children for exercising their democratic rights.” The Calcutta HC on Thursday ordered court-monitored CBI probe into alleged into murder, rape cases during post-poll violence in West Bengal and asked the central agency to file report by six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karma-always-haunts-says-bjp-after-high-court-order/articleshow/85474412.cms||---

BJP is finalising the names of its leaders who will be part of the delegation,” Nitish said while talking to reporters at Raj Bhavan here after a meeting with governor Phagu Chauhan. The meeting with the PM will be held at 11am, Nitish said, adding that the confirmation about the meeting came late on Wednesday. “The all-party delegation will urge the PM for a caste-based census in the country. Leaders of opposition parties had requested me to seek an appointment with the PM during the recently concluded monsoon session of the state legislature. I had accepted their proposal and an appointment with the PM was sought. We are thankful to the PM for giving us time to meet him,” Nitish tweeted earlier in the day. The state assembly had unanimously passed resolutions favouring caste-based census in 2019 and 2020. Nitish had argued that a caste-based census was in everyone’s interest. Tejashwi had also written to the PM on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/caste-based-census-nitish-delegation-to-meet-pm-on-monday/articleshow/85474659.cms||Ramashankar

It was a long-pending demand of the residents of these sectors, as heavy traffic jams are a regular feature at Sector 20 light-point.  HUDA chief administrator Ajit Balaji Joshi provided the detailed report of the approval to Haryana assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta during the Panchkula city development meeting. Joshi said, “Discussions were held with the NHAI officials to construct the underpass at Sector 12-A and Industrial Area road. It will not only connect Sector 20 with the other parts of the city, but also facilitate those going to Delhi or Patiala, with a direct link with the highway. At present, sectors 20 and 21 residents and those going to Delhi or Patiala have to wait in serpentine vehicle queues on narrow road under the flyover.” The underpass will solve 40% to 50% of the traffic congestion. The NHAI has sent an estimate of Rs 25 crore for its construction and HUDA will bear the project expenses, he added.  On May 21, 2018, Gupta had discussed the issue with Union minister of roads, transport and national highways Nitin Gadkari during his visit here. S K Jain, president of Joint Action Committee, Sector 20, said, “We hope the construction work will start at the earliest. There was a demand for the underpass as the flyover was constructed not taking into account the large number of housing societies that have mushroomed in the area. It is the only entry and exit to Panchkula and Chandigarh for residents. The traffic lights and narrow road, too, are a problem." Meanwhile, during a discussion on direct connectivity of Panchkula with the Chandigarh International Airport, Metro Neo and special corridor were suggested to Gupta. The officers concerned told Gupta that a special corridor can be built from Sector 17/18 dividing road connecting Makhan Majra through an underpass at railway lines and can connect to the airport road from Raipur Khurd village in Chandigarh. The speaker also discussed medical college status at Mata Mansa Devi Temple land and gave directions to remove encroachments from the area and the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/underpass-at-zirakpur-kalka-expressway-gets-nhai-nod/articleshow/85471186.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Business||Jet employees move NCLAT, say worried about dues, jobs||Manju.V@timegroup.com Mumbai: Jet Airways staffers have moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) challenging certain aspects of the Kalrock-Jalan consortium’s resolution plan that was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on June 22. The staffers also did not approve the compensation offered by the consortium with little over 3,000 (35%) of the nearly 9,000 employees voting in favour and 5,500 (62%) abstaining from voting (see graphic). The Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS) and Jet Airways Cabin Crew Association (JACCA) filed an appeal before the NCLAT on Wednesday against the consortium, the former resolution professional, Jet’s committee of creditors and monitoring committee. Arvind Sawant of BKS said, “We have two worries, one is the Jet staff’s pending dues, and the second is about their jobs, their reinstatement.” Last month, TOI had reported that the Jet staffers had planned to file an appeal. Of the 4,000-odd staffers who remained with Jet for over two years after it suspended operations in April 2019, only 50 have been retained in Jet 2.0. The remaining staffers have been hived off into a yet-to-be-formed ground handling company, according to the consortium’s resolution plan. To gain support for its resolution plan, the consortium had floated a proposal for Jet staff under which they were to get equity stake and management control of the said ground handling company. Among the other benefits, the proposal included a cash payment of Rs 22,800 to each staff, which included Rs 11,800 as reimbursement towards their parent’s medical expenses, their children’s school fees, stationery purchase and mobile recharge. But the consortium’s condition was that the proposal would be valid only if at least 95% of Jet staff voted in support of the resolution plan and not challenge its approval. Since only 35% voted in favour, the proposal has lapsed, said the consortium, in a communication on voting results, sent on Thursday. Advocate Rahul Oak, representing BKS and JACCA in NCLAT, said, “Our appeal is not against the revival of Jet, it’s about violation of major provisions of the labour laws. The workers have been moved to a company that currently has no operations and which could be liquidated at the discretion of the new owners.” The benefits listed in the now-defunct proposal was over and above the payments mentioned in the resolution plan. The NCLT order had mentioned Rs 52 crore as payment towards staffers’ dues. Apart from this, whatever would be left of the liquidation value owed to the staff will be paid to them on a priority basis, the order had said. Last month, the consortium had said that the liquidation value — the estimated realizable value of Jet Airways 1.0 assets on the insolvency commencement date — owed to the workers and employees is about Rs 100 crore. That is about 8% of the Rs 1,254-crore accepted claims Jet owes to its staffers towards payment of provident fund, gratuity, leave encashment and about six months’ salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jet-employees-move-nclat-say-worried-about-dues-jobs/articleshow/85469405.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC stays some provisions of Gujarat’s ‘anti-love jihad’ law||AHMEDABAD: In a setback for the state government, the Gujarat high court on Thursday stayed six amended provisions in the anti-conversion law covering interfaith marriages, popularly known as anti-love jihad law. The court clarified that the amended sections will not apply in cases of inter-religious marriages, which take place without force, allurement or fraudulent means. Staying the amended sections in the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav said, “The interim order is to protect the parties of interfaith marriage from being unnecessarily harassed”. The court pronounced its interim order and stated, “We are of the opinion that pending further hearing, rigors of section 3,4, 4a to 4c, 5, 6, and 6a shall not operate merely because the marriage is solemnised by a person of one religion with person of another religion without force, allurement or fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriage for the purpose of unlawful conversion.” The stay on these sections effectively means that an FIR under this law cannot be lodged merely on the basis of an interfaith marriage. Advocate general Kamal Trivedi asked for a clarification whether the provisions of the amended law will apply if interfaith marriage results in forceful conversion. To this, CJ Nath said that the provisions cannot be applied if there is no force or allurement involved in conversion. The Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, which penalises forcible or fraudulent religious conversion through marriage, was notified by the state government on June 15. Similar laws have also been enacted by BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. According to the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act (2003) conversion by “or any fraudulent means” was a punishable offence. This clause was replaced with “or by any fraudulent means or by marriage or by getting a person married or by aiding a person to get married” in the 2021 amended act. The Gujarat’s amendments were challenged by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and an activist Mujahid Nafees by terming them in violation of various constitutional provisions including Article 25. The petitions were filed through advocate Mohammed Isa Hakim and senior counsel Mihir Joshi contended that the provisions are encroachment on citizen’s right to privacy in her decision of marriage. They argued that the law effectively rendered interfaith marriages illegal, unless permission is sought from competent authority. During the hearings, the court repeatedly questioned the government whether it intended to prohibit interfaith marriages because it is a matter of personal choice. The court was also concerned about the government’s bid to shift burden of proof on the accused that after lodgement of FIR, a person has to go to jail and then he has to prove that the marriage has taken place without coercion. This is because the amended law provides for any relative of the victim to file a complaint. Jamiat Ulema Gujarat, in a media statement, said that with the HC’s stay, FIR under this law cannot be filed until the elements of force or allurement are not proved for conversion after interfaith marriages. Till date, three FIRs have been registered after amendment in the Act. In one case, the woman, after filing a complaint against her husband and in-laws, has approached the HC for quashing the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-stays-some-sections-of-gujarats-love-jihad-law/articleshow/85470087.cms||Saeed Khan

The seer, who had earlier sat on an almost 200-day fast which he broke in 2019 after the government's assurance, said that he was "still waiting for his demands to be fulfilled". His demands included forming a SIT to investigate the deaths of Swami Nigmanand and Swami Sanand. Both died while agitating for the free flow of Ganga. Two days ago Matri Sadan issued a demand letter in which he also alleged that "there is mafia rule in Haridwar with the help of a system for the past several years". This network should be investigated by the Centre, the letter stated. Swami Shivanand Saraswati, head of Matri Sadan, said, "The SIT under the supervision of a sitting high court judge should investigate the deaths. Also, all assurances regarding Ganga given by the government to the Matri Sadan should be implemented immediately."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/matri-sadan-seer-resumes-indefinite-fast-against-rampant-mining-in-ganga/articleshow/85466019.cms||MS Nawaz

There should be no politics when it comes to development,” Tejashwi said after unveiling the statue of former RJD MLA Rajballabh Yadav’s father Jahaal Prasad at Nawada. He said apart from caste-based census, he would also request PM Modi to send a central team to flood-affected Bihar and announce a special package. Tejashwi also criticised JD(U)’s Rajya Sabha member and Union minister RCP Singh for “ignoring” flood-affected people. “The minister chose to attend the programme organised to welcome him instead of meeting the flood-hit people,” he said. Meanwhile, Tejashwi downplayed the war of words between his elder brother Tej Pratap and RJD’s state chief Jagadanand Singh. “Everything is fine in party. I am not worried and others should also not worry about it,” Tejashwi told reporters here before leaving for Nawada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-will-seek-special-flood-package-for-bihar-from-pm/articleshow/85467021.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The floods have so far claimed lives of 23 people in the state. When Union minister and Begusarai MP Giriraj Singh visited a few villages in Barauni and adjoining villages in Matihani and Bachhwara blocks of the district on Wednesday, he faced ire of people seeking relief and assistance from the administration. Also, Singh could not visit a few other villages that he had desired as he could not get the required boats from the administration on time. The Bachhwara sub-divisional administration had sent the available two boats at the time to the flood-hit village to conduct rescue and relief operations. In fact, the number of flood-affected people in the state increased by over five lakh in the last three days. The number of the affected blocks and villages has increased to 100 and 2,628, respectively. The total number of flood-affected people stood at 37 lakh on Thursday compared to 32.29 lakh on Tuesday, state disaster management department (DMD) said. Over 1.35 lakh people have been displaced as a result of the floods across 16 districts, and as many as 11.59 lakh people had day and night meals at 865 community kitchens set up in the districts concerned. The DMD communique also said the authorities of the affected districts have been transferring the gratuitous relief (GR) money worth Rs 6,000 per family into the bank accounts of one member each of the affected families. The DMD also said that in view of the increase in the number of villages hit by the floodwaters, the number NDRF and SDRF teams has also been increased to 17 and 12, respectively, to conduct rescue and relief operations. Meanwhile, the pressure of floodwaters on villages has increased in the basin of the Mahananda river in Kishanganj and Katihar districts, as the river has been flowing above the danger level. With the Ganga flowing 10cm below the highest flood level of 34.86 metres at Bhagalpur, it has flooded the blocks lying along the two banks up to Kahalgaon and Pirpainty the district. The flood has also impacted the district’s northern blocks. On the other hand, the Ganga was flowing 2.25m below the danger level at Buxar and 13cm at Digha in Patna. From Gandhi Ghat (Patna) onwards along the downstream up to Kahalgaon, the water level of the river has been falling, even though the river is still flowing above the danger level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/floods-hit-37-lakh-claim-lives-of-23-people-in-16-bihar-districts/articleshow/85468878.cms||Abhay Singh

Speaking during the discussion over supplementary budget in Vidhan Sabha, the CM said property worth Rs 1,500 had been seized from criminals. “It is surprising that those who talk about women’s welfare, their government in a state did everything possible to provide protection to a dreaded mafia,” the CM said, in an apparent reference to the Congress government in Punjab where mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari was lodged. He was brought to UP earlier this year and is currently lodged in Banda jail. “There are many who will again try to give patronage to the mafia. After all, elections are approaching. However, time and scenario has changed. One should keep in mind that now if one wants to roam around with the mafia, a bulldozer will certainly be following them,” the CM said. He said state government not only seized the property of mafia elements but also demolished their illegal premises. “It was the government’s property. The state government will ensure houses for the poor and Dalits on the land that has been freed from the mafia,” Yogi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-houses-for-poor-dalits-will-be-built-on-land-freed-from-mafia/articleshow/85473224.cms||---

The committees, in their interim report submitted to the minister on Thursday, have suggested better interaction of universities with industries, introduction of flexible and innovative curricula, and creation of a state-level accreditation council. The panel on academic reforms, headed by Patna University’s vice-chancellor (VC) G K Chaudhary, recommended that all universities in the state should have representatives from industries and employment agencies on the board of studies in order to make the syllabi more employable. Laying stress on the need to introduce choice-based credit system (CBCS) and semester system for all courses at both the undergraduate and the postgraduate stages, the committee suggested that the policy of reappointment of competent and qualified teachers after their retirement should be reintroduced. Besides, the committee also pleaded for introduction of more career-oriented courses based on local requirements. The committee on NAAC accreditation, headed by Lalit Narayan Mithila University’s pro-VC Dolly Sinha, recommended the creation of a state-level accreditation council. It also said the government should sanction development grants to colleges on the basis of their NAAC reports and grades. The committee further suggested that institutions which continue to evade NAAC assessment should be punished. Another panel, headed by Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University’s VC Neelima Gupta, recommended implementation of multiple-entry and multiple-exit system and more institutional autonomy. It also recommended formulation of well-knit strategies for development and change and paradigm shift from classroom to online teaching. The fourth committee on quality assurance, headed by Magadh University’s VC Rajendra Prasad, pleaded for establishment of the Bihar Research Foundation for accelerating the pace of scientific research in the institutions of higher education. The vice-chairman of the BSHEC, Kameshwar Jha, told this newspaper that the committees were expected to submit their final reports in October after due deliberations on their interim findings. “The state government is committed to implement all these valuable findings for raising the standard of higher education,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/panel-pleads-for-creation-of-bihar-accreditation-council/articleshow/85466271.cms||B K Mishra

We believe that this successful issuance will set the road for other Indian players looking to raise AT-1 bonds in the overseas markets,” said HDFC Bank treasurer Ashish Parthasarthy. The AT-1 notes will be listed on the India International Exchange (IFSC). AT-1 bonds are considered quasi-equity as they can be perpetual. Also, they add to the bank’s capital base and can be written off first if a bank faces solvency issues.

Addressing the first Manoj Kumar Srivastava annual memorial lecture through a video link, Banerjee cited an ASER survey of 2011-16 to highlight the poor education system in government schools across the country. “Less than 50% of the students in Class V can read a Standard II text,” he quoted and added that it was found that in comparison to school-going children, those who never went to school were good at mathematics. He also said the Covid-19 pandemic had impacted the education system in developing economies the most. Banerjee recounted how Manoj, a 1980-batch IAS officer of the Bihar cadre, used to go deep into any topic and one could learn a lot from him. Recalling his first meeting with the IAS officer, who was a down-to-earth man, RJD MP Manoj Jha said the former challenged the authorities even in the later parts of his career like he did in his probationary period. Former Union minister and Patna Saheb MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said Manoj was always optimistic towards empowerment and changes in society. Bihar chief secretary Tripurari Sharan recalled how Manoj worked on a method of research, study, and evidence and went to Cornell for studies when people of his age were in pursuit of financial success. Vice-president, ADB and former election commissioner of India, Ashok Lavasa, said Manoj really saw things with a different perspective. Padma Shri awardee Dr Vijay Prakash, Congress MP Akhilesh Kumar Singh, and retired IAS officer Vyasji also shared their memories about Manoj. CPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said Manoj noted way back that information is essential for the transformation of society. Late Manoj’s wife Neena Srivastava welcomed the guests. Several IAS officers, academics, doctors, and people from the social service sector and politics graced the occasion.

District education officers (DEOs) and their subordinates found that the absentee teachers were on leave without prior information. The directorate of secondary education on Thursday ordered deduction of salary of these absentee teachers on the principle of ‘no pay for no work’. The department has clarified that leave without permission of the head of the school would be treated as unauthorised absence. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said at the last review meeting with all district collectors and educational officials, including DEOs and DPOs, he had asked them to make surprise visits to government schools. Of 38 districts, the education officials found teachers absent in 18 districts.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a yellow alert on Thursday, predicting heavy rainfall along with thunderstorm and lightning at isolated places in Bihar on Friday, Sunday and Monday. The Patna Metrological Centre, however, issued an alert, forecasting heavy rainfall at isolated places in western Bihar on Saturday and in a few areas in the north-eastern districts on Sunday and Monday. While heavy rainfall is likely to occur in Kishanganj, Araria, and Purnia on Friday, thunderstorm and lightning are expected in Kishanganj, Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria, Purnia, Katihar, Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Khagaria, and Jamui on Saturday.

Hussain’s three colleagues from J&K, including Mohammad Aasif Shah and Adil Rasool, are also stranded on the university campus in Kabul. Abid’s younger brother Majid Hussain, former deputy mayor of Muzaffarpur, said his brother, though stuck on the university campus, is completely safe. “We are hopeful that the government of India will rescue all countrymen stranded in Afghanistan, including my brother. The Union ministry of external affairs authorities communicated with Abid and others on Wednesday night and asked them to remain prepared to leave the country with just two luggage,” he said. Majid said he has no knowledge if the team in Kabul or MEA authorities are in touch with Taliban for safe passage of the trapped Indians. “Abid and others are living in their quarters on the university campus. The mess is functioning and they are getting food. The university authorities are in constant touch with them,” he said. The former mayor said his elder brother had come home for a few days and returned to Kabul on July 25. “The situation suddenly deteriorated in Kabul on August 15. The university is shut now,” he added. “Abid was supposed to return to India by a commercial flight on Wednesday. However, all commercial flights have been grounded in Afghanistan now,” he said. Majid said Abid has a wife, a daughter studying in Class II and a son who is an Intermediate student. “We all live together in Chandwara,” he said, adding Majid had joined the Bakhtar University almost one-and-a-half-years back. TOI traced the twitter handle of Abid and found that he had tweeted at 9.42pm on August 15, seeking rescue after Taliban entered Kabul. Abid tweeted, “We are four Indians teaching in one university in Afghanistan and are stuck. We have tried several times to coordinate with the embassy people, but to no avail. Kindly rescue us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/professors-from-muz-jk-still-stuck-at-kabul-varsity/articleshow/85466974.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Sidhu himself handed over the appointment letter to Mustafa in the presence of his wife Razia Sultana, who is a minister in the Congress government. Mustafa said, “How could I say no this time? He showed the magnanimity of a great human being and came down to my house, almost unnotified. I have done no favours, just nothing for him ever. But he said the system did not recognise my contribution in restoration of peace to the state and instead humiliated me and that he wanted to do his bit to reinstate my honour. I feel privileged to work with a man of honour like him.” Earlier, Mustafa was named one of the advisers to the PPCC president but the former DGP had said he would continue to work for the revival of Congress in Punjab and offer support to Sidhu without any political position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mustafa-is-principal-strategic-adviser-to-sidhu/articleshow/85471175.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Fishy telephone exchange busted in Gujarat||VADODARA: An illegal telephone exchange that could have been used for terror activities or extortion was busted in Borsad town of Anand. The local crime branch of Anand police arrested two men, who claim to be caretakers of this exchange set up using four SIM boxes, 61 SIM cards and five wifi routers, on Wednesday. LCB sleuths conducted a raid based on a tip-off and arrested the duo identified as Babar Ali Ansari and his cousin Mir Faisal Ansari. However, the duo said that they were only taking care of the unit in their house for a monthly rent of up to Rs 40,000 while the operator is a man named Jaleel in Dubai. The pre-activated sim cards found from them were procured from West Bengal and Odisha. Cops suspect that fake documents of real people could have been used to purchase the sim cards. During interrogation, the two accused said that they set up the exchange after coming in contact with a person through Facebook over a year ago. After they agreed to set up the unit, they received all devices and sim cards through courier and kept the exchange functional for almost a year. “Through this technology, all international calls can be made to look like local calls, bypassing international rates and make the service provider incur loss. So, there will be loss to public exchequer too and the offence of impersonation is also committed,” said LCB inspector KG Chaudhary. Police are, however, widening their scope of investigation to find out if the exchange was used for making extortion calls or terror activities. “We are following some leads and also investigating in that direction if any extortion calls were made,” said another police official. Police said that on getting more information about Jaleel, more details will be unraveled. The cyber crime cops are further probing the case after an offence of cheating and criminal conspiracy, and violation of Information Technology Act, Indian Telegraph Act and Indian Wireless Telegraph Act was registered at Anand Cyber Crime police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/illegal-exchange-with-sim-box-busted/articleshow/85465958.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Allahabad HC sets aside Uttar Pradesh govt order designating Nayak, Ojha as STs||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has set aside the order of the state government under which two Gond sub-castes — Nayak and Ojha — were designated in the category of Scheduled Tribes (STs). While allowing the writ petition filed by Nayak Jan Seva Sansthan, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Rajendra Kumar held on August 13 that the UP government was not empowered to refer to sub-caste Nayak and Ojha of Gond caste as falling in the category of Scheduled Tribe (ST), thereby interpreting or substituting the 2003 notification of the Central government notifying certain castes as Scheduled Tribes (STs). In the writ petition, the petitioner’s plea was that the power to issue a notification declaring castes to fall in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category lies with the Central government under Article 342 of the Constitution of India and in pursuant to this, a gazette notification was issued on January 8, 2003, to notify certain castes to be Scheduled Tribes for 13 districts of the state of UP. Later, on July 15, 2020, a notification was issued by the state government while naming some castes in 13 districts of the state as per a notification of 2003. It further added that the two sub-castes of Gond, i.e., Nayak and Ojha be included in the category of Scheduled Tribes. The petitioner argued that such reference was not in the domain of the state government as it cannot tinker or substitute the notification of 2003 published in the Gazette under Article 342 of the Constitution of India. On the other hand, the state government plea was that the order of 2020 was in consonance to the Gazette notification dated January 8, 2003, and the necessity to issue the order under challenge was due to the malpractices adopted by some persons to take caste certificate fraudulently claiming to be a candidate of Gond caste. It was argued by the counsel of the state government that the order had wrongly been taken as an order either for interpretation or substitution of the Gazette Notification of the Government of India. On this submission of the state government, the court clarified that while issuing caste certificates in favour of reserve caste candidates of the Gond category, the state government would be at liberty to make proper scrutiny of the application so that caste certificate may not be taken fraudulently by any person. The court after hearing concerned parties allowed the petition and set aside the state government order of July 15, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-sets-aside-up-govt-order-designating-nayak-ojha-as-sts/articleshow/85471836.cms||---

Though a suicide note accused the two of pressuring him, in her order Justice Bharati Dangre said that prima facie it was an instance of how a common man had suffered on account of the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic.

Marked by the lethal Covid second wave, the five months from January to May recorded 80,231 deaths this year, as per Health Management Information System (HMIS) data of the Government of India (GoI). This is 83% higher compared to the average 43,880 deaths recorded between January and May in the past three years from 2018 to 2020. In 2018, Gujarat had recorded 47,923 all-cause deaths in the first five months. This figure was 42,652 in 2019 and 41,067 in 2020. The two months of April and May 2021, according to HMIS data, recorded 26,050 and 29,690 deaths respectively, which were about 3.5 times more than 2020. In all, about 36,351 more deaths were recorded this year as compared to the average of the past three years. The number of all cause deaths this year far exceeds the number of official Covid-19 fatalities reported by Gujarat government. According to the state health department data, Gujarat recorded 2,664 deaths of Covid-19 patients in April and 2,650 in May. In all, 2021 recorded 5,526 deaths of Covid patients from January to May, which accounts for only 15% of the 36,000 additional all cause deaths reported this year. Majority of the deaths were recorded as ‘causes not known’ in the HMIS. Chronic diseases caused about 13% and 14% deaths in April and May respectively, whereas 8% and 9% died due to respiratory complications, according to HMIS data. Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health), said that would be able to comment on the statistics after studying them in detail. Sources at the state health department said that there indeed was a spike in death after the second wave due to long-term Covid impact. “But Gujarat, like all other states, follows a method to ascertain whether a specific death can be considered a Covid death. For example, if a person passes away 20 days after discharge from a hospital, the death would not be considered a Covid death. Likewise, those with existing comorbidities are also not counted according to the national guidelines,” said an official. Medical experts pointed out that Covid impacted lungs, heart and blood vessels of the patients along with other internal organs. A recent study of Covid deceased at BJ Medical College indicated that cardiac issues were the predominant reason for deaths among the young and blood clotting among elderly patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/36k-more-all-cause-deaths-in-jan-may-21/articleshow/85470007.cms||Parth Shastri

Addressing the first Manoj Kumar Srivastava annual memorial lecture through a video link, Banerjee cited an ASER survey of 2011-16 to highlight the poor education system in government schools across the country. “Less than 50% of the students in Class V can read a Standard II text,” he quoted and added that it was found that in comparison to school-going children, those who never went to school were good at mathematics. He also said the Covid-19 pandemic had impacted the education system in developing economies the most. Banerjee recounted how Manoj, a 1980-batch IAS officer of the Bihar cadre, used to go deep into any topic and one could learn a lot from him. Recalling his first meeting with the IAS officer, who was a down-to-earth man, RJD MP Manoj Jha said the former challenged the authorities even in the later parts of his career like he did in his probationary period. Former Union minister and Patna Saheb MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said Manoj was always optimistic towards empowerment and changes in society. Bihar chief secretary Tripurari Sharan recalled how Manoj worked on a method of research, study, and evidence and went to Cornell for studies when people of his age were in pursuit of financial success. Vice-president, ADB and former election commissioner of India, Ashok Lavasa, said Manoj really saw things with a different perspective. Padma Shri awardee Dr Vijay Prakash, Congress MP Akhilesh Kumar Singh, and retired IAS officer Vyasji also shared their memories about Manoj. CPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said Manoj noted way back that information is essential for the transformation of society. Late Manoj’s wife Neena Srivastava welcomed the guests. Several IAS officers, academics, doctors, and people from the social service sector and politics graced the occasion. Raushni Shrivastava conducted the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-19-has-impacted-edu-system-in-developing-economies-most-expert/articleshow/85467513.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

---||Business||Birla Sun Life cuts term rates as vaccinations rise||MUMBAI: Going against the trend, Birla Sun Life Insurance (BSLI) has decided to reduce its pricing on term policies. At a time when insurers are wary of large proposals, the private life company is optimistic on the health front given the surge in vaccinations. Speaking to TOI, BSLI MD & CEO Kamlesh Rao said, “Our sense is that consciousness on health is going up. It is a good time to issue medically underwritten policies in the Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 crore range.” He added that the company has decided to drop prices 6-10% as part of a strategy to increase focus on protection. In FY21, many insurers were forced to increase prices on group term policies as reinsurers turned wary and Covid deaths resulted in large payouts. This prompted many life companies to turn cautious in underwriting high-value individual term insurance too. BSLI is bullish on term insurance despite seeing a surge in life claims during the second wave of the pandemic. “Covid accounted for 15-16% of claims in the previous financial year. As against that, 40-42% of claims during the first quarter were due to Covid,” said Rao. While those who have recovered from Covid are also covered, there will be a short cooling period. Net of reinsurance, the company’s Q1FY22 Covid claims amounted to Rs 108 crore. In addition to this, the company is carrying reserves of Rs 100 crore for claims in Q2FY22. BSLI’s individual first-year premium grew 5% year-on-year in the first quarter on the back of a 5% growth in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. According to Rao, the company’s digital transformation has enabled it to grow business even during the lockdown months as almost half the proposals are now underwritten straight-through by software. In the first quarter, the company sourced 91% of its individual policies digitally with most of the proposers opting for autopay, which has helped improve 13-month persistency by two percentage points to 83%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/birla-sun-life-cuts-term-rates-as-vaccinations-rise/articleshow/85469319.cms||Mayur Shetty

A session was first held on August 5, in Vishranti Dhama building of Dimhans for inpatients diagnosed with depression and their family members by Dr Shridhar Kulkarni, Dr Manjunath B, and Dr Shanteri Pai. Also present were nursing staff and students, and other employees of Dimhans. The session consisted of special ragas specifically recommended for depression such as Darbari Kanada, Brindavani Sarang, and Raag Yaman. Both active and passive forms of therapy were used. The session was for one hour. Another music therapy session was conducted on August 12 in the same venue. Music therapy is now planned as a regular intervention for inpatients once a week on every Thursday evening. For those who are new to music therapy, it involves use of specific ragas to address the physical, emotional, cognitive and social needs of a group or individual. Darbari Kanada, or simply Raga Darbari, is a raga in the Kanada family which is thought to have originated in Carnatic music. In 2019, researchers Samarpita Chatterjee and Roan Mukherjee investigated the effect raga Darbari Kanada (music therapy intervention) on psychological variables such as depression, anxiety and stress among elderly adults. They asked participants to listen to the instrumental version of the raga every day before sleeping at night for a total of eight weeks. The results revealed the two-months music therapy progressively and significantly lowered depression, anxiety, stress, as well as sleeping problems in the participants. Brindavani Sarang or Brindabani Sarang, also known as Vridavani Sarang or raga Sarang, is a Hindustani classical raga. Raga Yaman consists of consists of seven notes and is regarded one of the grandest and most fundamental ragas in Hindustani music. All these ragas have been of interest to researchers on management of psychological problems. Music therapy in India is still in nascent stages, and needs to undergo rigorous research using strong methodology. Dimhans Music Therapy and Research Unit intends to conduct such systematic research trials to contribute to the understanding of how music therapy impacts a person’s body and mind, and differential the effect of each raga. The unit’s steam is excited and are fully devoted to contributing to scientific knowledge of music therapy using Indian ragas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/music-therapy-at-dimhans-to-bring-solace-to-inmates/articleshow/85465584.cms||---

The police had launched an investigation into various angles, including murder, suicide and accidental death, following public uproar. The sister of the deceased had submitted details of call records and messages to the police for investigation. Based on these, the police had summoned several people to the Calangute police station for inquiry. A senior police officer said that even after questioning the people who had contacted the girl before her death through calls or messages, they have not been able to draw any inferences. The police had also examined the CCTV footage of beach shacks located near the area where the teen’s body was found, but had not found anything useful. “The investigation is not closed. We are working to clear all the apprehensions of the family,” the police officer said. The family and neighbours of the teen have been demanding for justice in the case. Her body was discovered on the morning of August 13 on a busy stretch of Calangute beach in a semi-nude condition, with her clothing nowhere in sight. The police have also been trying to locate her clothes. Calangute PI Nolasco Raposo had told TOI that the report of the autopsy, which was conducted at Goa Medical College (GMC), had attributed the cause of death to drowning. He ruled out any sexual assault. On Saturday, the parents of the teen had lashed out at the Goa Police, with her father claiming that the police confused him while he was still disturbed after seeing his daughter’s body, and took a “wrong statement” from him. He had also accused the police of spreading lies to the media regarding his relationship with his daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teens-death-no-clues-in-girls-phone-records/articleshow/85471922.cms||Murari Shetye

Initially, the project would be taken up in Sircilla Rajanna and Mulugu districts and the health department has been asked to come up with detailed guidelines on the scheme. On Thursday, ministers KT Rama Rao, Errabelli Dayakar Rao and Satyavathi Rathod held a meeting with health and IT department officials on the modalities of the health profile project. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had recently announced that the government would prepare a health profile of the state which would be helpful in understanding and preventing medical problems faced by people. A couple of years ago the state government had taken up ‘Kanti Velugu’ programme to conduct eye screening in the entire state. Free spectacles were also distributed to the people who needed them. After the meeting, the ministers said the government would speed up the health profile project. “Several services have already been provided through IT and using technology in the state. The database on the health profile of people would also be used for analysing their conditions, seasonal diseases in various districts, taking preventive measures and providing treatment,” KTR said. The group of ministers said that in the pilot districts all the details would be taken at the doorstep with the help of health staff who would collect blood and urine samples. If anybody needs further tests, services would be provided at Telangana diagnostic centres and primary health centres. “Countries such as Estonia which have already come up with the health profile of their citizen would also be studied,” Dayakar Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-set-to-roll-out-project-to-map-health-of-all/articleshow/85471273.cms||Koride Mahesh

According to sources, the 11-phase election will first be conducted in those districts where there are no floods. Heavy showers have inundated major parts of north Bihar. A DM posted in a north Bihar district told this reporter on Thursday that country boats would be used to transport the polling personnel from their camps to the booths in some of the worst-affected villages. “But we hope the situation will improve gradually,” he said, requesting anonymity as the election schedule is yet to be announced officially by the SEC. Polling will be conducted in the flood-affected districts in the last phase. Additional chief secretary, Sanjay Kumar, had earlier told mediapersons that the panchayat election would first be conducted in the districts of south Bihar. Meanwhile, the first level verification of the electronic voting machines (EVM) and their coding have to be completed by Friday. This is for the first time that the panchayat election will be held through EVMs. Voting for the posts of mukhiya, ward member, panchayat samiti member and zila parishad member will be done through EVMs and that for the posts of panch and sarpanch through ballot papers. With the state cabinet giving its nod for the upcoming panchayat polls on Tuesday, political parties have stepped up their activities in rural areas to back the candidates owing allegiance to them. “Although the panchayat polls are not held on party lines in the state, it will impact the next Lok Sabha and assembly elections,” claimed Prince Kumar, the mukhiya of Raspur Patasia panchayat in Samastipur district. The BJP, a major ally of the ruling JD (U), has already announced that it will support the candidates of the zila parishad in the election. However, the SEC has banned the use of flags and banners of political parties for election purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sec-to-seek-report-on-condition-in-flood-affected-dists-from-dms/articleshow/85467657.cms||Ramashankar

---||Patna||I am only answerable to Lalu, says Jagadanand; Tej Pratap fumes||PATNA: In an apparent dig at former health minister Tej Pratap, RJD’s state president Jagadanand Singh on Thursday said he was only answerable to party chief Lalu Prasad. Tej, on the other hand, dared Singh to take action against him and also made a vitriolic attack on Sanjay Yadav, political adviser of his younger brother and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Tej said if action was not taken against Jagadanand, he would stop participating in party activities. The ugly spat between the two netas unfurled a day after Jagadanand showed door to Tej’s close aide Aakash Yadav and appointed Gagan Kumar as the state president of Chhatra RJD. While Tej had described this move as against party’s constitution and claimed Aakash was not given any notice before his removal, Jagadanand made it clear he had absolute right to appoint the Chhatra RJD president as he was holding the charge of party’s state president. While interacting with mediapersons at the RJD office here on Thursday, Jagadanand said Aakash was not removed from the post of state president of Chhatra RJD as he had never appointed him to this post. “Show me the paper if he (Aakash) had been nominated,” Singh said. Asked about Tej’s allegation that he had violated the party constitution, Jagadanand asked, “Who is Tej Pratap?” Reminded by mediapersons that Tej is the patron of Chhatra RJD, Jagadanand said, “Who made him the patron? If I declare myself as the President of India, will I become so?” A senior RJD leader said Gagan’s appointment was necessary to stop Tej from going against party lines and mistreating senior leaders. “From party workers to senior leaders, people associated with RJD are happy with Jagada Babu’s stand,” he said. Tej, meanwhile, continued his attack on Jagadanand even on Thursday. “He (Jagadanand) is a coward and has no status to take action against me. I am Lalu’s son,” Tej told a news channel. Through a series of tweets, Tej also lashed Tejashwi’s aide Sanjay and described him as a ‘pravasi salahkar’. “The party is functioning as per the instruction of a pravasi salahkar. In Haryana, he could not make anyone sarpnach in his family. How will he make my Arjun the chief minister of Bihar? He can only create tussles in Lalu family and RJD,” Tej tweeted. He later held a press conference to hit out at the RJD state chief. Asked about Jagadanand’s ‘who is Tej Pratap’ remark, he said, “I am Lalu’s son”. “He (Jagadanand) did not consult me before removing the Chhatra RJD state president. He had gone against the RJD’s constitution and I will take him to the court,” Tej said. “Bugle has been blown before the war and I will also do the shankhnaad,” Tej said. Asked whether he will form a separate front, Tej said, "RJD is our party. It has been nurtured with the sweat and blood of the poor, backwards and extremely backwards.” He also hit out at party’s national vice-president Shivannad Tiwari who had supported Jagadanand. “Everyone knows that it was Shivanand who had sent my father to jail. He wants to break the party since the beginning,” Tej said. After the press conference, he again tweeted, “Tej pratap Yadav is a warrior of Lalu who will fight for Laluwadi ideas till his last breath.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/i-am-only-answerable-to-lalu-says-jagadanand-tej-fumes/articleshow/85467095.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||No processions, mass gatherings today: Patna DM||PATNA: In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, no religious processions and mass gatherings will be allowed in Patna district on the 10th day of Muharram, also known as Yaum-e-Ashura, on Friday. Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh told this reporter on Thursday that people were, however, free to organize religious events in their houses in the presence of their family members. The DM also instructed all the circle officers, cops, SDOs and SDPOs to ensure that neither ‘tazias’ (a replica of the mausoleum of Imam Hussain) nor weapons are displayed at public places on Friday. He told them that all kinds of processions, demonstrations, public events and programmes related to Muharram would be banned. Singh asked the officials concerned to coordinate with the members of peace committees at the block and sub-divisional levels and ensure peaceful observance of Muharram. “Inform them about the decision of the government and the district administration,” he said. The cops and other officials, on the other hand, were told to remain vigilant. They were also asked to keep tabs on the circulation of objectionable messages, photos, and rumours on social media platforms and take legal action against the anti-social elements involved in such activities. Muharram, which marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, is observed in remembrance of Prophet Muhammad’s grandson, Imam Hussain, and his family and companions, who were martyred by the Yazid army in Karbala in modern Iraq in 680 AD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-processions-mass-gatherings-today-dm/articleshow/85466543.cms||---

Notebooks (laptops) continue to hold a majority share, being the most sought computing devices. Analysts said that one device per person in a family is emerging as the norm as remote work and learning continues giving a big boost to the personal computing market. Brands also reported healthy channel availability, and most global vendors are prioritising inventory to growth markets such as India, they added.  The India PC market (inclusive of desktops, notebooks and workstations) recorded a 50.5% YoY shipments growth in April to June, according to data from International Data Corporation (IDC). A total of 3.2 million PCs were shipped in the quarter, with all product categories reporting strong double-digit growth despite absence of any large education and government deal, IDC said. IDC’s data showed that the consumer segment grew over 110% YoY and around 6% sequentially in April-June as home learning boosted demand. The commercial segment grew a modest 14% YoY as enterprises — especially the IT and ITeS companies — continued buying to manage the ongoing work-from-home scenario. HP, Dell and Lenovo emerged as the top three brands with market shares of 34%, 22% and 18% respectively, according to IDC’s estimations. IDC India research manager (client devices) Jaipal Singh said that schools and educational institutions being shut indefinitely has converted those learning on smartphones to buy laptops for long-term use and for factors such as protecting their vision. The purchase of laptops by enterprises is improving as remote work continues and desktop buying is backed by BFSI and other sectors, he added. Rushabh Doshi, director at research firm Canalys, said PC vendors now have two key business opportunities in front of them — the first-time PC users and upgraders. “With the installed base having blown up massively in the past year, upgrade opportunities will provide a strong long-term sales pipeline.” Canalys notes a 42% growth YoY in shipments in April-June. PC vendor Lenovo sees demand for premiumisation as consumers seek better features, given the higher, more long-term usage. There is demand for flexible machines with better battery life, larger screen sizes for tablets, and better processing speed and display quality so that work PCs can double up as a device for gaming and entertainment, Lenovo PCSD India MD Shailendra Katyal said. Component’s shortage issues remain an issue for the sector, but analysts note that the extent of order shortfalls and backlogs is reducing. Gartner research director analyst Mikako Kitagawa said that given the specs, the enterprise PC market was impacted relatively higher by semiconductor shortage, while the consumer market was less impacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pc-market-expands-50-yoy-in-apr-june/articleshow/85468400.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Justice Subramonium Prasad stated that the offences under the NDPS Act cannot be equated with those under the IPC. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS) was enacted to curb this menace and therefore its purpose must be kept in mind while considering the grant of bail in such cases, he added.

---||Delhi||Delhi: AIIMS Trauma Centre may resume non-Covid services||NEW DELHI: AIIMS Trauma Centre is planning to resume non-Covid services in a phased manner. It was declared a Covid-19 facility in March last year and all non-Covid emergencies were shifted to the main institute. Recently, resident doctors’ association (RDA) of AIIMS wrote to the institute director seeking the commencement of trauma services at the centre. Sources said a meeting was held recently on the issue where head of the centre, Dr Rajesh Malhotra, proposed that non-trauma services can be resumed in a phased manner. Among others, it has been proposed that three out of five main operation theatres should be made operational. There are also plans to re-designate some of the ICUs and wards for non-Covid trauma services. “Right now, most of the beds designated for Covid-19 at our centre are lying vacant. But, we still cannot shut the Covid management plan implemented so meticulously over months, because cases may start rising again as it happened in March,” said a senior official. He added that in February many Covid beds at the hospital were lying vacant and they were considering resumption of non-Covid services when suddenly, March onwards, the cases started rising exponentially. Officials said that this time the plan is to start non-Covid trauma services in a phased manner. “Our emergency at main AIIMS is handling close to 150-200 patients daily. The problem we are facing is mainly lack of OTs and ICUs and wards to admit them. Initially, we have proposed to start three OTs where non-emergency trauma surgeries can take place. The trauma surgery, neurosurgery and orthopaedic – all three key divisions – will be allocated a limited number of beds in the ICU and wards for non-covid patients at the trauma patients. If Covid situation remains stable or improves, the number of such services/facilities can be increased further,” an official said. The proposal is yet to receive a go-ahead from the administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-trauma-centre-may-resume-non-covid-services/articleshow/85468880.cms||---

With this, SuVitas will become a 100% subsidiary of HCAH and its CEO Antra Bhargava as well as one of the founders Dr Ramesh Byrapaneni will join the HCAH board. HCAH said the acquisition will help it emerge as one of India’s largest chronic and pre and post hospital focused healthcare delivery platform that would act like a ‘hospital outside of the hospital’. Pointing out that the acquisition was aimed at holistic business growth, HCAH co-founder & CEO Vivek Srivastava said with the acquisition the company has expanded its service portfolio in the transition care segment. “With SuVitas running centres at Bengaluru & Hyderabad, this acquisition helps in making our reach much stronger in South India too,” he added. SuVitas, which started out with 50 private rooms in 2015, currently runs two facilities in Hyderabad and Bengaluru with over 100 private beds providing post-hospitalisation rehab care for patients. HCAH, on the other hand, delivers healthcare services, including home ICU, chronic disease management, step-down care, post-operative care, home cancer treatment, home dialysis, physiotherapy, attendant services, and elderly care along with and other ancillary services such as labs, equipment, and pharmacy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hcah-acquires-hyd-based-suvitas/articleshow/85449420.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Karandlaje turns farmer in Udupi||Mangaluru: Shobha Karandlaje, Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare, joined farmers to cultivate paddy on fallow land at Kadekar village in Udupi district on Thursday. Kedarotthana Trust, headed by Udupi MLA K Raghupathi Bhat, has set a goal of converting 1,500 acre of fallow land in Udupi district into paddy fields. Accordingly, paddy will be cultivated on 140 acres of fallow land in Kadekar village. The minister suggested that the MLA ensure the participation of more farmers in the trust’s initiative and form a farmers’ cooperative. “Farmers are reluctant to invest in agriculture, thinking that it is unviable, so the central government has launched several schemes for the welfare of small and medium farmers. Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana has been launched to give emphasis to traditional organic farming. Demand for organic farm produce is increasing in the international market. The crop insurance scheme launched by the PM allows farmers to report crop loss using mobile apps, and avail benefits without visiting government officers. Farmers may upload the pictures of crop loss directly to the app, to avail compensation. The government aims at multiplying the income of Indian farmers,” Karandlaje said. “I have suggested MLA Bhat to involve more farmers in the activities of Kedarotthana Trust, and also form farmers producers’ organisation. Such initiatives will help farmers avail benefits of all agriculture schemes of the government,” the minister added. She lamented that most of the fallow land in urban areas have already turned into concrete jungles. “Schools and colleges should take initiatives to introduce farming for students and engage them in agriculture activities. I will ensure the support from central and state governments for farming activities,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karandlaje-turns-farmer-in-udupi/articleshow/85466091.cms||---

The young man had later consumed a toxic substance and was admitted to hospital, police said, adding that he is currently under the supervision of doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/girl-19-killed-by-youth-in-almoras-someshwar/articleshow/85466097.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Brain behind 51 offline teaching apps chosen for national award||AURANGABAD: The angst of students from the rural areas facing poor internet connectivity would worry zilla parishad (ZP) teacher Umesh Khose. The 34-year-old from Umarga in Osmanabad district of Marathwada overcame his lack of technological knowledge to devise as many as 51 offline apps, among other Information Communication Technology (ICT) tools, to make learning effective and joyful for the students. In recognition of Khose’s efforts, which also included extensive use of the latest technology in transforming two ZP schools he has worked with so far, the Union ministry of education has selected him for the National Teachers Award for 2021. “I have formal degrees in Arts and teachers’ education, but no technical degree as such to develop mobile applications or innovate e-learning tools. I gathered the necessary technical knowledge using YouTube and Google and developed offline apps, games and websites,” said Khose. The offline mobile apps are themed on primary education for subjects such as Marathi, English and Mathematics. They have reported over 50,000 downloads so far from rural students. Khose, currently working at the Jagdambanagar ZP school in a hamlet called Kaddora, has also developed special learning content in the Banjara language. “Many of my students belong to the Banjara community. Given the importance of early education in the mother tongue, I have developed e-learning content in the Banjara language, which has found many takers,” he said. Some of the learning content developed by Khose has figured on the Diksha app, the national platform for school education developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training. The award-winning teacher has also penned five books and 47 research articles so far besides being the developer of his school’s website. “I come from a very humble family background, my parents being daily-wage labourers. I have closely seen the struggle faced by many poor students in getting proper education. My only dream is to make education for rural students accessible and enjoyable,” said Khose. Khose was among 44 teachers selected from across India for the award. The awardees also included ZP teacher Khurshid Sheikh from Gadchiroli district. The awards will be given by the President of India at a formal function to be held on September 5 (Teacher’s Day) in New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/brain-behind-51-offline-teaching-apps-chosen-for-national-award/articleshow/85463590.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Goa||Goa uses 55-year-old order to revert 36 lakh sqm land in Sanguem to government||MARGAO: Fifty-five long years after it had issued an order reverting huge tracts of land in Uguem, Patiem and Costi in Sanguem taluka that were “assigned” to Sociedade Patriotica dos Baldios das Novas Conquistas during the erstwhile Portuguese regime, the state government recently undertook and partly concluded the process of restoring the ownership of the land in its possession based on the June 27, 1966 order. While the Sociedade claims that it stands to lose 36 lakh square metres of land that it had “owned” following the government’s belated execution of the order, scores of locals who had purchased the land from the Sociedade and had built their dwellings on it – blissfully unaware of the archaic order – are now left in the lurch. The state government maintains that it has merely carried out the rectification in the land records that were long overdue. “The June 27, 1966 order is clear that the land has to be reverted to the government. We are puzzled over how the records weren’t updated all these years,” a highly placed revenue department official told TOI. The government kickstarted the ownership restoration process after the “anomaly” was brought to its notice earlier this year. According to official documents accessed by TOI, after the directorate of settlement and land records (DSLR) identified the corresponding survey numbers as delineated in the 1966 order, the under-secretary (revenue) wrote to the South Goa collector conveying the government’s decision that the 1966 order published in the official gazette was valid. The June 27, 1966 order, signed by secretary (revenue) N Subramanian states that “the formalities for the reversion have been complied with, rejecting the claim of the said Sociedade against the show cause notice issued to it”. The Sanguem mamlatdar recently concluded mutations in Form I and XIV (record of land rights) of the promulgated survey records. The exercise of identifying areas falling under non-promulgated survey records is under way. Non-promulgated survey records pertain to areas that had remained excluded from being recorded under Form I and XIV (record of rights). Survey records in Goa were promulgated sometime in 1973-74. The move, however, has triggered strong opposition from farmers in the area. While the Sociedade has moved the high court of Bombay at Goa challenging the deletion of the institution’s name, many farmers are also in the process of taking legal recourse. “More than 50 residents from Uguem and a few from Costi are absolute owners of the agricultural land under different survey numbers. Being completely dependent on rice cultivation, our ancestors tilled the land for many decades. But within a period of four to five months, the Sanguem mamlatdar, without sending us notices, included the government of Goa, Daman and Diu as co-owner of the property,” Milagres Carvalho, an 80-year-old farmer, said. Residents told TOI that they had purchased the land from the Sociedade and were in possession of it for two generations and that their names were included in the occupants’ column of the Form I & XIV. Recently, when they applied for an updated copy of the Form I and XIV, they were stunned by the modifications. Tenants who became beneficiaries of the provisions under the Goa Daman and Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1964, also stand “deprived” of their land ownership status following the government’s abrupt move. “I was declared owner of the agricultural property in 2001 by the Sanguem mamlatdar under the Tenancy Act and paid money in the government’s treasury office. How can the mamlatdar include the government as co-owner of my property?” said Uguem resident Rosario Carvalho. The farmers are agitated as they believe their land is being snatched away an IIT campus. “Three sites in Sanguem were identified for setting up the IIT — 13 lakh sq m in Cotarli, about 200ha in Nagvem (near Rivona), and the 36 lakh sq m of Sociedade land in Uguem. As the first two sites were rendered unfeasible — the Cotarli site was mired in litigation, and the Nagvem site necessitated clearance from the forest department, which entailed a long-drawn process — the Uguem site, which was until then presumed to be owned by the Sociedade, was then proposed to the government as another alternative,” a source aware of the development told TOI. “The state government has thus saved approximately Rs 40 crore which it would have otherwise had to spend towards land acquisition, if at all the site is selected for the IIT campus. The recent statement of the chief minister to the effect that there were attempts to sell government property to the government itself should be seen in that light,” a senior official well-versed with the development said. Determined to hold on to the land that they have now been dispossessed of, the villagers are trying to “secure” it by installing fresh fences. “We will not allow the government to take over our agricultural land for the sake of the IIT,” said Niquel Cabo, another Uguem farmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-uses-55-yr-old-order-to-revert-36l-sqm-land-in-sanguem-to-govt/articleshow/85471362.cms||Johnny M
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: No data on Covid deaths in home isolation, says health minister Jai Pratap Singh||LUCKNOW: Health minister Jai Pratap Singh said in the House on Thursday that the government did not have data on the Covid deaths which took place in home isolation in the state. Responding to a question by Congress MLC Deepak Singh in Vidhan Parishad on Thursday, the health minister said that the government had counted deaths that took place in private and government hospitals but did not have data on those who died at home. To an observation by acting chairperson Naresh Uttam who said that home isolation was supposed to have taken place under government monitoring, the minister said: “If a death at home came to our notice, we included it. There were monitoring committees and integrated command and control centres which were keeping tabs on patients and when someone became serious, the patient was immediately admitted in hospital or a covid care centre. If a death took place there, it was included in the data but no death in home isolation was brought to our notice,” the minister said. Till Thursday, UP had recorded 22,789 deaths since the start of the pandemic, a low death rate going by the state’s population of 24 crore. Singh alleged that as per a sero survey carried out in UP, there were over 7 lakh deaths in the state, a data which the government was purposely trying to hide. Dhruv Kumar Tripathi of the Shikshak Dal also asked why the government had not considered teachers as front line workers when giving vaccines, when the government knew that they would be deployed for the panchayat polls. “Their training etc started in the first week of March and by not getting them vaccinated in time, many fell victim to the virus and also spread the infection in their families,” he said. A discussion was also held on why children were being called to school if no vaccines were available for them, prompting deputy chief minister Dinesh Singh to say that if there was a requirement, schools could be shut again but it was necessary to move away from online classes for the time being. SP MLC Shatrudra Prakash also pointed out that while 32% of the state’s population had received one dose of the vaccine till the beginning of August, fully vaccinated people were just 5.9%. “The government claims that it has given the most doses in the country but in the Centre’s data, it has given the least doses in percentage of the population, lower than the national average,” said SP MLC Shashank Singh. The health minister accepted that not enough people were coming to take the second shot because of which the government had started a special drive. He also said that where the government had put up a demand of an average of 5 crore doses per month before the centre, it had been given 7-8 lakh doses per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-data-on-covid-deaths-in-home-isolation-health-min/articleshow/85473261.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Pune||Seven minors from Pune get vaccine as part of trials||PUNE: A total of seven adolescents from Pune have received three shots of the Covid vaccine — ZyCoV-D — as part of its countrywide advanced human trials that concluded last month. If approved, ZyCoV-D would be the first vaccine in India for the 12-17 years age group. The Ahmedabad-based pharma company Zydus Cadila has now applied for emergency use authorisation. The vaccine is likely to be made available next month or early October. “Our trial study has shown that ZyCoV-D is safe for children in the age group of 12 to 17 years. The trial participants didn’t report any adverse reaction post-vaccination,” said Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani. The hospital had screened 12 adolescents and enrolled eight, fitting the criterion for the advanced trials in early June. “More than 1,000 adolescents participated in the phase III trials of the vaccine across the country,” Lalwani said. “ZyCoV-D is the world’s first DNA vaccine. It has a three-dose schedule. It is given with a special needle-free injector as it is to be given intradermally (below the skin) and not intramuscularly. If licensed, it will be the first vaccine to be used in paediatric population above 12 years in India,” Lalwani said. The three doses of Zy-CoV-D are to be administered on day-0, day-28, and day-56. Zydus Cadila had last month said it had applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) with the Indian drug regulator and planned to manufacture 10-12 crore doses annually. V K Paul, a member of government think tank Niti Aayog, said the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) was examining Zydus Cadila’s Covid vaccine for children. “More data is needed. The scientific process has to be completed. We have to be sure that it should be effective and safe,” Paul said. While addressing the media, Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary of the Union health ministry, had said the Centre would decide on vaccination of children as soon as the Centre got robust enough results of the trials. It would hinge on the experts’ decision, he added. Officials of the Zydus Cadila in Ahmedabad could not be reached for their comments despite repeated attempts. The company’s Mumbai-based official, when prodded about the exact number of adolescents participating in the trials across the country, refused to share the data siting “legal issues”. Other countries have also started allowing adolescents to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/7-pune-minors-get-vaccine-as-part-of-trials/articleshow/85468904.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Chanting Ram is no longer communal for opposition, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: In a veiled attack on the Opposition, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said, those who would call the mere invocation of Lord Ram and Krishna as communal discourse are now chanting “Ram hamare hain (Ram is ours)”. The chief minister was referring to Mayawati’s aide and BSP general secretary Satish Mishra’s obeisance at Ramjanmabhoomi and his temple-hopping spree in Mathura, Vrindavan and Varanasi during his Brahmin conclaves. “They would never look towards Ayodhya. Now, they are adopting our ideology and thoughts,” said the chief minister, while replying to a discussion on supplementary budget in Vidhan Sabha. Taking potshots at BSP, he said, “while they built memorials in their own names, we constructed memorials to commemorate national icons and launched beautification drives of religious sites like Vindhyachal”. Launching a diatribe at Samajwadi Party over its leader Shafiqur Rehman Barq’s controversial remark on Taliban, chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked, how can they talk about women’s welfare when some party leaders are backing Taliban in Afghanistan. “Despite the cruelty unleashed on women and children, how can they shamelessly support them? They actually favour Talibanisation,” he said. In a scathing attack on Samajwadi Party and Congress, the CM said, after creation of Brij Vikas Parishad, one can witness widespread development. “These parties who enjoyed power for decades could have also organised a mahakumbh, but they were actually afraid. Woh topi pehan kar mubarakbaad kaise de paate (How would they offer greetings wearing caps). Now the caps have vanished. Earlier, they would often talk about installing a statue of demon king Kansh,” the CM said. Yogi said, Congress should get their facts right before talking. “The party questioned the veracity of 4 lakh jobs given by the UP government. The fact is we have provided 4.5 lakh jobs. Also, if they visited their own constituencies, they would know, the state government is providing electricity for 18 hours,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chanting-ram-is-no-longer-communal-for-oppn-yogi/articleshow/85473280.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Sources said it is suspected to be a case of murder. This is the second body found in the Calangute-Candolim beach belt within a week. Last Thursday the body of a 19-year-old girl from Nachinola was found on Calangute beach, sparking a major controversy in the state with allegations of foul play.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/body-found-in-bushes-at-candolim-beach/articleshow/85471467.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Did Afghan deported from city join Taliban?||NAGPUR: The photograph of a Talibani fighter carrying an assault rifle, with a rugged rural landscape in the background, has raised a storm in the city. There is speculation that the man is Afghani Noor Mohammed alias Abdul Haq, who was deported in June for illegally staying in the city. City police had deported Mohammed after he was caught staying in the city illegally in June. However, the cops declined to confirm the controversial picture is of Mohammed. After coming to India on a tourist visa having six-month expiry in 2010, Mohammed had reached Nagpur from Delhi and had been staying here since then. He used to sell blankets for a livelihood and was also in illegal money-lending business. Dodging intelligence agencies and police, Mohammed is also learnt to have purchased property too. The security agencies had in June claimed Mohammed was a pro-Talibani, whose overt support to the Afghanistan-based ultra-fundamentalist outfit was evident in his social media activities. A video, now in possession of TOI, was prepared by Mohammed in which he had threatened to eliminate members of other communities or unfaithful ones for opposing his religion. With a dagger in hand, Mohammed had vowed to punish members of other communities, speaking with a stern voice in Pakhtoon language. The video was circulated in some groups, following which cops had got a hint and zeroed down upon him. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said Mohammed’s activities, networks and contacts were thoroughly scrutinized but he did not seem to have indulged in any kind of unlawful activities related to terror during his decade-long stay in the city. “Deportation is the better option than registering an offence against illegal immigrants and prolong their stay in the country for the trial to end,” said the CP. He added Mohammed was deported to Kabul in Afghanistan. “In the picture, it is difficult to say whether it is him or a look-alike. I interrogated Mohammed but his face does not seem to match that of the man in the picture,” he said. Kumar also said Mohammed was interested in being booked, so he could stay back in Nagpur, but we felt otherwise. Police have also said Mohammed had a bullet mark on his body, which he told interrogating officials he had suffered when the Taliban fired at them while they were offering food to a fellow villager. It’s learnt security agencies had last week received a photograph of an armed Talibani fighter through Mohammed’s friend in the city, saying it was him, now part of the fundamentalist group in Kabul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/did-afghan-deported-from-city-join-taliban/articleshow/85471265.cms||Soumitra Bose

Among cities, New Delhi has the highest percentage of completed projects, followed by Chennai, Indore, Surat and Coimbatore. Rajkot utilised its funds best, followed by Indore, Ujjain, Bhopal and New Town Kolkata. At the bottom of the list project completion, among cities, are Puducherry, Amaravati, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur and Shillong. Not one project has been completed in these. Among states, Meghalaya has not completed a single project. Why the disparity? “No doubt the COVID-19 pandemic has impeded progress, but there are also various administrative and financial reasons for the underperformance,” the report said. “In some cities, the SPVs (special purpose vehicles) set up to implement the Mission are not functioning well due to inadequate managerial, technical, and financial capabilities. Deficiencies were observed in data handling and its analysis, levels of digitalisation, fund mobilisation, release, and utilisation.” What works, the researcher for the study said, are involvement of private partners and effective implementation. “The slow pace of work in most cities is due to gaps in resource mobilisation. While the Centre and state governments are funding these projects, private investment plays a key role in developing such expensive projects. There is a great need to make sure private partners get on board,” said Rumi Aijaz, senior fellow at ORF who put the study together. “Another important aspect is the effective implementation of projects once they are conceptualised … In the case of Delhi, the results are much better due to great involvement of private partners and effective management on the ground."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/47-of-smart-city-projects-done-across-india-tn-leads-states-delhi-cities-study/articleshow/85466199.cms||Abhijeet Singh

For imparting training to its staff, the Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited (UPMRC) is equipped with all necessary technical equipments at the COET located at Transport Nagar Depot, Lucknow amongst which the most prominent is ‘train simulator’. Only four Metro Rail Corporations —UP Metro, Delhi Metro, Hyderabad Metro and Namma Metro (Bangalore), have this facility in India. The simulator is a replica or an exact copy of the driver’s cab of a Metro Train so that the ‘train operator’ can have a real experience during training period. First, the trainees undergo classroom training and then they are trained on simulators. In first phase, the trainees are trained on desktop simulators where there is a screen like a train driving cab with all the control buttons and a lever. In the second phase, drivers are given the experience of ‘5D Motion Simulator’ which is . a replica of the driver’s cab of train. In the screen present inside the Motion Simulator, the driver sees the city buildings, roads and passengers etc. In this stage, the trainees are being trained for proper door opening and closing. They are also trained to resolve or to tackle all types of possible emergencies situations/technical glitches, such as doors stucking or fire. There is a Passenger Emergency Intercom in train so that passengers can talk directly to the ‘Train Operator’ in case of emergency. A training for the same is also given in training session. CCTVs are installed inside the simulator through which the monitoring team continuously monitors and evaluates the performance of the trainees. After training on simulators, the trainees practice on the test track of depot. Train operators are given a ‘Competency Certificate’ only after practicing 400km of train operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-metro-project-training-of-train-operators-begins-in-lucknow/articleshow/85471464.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

Quite a few of them have already held vaccination camps on their premises by tying up with private hospitals. The idea is to get maximum people vaccinated and avoid crowding at vaccination centres,” said PMC’s Covid-19 vaccination chief Suryakant Devkar. Devkar, however, said the PMC was currently not considering free drives at housing societies. “Housing societies can tie up with designated private hospitals called private Covid vaccination centres (PCVCs) to hold a drive. But they (housing societies) need to seek PMC permission to do so,” Devkar said. Medical expert Snehal Porwal, founder, Healing Hands Clinic, said, “We were the first to start the Covid inoculation drive on the premises of the corporates. Based on the learning from it, we proposed to the PMC about starting the vaccination drives in housing societies. We have reached out to more than 20 housing societies and plan to cover more in the days to come.” Private hospitals are not charging extra for logistics. “It is Rs 780 for a dose of Covishield, as fixed by the Centre,” Porwal said. “In addition to the corporates, many housing societies across Pune are approaching to hold the vaccination drive on their premises. We have covered about 16 housing societies and will cover more in the days to come,” said the hospital’s executive director HK Sale. As per central guidelines, Covid-19 vaccination sessions can be organised at workplaces (industrial establishments and others) and housing societies with a sufficient number of willing beneficiaries to ensure optimal utilisation and low wastage of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/inoculation-drive-at-154-housing-societies/articleshow/85468948.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Allahabad||Floods, rising soil price & less orders for idols add to woes of artisans||Prayagraj: City-based artisans who sculpt idols of Hindu deities ahead of Ganesh Chaturthi and Vishwakarma Puja are finding it difficult to arrange soil for shaping idols. The recent floods have played a spoilsport for artisans who are running from pillar to post to purchase good quality soil from trans-Ganga area. Moreover, they are spending four times more money to purchase half a truck of soil. Apart from this, lesser number of orders for idols from city-based religious groups and individuals this time has also compounded their woes. Since idol preparations for Ganesh Utsav, Vishwakarma Jayanti and Durga Puja usually begin after June every year, these artisans usually get busy moulding clay into figurines and embellishing them with brush and colour. But this year, absence of good quality soil and less number of orders for idols have left artisans worried. Tapas Pal, whose three generations have been in the trade of sculpting, told TOI on Thursday, “I have been arranging good quality soil from trans-Ganga area and have to travel at least 40-50 km to bring it. Rains and floods have washed away the rich soil of Ganga, and I have been purchasing soil at higher prices.” “Earlier, a small truck of soil was available at Rs 1,000, but now I am buying it for Rs 4,000. The demand for idols has also declined considerably in the market,” he added. Tapas further claimed, “The corona pandemic has hit artisans severely. We are experiencing the worst situation since the last two years.” “We usually start getting Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja orders from June-end or July, and start purchasing raw material like clay, stacks of bamboo poles, wood, dry grass, hay, ornaments, clothes and decorative items by August. This year we have not received any major order for big idols of Lord Ganesh. People are asking for small idols for their homes,” he said. “Last year, many artisans had left for their native villages in West Bengal after the lockdown, and they do not have a reason to return,” said another artisan. “This used to be the peak season for artisans as most Hindu festivals begin after mid July,” he added. Artisans at Bhardwaj Ashram said, “We used to get orders for hundreds of big Ganesha big idols. However, for the past two years, orders are few and that too for small idols. Local puja committees have also not placed any orders for idols so far due to the pandemic, as they don’t know whether administration would allow puja celebrations or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/floods-rising-soil-price-less-orders-for-idols-add-to-woes-of-artisans/articleshow/85471787.cms||---
---||Delhi||Constable sacked for involvement in gambling racket||New Delhi: A Delhi Police constable was dismissed from service on Wednesday following a departmental inquiry for his alleged involvement in a gambling racket. It was found that the policeman was in touch with criminals involved in the racket. The constable, Amit Kumar, was posted at Paharganj police station. The Station House Officer of Paharganj police station has also been sent to the district lines. DCP (Central) Jasmeet Singh said that on Saturday, a day before Independence Day, two groups opened fire at each other at Paharganj near Relax Hotel. “One person sustained a gunshot injury, while another was stabbed. During inquiry, it was found that the fight was over satta. A probe revealed that constable Kumar was working in close connivance with one Amit Raghav in the gambling operation and collection of proceeds,” he added. The probe also revealed that there were 33 calls exchanged between Kumar and Raghav, who was found involved in five criminal cases. Apart from running satta activities in Paharganj, Raghav was also involved in riots in the area. One Gajender Singh, who was involved in at least 15 criminal cases, including under MCOCA, was also involved in the riots. The constable had talked to him 17 times in the past one year. Kumar was posted in beat number 9 of Paharganj police station in which several restobars, including Mumbai Dreams, My Love, Your Bar, etc were situated. Call detail records revealed that he was actively connected with the owners of the bars as well as their managers. Meanwhile, during the inquiry with respect to a sting operation, it was found that Covid-appropriate behaviour, guidelines and protocols were also not being followed in the bars. Further, other guidelines mentioned in the licences for running bars were also being violated as some girls could be seen dancing there, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/constable-sacked-for-involvement-in-gambling-racket/articleshow/85468977.cms||---

Besides, their identity cards have been cancelled by the temple administration on the charges of misbehaving with devotees and extorting money. Explanation has also been sought from several such priests on different issues. “A number of complaints had been received against some priests engaged in KVT to facilitate devotees seeking entry after purchasing tickets, especially of Sugam Darshan to avoid spending time in queues. It was alleged that after taking devotees inside the temple, these priests used to force them to perform rituals to milk money from them,” said divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal while talking to TOI on Thursday. “As the complaints increased, evidence was collected in which 10 Shastris were found involved in malpractices, after which the action of barring them from performing rituals was initiated on Wednesday,” he said adding, “the identity cards issued to those priests have also been cancelled.” According to temple authorities, the priests in the category of Nihshulk Shastri are engaged by the temple's help-desk to facilitate devotees entering the temple after purchasing tickets. Against payment of Rs 300 for a Sugam Darshan ticket, each priest sent to facilitate the devotee concerned is paid Rs 30, they said adding that in Shrawan of 2019, a large number of priests in this category had earned over Rs 1 lakh only by receiving the genuine amount paid to them on each ticket. With the beginning of construction work of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project, the CCTV network installed in and around the KVT was disrupted. Officials said that taking advantage of it, some priests in Nihshulk Shastri category started indulging in malpractices. The commissioner said that two more Shastris and an assistant public relation officer were also issued show-cause notice for their behaviour. He said that a meeting of Archaks (regular priests) and employees was convened on Wednesday in which it was made clear that those distorting the image of the holy shrine will not be allowed to contribute to the working of the temple. The officials also praised the Archaks and employees who performed outstandingly during the Shrawan month despite the odds faced by the on-going construction work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/10-kvt-nihshulk-shastris-barredfrom-rituals-for-fleecing-devotees/articleshow/85471371.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Karuvannur Service Cooperative Bank casts shadow on property mortgage rules||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The malpractices and irregularities uncovered at Karuvannur Service Cooperative Bank exposes the vulnerabilities in the present rules for mortgaging properties in cooperative banks. As per cooperation department sources, many cooperative banks and institutions are resorting to the practice of extending multiple loans on the security of the same property by citing government rules in this regard. In order to make loans from cooperative banks easier, government had extended (since June 23, 2004) the provision for issuing loans on properties by executing a document (Gehan) agreeing to mortgage the property before bank authorities, without requiring to visit the sub-registrar office for mortgaging it –a provision which was originally applicable only to land mortgage banks. As per this amendment, Gehan –which means a special charge on movable or immovable property –could be executed in favour of the state/district cooperative banks, primary agricultural credit societies, primary housing societies, urban co-operative banks or other primary cooperative societies dealing with credit activities by a mere declaration in writing by the borrower, for securing the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way of loan, which will have all the characteristics of a valid mortgage. “Ever since land mortgaging became easy, institutions began offering multiple loans on the same property by revising property value each time according to the loan requirement. Nowhere in the law has it been said that multiple loans can be sanctioned on a single property as the liability of a single loan itself extends to the whole property being mortgaged,” said a senior official in the department. The government-appointed nine-member committee’s report on Karuvannur fraud has made the observation that ‘it is seen that the property value has been forged in most valuation reports. The land value of a property has been adjusted and corrected in accordance with the loan disbursed over that property’. As many as 52 illegal loans, to the tune of Rs 215.71 crore, were sanctioned by pledging eight properties, the committee further found. Officials also pointed out another contradiction in the circular that was issued by the department and in the prescribed form for preparing Gehan. As per the circular issued by the registrar of cooperative societies on July 25, 2007, Gehan can be considered as a mortgage document like any other document and a fresh loan can be sanctioned on the same Gehan without re-executing it again, when the previous loan is closed after remitting dues. However, form 8 (A) of the cooperation rules say that if the borrower duly pays the entire loan amount, Gehan will become ineffective. “The circular is in contradiction to the rules as the rules clearly say that for each loan, different Gehan will have to be executed as once the loan amount is closed, the validity of the Gehan executed for that loan will also expire,” officials said. Sources said that this could lead to a major chaos if questioned legally. “Cooperatives are issuing fresh loans without re-executing Gehan each time. If questioned legally, the rules will prevail over circular and such Gehans will become infructuous, and there will be hundreds of loans across the state which will turn out to become loans disbursed over invalid mortgages of properties,” sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/karuvannur-casts-shadow-on-property-mortgage-rules/articleshow/85466189.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Allahabad||HC: Little girls worshipped in country,but cases of paedophilia are increasing||Prayagraj: Taking serious note of increasing crimes against minor girls, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of a man accused of raping a 13-year-old girl, observing, “little girls are worshipped in our country, but cases of paedophilia are increasing”. While rejecting the bail application filed by one Jasman Singh of Lalitpur against whom an FIR of rape was lodged on February 17, 2019, at Jakhaura police station of Lalitpur, Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh further said, “In this case, a small innocent girl has been raped, who does not understand its meaning. Little girls are worshipped in our country, but cases of paedophilia are increasing.” “Rape is a heinous crime. The victim suffers from psychological effects of embarrassment, disgust, depression, guilt and even suicidal tendencies. Many cases go unreported. In most of the rape cases, the victim is unwilling to report the name of the abuser. The families of the victim remain silent about the sexual offences in order to protect the family image.” “The victim/female small child, who experiences sexual abuse once, tends to be more vulnerable to abuse in adult life. Healing is slow and systematic. In such a situation, if the right decision is not taken from the court at the right time, then the trust of a victim / common man will not be left in the judicial system. This is the time to strictly stop this kind of crime,” added the court. As per prosecution case, the applicant raped a 13-year-old girl when she was alone in the house and doing some household work. All her family members had gone to the agricultural field for cutting fodder. The applicant taking advantage of the situation, forcibly entered the house, dragged her inside the room by grabbing her hair and forcibly committed rape of the victim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-little-girls-worshipped-in-countrybut-cases-of-paedophilia-are-increasing/articleshow/85471860.cms||---

The people paid tributes to the freedom fighters and also took out a procession in the town. Every year, on August 19, people carry out a procession from the district jail and hold a meeting at Bapu Bhawan to celebrate the victory of the dsitrict. The uprising in Ballia began soon after the arrest of the Congress leaders taking part in the Quit India movement. On August 10, 1942, all the schools were closed and people continued taking out processions. On August 13, Bilthara Road railway station was attacked and the building was burnt. On August 16, Rasra treasury was attacked and two days later the police station at Bairia was attacked. The station officer had removed the Tricolour hoisted by the freedom fighters on August 15. At least 20 persons were killed and several others injured in police firing. According to the district records, on August 19, 1942, about 50,000 persons armed with guns, lathis, spears, proceeded towards the jail to free their leaders and other participants. When the district magistrate learnt that the people were approaching to free their comrades, attack the government offices and loot the treasury, he went to the leaders in jail and met Chittu Pandey and others and offered to release them provided they pacified the crowd. But as the leaders did not agree he suggested that they should at least take the responsibility of seeing that no harm reached the treasury, the prison and government property. As no guarantee was given to him, he had no option but to release the freedom fighters in the faint hope of saving the treasury and other government property. Before their release they assured him that efforts would be made to maintain peace as far as possible. This not only marked the first victory of the freedom struggle but was a symbol in this small and economically backward district of the downfall of the British raj. After their release, the leaders addressed a huge gathering at the town hall when Chittu Pandey exhorted the people not to indulge in sabotage or similar activities. But there was a difference of opinion and many opposed this point of view as they had witnessed the brutal killing of their companions and their feelings had been roused vehemently, so sabotage activities continued. The residences of government officers and non-officials who had given support to the government were sacked. Shops selling foreign cloth and liquor were attacked. On August 20, a police van went round the town opening indiscrimintae fire on passersby contrary to the assurance given to the leaders. In the absence of any planned program, many administrative centres remained to be captured, but they had already ceased to function properly. The freedom fighters constituted separate panchayats for different localities for carrying on the civil administration and Congress volunteers were appointed for the defence of the city. By now the people had acquired complete control of the city so much so that they declared ‘Independence’ and a government was formed with Chittu Pandey as its first head. According to a government report, seven out of ten police-stations of the district were in the hands of the freedom fighters and Congress raj had been proclaimed. During the night of 22–23 August, military forces entered Ballia and the popular government was overthrown. Then the horrors of the British police and military were let loose upon the people of Ballia, signalized by and orgy of loot and plunder, rape and ravage, beating and shooting, firing and burning. All leaders of the revolution, young and old, were arrested, beaten and tortured. The houses of all those who had helped or were supposed to have helped the fighters, were burnt down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ballia-recalls-its-victory-against-british-rule-processions-taken-out/articleshow/85471344.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Man gets 7-year jail term for physically exploiting girl on pretext of marriage||Kanpur: Additional session judge of Fast-track court (number 41) on Thursday convicted one Dharmendra Vishwakarma for physically exploiting a girl under pretext of marriage and punished him with a sentence of 7 years imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 15,000. The presiding judge in his order further observed that if the accused failed to pay the fine, then he had to suffer another jail term of six months. The period in which the accused was in the jail would be adjusted in the sentence term. According to additional district government counsels Vinod Tripathi and Indralata Shukla, the complainant was the victim herself. She had stated in her FIR that she was meeting with a boy named Dharmendra, a resident of Arra Bingawan, who promised to marry her. On February 3, 2013 her mother had visited Dharmendra’s residence and discussed the marriage issue. But Arvind Vishwakarma, brother of Dharmendra demanded a sum of Rs 5 lakhs as dowry and in the absence of money there would be no marriage. Moreover, he threatened that if this conversation was leaked then she and other members of the family could not come out of the house. Arvind thereafter frequently visited her house and gave threats of life. The ADGC stated that during the trial, the victim had adduced that Dharmendra had established physical relations with her under the pretext of marriage and had exploited her several times at different places. The presiding judge in his observation stated that prosecution had successfully proved that the accused had physically exploited the victim and sought her consent under pretext of marriage. There was no free consent. The charges of dowry demand could not be proved. Therefore, accused Arvind Vishwakarma and others had been acquitted from dowry charges. On the quantum of sentence, the defence pleaded that it was his first offence. He was already married and a liability to his family. Therefore, a lenient view should be adopted against him. On the other hand, the prosecution argued that the accused had deceived and exploited a girl which was an offence of serious nature. Therefore, he should be punished with stringent punishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-gets-7-year-jail-term-for-physically-exploiting-girl-on-pretext-of-marriage/articleshow/85471500.cms||---
---||Lucknow||New record: Uttar Pradesh first state to cross 7 crore Covid tests||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh became the first state in the country to carry out more than 7 crore Covid tests on Thursday. “The early detection and isolation of potentially infectious individuals are the keys to successfully fighting a viral pandemic. The testing protocol by the World Health Organisation for Uttar Pradesh is 32,000 tests per day, whereas Covid testing in the state has averaged 2.5 lakh tests a day for the past few weeks," said a government spokesperson. Meanwhile, UP reported 29 new Covid positive cases and 35 recoveries on Thursday, taking the total number of active cases in the state down to 407. Cases were reported from just 16 districts, with Lucknow reporting the highest number of new cases at five. Banda and Bulandshahr also reported one death each. “The reason UP is able to keep the infection under control is because of the aggressive testing. On Thursday, the state carried out more than 2.36 lakh tests. Except for a few days in between, UP has been averaging 2.3-2.5 lakh tests a day. On the scale of testing samples per positive case, UP is doing 39.9 tests per positive case,” said a government spokesperson, adding that 6.4 tests per positive case were conducted in Maharashtra, 11.5 in Karnataka, 8 in Kerala, 14 in Delhi, 12.8 in Tamil Nadu and 11.4 tests per positive case in Andhra Pradesh. He added that 70% of tests conducted since the surge of the second wave of Covid-19 had been conducted in rural regions. “More than 73,000 surveillance committees constituted by the Yogi Adityanath government are moving across 97,941 villages in all 75 districts for this activity, which began on 5 May. We are targeting 100% coverage of rural households,” he said. The spokesperson added that testing is crucial for curbing the transmission of Covid-19 as it helps timely detection of cases, their isolation and contact tracing. The government is getting more than one lakh tests through 8,000 Rapid Response Teams in the rural areas of the state everyday, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/new-record-up-1st-to-cross-7-cr-covid-tests/articleshow/85473296.cms||---

Such charged was the atmosphere that Neeraj Chopra, boy with golden arm, dubbed the UP government event to felicitate Tokyo Olympians as the ‘function of India’. Overwhelmed with the love and respect showered on them, the medalists joined the cheering crowd in the stands from the dais. The two-hour long event witnessed loud patriotic chants of slogans and a long round of applause for the Olympians who earned medals for the nation with their hard work and determination. Rani Rampal, the skipper of the Indian women’s hockey team, said, “It was an electrifying experience after the Olympics. I guess it is the first state, which not only honoured and felicitated Olympians of Uttar Pradesh but also sportspersons from other states as well as the support staff.” Manpreet Singh, skipper of Indian men’s hockey team, said, “The affection and respect bestowed on us by the people of Uttar Pradesh will inspire youngsters to reach where we are today. As an athlete, it gives me immense happiness when a government or state head promotes sports.” “During Olympics, a call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi boosted our morale and we went on to win the bronze medal,” he said. Neeraj Chopra, the gold medalist of Tokyo Olympics, said, “It looks like a function of India for me. The love and respect we received here is more than what we received at Tokyo stadium. Such gestures of people will motivate us to strive harder.” Ace shuttler PV Sindhu said, “This is my second felicitation by the UP government. Earlier I was honoured after the Rio Olympics. I have never seen this huge crowd, which gathered to bestow their love on us irrespective of athletes hailing from different states. I thank CM for this encouragement.” World number one wrestler Bajrang Punia (bronze medalist) and Ravi Kumar Dahiya (silver medalist), recalled their UP connection and said, “Our current wrestling federation chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who hails from UP helped many wrestlers to achieve new heights in the game.” “At least three medals came under his tenure. We are excited and feel elated,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/feels-like-function-of-india-say-olympians/articleshow/85473319.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Pune||Pune: Huge rush for psychology, economics in arts colleges||PUNE: Psychology and economics have been the most in-demand courses in arts colleges for undergraduate studies in the city in the last few years with some registering over 85-90% cut-off marks for undergraduate programmes. The cut-offs are expected to increase this year, experts said. A student pursuing psychology can work as an independent clinical counsellor or as an industry counsellor, depending upon the specialisation. Principals said it is not just the jobs that attract the students to psychology, but the love and curiosity about the subject. As for economics, principals have called it an evergreen subject, which can be really helpful for securing a job in the present scenario, if combined with statistics or coding. Saee Pathak, who passed out of Std XII recently with 98.8%, is hoping to pursue a degree in psychology. She said she finds the subject fascinating. “I am very interested in understanding why we behave in a certain way, why two people in the same circumstances will behave differently and also how we can be better people if we understand each other better. I want to pursue a career in clinical psychology,” she said. Savita Datar, principal of SP College, said she expects the first cut-off marks to be much higher than 90%. “There is a rush for psychology, economics and even political science in arts faculty. Even the postgraduate degree in psychology is much in demand,” she added. Gautami Thombare, who scored 99.3% in Std XII, is pursuing her graduation in economics from a US university. “This is a bachelor of science degree in econometrics and quantitative economics. I have loved economics since I took it up in Std XI as I discovered that I love things that have both theory and mathematical parts in them. I had heard about this course in the US from my seniors and I think this will be a good fit for me.” Jyoti Chandiramani, director Symbiosis School of Economics & Dean Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Symbiosis International, said there is a need to wed economics with the study of multidisciplinary courses. “These can be econophysics - economics and anthropology and economics and IT for infonomics. For example, urban economic development needs to encompass- applied microeconomics, urban geography, demography and so on. Behavioural economics is another important and popular specialisation coming up beside economics and finance, economics and data sciences. It is also good to study both statistics and mathematics which can be applied to decision science. This is then supported by learning of software like R which does rely on programme coding. Further, if you want to be an analyst, the student will benefit from understanding coding,” Chandiramani said. One must pursue a master’s degree only if passionate about economics, she added. “Jobs after an undergraduate degree in economics are surely available for most students. It also depends on the career aspirational graph of the student and where they want to see themselves 10 years after graduation. Being an academician, I do encourage a master’s programme in economics as it enhances knowledge levels and provides a more holistic understanding with respect to jobs like a data scientist, a development economics practitioner, an economist with a large corporate or in banking and finance,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/huge-rush-for-psychology-economics-in-arts-colleges/articleshow/85470419.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Pune||Covid-19: Pune district’s WPR drops to 3.3%, but still over Maharashtra's average||PUNE: Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on Thursday said the district’s weekly positivity rate was 3.3% for the August 12 to 18 period — 0.5% less than the last week’s 3.8% but 1.36% higher than the state average of 2.44%. As per the district health department data, the Covid-19 WPR for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits in the seven-day period was 2.5%. It was 3.2% in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits and 3.9% in the Pune rural areas. Health officials claimed there was a dip in cases in this seven-day period. According to the data, 6,325 fresh cases were reported last week as against this week’s 6,008. The active case count this week was 7,992, compared to the last week’s 8,992. The mortality rate for the August 12-18 period in the district was 1.6%. Rao said the back-to back below-4% weekly positivity rate in the district was a good sign before the weekly Covid review meeting, to be chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday. “The local administrations are ensuring citizens strictly follow Covid protocols,” he said, adding that efforts were being made to bring down the district’s WPR. Senior officials told TOI that any new announcements related to relaxations were unlikely after this week’s review meeting. The focus of Covid mitigation continued to be on the rural areas in the district; nearly 80,000 tests were carried out in the seven-day period. “But the WPR and the total number of new cases added this week was less compared the previous seven days in the district,” said a health official. The health department officials stated that they had procured more Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits for increasing testing in rural areas. The public health department is spending nearly Rs22.5 crore to procure 25 lakh RAT kits for the state to increase testing, especially in districts of concern, ahead of the possible third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/districts-wpr-drops-to-3-3-but-still-over-state-average/articleshow/85468978.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Dehradun||Top Taliban man Stanikzai was 'Sheru' to IMA batchmates in 1982||DEHRADUN: To the 1982 batch of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun, he was “Sheru” — well-built, not too tall and never religiously inclined. Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, 60, is now one of the seven most powerful men in the Taliban regime about to take the reins of Afghanistan. Stanikzai was 20 when he came in, one of the 45 gentlemen cadets of the Bhagat Battalion’s Keren Company at the IMA. “He was a likeable guy who seemed a little older than the other cadets at the academy. He kept this striking moustache. He certainly had no radical views at the time. He was an average Afghan cadet who seemed to be enjoying his time here,” Major General DA Chaturvedi (retired), his batchmate and a recipient of the Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Ati Vishisht Seva Medal and Sena Medal, told TOI. Stanikzai was one of the 45 foreign gentlemen cadets of the Bhagat Battalion’s Keren Company at the IMAThe IMA had been taking in foreign cadets since Independence and Afghan cadets since 1971, after the India-Pakistan War. Stanikzai was a direct recruit from the Afghan National Defence & Security Forces. “He was like the kid next door. I remember this one time we went to Rishikesh and bathed in the Ganga. There is a photograph from that day in which Sheru can be seen in IMA swimming trunks with me,” Colonel Kesar Singh Shekhawat (retired), another batchmate, told TOI. “He was so friendly. We’d go exploring the forests and hills on weekends.” He completed his pre-commission training at the IMA for a year and a half before joining the Afghan National Army as a lieutenant. It was just after Afghanistan was overrun by the Soviets. By 1996, Stanikzai had left the army, joined the Taliban and was holding negotiations with the Clinton administration to make the US give diplomatic recognition to the Taliban. A ‘New York Times’ article from 1997 says Stanikzai, “the acting foreign minister” of the Taliban regime, had learnt English “in college in India”. In the years that followed, he became one of Taliban’s key negotiators — his English skills and military training had held him in good stead for the outfit. When the group set up its political office in Doha, where its senior leaders stationed themselves, he ran it since 2012 and led talks on behalf of the Taliban before Abdul Ghani Baradar, co-founder of Taliban and tipped to become its new head, was back in 2019. Stanikzai remains one of the top negotiators. This, his former batchmates said, could be a trump card. “He would surely have fond memories of his time in India,” said Chaturvedi. “I would say this is an opportunity for the Ministry of External Affairs to use his network of friends from his IMA days to speak with him and for entering into a dialogue with the Taliban.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/top-taliban-man-stanikzai-was-sheru-to-ima-batchmates-in-1982/articleshow/85466232.cms||Shivani Azad

On Tuesday, an order was issued transferring 23 deputy superintendents. Senior jail officials claimed that the move aimed at breaking the connivance of deputy superintendents with inmates. Several inmates in leaked videos have alleged that jail officials ask for hefty amounts to let them keep a mobile phone or use internet inside the prison. Deputy superintendent Atul Sharma from jail number 1, along with Jitendra Bhargav, another deputy, has been transferred, while Vinay Kumar and Dharmendra Kumar have been sent from jail number 3 to Mandoli Jail. “The step has been taken considering the ‘give and take’ relationship between prisoners and some jail officials. We often carry out raids in cells and seize mobile phones and other banned items too,” said a jail official. Earlier, after the death of gangster Ankit Gujjar in jail number 3 in the early hours of August 4, his family had alleged involvement of jail officials in his “murder” and a deputy superintendent has been booked. After an FIR was lodged by Delhi Police, Tihar director general Sandeep Goel suspended the accused jailer, along with two assistant superintendents and a warder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-shuffles23-officials-in-clampdown/articleshow/85468999.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a memorandum submitted to the chief minister, the leaders of the organizations, including the pro-LDF Adivasi Kshema Samithi, have also demanded formation of a land commission to solve the issue of alienation of holdings owned by tribespeople. It was at 5am on August 8 that a police team from Agali station had arrested tribal head of Vattalakki settlement in Sholayur panchayat in Attapadi and his 17-year-old son.  “Police had arrested Choriyan Mooppan and his son Murugan from their residence based on a dispute between relatives. Mooppan is a person who would go to the station even if officers make a call summoning him. Then, why police made such an operation at 5am still remain suspicious,” said Rajendraprasad of Thampu, an NGO working for the welfare of tribal people. The leaders demanded action against station house officer of Agali police station who showed undue haste in arresting Mooppan and his son. The leaders also alleged that police assaulted Murugan. Leaders of Mooppans’ Council, Attapadi Adivasi Action Council, Adivasi Kshema Samithi, Adivasi Congress etc have signed the memorandum. Other demands include surveying the land in each tribal settlement and issuing possession certificates to tribal families who own it, opening up of the court allotted in Attapadi and declaring at least one police station in Attapadi as women and children-friendly station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/call-for-probe-into-arrest-of-tribal-head-son/articleshow/85466282.cms||---

Depending on the facilities provided by the colleges, the fee cut will be effected. These will be 50% reduction in library, laboratory, gymkhana, extra-curricular, computer facility among others. Students who have lost either of their parents to Covid will get a full waiver and needy students will be allowed to pay them in instalments. Registrar Prafulla Pawar said upon request made by the department of higher education in June regarding the reduction in fees, we placed the proposal before the management council for consideration. The members considered the proposal at their meeting on June 26 and constituted a committee under the chairmanship of member of management council Sudhakar Yadhavar. The committee submitted its report along with details for reduction of fees. The vice-chancellor accepted the committee report and approved its recommendations. Pawar said, “Accordingly, the reduced fees of various courses shall be made applicable by the university departments, affiliated colleges and recognised institutions of the university for the academic year 21-22.” Student of Fergusson College, Radhika Purohit, said, “This move is really appreciable. I would like to appreciate the efforts by students’ organisations who have been continuously demanding reduction in fees for many months. Their demand has been accepted. I have friends who lost their parents and they were worried about their studies, but now this news will bring them some relief.” Joint secretary at Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, Dayanand Shinde, said the decision from the university came late but it is welcome. “We have taken a very aggressive stand on this issue and have been following up for many weeks so this is a victory for the students,” he added. The university notification stated that 100% fees will be waived for the students who have lost their father or mother or both parents due to Covid infection. The SPPU has notified its colleges that even with the reduced fees, the colleges or institutions may allow poor and needy students to pay the fees in instalments after taking their written applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-varsity-fee-cut-slabs-based-on-college-facilities/articleshow/85470425.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The state government has recently issued guidelines to rationalise teaching staff in all government schools across districts based on enrolments during the academic year 2019-20. As per the guidelines, surplus teachers would be posted in vacancies notified through transfer. The move, which was resisted by teachers, also drew flak from the committee, which consists of eminent academics such as Prof G Haragopal, Prof K Laxminarayana and Chakradhara Rao. In a representation submitted to the education department, the committee demanded that the government immediately stop the process of rationalisation. If the government fails to do so, it threatened to launch a statewide movement. “Surveys show that more than two lakh students have joined government schools this year. Under these circumstances, it is criminal that the government is undertaking rationalisation according to the 2019-20 district information education system (DISE) statistics instead of 2021-22,” the representation said. The committee fears that rationalisation of schools would severely affect education of Dalits, adivasis, bahujans and those coming from economically weaker sections of society. “There should be a school in every village. For that, teachers, students should work with the people to motivate them and launch a movement to protect schools in village and towns,” it added. The committee fears rationalisation of schools would severely affect education of Dalits, Adivasis, bahujans and those coming from economically weaker sections of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/academics-warn-of-stir-over-school-rejig-move/articleshow/85471458.cms||---

For example, Rani Rampal (26), the skipper of the Indian team, began playing with a broken hockey stick while wearing a salwar-kameez. Neha Goyal (24) and Nisha Waris (25), who are referred to as Sonipat’s sisters born from different mothers, joined hockey for incentives like shoes and clothes. While they are proud of their achievements that came amid challenges, the champions from the legendry team, which defeated Australia 0-1 to reach semi-finals want the situation to change. “Every athlete deserves a good field, kit and a coach,” is the common refrain of the players who gathered in Lucknow for felicitation ceremony of Tokyo Olympians on Thursday. “The situation needs to change as there are millions of other boys and girls who have similar stories,” said a team member. “Apart from dedication and hard work for a game, an athlete requires a good field, kit and a visionary coach to groom at a very young age in order to become a world class player,” said Gurjeet Kaur, the 25-year-old drag flicker, whose primary role is that of a defender but was highest goal scorer for the Indian team along with Vandana Katariya (26). Both the players scored four goals each, including hattrick goals by Vandana against South Africa and two back-to-back goals with a minute gap by Gurjeet against Britain while fighting for bronze medal. “We should have dedicated schools and colleges for sports which can nurture Olympians. Inspired by our team and other Indian Olympians’ efforts at Tokyo, the UP government seemed to be investing in this direction,” said Vandana. “The team performed exceptionally well. We never lost faith in ourselves and fought with ‘never give up’ attitude. This needs to be taught and embedded in players,” Gurjeet told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-athlete-deserves-good-field-kit-coach/articleshow/85473347.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The constable had given him the car for use in April. She pursued him for two months to return the car and approached the police when he refused to do so. An officer from the Haveli police told TOI that the woman constable had purchased the second-hand car for Rs 7.15 lakh from a person in Ambegaon taluka in January this year. The woman had come in contact with the car seller through a social media platform. “The car is yet to be transferred in the woman’s name. The woman has initiated the process of transferring the vehicle in her name,” the officer said. He said that the constable had informed the man she met on a matrimonial site about the car she had purchased. The man had claimed to be a food supply officer in Amravati district. After getting acquainted with him, the constable started interacting with him regularly and aslo had some financial transactions with him,” the officer said. He said that according to the complainant, the man called the woman constable on April 20 and told her that he had been transferred to Gondia district and requested her to give the car to him for some days. “The woman told him to take the car as she was not using it frequently,” the officer said. The next day, the man contacted the constable and told her that he was in Pune. “The complainant was at Khadakwasla at that time. The man went there, and the constable handed over the car to him,” the officer said. In July, the woman constable needed the car for some work, and requested the man to return it. “The man, however, refused to do so. He even told the constable that she did not have any document to prove that she was the owner of car,” the officer said. The man has been booked under section 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cop-files-cheating-plaint-as-man-drives-away-with-her-car/articleshow/85470481.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The police officer was on his way to his room in the police barrack near the ITI police station when the accident took place. The deceased has been identified as Pawan Bhardwaj, the in-charge of the City Patrol Unit (CPU), Kashipur, and native of Shivpur village in the Kotdwar town of Pauri Garhwal. The collision was so intense that the car was completely crushed. Senior police officers of the area, including ASP Pramod Kumar and CO Akshay Prahlad Kode, rushed to the spot. It took the police personnel around two hours to pull out the body with the use of electric cutters and a crane. ASP Kumar said Bhardwaj was returning to the barrack around midnight when his car collided with a brick-laden truck near the Indane Gas agency at Jaspur Khurd. “He died on the spot. We sent the body for postmortem and subsequently handed it over to the bereaved family. The 2008 batch sub-inspector was given a tribute by the police department. It’s a big loss to the department,” ASP Kumar added.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Solar-powered electric vehicle charging points to come up at malls||KOCHI: Aiming to tap non-conventional energy to run electric vehicles, Agency for Non-Conventional Energy and Rural Technology (Anert) is going to install solar-based electric vehicle charging stations at hotel and mall premises in the state. The move will thereby reduce the dependency on hydropower for charging vehicles. The agency received administrative sanction from the government in this regard, and has invited quotes from national level empaneled agencies to set up the charging points. Currently, Anert has five fully operational charging stations and work for another six is underway. “Anert will give subsidies to malls and hotels to set up solar based charging stations. About 5kw to 50kw of solar panels can be installed for the purpose, and the operator will get 50% subsidy. Electricity consumption is high for charging vehicles, so we have to tap green energy sources to reduce the huge burden on the KSEB,” an Anert official said. Currently, the state does not have any qualified company capable of setting up these charging stations. To address this, Anert has invited quotations at national level for empaneling agencies to provide technical support and awareness to the interested parties. Anert will empanel eight to 10 agencies and the beneficiary can select the company for setting up the charging station. “In our existing stations, consumers have to wait 30 minutes to an hour to get their vehicle fully charged. If we set up charging stations at hotels and malls, people can charge their vehicle while they shop or have food. We are looking into places with refreshment facilities and washrooms, where business is high to set up these stations,” he said. During nights, slow charging is possible and the consumption will be less compared to fast charging. At present EV cars have 200 – 400 km mileage at one charge. Meanwhile, more affordable vehicles with upto 300km mileage is expected to be launched in the market next year. At present, KSEB has six operational charging stations, and work is on for another 25. According to available data, per month around 1,000 consumers are using these stations. The highest number of consumers is in Kozhikode, where the presence of private charging stations is also rising. Meanwhile, the registration of electric vehicles is also rising in the state, especially since the Covid pandemic. This year so far 3,313 EVs were registered in Kerala, against 1,324 and 468 in previous years. The highest registration of EVs was recorded in April and July 2021 with 631 and 668 respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/solar-powered-ev-charging-points-to-come-up-at-malls/articleshow/85466310.cms||T C Sreemol

Vendors, who wish to sell idols and decoration material, should set up stalls only at designated locations on vacant amenity spaces and school grounds. The anti-encroachment department will issue orders banning stalls along the roadside. Last year, the PMC permitted stalls to sell Ganesh idols at only 41 places to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Places were selected under the jurisdiction of 15 ward offices. These included municipal school grounds. Only 500 licences were issued for stalls. Usually, around 4,000 stalls are set up and vendors sell around 4.5 lakh idols. According to PMC officials, planning will be done on the same lines this year as well. The civic administration will select only such locations, where physical distancing can be maintained. “The location will be finalised in the next couple of days. We have asked ward offices to provide details about the places, where the stalls can be set up under their jurisdiction,” said senior PMC official Rajendra Muthe. “The mandatory no object certificate (NOC) to set up stalls on footpaths or roadsides should not be provided. A decision was taken at a meeting in PMC recently,” said Madhav Jagtap, head of PMC’s anti-encroachment department. A woman paints a Ganesh idol at a workshop in Shukrawar Peth on Thursday.

---||Delhi||Sludge treatment plants at EDMC toilets to secure double benefits||New Delhi: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has taken up a project to set up faecal sludge treatment plants at septic tanks in its community toilets to minimise the burden on sewerage systems and also supply non-stop water and electricity at these facilities. Two of them have already been made operational in Nand Nagri and Welcome. The civic body plans to set up 27 such systems in the next one year at public and community toilets as well as in EDMC schools, said an official. “Faecal waste is digested in an anaerobic environment using a biodigester. Anaerobic microbial inoculum decomposes the septage in absence of oxygen to produce methane gas and the trapped gas is fed to generate electricity,” said the official. EDMC has floated a tender inviting proposals from concessionaires to maintain its 50 public toilets on prominent roads. The private player can also earn revenue by putting up advertisements at these facilities. Unlike the north and south corporations, EDMC itself was carrying out the maintenance work so far. Civic officials said they aspired to achieve an open defecation free++ (ODF)certificate under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and various arrangements to achieve it would also improve related public services in east Delhi. “About 50 public conveniences at various locations have been identified and concessionaires have been invited to take over these complexes on design, built, operate and transfer basis. The concessionaire will be responsible for making necessary arrangements, including repair, reconstruction if required and suitable creation of space for placing advertisements. The company will provide the services as well as maintenance for free for 10 years,” said the official. An anticipatory approval has been taken to implement the project and it will also be placed in a deliberative committee meeting later, he added. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said the tendering process had started and according to the size of the community/public toilet complexes, the selected outsourced agency would be given space for advertising and commercial purposes. “There are about 348 community/public toilet complexes under the EDMC jurisdiction. If this experiment becomes successful, maintenance and operation of other toilets will also be brought under this scheme,” he said. “Swachh Bharat Mission has been launched by Government of India in October 2014. In 2019, EDMC was certified as open defecation free and in 2020, it achieved ODF+. We are committed to provide world-class services to the residents and change the perception about usability of public toilets,” said the commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sludge-treatment-plants-at-edmc-toilets-to-secure-double-benefits/articleshow/85469093.cms||Vibha Sharma

Among other things, the draft report gives stress to bring down the cross subsidy and proposed measures to insulate consumers from the loss, if any, incurred by the power utility in the event of it running any other business. The draft guidelines published by the commission has proposed a mechanism for sharing of gains or losses incurred by the power utility on account of controllable factors. In case of the aggregate gain from generating/transmission/distribution business, the utility is supposed to transfer “one-half of the amount of such gain to the consumers as rebate in the tariff. However, the aggregate loss as approved by the commission shall not be passed on to the consumers in any manner” According to the draft, the commission may allow the licensee to sell the surplus energy, if any, to its consumers instead of selling in the open market or power exchanges. The excess power shall be available to its open access consumers at a price existing in the power exchange at the respective time block of the day. The licensee will have to announce the quantity of surplus energy available in advance through their website or any appropriate means so as to enable the open access consumers to express interest for the purchase of the same. Whereas the distribution business/licensee engaged in any other business for optimum utilization of the assets of its electricity business, an amount equal to one-half of the revenue from such other business, after deduction of all the direct and indirect costs attributed to such other business, shall be deducted from the aggregate revenue requirement of the distribution business/ licensee. “Where the sum total of the direct and indirect costs of such other business, exceeds the revenue from such other business, the distribution licensee shall file a petition before the commission clearly indicating the nature of business, its income and its sources, expenses, reasons for shortfall along with measures taken/ proposed to be taken to overcome the situation and seeking directions from the commission in this regard. No amount, however, shall be allowed to be added to the aggregate revenue requirement of the distribution business/licensee on account of such other business,” stipulates the draft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/serc-issues-draft-tariff-regulation/articleshow/85466396.cms||B S Anilkumar

This follows after 228 students from Kerala testing positive after reaching Dakshina Kannada, even after showing RT-PCR negative reports. Recent instances of students from Kerala testing positive in college campuses of Dakshina Kannada, has prompted the district administration to double check the RT-PCR negative reports at inter-state borders. However, the district administration is not sure whether inter-state commuters, especially students, use fake RT-PCR negative certificates to enter the coastal district. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra told TOI that checking the authenticity of RT-PCR negative certificates is a major challenge during border surveillance. “Commuters from Kerala, who enter Dakshina Kannada, have been bringing RT-PCR negative certificates. Those reports indicate that they are not infected with Covid-19 while entering our district. Hence, we have already made seven days of quarantine mandatory for all students who enter Dakshina Kannada, even if they produce RT-PCR negative certificates. However, even after entering the district, there are chances that those students may get infected within seven days, through contacts here. We have been receiving such cases in the past few days in the district. Till Tuesday, the district has found 228 students from Kerala testing positive after reaching Dakshina Kannada, and the number is increasing,” the DC said. He added that many of them got infected after seven days of quarantine in the district. “I have directed officials to check the authenticity of RT-PCR negative reports that the students from Kerala bring while entering the district. We have also directed colleges in the district to check the authenticity of Covid-19 reports when students enter the campus. Checking the authenticity of RT-PCR negative certificates is a major challenge for us, as reports are not uniform,” Rajendra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dk-to-double-check-authenticity-of-rt-pcr-reports-at-borders/articleshow/85466329.cms||---

The fawn deer, a Himalayan Goral, was brought up by Darshan Lal and his wife Uma Devi in Kewar village in Narayanbagar block after they found it alone and scared in the woods one evening. Since then, the deer, named Julie, has often accompanied them to festivities in the village and visits to the neighbourhood. “The entire village loves her, feeds her and treats her as one of their own. The thought of parting with her is heartbreaking. She is like a child to us,” said the couple, in their sixties, who live alone since their two sons moved to Punjab for work a few years ago. The couple was asked to hand over the animal to the forest department two weeks ago after they informed the officials about harbouring the deer in their house. “We had no idea they would separate us. We just wanted to let them know. They told us that the Wildlife Protection Act does not allow keeping a deer as a pet,” Lal told TOI. Himalayan Goral is listed as ‘Near Threatened’ on the IUCN Red List because the population is declining significantly. Lal, a former truck driver, is also worried that the domesticated deer might find it hard to adapt to a life in the wild, if the forest department decides to release it. “She can only be rehabilitated in a zoo. She is not a wild animal,” he said. Mohan Prasad Sati, a forest guard at Badrinath forest division, told TOI the animal would be shifted to a “safe and secure location”. “Arrangements are being made to put her in an environment which she would find easy to adapt to. The couple can stay with her until then,” he said. Lal’s neighbour, Balbir Singh, said Julie is welcomed in all homes in the village and brings much cheer to everyone. “The news has saddened everyone. Why can’t they let her live here?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/julie-we-love-you-village-that-adopted-lost-fawn-cries-at-separation/articleshow/85466503.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee

The directorate has not asked them to collect caste data.” At Handique Girls’ College, submission of online admission forms started last week and a large number of students have already specified their caste and community. The college principal did not respond to repeated phone calls from TOI.  An official who requested that he be not named said IT service provider Adroit DigiSoft Solutions included the caste column on its own. “There has to be a system to identify students from reserved categories like SC, ST or OBC. But we weren’t aware that students were being asked in the admission portal to reveal their caste. The college authority may drop this section soon,” the official said. Software developer KK Gogoi said the firm had decided to drop the caste options, based on objections from the colleges. “We wanted to be more specific. If a student is from the general category, the caste-related information would have made his/her identity more clear,” he said. Sikhamoni Konwar, principal of Karmashree Hiteswar Saikia College, said the IT firm had been asked to remove the caste options immediately. “We don’t even keep a record of which religion students follow, let alone caste,” she said. “There was no instruction from the government to record the caste and religion of applicants this time either.” State SFI secretary Nirangkush Nath alleged that the BJP-led government might be bringing caste mapping to academic institutions. “Some students were unaware of their caste when our volunteers were helping them fill in forms online. Never before did we have to reveal our caste.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/3-govt-colleges-in-assam-seek-caste-identity-in-entry-forms/articleshow/85474761.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The prime accused, an electrician identified as Rahul, was nabbed from Muzaffarpur, Bihar, who then revealed the details of the case. The cops are now hunting for Rahul’s associates, who have a chunk of the booty. Around Rs 19 lakh has been recovered from the accused. The help, Sarita, had run into the men burgling the house and raised an alarm. The accused panicked and killed her, Rahul told police. The owners of the house were away at the time of the incident. Sarita stayed behind as some renovation work was going on. The electrician was known to the family and often came in case to fix any issues. “Sarita (35) was working in the kitchen and some labourers were doing some renovation work in the flat. While the owners of the house left in the afternoon, the help stayed behind as the workers were to finish their job in 15-20 mins,” a senior police officer said. However, the owners later called the guard as Sarita was not responding to their calls. When the guard checked to see if she had left, he found the body on the floor. She was rushed to the hospital, where she was declared brought dead. A cupboard in the house were found broken open. Some jewellery and cash were missing from it. An FIR under sections of murder and violent robbery was registered and forensic teams inspected the spot. Surveillance revealed that Rahul, who was missing since the murder and was the prime suspect, had left for his hometown after which a team was rushed there to arrest him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/men-who-killed-house-help-in-central-delhi-fled-with-cash-and-jewellery-worth-rs-1-5cr/articleshow/85469195.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Open to app-based taxi services like in other states, says minister Mauvin Godinho||PANAJI: Transport minister Mauvin Godinho on Thursday said that the state government is open to all app-based taxi services, including Ola and Uber. His statement comes after taxi operators suggested that they would prefer to operate from an appbased aggregator service instead of using digital meters. Godinho said that if taxi operators want taxi aggregator then they should not oppose Ola and Uber Referring to the new demand of the taxi operators in the state, he said let the taxi operators take a clear stand. “They are confused. They don’t know what they want and they are being misguided,” Godinho said. The transport minister said that whatever decision the state government has taken has been on the direction of the court. “I cannot change even if I want to. Let them go to court and tell the court that they will function from app-based services. They have gone to the court three times, let them go a fourth time,” he said. The transport minister added that he has already told the taxi operators that the digital meter is also a type of digitisation and that he has already told the National Informatics Center (NIC) to add the app feature to digital meters “When we had asked them to go with app-based service, they (taxi operators) said they will never accept the app,” Godinho said. Questioning why then the taxi operators are opposing Ola and Uber if they want app-based aggregator service, Godinho said, “They (Ola and Uber) are also app-based services and if they come to the state then our people will only join them. They will not bring in taxis from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru. I have one thing to suggest. Let us make it a free market, like other states. Let other app based services come to the state.” Asked if it was possible to provide free digital taxi meters instead of refunding the money later, Godinho said, “Every situation is dynamic. We have always reached out to them. At present people are installing meters in large numbers. Should we punish these people who are following rules and regulations and installing meters. We have to think over this.” BJP won’t be able to accommodate Congress leaders: Reacting to speculations of some senior Congress leader joining BJP, transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that they don’t want any more to join. He said, “Existing leaders don’t have space, where will we accommodate new entrants.” Reacting to criticism to his statement that Porvorim should be renamed New Panaji, Godinho said everyone has the freedom to express their views and if people don’t want to rename the place, so it shall be. “As I told you, party is supreme. I will go by whatever the party decides. I have expressed myself, is there anything wrong. Because elections are close by, people are attributing motives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/open-to-app-based-taxi-services-like-in-other-states-mauvin/articleshow/85471672.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Vinay Kulkarni granted bail by special court; To walk out of jail||Dharwad: The special court dealing with the criminal cases against elected representatives has granted bail to former minister and Congress leader Vinay Kulkarni who was arrested by the CBI in connection with the murder of ZP member Yogeeshgouda Goudar.Justice B Jayantkumar, who had heard the arguments by the counsels for CBI and Vinay Kulkarni, granted bail on Thursday. The court was hearing a case of Vinay attempting to destroy evidence in the murder case.Earlier on August 11, the Supreme Court had granted bail to Vinay, who is accused no. 1 in the murder case. The two-judge bench comprising Justices Uday Lalit and Ajay Rastogi, while granting the bail had said that the accused should not visit Dharwad during the bail period and should visit the CBI office every week. The bench also warned that the bail will be cancelled if the accused attempts to tamper with the evidence.Now that both the courts where cases against Vinay have been filed have granted the bail, Vinay, who is lodged in Hindalaga Central Prison, Belagavi since November 5, 2020 will walk out of the jail. However, he cannot enter Dharwad district as the SC has barred him from doing so.Yogeeshgouda Goudar, a BJP member of the zilla panchayat from Hebballi constituency, was hacked to death by a group of people at his gym in Saptapur in Dharwad on the morning of June 15, 2016. Acting swiftly, local police had arrested six persons including Basavaraj Mutagi on charges of murder. Police had cited land dispute as the reason for the murder.However, family members of Yogeeshgouda, including his wife Mallamma, brother Gurunathgouda and mother Tungamma, were not ready to buy this theory and they had pointed fingers at Vinay Kulkarni, MLA from Dharwad (Rural) constituency who was then a minister in the Siddaramaiah cabinet. They had demanded a CBI inquiry which was declined by the state government. In the meantime, Mallamma who contested the byelection to ZP from Hebballi as a BJP candidate and lost, joined Congress. But Gurunathgouda and Tungamma continued their demand for a CBI inquiry into the murder case and even approached the high court seeking direction to the state government to hand over the case to the CBI. The high court had rejected their plea.The change of guard at Vidhana Soudha changed the course of investigation as the BJP government ordered a CBI probe. The CBI which began the probe arrested six others from Bengaluru on charges of murdering Yogeeshgouda and subsequently arrested Vinay Kulkarni accusing him of masterminding the murder and trying to threaten and destroy evidence.Vinay had approached Supreme Court seeking bail after the trial court and high court had rejected his pleas.caption JUBILATION: As news of Vinay being granted bail by the special court came in, his followers led by Shivashankar Hampannavar celebrated by bursting fire crackers and distributing sweets at Hebballi Agasi in Dharwad on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/vinay-kulkarni-granted-bail-by-special-court-to-walk-out-of-jail/articleshow/85463900.cms||---

We will release them once all the reports are confirme negative. We have examined occularly and didn’t find any issue with their health, but we will want to be sure.`` However, lion conservation activists in the area smell something fishy over the sudden capture. Vasavada, however, denied finding anything suspicious in the postmortem report of lions that were found dead in Khambha and Rajula areas recently. The five lions have been taken to the Jasadhar animal rescue center. Eight lions that were captured in January from Jetpur area were kept confined for a month without any proper reason before they were released following uproar by the lion activists. The activists are fearing the same treatment with these lions. Bhushan Pandya, a member of state wildlife board said, “We don’t know why these lions are captured but we hope they are released in the wild as soon as possible after health check-ups.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/five-lions-captured-for-health-check-ups/articleshow/85466649.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Beaten brutally, woman goes to thana in ambulance; 4 held||BAREILLY: A 27-year-old woman in UP’s Moradabad who was allegedly thrashed brutally by her family for marrying a man of her choice reached the office of the senior superintendent of police (SSP) in an ambulance — minutes after getting discharged from the hospital and with multiple fractures — to demand that a case of "attempt to murder" be filed against them. In her complaint to police, the woman alleged that four of her cousins barged into her marital home on July 19 and attacked her with sticks. “They wanted to kill me but my father-in-law and brother-in-law rescued me after which they fled. They should be booked for attempt to murder,” she said in her complaint filed on Wednesday. The four accused were arrested soon after the incident. Following the alleged assault, the woman, who belongs to Ganesh Ghat village under Mundha Pandey police jurisdiction, suffered fractures in both legs and an arm. She was hospitalised for 15 days. On Wednesday, after she was discharged from the hospital, the woman headed straight to the Moradabad SSP’s office to get justice. The woman was accompanied by her in-laws. The woman’s in-laws said that her family had previously beaten her up on several occasions, resulting in her getting hospitalised frequently. “She married my son, a mechanic, in March. Her family was against the match because it was a love marriage. Since then, her cousins have entered our house in the dead of the night many times and beaten her mercilessly. She was bedridden due to her injuries several times and needed treatment. I have exhausted all my savings in getting her treated repeatedly. We need financial assistance,” said Om Prakash, the woman’s father-in-law. In June, an FIR under section 325 (punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the IPC was registered against the four cousins, alleged the in-laws. This time, they want more stringent sections of the IPC against the accused. “We want strict action against these people who have made our lives a living hell,” said the father-in-law. Police said they are probing the case. “We have arrested four people in the matter and investigation is on," said circle officer Ganesh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/beaten-brutally-for-love-match-woman-reaches-thana-in-ambulance-with-complaint-4-held/articleshow/85466586.cms||Maria Khan

Furthermore, the rules clearly stipulate that parties can campaign in groups no more than five members strong.HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal confirmed to TOI that they were withholding permission for political rallies, since assembly of a large number of people in a place could lead to unchecked spread of Covid-19 infection. “The Election Commission has made it clear to the candidates that they can only engage in door-to-door campaigning. Only five people, including the candidate, can participate in the campaign; all of them must wear a mask and follow all the safety guidelines,” Itnal said.The HDMC commissioner said that there was a proposal to allow parties to hold political rallies that would be attended by less than 100 people. “But the EC has banned all public rallies and meetings for elections to civic bodies,” Itnal added.He further added that the candidates would not be allowed to use vehicles for campaigning. “Our team of officials, including returning and assistant returning officers, will ensure adherence to the model code of conduct. Action will be initiated against candidates caught violating safety norms,” said Itnal, adding that each candidate had to seek prior permission from the HDMC before starting his or her campaign. “We will also take steps to ensure that only one candidate campaigns in the same street at one time to prevent cramming of too many people in a confined space,” the HDMC commissioner said.However, political parties are none too pleased with the setup. They pointed out that covering an entire ward in a short span of time by knocking on residents’ doors would prove difficult. Functionaries of all parties did, however, agree to abide by the norms laid down by the EC.Activist Dr MC Sindhur called on all candidates, cutting across party lines, to take all necessary precautionary measures while campaigning lest the exercise lead to the spread of Covid-19 infection. “They should wear masks, and maintain a safe distance from each other. HDMC officials must stay vigilant and ensure that all parties abide by the safety norms,” Sindhur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-council-election-no-public-rallies-only-door-to-door-campaigning/articleshow/85463949.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

NHB tracks housing prices of 50 cities, it also includes two from Kerala. Housing prices are classified on the basis of carpet area size at city level (Rs/sq ft) for units under three product category levels namely up to 60 sq m, over 60 and up to 110 sq m and over 110 sq m. NHB Residex captures two housing price indices: HPI@assessment Prices and HPI@market Prices for under construction properties. The former is based on valuation data of residential properties received from banks and HFCs, while the latter is based on data of unsold stock collected through a market survey collected from project financing details of banks and HFCs. In Kochi, the average carpet area prices (HPI@assessment prices) for properties of size up to 60 sq m stood at Rs 4,259/sq ft during the third quarter of 2013. It grew to Rs 5,994 in the same period in 2020, a growth of 41%. Whereas, the carpet area prices of above 60 sq m and up to 110 sq m grew from Rs 3,920 to Rs 5,882/sq ft over the same period, registering a growth of 50%. For properties above 110 sq m, the prices grew from Rs 4,735 to Rs 8,356/sq ft, a growth of 76%. Overall, the carpet area prices (at the assessment prices) in Kochi grew from Rs 4,288 to Rs 6,843/sq ft, a growth of 60% in seven years. In Thiruvananthapuram, the overall carpet area prices (HPI@assessment prices) grew from Rs 4,035/ sq ft during third of 2013 to Rs 6,848/ sq ft during third quarter of 2020, a growth of 70%, which is 10% higher than that of Kochi. For properties of size up to 60 sq m, the carpet area prices stood at Rs 4,832/sq ft in 2013 and it grew to Rs 7,041/sq ft by 2020, an increase of 46%.

For properties above 110 sq m, the prices grew from Rs 4,074 to Rs 6,920/sq ft, an increase of 70%. Commenting on the steady growth of real estate prices in Kochi, MD of Asset Homes Sunil Kumar said, “The fact that there hasn’t been any correction shows that the builders in Kochi were always working on a relatively thin margin compared to the rest of the country. The maximum price here could be Rs 6,000 to 6,500/sq ft, while this could touch five figures in bigger towns.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/housing-prices-steadily-increased-in-7-years-nhb/articleshow/85466646.cms||Shenoy Karun

Five people, including a woman, were arrested by excise anti-narcotic special squad in a joint operation with state excise enforcement squad and customs preventive unit, Kochi. The arrest of two more persons, including a woman, is yet to be recorded. The seizure was made from a rented apartment at Vazhakkala. The arrested were identified as Sreemon, Mohammad Favas and Shamna of Kozhikode, Aju alias Amal of Kasaragod and Mohammad Afsal of Ernakulam. Though a Kasaragod native man and an Ernakulam native woman were also taken into custody, their arrests are yet to be recorded as the excise said they are yet to confirm their involvement in the case. According to the excise officers, the modus operandi adopted by the gang was to travel as family with ladies along with furious dog breeds like Rottweiler and Doberman to evade inspection by law enforcement agencies at checkpoints. Three dogs were also detained during the search operation and the car they used to travel was confiscated. “The gang is suspected to have been involved in the distribution of MDMA in not only Kochi but also in Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, Wayanad and Kasaragod,” said deputy excise commissioner, Ernakulam, Ashok Kumar. A case has been registered under relevant sections of NDPS Act and a probe has been launched by a team led by N Sankar of anti-narcotic special squad, Ernakulam.

---||Kochi||Experts propose ideas for setting up public toilets||Kochi: The fast emerging city still remains the only corporation in the state that lacks open defecation free (ODF) zone status. The city has a dearth of public toilets, and the administration claims that absence of available land is the major hindrance in the way of constructing these toilets. Even while the local body authorities fail to identify land for the purpose, experts in the field of developing public amenities suggest alternative solutions. “There are a lot of abandoned bridges in the city. The authorities can set up public toilet complexes on such bridges. They can also develop such bridges into a lively place with commercial and recreational activities,” said an official associated with Ashwas Public Amenities Kerala Limited, a wing of PWD. The Ashwas had constructed a number of public comfort stations in the state. “There are many canals in the city. Toilet complexes can be constructed on viaducts across the canals. Container toilets can also be set up across the canals,” he said.  Another suggestion is that the corporation should identify its own land which remains abandoned. “There are a lot of land parcels owned by the corporation in different parts of the city. Many of them have been alienated. The corporation authorities should identify such holdings and use the land for setting up public toilets,” said Upendranarayanan, director, Indian Institute of Road Safety. Another suggestion is to set up public toilet complexes on the medians of metro stations along with recreational space, café and comfort stations. The Ashwas have developed such stations in many places like Aroor and Perumbavoor. A small park for kids and a restaurant can be opened adjacent to the comfort station. This will ensure that the toilets remain well maintained. “In my division, there is a project for setting up a public comfort station. Though the fund for the project has already been earmarked, lack of land is the major hurdle. I have requested the corporation authorities to do the needful for getting the land attached to Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium metro station for setting up the toilet complex,” said Deepthi Mary Varghese, a councillor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/experts-propose-ideas-for-setting-up-public-toilets/articleshow/85466681.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Four days after he returned to his Picnic Garden home, Baren who was a chef in an Army camp in Kabul, is still in a delirium over the close shave in the nick of time. So long as he lives, he is unlikely to forget the ride from the military camp to the airport. “It is barely a 20-minute ride. But that day, it took hours. The situation was very chaotic all over Kabul. There were huge crowds and traffic jams everywhere on the streets. The air was taut with tension. I fervently prayed that I would reach the airport without any untoward incident. I am lucky to have made it out of Kabul just before the Taliban took over the capital,” recounted Baren, who reached Kolkata a day later. The reunion with wife Roshni was an extremely emotional one. Roshni fasted on August 15, praying to Jesus for his safe return. The two are Bengali Christians. “It was such a relief to have him back. Four of his friends are still holed up there. I pray for their return,” said Roshni. Baren, who specialises in Italian cuisine, has worked in Dubai, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia before taking up the assignment in Afghanistan. “This is my second stint in Afghanistan. The first one lasted five years,” he said. Baren had returned there in 2019 and served in military bases in Kandahar and Jalalabad. For the past five months, he was in an Army camp in Kabul. “The situation started changing in July. Since we were not permitted to step out of the camp due to security reasons, we could not gauge the tension outside. But we could pick up snatches of conversations among soldiers and it became evident that something was cooking. Finally, when the soldiers began to leave, I, too, realized it was time to go,” he said. For now, Baren is glad to be back home with Roshni and son, Allen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kabul-army-camp-chef-flies-back-to-safety-freedom-in-nick-of-time/articleshow/85469344.cms||---

The plea has alleged that rave parties go on into the wee hours of the morning on the Anjuna-Vagator beach belt and that there are no checks on the noise pollution caused by these parties. The decibel meter allotted to the Anjuna police station is non-functional and was sent for repairs, the police station submitted to the high court. In a letter the police station received in October 2019, it was stated that the decibel meter was non-repairable. The police station moved a note the same day to the SDPO Mapusa with a request to provide it a new decibel meter, but is yet to receive it despite a reminder letter in April this year. The petitioner, a resident of Anjuna, stated that on all occasions when he complained to the police station and on the public helpline number 100, police officials visited the site “without decibel meters”. Earlier this week, the high court was told that loud music in excess of permissible levels was played beyond 10pm between August 13 and August 15. The petitioner submitted videos of the parties to the high court and after watching them the court stated that the shack owner doesn’t have any permission to play music in its shack. The petition states that the noise pollution has been disturbing the peace and tranquillity of Chapora, Anjuna and Vagator and affecting senior citizens, families and minor children. The loud music normally commences after sunset around 6pm and goes on up to around 6am, the petitioner stated. “On account of the loud nerve racking music played unabated all night long from said beach shack within coastal areas, great trauma, harassment and disturbance is caused to the residents and, in fact, is a source of nuisance to the residents of the said area,” the petition states. “The residents of Vagator and Anjuna are unable to perform their normal functions during the day nor able to sleep during the night time, which results not only in the school going children being disturbed, but also reduces the performance level of the individuals resulting in a health hazard and disruption to the normal life of the residents and the surrounding villages in Anjuna and Vagator, affecting their lives,” the petition added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/anjuna-cops-blame-broken-decibel-meter-for-failure-to-check-noise-pollution/articleshow/85471750.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Of the 23 samples sent for genome sequencing, 19 have tested positive for Delta strain. So far, of the over 200 samples tested for the mutant strain, the majority were found to have Delta strain that caused the second wave. For the last few months, the directorate of health services has been routinely sending samples for genome sequencing to outstation laboratories as the facility is not available locally. Meanwhile, the state’s case positivity rate dropped to 1.3% with 6,220 samples tested on Thursday. The toll reached 3,181 with two fatalities — a 32-year-old from Mopa and a 46-year-old having comorbidities died at GMC. The 32-year-old had down syndrome and died within 24 hours of hospitalisation. On Thursday, 13 people were hospitalised and 10 were discharged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/19-of-23-test-positive-for-delta-strain/articleshow/85471746.cms||---

There were heaps of corpses at funeral grounds, along the banks of Ganga and hordes of bodies floated in the holy river during the second covid wave. Is BJP seeking ‘Jan Ashirwad’ (public blessings) for this deed of theirs?” the minister asked at a press conference here. “Theirs is a ‘Jan Dhokha Yatra’ (public deceit rally),” he added.Khachariyawas said, “Inflation is at an all time high with petrol-diesel and cooking gas prices rising frequently. In the last six years, the BJP government at the Centre has collected Rs 22-lakh crore by increasing excise duty on petrol and diesel.” The minister asked, “Why has the BJP not been able to solve problems of hunger and unemployment despite being in the second term of government at Centre? BJP has always been into the politics of lies, deceit and dishonesty.” Khachariyawas reiterated the demand for bringing in a law on employment guarantee for youths in cities on the lines of the existing MGNREGA for people in rural areas.Pointing to chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s statement that the Congress government in Rajasthan has fulfilled 64% of its manifesto promises in the past two-and-half years, minister Khachariyawas sought a similar report card from the Centre’s BJP government on its achievements. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/khachariyawas-says-jan-ashirwad-yatra-a-bid-to-hide-failures/articleshow/85471713.cms||---

The deceased Gumansinh Parmar was found hanging in his home by his family members, who later informed the police.According to police, the family of the deceased told them that Parmar had sown cotton on his 20 bigha land a few days ago with the hope of a good spell of rain. “But there was no rain in the region and he feared that his crop might fail. So, he took the extreme step,'' said A M Zala, investigating officer from Muli police station. The rains have played truant with the state recording only 39% of its average annual rainfall of 840mm till August 18. The rain deficient is nearly 50% compared to normal rainfall. Saurashtra and Kutch regions are the worst hit with only 35% of the average rainfall till August 18. Though August month generally records two to three good spells of rain that last for three to four days, but this year, there has been no reports of good rainfall. Weather experts said that they are not hoping for heavy rainfall for the next few days. The weather department official said that there was a lack of a good system in the Arabian sea that usually brings rains to Gujarat. The weather forecast issued on Thursday by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) suggests heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places in the district of South Gujarat region over the next 4-5 days. Heavy rains are also expected at isolated places in the districts of Dahod, Narmada, Surat, Navsari, Tapi and Bhavnagar during the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fearing-crop-loss-farmer-ends-life/articleshow/85466724.cms||---

---||Kochi||Dearth of raw materials disrupt NH bypass work||Thiruvananthapuram: The agitation against toll collection at Thiruvallam on Wednesday here has once again brought the public’s attention to the Kazhakkoottam-Karode national highway bypass stretch. The protesters on Wednesday raised the issue of commencing toll collection even before completing work for the second phase of the stretch from Mukkola to Karode. However, the works on this stretch have been caught in a limbo owing to shortage of raw materials, mainly red earth. It has been weeks since the works were affected, and the officials concerned have been on a race against time to clear hurdles to meet the deadline for completing works. Incidentally, it is for the second time in a year that the works were stalled owing to the same reason. Earlier, the problem had cost more than four months of work time. According to the officials of the National Highways Authority of India, around 93% of works of the second phase have been completed. What remains is works related to landfilling and laying bitumen in a few small pockets in Kottukal, Thirupuram and Chengal villages through which the NH passes through. Landfilling process is done using red earth, which is not in stock. The problem they are facing now is related to acquiring mining sanctions for the red earth. “Currently we have identified an acre of land in Chengal village where sufficient red earth is available. Works can be resumed as soon as we get the mining sanction”, said an official from the L&T Construction, the firm which is carrying out the works for NHAI. Meanwhile, for the mining and geology department to accord sanction, consent letters of residents in the proximity of the proposed mining land have to be produced. This process is what is causing the delay. The construction firm has been working tirelessly with the officials of Chengal panchayat for over a month in this regard. “We have managed to get consent letters from the majority of the residents. We hope to file the application for a mining permit in the next week itself,” the official said. He added that they do not expect any other administrative sanction like last time caused by multiple factors such as lockdown protocols and model code of conduct related to local body polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dearth-of-raw-materials-disrupt-nh-bypass-work/articleshow/85466762.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan

The app is the brainchild of UC Monks, a startup company by Jijo J, Parvathy H, Vivek S Nair, Arshath Safuan, and Prince Thomas, former students of University College of Engineering, Kariyavattom. Festeves, available both in the app store and play store, offers a wide range of items from Onakodi to Onathappan to celebrate the festival in all its traditional glory. Besides, the app also provides options for athapookalam and sadya. Once they receive the orders, they ensure that items are safely delivered at your doorsteps. In fact, their venture is giving a financial boost to economically crippled groups, including the weavers at Balaramapuram, and traditional flower merchants. It was their confidence, passion and quest for creativity that led them to set up a start-up firm. When most of their peers wanted to land coveted positions at multinational companies, the five friends decided to explore their talents. Their efforts gave shape to UC Monks last December. Jijo J, CEO of UC Monks said the idea of Festeves launched on July 27, was originally conceived in 2018. But the floods hampered their plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/festeves-app-to-ensure-hassle-free-onam-shopping/articleshow/85466782.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Coins worth Rs 11 crore go missing from SBI branch||JAIPUR: State Bank of India (SBI) officials of Mehandipur Bajalji town in Karauli district were shocked after learning about embezzlement of coins worth Rs 11 crore. Bank authorities have lodged a case at Todabhim police station and have also asked police to probe the role of bank officials who worked in this branch five years ago. According to police, complianant Hargovind Meena, manager of Mehandipur Bajalji branch, in an FIR lodged on August 16 said coins worth Rs 13,62,11,275 were deposited according to bank records, but only Rs 1.39 crore were found. “The embezzlement came to light when the bank management awarded a tender to a private firm for counting the coins on August 10. After this, the manager of the bank intimated higher authorities and later it was decided to lodge an FIR. We have registered an FIR and have initiated an investigation,” said a police officer. It was also been mentioned in the FIR that about 15 armed miscreants threatened one of the employee of the firm not to count the coins on August 11. “The manager has also demanded an inquiry into the employees working in the bank in the last 5 years,” the officer added. In the complaint, it was also alleged that the former manager of the bank and other employees had connived in this embezzlement. “We have registered an FIR and an assistant sub-inspector rank officer is been assigned the task to investigate the matter. We will visit the bank and if needed will call upon the former employees,” the officer added. Police said there are two possibilities in this embezzlement. “Either the coins sent to the firm for counting were less or there might have been the involvement of the firm which was assigned to count the coins. We will probe into every angle of this,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/coins-worth-rs-11-crore-go-missing-from-sbi-branch/articleshow/85471764.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru pips Mumbai, now district with second most Covid deaths||BENGALURU: Bengaluru Urban has now overtaken Mumbai to become the district with the second highest Covid deaths in the country, while Pune continues to lead the table. As of August 18, Bengaluru had 15,953 virus-related deaths compared to 15,930 in Mumbai and 18,779 in Pune. Bengaluru, which has the highest overall Covid-19 cases for a district in India after it pipped Pune in mid-May, has a better case fatality rate (CFR) than the Maharashtra cities. As of August 18, Pune’s CFR stood at 1.7% and Mumbai’s at 2.1% compared to Bengaluru’s 1.3%.   Data shows eight states or UTs — Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi and Punjab —have reported more than 15,000 deaths. Among these, no single district has more than 10,000 deaths. Bengaluru, which reported its first Covid death in late March 2020, took more than three months to cross the 100 mark, which happened on July 2 that year and the district breached the 500 and 1,000 marks in the same month.   Bengaluru saw 1k monthly deaths from Aug to OctFrom there, the number of deaths increased and Bengaluru saw an average of more than 1,000 deaths each month from August 2020 before it began to dip from late October. While the district had crossed the 4,000 mark on November 15, it took another four months to add 1,000 deaths and breach the 5,000 m6ark on April 16, 2021. As the second wave swept across Karnataka, Bengaluru’s death rate increased again. From 5,000 in mid-April 2021, deaths jumped to 7,000 in the first week of May, and doubled to 14,276 by June 3. With the waning of the wave, deaths reduced and it has taken more than two-and-a-half months for the remaining 1,677 deaths to be added. Comparatively, Mumbai had reported more than 5,000 deaths when Bengaluru’s toll was 155 (July 7, 2020). By October, the toll in India’s financial capital had crossed 10,000, which Bengaluru achieved in mid-May this year. Mumbai’s deaths have been low since October 2020, as Pune took the brunt of the second wave in Maharashtra. Unlike other states where the Covid-19 burden is better distributed among districts and Maharashtra too has more than one district sharing the burden, Karnataka’s pandemic load is taken mostly by Bengaluru. For instance, Pune and Mumbai together account for a quarter of Maharashtra’s deaths, while Bengaluru is home to 43% of Covid fatalities in Kar nataka. In fact, district-wise data shows that seven other districts in Karnataka — Mysuru (2,343), Ballari (1,686), Dakshina Kannada (1,509), Dharwad (1,291), Hassan (1,208), Tumakuru (1,087) and Shivamogga (1,069) — have more than 1,000 deaths, and all of them put together don’t add up to the number of deaths in Bengaluru. There are 13 districts with less than 500 deaths.

Serial sodomite Dilawar Khan Pathan, who had sodomized a 13-year-old boy in Rajkot city on August 8, was on Thursday arrested by the Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) of Rajkot city police. “We arrested Pathan from Gondal road in the city.

He was out on parole till July 13 but did not report back to jail and was wanted by the jail authorities,” a police official said. In the present case, the victim’s father had lodged a complaint against an unidentified person after the child informed his family about the incident. The incident occurred at around 9:30 am on August 8 when the boy came out of Ramesh Chhaya School campus in Sadar Bazaar area after attending a workshop organized by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Promising to give him a cricket ball, Pathan took the boy to the backside of the medical college in the Civil Hospital campus. There the accused tied the boy’s hand and sodomized him. In the past, he had been convicted in two child sodomy cases in Ahmedabad in 2005 and had served three years in jail.

---||Kolkata||‘Have not been able to sleep since Sunday’||I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw on TV how helpless Afghans were clinging on to an American aircraft and falling to their death from the sky. Since Sunday, I haven’t been able to sleep. I have been glued to news channels throughout the night. My hometown is Ghazni, about 150km south of Kabul. It is Afghanistan’s sixth largest city. From 1996 to 2001, when the Taliban held control over roughly three-quarters of Afghanistan, I was a little boy. I have heard from my parents how they enforced a strict interpretation of the Sharia law. I fear the same will happen again. It seems to have started already. Horrifying videos of women and men being killed, ostensibly for defying the Sharia laws, have been emerging. The more I see them, the more I lose hope. I am scared for my cousin and his family, who live in Ghazni. I last spoke to them on August 9, when Taliban forces were advancing towards Ghazni. Ever since there has been no contact. On August 12, I learnt from TV, that my city had been captured by the Taliban. Facebook is the only way of getting any information about my city  I left my hometown in 2006 to join the money lending business in Kolkata but after demonetization, I shifted to garments trading. I deal in Pathan suits, handkerchieves and turbans. I collect raw materials from Burrabazar and sell them among my own community. I shifted to a rented room on Elliot Road after my marriage and now live with my daughter (5) and son (3). My daughter joined a central Kolkata school last year and studies online now, something which would not have been possible if my family lived in Afghanistan. I don’t know if I will ever return to my country.

The health department is not taking any chances of leaving loose ends in the preparation for the third wave. The finance department has also given approval for retaining them till October. A health department official said Covid health consultants and health assistants were recruited aiming to bring down mortalities by breaking the chain of infection and ensure treatment to patients especially in the rural areas.

Congress’s student wing, National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), has also demanded that the Centre must reduce the time gap between two jabs for students as well. NSUI Goa president Naushad Chowdhari said that the directorate of higher education’s (DHE) circular lifting restrictions on physical classes has created a sense of fear among students given that the Covid-19 pandemic continues to claim lives. “The only hope against Covid-19 is vaccination, especially at a time when the daily cases are still fluctuating. Unless the graph of daily cases is stable, no physical classes should be held without vaccination,” Chowdhari said. NSUI has demanded special vaccination camps in colleges to inoculate those students who have yet to get their jabs. Given that no vaccination camps have been held specifically for students, NSUI said that the government’s seriousness is questionable. “This government is an expert in conducting surveys. We demand that a survey in each college be conducted as this will give a better picture of who is vaccinated or not. Offline classes should resume after the entire students community is 100% vaccinated,” Chowdhari said. The NSUI also wants the time between both the vaccine doses to be reduced for students just as it has been done for teaching and non-teaching staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/resume-classes-only-after-100-vaccination-cong/articleshow/85471819.cms||---
---||India||Italian marines case: SC stays compensation to boat owner||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Kerala high court not to disburse compensation awarded to the owner of fishing boat “'St Antony” in which two fishermen were allegedly killed by Italian marines in 2012 after ten surviving crew members also sought a share in it. A bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and V Ramasubramanian passed the order on a plea of the surviving fishermen who pleaded that they too were eligible for the compensation from Rs 2 crore earmarked by the top court for the boat owner. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta suggested that the fishermen’s plea can be sent to the Kerala HC which is entrusted with the task of disbursing the compensation, to which the bench said a notice to vessel owner Freddy was necessary as any modification in the order will cut down his share. The bench said that it will ultimately leave it for the HC to take a call but it should first hear the boat owner before sending the case to HC . Alleging that they also suffered despite not being hit by bullets in that firing incident, the surviving fishermen pleaded to the court that they should also be compensated like two of their colleagues who died and the boat owner who were granted Rs 10 cr compensation. On June 15, the SC had accepted the compensation of Rs 10 crore deposited by Italy. Out of the total amount of Rs 10 crores, Rs 4 crores was to be paid to the family members of each deceased person and Rs 2 crore to the boat’s owner, The apex court thereafter closed all the proceedings in India against the two Italian Marines — Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone. “After the shooting incident, the applicants have been afraid to venture into the sea. On account of the same, the applicants have lost their means of livelihood and their moral right to feed their family members. The applicants and their families have been struggling even for basic sustenance. They have also undergone immense mental trauma and suffering,” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/italian-marines-case-sc-stays-compensation-to-boat-owner/articleshow/85474848.cms||---

Dearth of oxygen during the second wave of Covid had promoted the health department to install oxygen generation plants in the state. “We are targeting to achieve 1,000 metric tonne of oxygen generation daily from oxygen plants which are being established indifferent parts of the state and also from oxygen concentrators which we are installing not only in urban areas but also in rural areas too,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). Recently, the health minister inaugurated an oxygen plant at Mahila Chikitsalaya having a capacity of producing enough oxygen to cater to the needs of 200 beds and another was inaugurated at JK Lon Hospital, which has the capacity of catering to the need of 160 beds. Besides, the health department has made it mandatory for private hospitals for setting up oxygen generation plants which have 60 or more beds. Also, in rural areas, as many as 350 community health centres have been identified by the health department, which will be developed in such a way that they will have facilities for Covid treatment including oxygen therapy. For the purpose, health department is now making efforts to install oxygen generation plants or if it is not possible, it is ensuring that the CHCs should have sufficient number of oxygen concentrators and supply of oxygen cylinders. The measures are being taken by the health department to remain prepared for the third wave, which may emerge in the coming months. For the purpose, the health department is ensuring sufficient stock of medicines, oxygen and beds for Covid patients along with other facilities required in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-100-oxygen-plants-set-up-in-raj-after-second-wave/articleshow/85471806.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan needs 80 lakh doses in August to meet second shot demand||JAIPUR: Justifying the demand for 2 crore Covid vaccine doses for August, the health department has pointed out that they need 80 lakh doses for those who have already received the first dose and need to get their second dose in August. “As many as 80 lakh beneficiaries are now eligible for receiving the second dose. However, the Centre has allocated just over 53 lakh doses for August. If we vaccinate only those who are now eligible for second dose in August, we require at least 80 lakh doses. But, the allocation for the state for August is just over 53 lakh doses,” said a health department official. Taking up the issue, health minister Raghu Sharma has already written a letter to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya to increase the allocation of doses for August. The number of beneficiaries in the state are 5.14 crore, and for vaccinating them, the health department requires 10.28 crore doses. But, till date, just over 3.87 crore doses have been administered. Still, over 6.4 crore doses are required by the health department to fully vaccinate the eligible population for vaccination in the state. If the state continues to receive the same number of doses allocated by the Centre for a month, it would take at least six to 10 months to completely vaccinate the people eligible for vaccination in the state. Health experts claimed that to avoid third wave, the need of the hour is to scale up vaccination against Covid and also people should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. On Thursday, till 6pm, the number of doses administered were 2.6 lakh, out of which 1.8 lakh were first doses and over 80,000 were second doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-needs-80l-doses-in-aug-to-meet-second-shot-demand/articleshow/85471827.cms||---

---||Lucknow||1 crore youths in Uttar Pradesh to get smartphones & tablets||LUCKNOW: In what is being seen as one of the biggest youth-outreach moves of the UP government months before assembly elections, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced that one crore youths of the state would be given smartphones and tablets for their 'digital empowerment'. The chief minister’s announcement came during reply to the discussion over the supplementary budget tabled on Wednesday. Following the CM’s reply, the supplementary budget worth Rs 7,301 crore was passed by voice vote. Replying to the discussion, the CM said that the Opposition never cared about youths of the state and they were forced to commit unruly acts and ultimately put behind bars. However, the BJP government was thinking about their betterment. Earlier, the youth of the state used to hide his domicile as he was afraid of the state’s image on the law and order front. “But now whenever he goes out, he proudly tells everyone that he is from Uttar Pradesh,” he said.The government has plans to make youths of the state digitally empowered, Yogi said and added that it is for this reason that in the supplementary budget out of over 7,000 crore, Rs 3,000 has been earmarked for youths. The budgetary provision made would be used for purchasing tablets and smartphones which would be given to one crore youths from high school and above. "Mainly unemployed youths would be getting the benefit of the scheme," he said. The CM, announcing further sops for the youth, said that the state government would also provide allowances to technicians, polytechnic pass-outs, graduates and postgraduates for appearing in competitive exams. The youths would be given free digital access, the CM said. Even though the leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary termed the supplementary budget an election plank, political analysts said that the announcement to woo youths will have a positive impact for UP which is one of the youngest states that would go to polls in 2022. The CM’s list of announcements didn’t end here. Remembering the contribution made by nigrani samitis consisting of Anganwadi and Asha workers, the CM said that the state government has decided to increase the honorarium of them as a mark of appreciation for their contribution during the corona pandemic. Further keeping 16 lakh employees and 12 lakh pensioners in good humour, the CM said that the state government has decided to give increased DA and bonuses to them. They would be getting 11% increased DA. A provision for the same has been made in the supplementary budget, Yogi said. He said budgetary provision has also been made for the upkeep of stray cows. There are around 6 lakh stray cattle in the state, the CM said and added that a provision to give Rs 900 on each cow has been made under which any farmer can keep at least four stray cows. For this the farmers are getting Rs 900 per cow, the CM said. He said 90,000 such stray cows are being taken care of by farmers. Criticising the previous SP government, the CM said there was a deliberate move on the part of the SP government to close the Sanskrit schools as admissions and teachers’ appointments were closed. “However, we have opened everything and budgetary provision has been made for appointment and salary of Sanskrit school teachers. For the new appointments, a district level team led by the manager of the school has been made,” the CM concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1cr-youths-in-up-to-get-smartphones-tablets/articleshow/85473488.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Lucknow||‘I never give up in the face of adversities’, says Boxer Satish Kumar||Boxer Satish Kumar is a fighter to the core. The Subedar Major, who hails from UP’s Bulandshahr, had put up a gritty performance in the Tokyo Olympics when he participated in a medal-deciding quarterfinal against Uzbek heavyweight Bakhodir Jalolov despite 13 stitches on his face. Though he lost the bout but won many a hearts, even forcing his opponent to praise him for his fighting spirit. Kumar, who was in Lucknow to attend the felicitation function at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium where he received Rs 25 lakh award, spoke to Fazal Khan on his Tokyo experience and UP government’s efforts for promotion of sports. Excerpts: How was the Lucknow felicitation event? The UP government’s efforts are highly commendable. I think no other state has given so much respect and appreciation to Olympians as the UP government did. This will inspire young players to do well and win medals for the country. A sports university is coming up in Meerut. How do you see it? It is a welcome step and will help a lot in promotion of sports, especially in west UP. Young sportspersons from the region will get the opportunity to hone their skills and bring honour to the state and the country. You had many stitches on your face when you decided to fight in the quarterfinals. How did you manage to do it? I had six stitches around my eye and seven on the chin. But Olympics come once in four years and it was a medal-deciding bout. My first priority was to give my best. My father and my brother have motivated me so much that I never give up in the face of adversities. What was the advice of the doctor after your medical checkup? The doctor asked me not to go for the bout as the injury on my chin was bad. But I requested that I should be allowed to fight and said I would stop if bleeding occurs. My opponent, who is number 1 boxer, also praised me after the fight. He also posted a tweet saying that I fought like a true warrior. Q What are your future plans? My focus is certainly on the next Olympics in Paris. Besides, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games are also lined up next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/i-never-give-up-in-the-face-of-adversities/articleshow/85473519.cms||Fazal Khan

Accused Ramswaroop is the husband of Pravesh Vankar who worked as a nurse and domestic help in Yagnik’s house in Navrangpura, said police. Yagnik’s husband Kantilal Rathod, 69, filed a complaint on Thursday, accusing the caller of criminal intimidation and using abusive language. “Since Yagnik was not keeping well, we employed Pravesh as nurse and domestic help on August 11. When she was working at home on Tuesday morning, she received a call from a person who told her to come to Sola police station to give a statement in connection with a police complaint against her. When she told Yagnik about it, the retired judge took the phone from her and asked the caller if Pravesh could come to the station after work,” the complaint stated. The man on the phone allegedly told Yagnik that he was a cop. However, when she asked for his name and buckle number, he began abusing the former judge. Yagnik disconnected the phone but the man made 42 threatening calls to Yagnik from two different phone numbers on Tuesday and Wednesday. Pravesh filed a complaint of domestic violence against Ramswaroop on Wednesday, following which Sola police nabbed him the next day. Ramswaroop’s custody was handed over to Navrangpura police who is investigating the threats made to the retired judge. Since he was drunk when he was caught, the accused was also booked for violating prohibition norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/retired-judge-gets-42-threat-calls/articleshow/85469534.cms||---

He demanded that the state government provide relief to the artiste community, and to open Ravindra Bhavan Margao at 50% capacity to facilitate tiatr shows. “As Tika Utsavs have been successful and as a significant population has taken both the doses of vaccination, the government should allow Ravindra Bhavan to be opened at 50% of its capacity,” he said. “Last June, the government made some statement of giving a one-time grant of a maximum of Rs10,000 to the artistes, but no final decision has been taken yet,” Sardesai said, and wondered how the “paltry sum” would benefit the affected theatre artistes. He further announced that he would utilise the monthly salary he gets as an MLA to pay the tiatrists from his constituency as a relief measure. “I appeal to other MLAs to do likewise in their respective constituencies,” he said. He further advocated the need for a change in art and culture policy of the state, and stressed on the need to include performing arts in the academic curriculum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-should-open-ravindra-bhavan-with-50-capacity-sardesai/articleshow/85472203.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Narayan Rane targets Shiv Sena on Marathi turf, says BJP will win BMC polls||MUMBAI: Union minister and now BJP leader Narayan Rane led the party’s onslaught against the Shiv Sena by launching his Jan Ashirwad Yatra from Mumbai on Thursday. Seven FIRs were later registered by Mumbai police — at Vile Parle, Kherwadi, Mahim, Shivaji Park, Dadar, Chembur and Govandi police stations — in connection with his yatra for flouting Covid guidelines. Rane, on his arrival in the city, first paid tributes at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue on Thursday morning and thereafter headed to pay his respects to the late Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray at his memorial at Shivaji Park. Sena MP Vinayak Raut had on Wednesday said that the party would not allow Rane to visit and pay respects at the Balasaheb Thackery Smruti Sthal at Shivaji Park. However, on Thursday, the party changed its stance. Mayor Kishori Pednekar, while reacting, said that the Sena would not restrict Rane. “While he (Rane) pays respects to Sena Supremo, he should follow his ideology,” she said. Rane said Thackeray belonged to the entire country and his memorial had been built by the BMC at a public place. “It is not somebody’s private property. I had been waiting for this day, and today I feel very contented. When I was in the Sena, Thackeray would tell me, ‘Narayan, go forth.’ I am sure today also, he will bless me saying the same and to bring victory to the BJP. I am confident the BJP will come to power in the BMC,” he said. Pednekar said there was a contradiction when BJP leaders such as Atul Bhatkalkar said the party’s face for the BMC elections is Narendra Modi and Devendra Fadnavis and Rane claimed he was leading the BJP’s fight for the civic polls. “The original party does not seem to accept his leadership,” she said. Rane started his week-long Jan Ashirwad Yatra from Mumbai, while three newly-inducted ministers of state at the Centre, Bhagwat Karad (finance), Kapil Patil (Panchyat Raj) and Bharti Pawar (public health) started the yatra from their respective constituencies. During his yatra in Bandra, Rane levelled corruption charges against the Sena and said the BJP will win 120 seats and come to power in the BMC in 2022. Rane’s yatra moved through the Marathi-dominated areas of Bandra (Kherwadi), Mahim, Shivaji Park, Naigaon-Bhoiwada and Chembur.  Sena leader and urban development minister Eknath Shinde said, “Every party works for itself. The MVA of 3 parties is doing well in the state. So (Rane’s yatra) has nothing to do with Sena.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rane-targets-shiv-sena-on-marathi-turf-says-bjp-will-win-bmc-polls/articleshow/85472035.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Nagpur||Not possible to limit global warming without India, G20’s contributions: Espinosa||Climate change is no longer a silent killer in India. Deadlier floods and landslides in various parts have left hundreds dead in the country. The United Nations climate change report further warns India of facing irreversible impacts of climate change. Stating that the current situation is a testimony that efforts to address climate change are not enough, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Patricia Espinosa, in an exclusive interaction with TOI, stresses that time has now come for shared responsibilities and keeping promises. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a death knell for India which is expected to witness a rise in extreme weather events. How seriously should the policy-makers consider the report?We are all witnessing how severely India has been impacted by heavy rains, floods and landslides in the recent weeks. These events have washed away livelihoods and led to the loss of lives. My heart goes out to every person who has been impacted by these events. The IPCC report is a very loud wake-up call. It is testimony to the fact that the efforts taken to address climate change over the past decade have been insufficient. I really hope that all governments take this report to heart and use it to guide their policy choices and decisions. Sound policy is based on sound science and this report needs to be the foundation that climate change is built upon. India is thinking to update its nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Your advice for the government.When it comes to fulfilling the Paris Agreement, the importance of NDCs cannot be understated. These plans allow governments to plan their national climates responses over the next years. While the deadline for presenting the NDCs was 2020, countries need to remember that they can review their climate action plans at any time to increase their ambitions. At present, more than half of all the parties of the Paris Agreement have submitted new or updated NDCs, I want to invite them to review them again. While we expect major economies like India to update it, it is crucial that the plans not only focus on reducing emissions but also adaptation. So far, we have seen very few national adaptation plans by developing countries. For protecting the vulnerable population, there is an urgent need for ambitious adaptation particularly for a country like India. India recently stated that asking developing countries to pledge towards a net-zero goal will undermine their right to develop and urged the G20 nations to bring down their per capita emissions. In this battle between the developed and developing world, has the time come for major economies like India to take shared responsibilities? Or the onus should still be on the developed countries?It’s not about putting one-sided responsibilities on inequality; there are different responsibilities for developed and developing countries. What Paris aimed was to make clear that climate change is a global problem that is affecting each and every country around the world. We are facing a very critical situation now – the 1.5 degrees goal is starting to slip out of reach and we cannot allow that to happen. Science has already told us that what will be the consequences and countries with more vulnerable population and less resources will be suffering more. Yes, it is true that developed nations must take the lead. The way that we are seeing the climate emergency unfolding around us makes it very clear that the efforts are required by all, especially from countries like India. It will not be possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees without the contribution of all G20 countries. The United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres has stated that countries should end all new fossil fuel exploration before they destroy our planet. Despite ambitious clean energy targets, investments in coal continue in India. Should it put a complete full stop on its dependence on the fossil fuel and make a complete energy shift?This is the path we need to follow. It is very important to recognize that such decisions are in the interest of each and every country. Look at the consequences of use of fossil fuels, especially coal which is causing millions of deaths all around the world every year. The secretary general’s call to shut down all coal-fired power stations by 2040 needs to be taken seriously. We are seeing how much feasible renewable energy sources are. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s National Hydrogen Mission which is an incredible step. However, we don’t just have to talk about phasing out in future but putting a strict deadline to end reliance on coal as soon as possible. The previous United Nations Conference of Parties (COP) have failed to reach key outcomes or an overall consensus on increased climate ambition. How is COP26 going to be different? What are your expectations?You are right. We have had a lot of work virtually and it has been very tense. It is true however that these meetings have not really been entirely fruitful when it comes to negotiations. Still, I wouldn’t want to underestimate the value of those exchanges because when you have almost 200 countries around the table, you need to give them time to have their exchanges which are very valuable. But the real negotiations on the pending issues have not yet started. We have been discussing for almost six years and now we have to wrap up outstanding discussions. We are also hopeful that in COP26, the governments will come ready to make compromises and allow us to have a successful outcome. It will be a credibility test for the international community. Promises that have been made must be kept — parties must fulfil their pre-2020 commitments. Fulfilling the commitment of mobilizing $100 billion annually is urgent, not just to support countries in their adaptation efforts but also as a signal of trust and willingness to continue collaboration. The best time to raise climate ambition was yesterday and the next best time is today.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-possible-to-limit-global-warming-without-india-g20s-contributions-espinosa/articleshow/85462536.cms||Manka Behl

The court was moved by Sureshbhai Nayani after her wife, Rekhaben, died in August 2007. She was called on special duty to a school in Jiyana village of Rajkot on August 9, 2007. She was swept away in an overflowing culvert while on her way to school. She drowned, and her body was recovered two days later. Her husband sought compassionate appointment after death of Rekhaben, who was the sole breadwinner of the family. Since, Nayani’s request was not heeded, he approached the high court. During the hearing, the state government claimed that Rekhaben was appointed as Vidya Sahayak in January 2001. She started getting regular pay scale only in March 2006. On the day of her demise, she had not completed five years of her regular service. Therefore, the family was not eligible for any compensation including compassionate appointment. After hearing the case, the bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice Umesh Trivedi said that relief of compassionate appointment to the husband cannot be granted after 14 years of the teacher’s demise. However, “As far as the period of service of the deceased Rekhaben to be considered as regular service as Vidya Sahayak right from January 25, 2001 is concerned, it can be held to be so as there is no dispute before us that the deceased Rekhaben was appointed after facing due selection process and merely grant of her regular pay-scale at a later point of time will not exclude the previous period of 5 years for the purposes of compute her benefits available under the law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-compensation-for-teachers-death-on-duty/articleshow/85469564.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Wadettiwar blames CSTPS for pollution in Chanda, orders MPCB inquiry||Chandrapur: Expressing concern over increase in pollution and its adverse health impact on Chandrapur citizens, guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar squarely blamed the Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) for it and ordered the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to conduct inquiry and take appropriate action. In a review meeting held at district collectorate on Thursday, Wadettiwar charged the power plant with not taking measures to curb pollution despite Supreme Court orders. He maintained that the condition in city has reached a critical stage and ailments like skin diseases, asthma and other respiratory problems are on the rise. The minister directed the MPCB regional officer to take cognizance and initiate measures to curb pollution. CSTPS, which is the largest coal-fired power plant in Maharashtra, generates 2,920MW power from seven units, including two with capacity of 210MW each and five others with 500 MW each. There have been many complaints about excessive pollution against the mega power plant. MPCB has forfeited the bank guarantee of the plant on many occasions for causing pollution. Mahagenco was forced to scrap two of its oldest and highly polluting units I and II. The existing unit no. 3 and 4, both having installed capacity of 210 MW each, were commissioned in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Both the units have ESP design for discharging of suspended particulate matter at an average of 350 mg/Nm3 as against present norm of 50 mg/Nm3. Both the units have 150 metre tall emission chimneys as against present standard of 275 metre. MPCB has given these two units special relaxation of releasing 100 mg/Nm3 in light of its old age and outdated ESP design. Regional officer, MPCB, Ashok Kare claimed that CSTPS is having its own pollution monitoring system. “MPCB officials carry out surprise checks at CSTPS once every month. “However, we will install three ambient air quality monitoring machines in CSTPS on Monday,” said Kare. Kare further said that the monitoring would continue for three continuous days. “Based on the outcome of the monitoring, appropriate action would be taken as per regulations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wadettiwar-blames-cstps-for-pollution-in-chanda-orders-mpcb-inquiry/articleshow/85467050.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Ahmedabad||10,000 jobs to flood Gujarat’s IT sector in next six months||AHMEDABAD: Buoyed by the increasing demand for digitisation and automation in the state’s Information Technology (IT) and IT-Enabled Services (ITES) sector, companies in Gujarat are looking to hire more people in the days to come. Industry estimates by IT giants and other firms suggest that at least 10,000 more people are expected to be hired in the IT sector of Gujarat in the coming two quarters. For instance, Ahmedabad-based outsourcing firm Analytix Business Solutions (India), which provides technology solutions to US-based businesses, is looking to recruit more than 100-150 people in the coming months. “We continue to witness strong project pipelines and new client additions this year. We have already hired close to 200 persons between January and June this year. To be able to meet further growth objectives, we plan to hire 100-150 people across different business units,” said Rajiv Bhatia, president – India operations, Analytix Business Solutions. Similarly, QX Global Group, an outsourcing firm, is also looking to hire at least 500 people across various departments. Group CEO Frank Robinson said, “We have strategic partnerships with six of India’s most prominent universities and business schools. We have invested a million euros for the current financial year to train 1,000 graduate accountants by 2022 from across our global operations.” Gujarat is home to at least 2,000 IT and ITES firms in addition to a slew of tech startups. With growing number of companies opting for automation, the demand for IT services has grown. “Several businesses are undergoing cloud transition involving automation of basic business processes ranging from accounting to attendance and concierge management at break-neck speed. This has spurred the demand for fresh professionals,” explained Ravi Pathak, founder and CEO, Tatvic Analytics, which plans to hire at least 100 people in the five months. To be able to retain talent and attract fresh professionals, IT companies are rolling out lucrative packages for mid- to senior-level professionals. However, fresh talent is often picked up from tier-II or tier-III markets. “Remote working has dissolved the geographical boundaries for hiring and therefore, companies prefer to absorb younger talent from tier-II and tier-III cities and towns where the cost of living is less. Therefore, they can make lucrative offers within their budgets to get new talent,” said Pathak. Industry players suggest that many businesses in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), healthcare and consumer products segments, are fast adopting automation and cloud-based services, which has poured in more work orders for IT firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/10000-jobs-to-flood-gujarats-it-sector-in-next-6-months/articleshow/85469689.cms||Niyati Parikh

The accused had kidnapped the minor in April 2018 and gang raped her.

In the incident, the minor went out of home to buy snacks when accused Javre approached her in an auto rickshaw while she was returning home. The accused offered her a ride up to her home and instead took her to Madina Market area in Bardoli where he forcibly kept her at a place. Here, all the three accused raped her repeatedly throughout the night. The traumatized minor suffered injuries and after she turned normal two days later, a complaint was lodged in Bardoli police station.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan power generator runs out of money to pay for coal||JAIPUR: Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd (RVUNL) has run out of cash to pay for coal and keep running the state’s power plants. It shut down 600 MW unit of Kalisindh Thermal Power Plant on August 11 and switched off the second unit of same capacity on August 15. Now, it seems the 1,500-MW Suratgarh Thermal Power Station could be next in line. Most of the power plants of the state have coal for a day or two and it takes 2-3 days to transport them from the mines in the eastern part of the country. Alarm bells have been ringing for quite some time. But no heed was paid to RUVNL’s precarious financial condition. The state power generator company (RVUNL) owes Rs 850 crore to Coal India and Rs 1,850 crore to Parsa Kanta Collieries Ltd (PKCL). Recently, both the coal suppliers had sounded out RVUNL that supply would be disrupted if dues are not paid. In fact, Coal India had stopped supply in the past few weeks and only resumed with one rake recently. PKCL started supplying with restricted capacity after it was paid Rs 375 crore in recently. With the Kalisindh units shutting down, the discoms are now buying power from the exchange at about Rs 17 per unit during the evening times, or peak hours. “How can you expect power costs not going up if the discoms have to pay Rs 17 per unit. It is the consumer who have to bear the brunt,” said a Jaipur discom official preferring anonymity. Since the crisis has reached highest levels of the government, officials of both discoms and RVUNL are tightlipped. But some said the problem is the making of the discoms. “The discoms buy power from the plants but don’t pay fully. They owe about Rs 2900 crore to RVUNL, which in turn has taken loans of about Rs 2,4000 crore to meet its expenses, including buying coal. On this loan amount, RVUNL pays an interest rate of Rs 275 crore annually. It cannot survive with such a burden and buy coal for running the plants,” said the official. Earlier this month, RVUNL paid Rs 125 crore to Coal India to resume the supplies. But Coal India has decided to supply only 3 rakes. All the government power plants require 16 rakes of coal per day (One rake contains 4000 tonne). PKCL has also reluctantly agreed to supply 4-5 rakes a day. “Even then, the power plants will have to run at half the normal capacity required to supply power to the consumers. In that situation, the discoms will have no option than to buy costly power from the energy exchange,” said the discom official quoted earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-power-generator-runs-out-of-money-to-pay-for-coal/articleshow/85472055.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Pune||Soon, only RTO-verified doctors in Maharashtra can certify licence seekers||PUNE: Starting September 1, only RTO-verified doctors in Maharashtra will be allowed to issue medical certificates to people looking to renew their driving licences and those above 40 applying for a new licence. Officials of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) said the doctors have to visit RTO offices and have their medical qualifications verified, after which they will be given a login ID to upload the medical certificates. Verified doctors will have to upload the applicant’s medical certificate on the Sarathi portal. “We want a transparent system and ensure that no one can upload a fake medical certificate and get a driving licence. Hence, we are telling the doctors to upload the medical certificates themselves,” an RTO official told TOI. Deputy RTO of the Pune office Sanjay Bhor said that till now, four doctors visited the office to ask about the new regulations, but none had registered so far. TimesViewThe decision to allow only Regional Transport Office (RTO)-verified doctors to issue medical certificates to people seeking renewal of driving licence can turn into a problem in the long run. Given the change in the system, applicants will first have to find a verified doctor. If only a few doctors register with the RTO, getting their appointment would be an uphill task for licence seekers. The new system, though aimed at transparency, may eventually delay the renewal process.Another official, while assuring that doctors will not be inconvenienced during the verification, admitted that it is possible many of them may not be keen on the process. The doctor will have to be verified by the RTO otherwise the medical certificate will not be accepted. “We will write to the Indian Medical Association (IMA) urging it to encourage private doctors to participate. Discussions will also be held with government hospitals like Sassoon, and hospitals under the civic bodies and the Zilla Parishad to urge their doctors to come to the RTO and register themselves,” said the official. Currently, a self-declaration of medical fitness, which is approved by a doctor, is required to renew a driving licence, and it is be uploaded by the applicant. “If doctors upload the medical certificate, the system will recognise that it was uploaded from the login ID of a verified doctor,” the official said. A middle-aged woman, meanwhile, asked what the RTO plans to do if few doctors register for verification. “Will applicants have to hunt for verified doctors? My driving licence expires on August 31 so I will apply before this regulation comes into effect,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/soon-only-rto-verified-docs-can-certify-licence-seekers/articleshow/85469712.cms||Joy Sengupta

It also comes against the backdrop of a petition in the Allahabad high court alleging scam. The petition says that there was a government post office on the premises of the university, but the authorities took the service of a private and little known courier firm. Soon after it surfaced that wrong addresses of students were fed in the system -- in some cases they were ‘abcdefgh’-- and most of the degrees were coming back to the varsity, a probe was set up. After the three-member probe panel submitted its report highlighting lapses, the university took the action. Departmental inquiry was set up against assistant registrars Vikas Kumar and Kamal Krishna. While Neeraj Kumar, chief assistant officer in accounts section, and Rajeev Pal, chief assistant officer in degree section, have been suspended. Last year, in the midst of the pandemic, the university had decided to mail all the degrees directly to the residence of students to save them the hassle. The initiative was advertised as “one-of-its-own-kind in Uttar Pradesh". A sum of Rs 90lakh was also sanctioned for it. Later, the courier agency said that over 40,000 degrees of the academic year 2017 and 2019 came back from the given postal addresses as “the place did not exist, or no such student with the given name was found at the address.” Smelling a scam, a social activist, Abhishek Som, filed the petition in the court, which has now asked the UP government to file a response. The next hearing has been fixed for August 24. “No courier agency guarantees delivery to villages. Then how come the university trusted a private agency to handle such a massive task of delivering degrees to the interiors of the rural areas across UP? Why the services of government agencies like India Post, which has impeccable credibility, was not taken which would have charged much lesser amount than the private agency which has not even been able to give details of tracking ID to the university,” petitioner Som said. “Wrong addresses are just the tip of the iceberg. It is actually a scam in which lakhs of rupees were doled out without checking parameters or delivery mechanism. Now, we will see what the university says in the court,” Som said. Meanwhile, the university is in damage control mode. Registrar of CCSU, Dhirendra Singh, said, “We had immediately set up a probe committee in this regard. We have suspended two CCSU officials with immediate effect as the probe found dereliction in duty on their part. Besides, two assistant registrars have also been put under departmental inquiry. We have also terminated the contract of the courier agency and the remaining payment has also been withheld.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-univs-plan-to-send-home-40k-degrees-falls-flat-2-assistant-registrar-facing-probe/articleshow/85467141.cms||Sandeep Rai

Excessive speed appears to be the main reason due to which the vehicle lost control and fell on the pedestrian. “Ajay was unconscious and blood was streaming from his head. He was ferried to a hospital where he died later,” an official said, adding that efforts were being made to detain the driver. A case was filed against the driver for reckless driving. The police party that had gone to the spot claimed that vegetables were strewn all over the road after the accident. “Scores of vehicles from nearby areas race to go to the vegetable market in the morning. The victim, on the other hand, was going out to buy milk. We don’t have information about what exactly led to the crash, but excessive speed appears to be the chief reason behind the accident,’ an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pedestrian-dies-after-van-overturns-falls-on-him/articleshow/85472126.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Plans afoot to upgrade single fencing to double at Shahgarh Bulj area||JAISALMER: Single fencing in shifting dunes area in Jaisalmer’s Shahgarh Bulj has failed because of strong dust storms, increasing chances of intrusion and smuggling. To strengthen the security arrangements, a plan has been made for double fencing with special technique. CPWD gave a presentation to BSF Rajasthan frontier recently. An estimate will be sent to the Union home ministry for approval. Apart from this, CAZRI has come up with a project under which desert species plants will be grown in the shifting dunes to prevent its spread. BSF Rajasthan Frontier IG Pankaj Goomer said this during his stay in Jaisalmer. BSF Sector North DIG Arun Kumar Singh, Commandant Lokesh Sharma, 191 Battalion Commandant SR Bairwa were present with Goomer. Replying to a question he said the single fencing either gets broken or buried in strong dust storms. CPWD Firozpur wing had given a presentation on double fencing and soon they will send an estimate which will be sent to the Centre through BSF headquarters for approval. CAZRI has also made special plans to make these shifting dunes permanent and CAZRI along with BSF as a pilot project will plant desert species plants in one km by one km area. This will start in the next 2 to 3 months. He said that to strengthen security arrangements on the Rajasthan border, help of CCTV cameras and other technical gadgets is taken. Goomer also said that the problem of drinking water is being addressed in many bops in Jaisalmer. At present, in 48 bops, the project of supply of drinking water is in its final stage and it will start in the next 2-3 months. To provide water to the remaining bops, a proposal has been sent for approval to the high level committee. Replying to another question, Goomer said that Jaisalmer is a tourist hub and to boost border tourism, a plan has been made especially in Sam area. The tourists can see the model of fencing and bops and through these, they will get to know how the BSF jawans guard the border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/plans-afoot-to-upgrade-single-fencing-to-double-at-shahgarh-bulj-area/articleshow/85472135.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Arcelor Mittal seeks land for expansion at Hazira||GANDHINAGAR: Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Ltd (AMNSI), which has proposed a fresh investment of Rs 70,000 crore in the state, has sought a major land parcel at Hazira on the outskirts of Surat — close to its existing plant. At a high-level meeting, top representatives of AMNSI sought the state’s support in resolving land requirement issues which have been unresolved for long. The company in its formal proposal to the state government informed that, “The firm aims to increase its existing steel production capacity from 8.6 million metric tonnes per annum to 18 MMTPA and which will have approximate Rs 70,000 crore investment and may generate 1 lakh jobs.” The firm also claimed that it will also reduce carbon emission using new technologies. According to available official details, the company has demanded a ‘gauchar’ (pastoral land) parcel in Hazira of over 2,000 acres in the vicinity of their existing plant. The company requires this land for its expansion activities and also for solar power generation. The company has demanded 2,000 acres of land for solar power generation and 250 acres for various other purposes. The company also sought government support for getting land belonging to shrimp farmers and a land parcel belonging to Reliance group. The government has asked the firm to directly negotiate with Reliance and other private parties for the land. The company has also reportedly requested the state for financial and other incentives under the old policy of 2016 instead of the new industrial policy of 2020. The government recently had a detailed meeting with the top officials of the industry, revenue department, forest & environment department and directed to resolve pending issues of AMNSI. A high level committee also started reviewing the progress and pending issues of other large projects of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/arcelormittal-seeks-land-for-expansion-at-hazira/articleshow/85469749.cms||Kapil Dave

Two months ago, the bank had registered an FIR sagainst KSBL — which was India’s top broking firms till 2019 — accusing it of defaulting on a loan of Rs 137 crore by pledging its clients’ securities. Parthasarathy was arrested on charges of cheating, fraud and criminal breach of trust under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. The Karvy Group boss was later produced before the Nampally criminal court, which remanded him to 14 days judicial custody. Police officials said that apart from probing the KSBL loan default to banks, they are also probing the Parthasarathy’s alleged misuse of clients’ funds to the tune of Rs 720 crore parked in KSBL’s trading accounts. The investigating team of Hyderabad police relied upon details in Sebi’s 2019 orders banning KSBL from broking activities based on a preliminary investigation by National Stock Exchange. Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar told mediapersons that Parthasarathy was arrested under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to person whose interest offender is bound to protect), 421 (dishonest or fraudulent removal or concealment of property to prevent distribution among creditors), 422 (dishonestly or fraudulently preventing debt being available for creditors), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 120b (conspiracy) of IPC. Avinash Mohanty, joint commissioner of police (detective department), Hyderabad police, said the case was registered on the basis of IndusInd Bank’s complaint alleging that KSBL availed credit facilities of Rs 137 crore by pledging shares, along with a personal guarantee from Parthasarathy, by suppressing the fact that the pledged securities belong to KSBL clients. “Without their (clients) consent he misused the power of attorney (given by clients to KSBL for trading purposes),” Mohanty said. KSBL,which allegedly transferred the securities of its clients into its own demat accounts and pledged them to banks like IndusInd, is also accused of defaulting on loans worth Rs 680 crore that it took from various other banks. KSBL was one of the largest broking firms in India with over 2.5 lakh clients before the scam came to light. “The accused company became defaulter by diverting the funds into the accounts of its own or connected businesses entities. In November 2019, Sebi revoked the securities pledged with banks and NBFCs and returned the securities to client accounts. The complainant banks were left with no collateral and thereby KSBL defaulted in repayments of about Rs 137 crore to IndusInd,” police said. Following his arrest, Parthasarathy moved a bail petition in the Nampally criminal court, which is yet to decide on the date of hearing the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/karvy-group-chairman-held-for-rs-137cr-loan-default/articleshow/85473589.cms||Srinath Vudali

The court said it was true that while the right to travel abroad was valuable and an integral part of the right to personal liberty, it was not an absolute right. The court noted that in some matters pending against Parekh, proclamations were required to be issued, and only then did he appear before it. The court said that according to him, apart from 18 criminal cases in this court, 27 cases were also pending against him across the country. Considering the huge number of cases and past record, the possibility of him absconding cannot be ruled out, it said. The court pointed out that in each case, the offence was punishable with imprisonment of upto 10 years or with fine or with both. It said that Parekh had not furnished his itinerary too.

A devotee of Asaram had moved this bail application claiming to have obtained the documents in question through Right To Information. On the basis of this investigation, Ratanada police arrested Asaram on production warrant from jail on Thursday and produced him in the court, which sent him to judicial custody.According to police, an employee of Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) from Delhi, Raviroy Marwah, had moved a bail plea in the Supreme Court in 2016 for Asaram.“With this bail application, Marwah had submitted some documents pertaining to Asaram’s health. He had claimed in the court that he had obtained these documents from Jodhpur Central Jail administration under RTI Act,” said the police.The court, however, had sought an affidavit from the jail administration regarding those documents, which the jail administration had termed fabricated. On this information, the apex court had written to the Jodhpur police to file a case in the matter apprising the police about the fabricated documents. Pursuant to this, a case of cheating had been filed at Ratanada police in 2016 against Marwah and Asaram.Marwah was, however, arrested by the police in 2018 and sent to judicial custody, but the investigation to ascertain the role of Asaram dragged on.“On completion of our investigation, we arrested Asaram on Thursday in relation to the case of forged documents and produced him in the court.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Prithvi Information Solutions Limited MD arrested for money laundering in Rs 3,300- crore loan fraud||HYDERABAD: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested Vuppalapati Satish Kumar, the managing director of city-based company Prithvi Information Solutions Limited (PISL), under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) for causing a loss of Rs 3,316 crore to a consortium of public sector banks. The agency had earlier arrested Hima Bindu B, MD of VMC Systems Limited, in the same case. The ED had initiated a money-laundering probe based on an FIR filed by CBI against VMC Systems Limited (VMCSL), which had taken loans from a consortium of banks. The present outstanding to all banks is Rs 3,316 crore. Forensic audit revealed that VMCSL circulated loans to various related entities to inflate its books of accounts. The audit further revealed that VMCSL had opened various letters of credit worth Rs 692 crore in the name of dummy entities, which were subsequently devolved. V Satish Kumar — through his company PISL and Ennar Energy and with the active assistance of his sister Hima Bindu — created exaggerated operational revenues by generating fake sales invoices through companies controlled by family members. This was done to dodge the banks. “Satish and Hima Bindu siphoned off a part of proceeds of crime by remitting it to overseas entities controlled by their family members,” the ED said. Though Satish Kumar claimed he had no link with the loan of VMCSL, more than 40 hard disks of VMCSL were recovered from his residence during the search carried out by ED on July 20. On forensic examination of the digital devices, it was found that he had indulged in benami transactions and involved in efforts to transfer fraud amounts to off-shore entities. “Satish was non-cooperative during the investigation and was not supplying documents of his own business entities on one pretext or the other,” ED said. He was arrested and produced before the PMLA special court. Later, ED was granted 10-day custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-co-md-arrested-for-money-laundering-in-rs-3300-cr-loan-fraud/articleshow/85473590.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The party charged the ruling DMK with “pursuing vendetta politics and showing undue interest in Kodanad estate cases.” Questioning the way tender rules are being flouted by the government, the memorandum also said that “ultra-constitutional powers”, comprising chief minister M K Stalin’s family members, were controlling the government. “When the Kodanad case is in court, how can CM Stalin say conducting reinvestigation is part of his party’s poll promise?” asked Palaniswami. “All the witnesses in the Kodanad case have been examined and only the final hearing is pending in court. But the DMK is showing undue interest in protecting the accused and maligning the AIADMK,” Palaniswami said. He was speaking to reporters after the party delegation met governor Purohit. Former AIADMK ministers S P Velumani, P Thangamani, C Ve Shanmugham and D Jayakumar, besides AIADMK deputy coordinators K P Munusamy and R Vaithilingam were part of the delegation. The AIADMK delegation’s visit comes against the backdrop of a series of searches carried out by the DVAC on the premises of former ministers S P Velumani and M R Vijayabhaskar and renewed focus on investigation into the Kodanad heist and death cases. Questioning the motive of the DMK government, the AIADMK members had announced boycott of assembly proceedings for two days from Wednesday. Palaniswami charged that cases were being foisted on former AIADMK ministers. He said the DMK government had sought to divert attention of the people after its white paper failed to cut much ice. “DMK had promised to abolish NEET soon after coming to power. While the parents of students are waiting anxiously, the DMK government has constituted a committee to decide further course of action on NEET,” Palaniswami said. EPS alleged that the DMK government was under-reporting Covid numbers but going overboard on the Kodanad case. “Instead of focusing on containing the Covid pandemic, when the state is still reporting cases above 1,800 per day and with the threat of a third wave, the DMK government is focusing its attention on vendetta politics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-meets-guv-with-plaint-on-dmks-corruption-collection/articleshow/85469806.cms||---

Maharashtra Housing Federation vice-chairman Suhas Patwardhan on Wednesday said those societies had been waiting for long to conduct the elections that could not be held because of the pandemic. Of these 30,000 housing societies, 4,000-5,000 are from Pune. “Redevelopment cannot be proposed unless these housing societies elect their respective managements. Redevelopment is of two types — either by appointment of a builder by a society or the society going in for selfredevelopment by appointing an architect or contractor. In the second case, the society can gain an additional floor space index (FSI) and get single window clearance and concessions in Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), bank interest and stamp duty. But for all this, the elections have to be conducted,” he said. The elections in the housing societies were supposed to be held in April. But the state postponed the elections after August 31 due to the rise in the number of Covid cases. Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association chairman Ramesh Prabhu said the housing societies were awaiting government orders about elections to take forward the redevelopment proposals. “The Unified Development Control and Promotion regulations applicable to Maharashtra provide a lot of incentives, such as FSI and TDR concessions, to encourage redevelopment of the buildings that are over 30 years old,” he said. “These societies were constructed with one FSI about 30 years ago. With the new development control and promotion regulations in place, these societies can construct the new building with 2.5 or even 3 FSI across the state, depending on the road width,” Prabhu said. “This being a policy decision, the societies are waiting to elect a new committee which is held up since 2018 first due to the amendment to the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, and then the pandemic. We hope that the elections will be held next month,” he said. A member from a housing society in the southern part of Pune told TOI that their existing committee had resigned almost 18 months ago and no decision could be taken on the redevelopment since then. “We have a preliminary meeting to plan for redevelopment. But unless the new committee members are elected, we cannot go ahead,” he said. Consumer activist Shrikant Joshi said the government should not further delay the elections. “There are several other pending works, besides redevelopment, that have to be taken forward. Redevelopment is an important decision and it cannot be held up because the government is not allowing the (housing society) elections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/30k-co-op-housing-societies-await-elections-to-plan-redevelopment/articleshow/85469829.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The registration department is getting ready by ensuring that maximum developers are enrolled in the initiative. Hardikar told TOI that an app was being readied for the pilot project. “Over 100 developers have already carried out the e-registration process of over 346 projects across the state. The e-registration process will enable sale and purchase of housing projects, wherein the buyers and sellers will no longer have to visit the registration offices. We will first roll out the pilot project in the third week of September. After this, we will enable all the developers registered under Maha-RERA to carry out the process from their offices,” he said. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat had told TOI in June that the e-registration process was a part of the initiatives planned to streamline the work, especially during the pandemic. A registration department official said, “Now with this being mandatory from October 1, the registration department is ensuring that the software is being prepared by the middle of next month,” the official said. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) chairman Satish Magar, who was among the first realtors to register his projects in Nanded City with the earlier software, said, “Maharashtra is among the frontrunners to start such concepts.” State Credai president Sunil Furde said the developers’ body has been favouring a software that would ease the registration process and ensure transparency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/e-registration-pilot-project-launch-likely-next-month/articleshow/85469889.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A group of 25 architects and engineers will be hired on a contract basis for this. While the demand for regularizing Gunthewari properties is quite old, the latest amendment to Maharashtra Gunthewari Developments (Regulation, up-gradation and Control) Act, 2001 has rekindled hopes of owners of such properties. In a public notification issued on Thursday, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) said the architects and engineers to be appointed will be responsible for preparing necessary proposals for regularising the properties in question. “The architects and engineers will ready maps of Gunthwari properties and will collect necessary documents from owners in order to prepare complete proposals,” AMC has said, adding that the last date for sending applications by architects and engineers will be August 27. The resource persons to get hired will receive honorarium equal to 10% of total fees charged by AMC towards regularising properties measuring upto 150 square-meter and upto 7% for properties having area more than that. The honorarium per proposal will be capped at Rs 50,000, it was said. As per official estimates, municipal limits of Aurangabad have around 118 Gunthewari areas spread over considerable portion of the city housing around four lakh citizens. The gunthewari status of properties puts limitations on real estate transactions, besides denying loan facilities to property holders from a section of banks. While the state government had passed amendment in aforesaid Gunthewari Act in March this year, almost a year after formal announcement, outbreak of Covid-19 has been blamed by government authorities for delay in initiating necessary formalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-civic-body-initiates-steps-to-regularise-gunthewari-properties/articleshow/85464859.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Hyderabad||Karvy demat scam: Here’s how the scam played out||Less than two years after the Karvy demat scam came to light, Karvy Group chairman C Parthasarathy was finally arrested in Hyderabad on Thursday on charges of defaulting on a bank loan. Swati Bharadwaj & Partha Sinha break down the details for youWhat was the Karvy demat scam? Hyderabad-based Karvy Group flagship Karvy Stock Broking (KSBL) pledged securities lying in the demat accounts of its clients, without their permission, to raise funds from multiple banks and financial institutions. These funds were then diverted into other Karvy group companies like Karvy Realty. What was the magnitude of the scam? Initial estimates showed that KSBL pledged securities of over 95,000 clients illegally and raised over Rs 2,300 crore via loans against shares (LAS) from multiple lenders like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance. How was the scam done? The broking firm transferred shares from the demat accounts of its clients, which were not active, into its demat account named Karvy Stock Broking (BSE) and showed these stocks as its own securities to lenders as collateral for taking loans. How and when was it unearthed? On June 20, 2019, markets regulator Sebi came out with a circular on handling client securities which said that brokers could not pledge client securities to raise loans for themselves, which till then was an established market practice. Sebi had set a deadline of September 30, 2019, for brokers to segregate client funds and securities but when KSBL failed to do so by the given deadline, investors complained to Sebi, which then asked NSE to investigate the matter What was the action taken by regulatory agencies? On November 22, 2019, Sebi issued an order banning KSBL from broking services and said the firm had transferred Rs 1096 crore to group company Karvy Realty between April 2016 to October 2019. Sebi also asked NSE to conduct a detailed forensic audit while working closely with depository participants (DPs) and stock exchanges to quickly transfer some of the illegally transferred securities back into the accounts of investors. In January 2020, the Union corporate affairs ministry also ordered the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Hyderabad, to probe Karvy group financial fraud. What about investor compensation? In December 2019, soon after the scam came to light, Sebi worked with DPs and stock exchanges to transfer securities of nearly 83,000 out of the over 95,000 scam-hit KSBL clients from Karvy’s demat account back into their respective accounts. In November 2020, NSE said it had settled claims worth Rs 2,300 crore to around 2.4 lakh KSBL investors with fund balances of up to Rs 30,000. In early 2021, under directions from Sebi, KSBL’s demat accounts were auctioned off to IIFL Securities and its trading accounts were auctioned to Axis Securities as part of efforts to compensate investors.

---||Meerut||‘I was to get married, worried about my fiancee’: Af students in India agonise over kin left behind||Meerut: The distance between Toryalay Bajawari and Zulaekha, the woman he intends to marry, was rendered greater still on August 9, when Afghanistan’s key northern city of Kunduz fell to the Taliban. Bajawari, 28, has been studying in India. Zulaekha, a graduate, is trapped in Kunduz. “I got engaged to her just before I came to India to study, in 2019,” said Bajawari, a student at Meerut’s Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University. “I was going to go home, marry her and bring her back here.” He does not know when, and if, that is going to happen. “I am constantly praying for her safety. For my family’s safety. She is stuck at home and cannot step out. Everything we had dreamed of now seems distant.” For Afghan students at the university, who had left behind their homes in hopes of building new lives, the past few weeks have been excruciating. Khairuddin Sahibzada, 34, was told by his family that he shouldn’t try to come home. He had joined the university’s postgraduate programme in 2019 with a scholarship from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. “My mother told me the future is uncertain, stay back in India,” said Sahibzada, whose family is in Samangan province, whose capital Aybak was seized by the Taliban on August 9. And Ali Sina, 35, left Afghanistan a day before Kabul fell to the Taliban — taking the last flight out. “It was a miracle,” he said. The PhD scholar from Takhar province left with his wife and 3-year-old son to join the university’s agricultural biotechnology department. “It was moments before Afghanistan shut down. But my old parents are still back there and I pray for them.” It was in Takhar, a foreign news agency said, that a woman who stepped out without a burqa was shot dead on Tuesday. Mobile phones are working, the students said, so they can still talk to their families. “But everything we hear is frightening. They (Taliban forces) enter homes and snatch weapons and vehicles. They beat up those who resist. My family had to give our car away,” said Najibullah Azizi, 36, a student of animal husbandry at the university. He is from Balkh province, whose capital Mazar-i-Sharif was the last major city in northern Afghanistan to be taken over by the Taliban last week. While the Taliban in its press conference said that “there will be no violence against women” and “no prejudice against women will be allowed”, the Afghan students did not buy it. “What they say may not be what they do. That is what we fear,” said Ittihad Zaman, 31, from Jalalabad, where 3 died after anti-Taliban protests on Wednesday. “The history is too scary.” Barring Sina, who wants to join a UN-based assignment after his PhD, the students don’t know what they will do once their studies in India are over. “We will have to return when the scholarship runs out,” said Sahibzada. So, the university is trying to help them. Dr BR Singh, registrar of the university, said, “The ministry of external affairs and ICAR are in touch with us. Their scholarship might be extended. But we are yet to confirm.” Bajawari might have to wait longer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/i-was-to-get-married-worried-about-my-fiancee-af-students-in-india-agonise-over-kin-left-behind/articleshow/85467527.cms||Sandeep Rai

As many as 14 organs including kidney, heart valves and cornea were harvested from the bodies of a 40-year-old man, and a 48-year-old woman, who were brought to Apollo Hospital on August 16. The condition of both patients was critical when they were brought to the hospital, and on closer examination, it was found that they showed signs of brain stem infarction , and were shifted to the intensive care unit where they were put on life-support system, said Mysuru Apollo Hospital vice-president NG Bharatheesha Reddy. The 40-year-old man had met with a road accident, while the woman had suffered brain haemorrhage. After the patients’ relatives agreed to donate their organs, they were harvested in accordance with established protocol. Of the 14 organs harvested from the two people, two livers and as many kidneys were transplanted to patients at Apollo Hospital, while the remaining organs were dispatched to other hospitals.

Parthasarathy, who is one of the five founders of Karvy Group, has weathered many a scam including the infamous Roopal Panchal IPO (initial public offering) scam where markets regulator Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) found irregularities in 21 IPOs between 2003 and 2005. In 2006, Karvy group was one of the entities named in the scam where accounts were opened in fictitious names with several depository participants including Karvy DP. Parthasarathy & KSBL’s names also cropped up in the Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd case when Karvy group filed a police complaint against the promoters of DCHL and levelled allegations of forgery and misrepresentation against them. The complaint was filed after DCHL promoters pledged more stake that they held in the company with multiple financial institutions like Religare Finvest and Future Capital to raise funds. But with the KSBL demat scam case, Parthasarathy’s luck seems to be running out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/c-parthasarathy-no-stranger-to-controversy/articleshow/85471909.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Beginning of end for Karvy Stock Broking started in 2018||HYDERABAD: The Karvy demat scam may have come to light only on November 22, 2019, after markets regulator Sebi issued orders banning Karvy Stock Broking (KSBL) from taking new clients, but the beginning of the end for the firm began much before that. After numerous investor complaints about brokers not transferring shares and money to designated demat and bank accounts, Sebi began changing the rules and ordering new reports from stakeholders in the market, making it increasingly difficult for brokers to use clients’ stocks and securities for their own use. In December 2018, Sebi started standardisation of books and records maintained by brokers to make it easier to inspect and compare data and in January 2019, it directed brokers to report day-wise stock and fund balance, segregated according to their clients, at end of every week. Then, between March and April, Sebi also started matching records of ownership of stocks with the exchanges, with the brokers and that with the two depositories NSDL and CSDL and also started tallying details of pledged shares with depository records and what the brokers disclosed. Then in a June 20 order, it stopped all brokers from raising funds by pledging clients’ shares and also ordered segregation and reporting of clients’ stocks and funds from those owned by the broker. This move exposed brokers like KSBL who were using clients’ stocks for their own use. In September 2019, Sebi also ordered that shares could be pledged only after confirmation by clearing members or clearing corporations. Apart from pledging clients’ shares to raise funds, Karvy Group had also mortgaged its new corporate office in Hyderabad’s IT hub and its registered office in Banjara Hills to raise funds. It also mortgaged 10 immovable properties belonging to Karvy group CMD C Parthasarathy in Telangana and Karnataka to ICICI Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/beginning-of-end-for-ksbl-began-in-2018/articleshow/85471707.cms||Partha Sinha

According to the details, Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) primary education committee had given appointments on probation to 572 class four employees that it on March 3, 1992. However, the probation seems to have lasted forever and the employees are yet to be confirmed, while the issue has been a long drawn battle in the Gujarat high court as well as the labour court. The labour court ruled in the favour of the employees in 2019. As per procedures, the primary education committee prepared a proposal in this regard and passed it in its board which was then sent ahead to the VMC for its approval. The proposal was put before the general board of the civic body in June 2020. But, by the time the general board took up the matter for discussion on December 7, 2020, rumours were rife that a large sum of money had been collected from these employees to ensure that theirs jobs were confirmed. Recently, the issue was raised again when members of the union of these class four employees went to meet mayor Keyur Rokadiya. The mayor, however, categorically told the union members that no discussion can take place till the money was not refunded. “They (union) had collected Rs 29 lakh, of which Rs 16 lakh has already been refunded,” Rokadiya said. President of the class four employees’ union, Nilesh Raj claimed that the union had collected the money for fees to contest the case in court. “We had collected around Rs 17-20 lakh. But the amount has been refunded due to the suspicion. The money was used for our cases,” Raj explained. Rokadia further stated that the amount collected was much higher than the legal fees that should have been paid. “The information had come to the notice when the proposal was floated,” he added. Interestingly, by the time the proposal was floated, 272 employees had already retired, 66 had died leaving only 234 persons in service. Raj confirmed that at present only around 200 persons remain in service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/money-collected-for-class-iv-jobs-refunded/articleshow/85466121.cms||---

Interacting with the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) members, he said certain private airlines in Iran are keen to service this route and are awaiting a nod from the Indian authorities. On the upcoming Chabahar port in Iran, he said though the work on the project has been delayed by both sides, the last part of the rail connectivity from Chabahar port to Zahedan is expected to be completed by early next year. He pointed out that the construction of this port assumes significance as it will allow easy access to markets in Europe and Central Asia in less time. He also added that the port will offer a large free trade area benefitting the business community. The Iranian envoy also rooted for preferential trade agreement between India and Iran and said both the countries have the potential to clock bilateral trade of $10 billion in the near-term. Indian exports to Iran between 2011-12 and 2019-20 have grown by 46% and bilateral trade during 2019-20 was at $4.77 billion.  While India’s major exports to Iran include rice, tea, sugar, soya, medicines, pharmaceuticals, man-made staple fibres and electricals, the major imports from Iran include inorganic and organic chemicals, fertilizers, cement clinkers, dry fruits and nuts and leather, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iran-envoy-roots-for-directflight-services-to-hyderabad/articleshow/85471559.cms||---

Sawant was addressing the gathering after inaugurating Deendayal co-operative supermarket at Bordem in Bicholim on Thursday. He said some individuals have squandered the money of the poor by looting the co-operative institutions and some are entering into the sector with similar intentions. “Those who loot the small investors walk around as decent people. Crores of rupees were swallowed by some individuals on the pretext of paying double interest in one or two years. That is why from now on the government is keeping a close eye on every institution,” said Sawant. He said arrangements have been made to ensure that no institution will go bankrupt in the future and the money of the people will not be lost if it goes bankrupt. Mapusa Urban and Madgaon Urban co-operatives banks went into losses as people who were managing had no planning and no sense of responsibility. They were pretending to be Sahakar maharishi (co-operative leaders), the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-will-keep-watch-on-financial-institutions-cm/articleshow/85472308.cms||---

Accompanied by BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, Aurangabad MP Sushil Kumar Singh, Singh boarded the ‘ashirwad rath’ parked airport campus to start the yatra. At a meeting held with intellectuals at a technical education institution, the minister,while enumerating the achievements of the government said, “Against the demand of 6000 MW power in Bihar, 5900MW is supplied by the Centre. Work is underway on more power grid projects to fulfil the expected increase in demand.” He added, “After becoming energy minister, the task of electrification was completed in 987 villages and the tolas. Altogether 2.82 crore households, including 32 lakh in Bihar, were provided electric connection. Under the Deen Dayal Gram Jyoti scheme Rs 2,02,000 crore have been sanctioned to the states. This includes 22,000 crore to Bihar.” The minister also said that solar plants will be set up for farmers where feeder is not accessible under the Kusum scheme. “Farmers will be required to bear only 20% of total cost. While other states have started to work on this project, it is yet to commence in Bihar. I have requested chief minister Nitish Kumar also to start work for implementing the scheme.” Later, at a press meet, the minister lashed out at RJD for demanding caste-based census. “RJD chief Lalu Prasad came to power by doing caste politics.

---||Hyderabad||Karvy demat scam: IndusInd bank thought they had securities even as legal notices were ignored||Repeated requests, follow-ups and legal notices slapped on Karvy Stock Broking Ltd (KSBL) did not help IndusInd Bank since 2019 in ensuring repayment of Rs 137 crore loan taken from them. “The bank tried its best to get clarity on the repayment schedule or the status of repayment. Despite repeated oral remainders and calls to C Parthasarathy, no reply was forthcoming as to when the repayment will be made,” IndusInd Bank told police at the time of lodging the complaint. “On some occasions they assured the bank that they will pay on time and even at this stage they confirmed that security was available to cover the bank’s exposure,” the bank said. Later, the bank served demand notices to KSBL and Parthasarathy saying that they repay the dues in five days. At this stage, the bank was under the impression that they are secured since they have sufficient collateral in the form of pledged securities to recover the outstanding dues. But IndusInd bank got a rude shock after SEBI in November 2019 took action against KSBL, and IndusInd bank knew they had no collateral left as a surety. Finally, IndusInd bank approached the Hyderabad police detective department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indusind-bank-thought-they-had-securities-even-as-legal-notices-were-ignored/articleshow/85471749.cms||Srinath Vudali

Similarly, police also obtained the forensic audit report done by Ernst and Young (EY) against KSBL. “As per the EY report and its summary, after Parthasarathy was informed by NSE that EY would visit KSBL's premises to access the systems of key employees, they were noted to have deleted various files and emails from their respective systems,” Hyderabad police told Nampally court quoting the FY report. The Ey report further says: “The employees, including Parthasarathy used anti-forensic tools to wipe off data. When asked about the usage of such a tool, he denied using such a tool.''  Parthasarathy maintained in his bail petition that non-repayment of loan was not an offence. He also told cops that he was trying to make the repayment of loan to all the concerned banks. Police said that Parthasarathy was primarily authorised by the board of directors of KSBL to handle the issues of loan from 2013 and had necessary permission to take loan against securities and signed each document and executed personal guarantee for the loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/karvy-bank-loan-scam-1300-city-clients-complained-to-nse/articleshow/85471784.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Hyderabad||TRS government must bring legislation to legalise ‘Dalit Bandhu’: BJP||HYDERABAD: The BJP on Thursday demanded that the TRS government pass legislation to legalise the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ scheme. Addressing the media, state vice president NVSS Prabhakar said that the TRS government should immediately hold assembly and council sessions to review in detail the mechanisms and guidelines of the scheme. Demanding that the scheme be implemented throughout the state, he said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should prove his commitment to the initiative by making this scheme for Dalits legally binding. “It is now up to him to convince people particularly while the state’s finances are in disarray that he is committed for the welfare of marginalised sections by implementing the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ scheme,” he said. He, however, asked KCR to also explain why the state has not executed its earlier plan to give three acres to each Dalit family. Prabhakar said that it was not the pandemic but the policy failure of TRS government which has affected the state finances. “The state government has been unable to implement many other schemes and is also not paying government employees salaries in time,” he alleged. Demanding that the scheme be implemented throughout the state, he said CM should prove his commitment to the initiative by making this scheme legally binding||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-govt-must-bring-legislation-to-legalise-dalit-bandhu-bjp/articleshow/85471465.cms||---

About eight years ago, civic authorities approved a proposal for a model park on the land, with demarcated space for joggers and a children’s gaming zone. However, no work has been started here so far, despite several representations. “We have been waiting for authorities to take up the development of the park since the time the residential colony came into existence. The authorities have built a boundary wall and set up a gate, but no work has been done to clear the wild vegetation inside it and develop some basic amenities for the residents,” said Rajendra Prasad, secretary, Sanjeevani Hills welfare society. Residents also said that out of the eight pieces of lands that were approved for development of parks and beautification work, only one was developed. “This green space is now a wasteland full of wild vegetation, snakes and mosquitoes as the land is located right beside river Esa. We also submitted a representation to the GHMC commissioner and the zonal commissioner regarding this issue,” said Anand Rao, resident of Sanjeevani Hills colony. When contacted, the biodiversity wing official of GHMC, Prasanna Kumar said he will inquire into the issue and sought time till Saturday to dig out all details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/8-yrs-on-work-on-hyderguda-model-park-yet-to-commence/articleshow/85471499.cms||Moulika.KV

After inspection, the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety had given the clearance for trains to ply on the route.CM Uddhav Thackeray, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari (road transport and highways) and Hardeep Singh Puri (housing and urban affairs) will inaugurate the Metro extension through video link at 12.30pm. Also, the stations at Kasturchand Park and Zero Mile as well as the Freedom Park will be put to use.The Zero Mile station is a unique structure of the Nagpur Metro project with the trains passing through the fourth floor of a 20-sotrey building. According to Metro, this is first-of-its-kind in the country.The building has two basement levels for parking. Above the fourth floor will be the area for commercial development. An innovative step by way of deploying ‘floating track slab technology’ will help in mitigation of noise and vibration caused by the Metro, states a release.The Kasturchand Park station is constructed on the lines of traditional Rajput architecture. A ‘chhatri’, ‘torana’, ‘jaali’, motifs on columns and brackets have been incorporated to ensure the station complements the heritage monument in the park.The Freedom Park at Zero Mile is to commemorate the 75th year of country’s Independence. About 40,000 square feet area has been converted into a public park. “The aesthetically done park comprises urban public plazas connecting the heritage precincts and event spaces with a careful streetscape, markers like the History Wall, War Trophy – T55 Battle Tank, totem poles and plaza entrance areas,” states the release.State cabinet ministers Nitin Raut (energy), Eknath Shinde (urban development) and Sunil Kedar (animal husbandry) will be present at the function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cm-gadkari-puri-to-flag-off-new-metro-stretch-freedom-park-today/articleshow/85467400.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Not many takers among Mumbai kids for Covid vaccine trial||MUMBAI: Enrolling children and adolescents in a clinical trial for Covid-19 vaccine has proved to be much more challenging for institutes than recruiting adults. The BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central has been able to recruit only 11 adolescents for the Zydus Cadila trial for children between 12 and 17 years. The hospital initially planned to recruit 50 participants, 25 each for vaccine and placebo arms. “We are unlikely to reach that number,” said one of the investigators. “Since the trial is carried out at more than 40 sites, we are hoping there will be enough participants,” the expert added. According to sources, nationally over 800 have enrolled. While one would think parents are not keen to have their children participate out of safety concerns, there appears to be another big reason—few want to participate in a double blind study in which no one knows if they are receiving a vaccine or a placebo. The double blind study is to prevent bias in research results. “People call us thinking their child would get the vaccine. But when we tell them about the placebo arm which doesn’t get the vaccine, most back out,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Nair Hospital. Despite multiple advertisements, the institute has received barely 30 calls from which they recruited 11. ZyCov-D is a three-dose indigenous DNA vaccine being developed by Zydus with support from the central department of biotechnology. Dr Bharmal said the trial started in July and some children have got the second dose too. There are plans now to extend the trial to younger children of 5-12 years, which is likely to be equally challenging, he said. Three vaccine trials are in the pipeline for children and adolescents, of which ZyCov-D and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, being trialled on children between 2 and 18 years, are closest to getting an approval. KEM and Nair hospitals will also be participating in another trial for minors aged 12-17 for Covovax. The nanoparticle protein-based vaccine developed by US firm Novavax will be tested for safety and efficacy. KEM and Nair hospitals, which will be participating in the Covovax trial, said they are awaiting ethics committee approvals. A vaccine for children is expected to come by September. Interestingly, investigators had a different experience while recruiting children for Covaxin. The Nagpur-based institute, Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences, could recruit 150 children against its quota of 60 in June. Dr Vasant Khalatkar said they had to do a draw as hundreds wanted to participate. His youngest participant is a two-year-old. Since Covaxin was already given to adults, that could have given confidence to parents. “But, children also wanted to become Covid warriors and were not scared to take the shot,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-many-takers-among-mum-kids-for-covid-vax-trial/articleshow/85469950.cms||Sumitra Debroy

They said the internet connection is slow while using 2G SIM cards given by the government to scan QR code on smart cards, leading to delay in transactions. A salesman in Salem taluk told TOI that QR code scanner machines in all ration shops are connected to internet using 2G SIM cards. “It takes a lot of time to scan codes,” he said, adding that officials who know about the issue are not taking any action. The slow internet connection also delays fingerprint verification of one of the beneficiaries listed in the card, the salesman added. Due to this, queues grow longer in front of the shop and often leading to quarrels between customers and salesmen. Salesmen said they also have to spend from their pockets to recharge 2G SIM cards given by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/ration-shop-salesmen-demand-4g-connection/articleshow/85469954.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to the PHC records, Nnagfase’s second dose was given on August 17.In a video, Nnagfase has claimed that last week he received a call from the PHC arogya sevika (health worker) asking him to get vaccinated. In the video, he also gave the same dates of his vaccination thrice.He claimed that the PHC health worker didn’t inform him that it was Covid vaccination nor any query was made about his vaccination status when he reported to the PHC on August 17. It was only after giving him the jab, he was informed that both Covishield doses have been completed, Nnagfase claimed.DHO Dr Nitin Kapse said that the inquiry was completed by Thursday evening. “It was found that he got confused regarding his second dose. He wasn’t sure if he had got the second dose or not. He may have received an SMS on July 27 but we have no record showing he was jabbed that day. As per the PHC records, he was jabbed on April 15 and August 17. He confirmed to our team that he received only two doses when they went to his home on Thursday,” said Dr Kapse.Dr Kapse added that it may have been due to a technical error Nnagfase received the SMS.The video shot by health officials show Nnagfase a bit tense beside the officials who is prompting him to say that “he received only two doses”. In the earlier video, Nnagfase is seen quite relaxed and answering queries with a smile. Talks of Nnagfase having a tiff with PHC staff and he that was trying to settle a score too were doing the rounds.Local sources claimed that Nnagfase family is not educated and therefore he could point out that he had already been jabbed when the PHC staff called him. It was only after he informed a local body office bearar the matter came to light. Officials said that his health parameters were normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-claims-gondia-phc-gave-him-3rd-dose-of-covishield/articleshow/85467458.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

A division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice M Duraiswamy observed that once a representation is given in English, it is the duty of the Centre to send a reply only in English as the same would be in consonance with the provisions of the Official Languages Act. Observing that this is an era of communication and information, the judges said a few languages in the country are thousands of years old and many are 100 years old. The governments should take steps for preservation and development of all languages. Venkatesan had moved court after he received a Hindi reply from the ministry of state for home affairs to a representation he sent seeking to set up exam centres for the CRPF paramedical recruitment drive in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry last year. The Centre submitted that the reply was in Hindi inadvertently. The Centre further submitted that there would not be any violation to the Official Languages Act and the Official Language Rules in the future. Recording the submissions, the judges directed the Centre, its officials and other instrumentalities to strictly follow provisions of the Act and Rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hindi-reply-to-tn-mps-plea-follow-official-languages-act-hc-tells-centre/articleshow/85472301.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Acting on a complaint by FDA inspector Ajay Mahule (50), they arrested Kishore Khet, a Kamothe resident, and booked him under Section 420 of IPC along with Essential Commodities Act, 1955, and Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Senior inspector (crime branch-unit II) Giridhar Gore said, “We summoned Mahule to verify if the youth was actually selling the vaccine. We laid a trap by sending a decoy customer for buying two vials from Khet. The decoy was given a bundle of fake Rs60,000 notes, including four genuine Rs500 notes.” Gore said that at 3.45pm, the decoy met Khet under the bridge. Khet sold two vials and 15 syringes and accepted the cash from him. As the decoy signalled them, PSI Vaibhav Ronage detained Khet. Khet claimed he purchased the vials from a nurse. “He is not cooperating with the investigation, as he claimed he was unaware of her whereabouts. Hence, we have secured his custody,” Gore said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-youth-held-for-selling-covishield-vaccines/articleshow/85469982.cms||George Mendonca

Speaking with TOI, Vikas Tyagi, Dal's convenor of west UP, said, “During the time of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had spent their exile years in this place but it lost its historical significance to the Islamic seminary.” He said, “We do not write or print Deoband on our letterhead or any other document, including wedding invitations. We always describe Devvrand instead of Deoband. I have been attempting for the past 10 years to rename this town’s name as Devvrand and have submitted many memorandums to the local administration. During the 2017 election, we had made a promise to the people that its (Deoband) name will be changed.” This is not the first time that the demand to rename Deoband has been made. Soon after the BJP government came to power in UP in 2017, local MLA Brijesh Singh had raised the demand to change Deoband's name. When asked, a Deoband-based well-known cleric said, “Deoband is known because the world's most respected Islamic seminary is situated here, You can rename it whatever you want, it doesn't make difference.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rename-deoband-as-devvrand-says-bajrang-dal-deobandis-indifferent/articleshow/85467517.cms||Mohd Dilshad

He promised to relax the restrictions when the test positivity rate dips below 1% in the district. At present, the district has a test positivity rate of 2% . The collector said the Covid-19 caseload has been plateauing in the district. “Around 12,000 swab samples are collected for testing daily. The restrictions have yielded good results in reducing the caseload. We are now working on to reduce the test positivity rate to below 1% and bring in more relaxations.” He said there were plans to install 11 more liquid medical oxygen plants in the district, which already has 83 of them. “We have enough oxygen generators and can produce 21,000 litres a day,” he said. According to him, the district has 7,186 normal beds, 4,526 oxygen beds and 646 ICU beds. “We have set up 573 normal beds, 959 oxygen beds and 176 ICU beds exclusively for kids at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital and the ESI Hospital. We cannot predict the third wave. However, we are ready to face any challenges.” The district, meanwhile, topped the state in the number of fresh cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, when 198 people were tested positive for the virus. It also logged five Covid fatalities on the day, taking the toll to 2,232.

Accusing both the Centre and the state government for misleading the Maratha community in the matter of reservation, the outfit has warned of mass agitation to highlight the demand. “We will hold agitations in Delhi and Mumbai to press for our demand. While the central and the state governments have not been taking any concrete step to give reservation to the community, the affected youths are running out of patience,” said outfit leader Ramesh Kere-Patil. Raising anti-government slogans, Maratha Kranti Thok Morcha volunteers also tore the recent Government Resolutions (GRs) issued by the state government for the benefit of the Maratha community. While the protesters started to stage a sit-in agitation later, city police briefly detained them as a preventive action to ensure the law and order situation is kept intact. While the Maharashtra government had granted reservation to the Marathas in jobs and education under the SEBC category, a five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court, in May, had unanimously set aside such quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maratha-outfit-stages-protest-against-govt/articleshow/85464995.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Barely 50% of 45+ age-group covered by vaccines so far||MUMBAI: Even as the fear of a third wave looms over the state, barely 50% of its most vulnerable age group—those above 45 years—have got even one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Experts had stressed for 70% vaccination in this group by August since the 45-plus account for 85% of Covid mortalities in Maharashtra. As by per state figures, 1.92crore of the estimated population of 3.86 crore in this bracket have been vaccinated with at least one dose. In that, 98.93lakh (25.6%) have been fully vaccinated while 93.15lakh (24%) have got one dose. Vaccination for this group began in March. Besides low coverage, a persistent worry has been disparity between districts. Kolhapur is at the top having vaccinated 80.5% of its 45-plus segment with at least one dose, while Palghar brings up the rear having barely managed to vaccinate 31%. The second lowest is Hingoli (31.2%); at least 15 districts have vaccinated less than the state average. Mumbai has vaccinated 67% of its population above 45 years with at least one dose. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the shortage of vaccines has been the biggest hindrance in driving coverage across age groups. Palghar district officials said they have been experiencing an acute shortage for months now. In the last three months, they have written three letters to the government to increase their vaccine quota, an official said. In June and July, the district, which has an adult population of 23lakh, received less than 15,000 doses in both months. In August, they received two tranches of 20,000 doses each. “We finished the doses in a single day because there is a huge demand,” said Dr Dayanand Suryawanshi, district health officer of Palghar. He said, overall, 8.63lakh doses have been administered in the district but a significant number has been in the private sector. “Our wastage has been minimal too, but we are not getting adequate doses,” he added. Officials from several other districts told TOI that allocation of vaccines must be looked at as some are routinely handed fewer doses. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), however, said there was nothing wrong with the allocation formula. “Initially, the Centre’s supply was consumption driven, so districts which had more healthcare and frontline workers and those who vaccinated at a higher pace in January-March, got more doses. Subsequently, when second doses were due, same districts got supply commensurate to second doses due,” he said, adding that it will even out over a period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-barely-50-of-45-age-group-covered-by-vaccines-so-far/articleshow/85470006.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The division bench of the HC, comprising Justice Ravindra Ghuge and Justice Sanjay Mehare, also issued directives to Sharma to submit a compliance report within eight weeks. Sharma had taken charge of the Beed district on August 12. During the hearing on Wednesday, the HC gave Sharma the liberty to take the assistance of additional collector and Zilla Parishad CEO to carry out the investigation in accordance to its earlier directives. On January 21, the division bench comprising HC Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Ghuge, while hearing the PIL, had observed that the employment guarantee scheme “prohibits cash transactions and there have been payments to the beneficiaries of the scheme through cash transactions and also disbursement to dead persons”. The bench directed the Beed collector to investigate the matter as per the 12 points stated in the Supreme Court order in Centre for Environment and Food Security Vs Union of India. Following the latest hearing, petitioner’s lawyer Girish Thigale-Naik told TOI: “The HC has adjourned the matter for submission of progress report of the compliance of its order passed in January this year. The final report is expected to be submitted to the HC by the newly appointed collector within eight weeks. The HC has indicated that the application for recall filed by the earlier collector would be taken up for consideration next week.” He said former collector Ravindra Jagtap had moved an application for recalling of HC’s previous order initiating contempt proceedings as well as for his transfer. The HC has scheduled to hear it next week. The HC, on August 3, had directed the state chief secretary to transfer Beed collector Ravindra Jagtap and appoint another district collector with promptitude to enable an impartial probe in an alleged misappropriation and siphoning of funds meant for MGNREGA scheme. Acting on the directives, the state government appointed Hingoli ZP CEO Sharma as the Beed collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-collector-told-to-file-compliance-report-in-8-wks/articleshow/85465035.cms||Mohammed Akhef

But now, his life and career hang in balance, thanks to the swift turn of political events in his country. “Please don’t reveal my name, they might kill me,” was among the first things the youth told TOI over phone from, Herat, echoing the sense of dread and apprehension that have become all-pervading in his hometown. He said people were “in deep fear, which was worse than death”. “I reached home only 40 days ago. I came here at the wrong time. It would have been better had I stayed back in Kharagpur. I did not understand that the Taliban would seize power. The previous government had assured that nothing would happen. I was convinced and I returned home in July,” said the youngster, for whom returning to Kharagpur is important. “I have not yet received my degree certificate. Without it, I will not even get any job. I plan to travel to India via Iran. In Kabul, the Indian embassy is closed, so I have appealed to the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Kolkata, where I am registered. I am also writing to the Indian foreign office for visa,” he said. But he is torn between the choices he might have to make. Leaving Afghanistan right now would mean leaving his aged parents and sisters behind. “I will not be able to ferry them out of Afghanistan,” he said. The youngster pointed out the Taliban seemed to have evolved their strategies and were trying to be more polished than in their previous regime. “I have not heard any gunshot or missile attack near our home. So far, there has been no assault in Herat or I have not heard of any such incident,” he said. But still, people hardly stepped out of their homes. He said Afghans usually stocked up on food and ration for at least a month. “We go out to get milk and vegetables early in the morning after two or three days from local shops,” he said. “The past experience has scarred people.

---||Pune||Man who set self ablaze succumbs at hospital||Pune: Khadki resident Suresh Vitthal Pingle (42), who on Wednesday set himself ablaze on the premises of the city police commissioner’s office over alleged delay in granting a character verification certificate, succumbed to 75% burn injuries at a private hospital in Kasbapeth on Thursday. Late on Thursday evening, the police had to deploy additional manpower at the hospital to avoid any untoward fallout as Pingle’s relatives refused to take his body home. They alleged that the police deliberately delayed recording his statement on time. “He was speaking when he was first admitted to Sassoon general hospital, but the police did not record or videograph his statement. He was cursing two police constables from the Khadki police station for ruining his life,” a relative said. By 10.15 pm, senior police officers were speaking to family members to convince them to accept the body and let the investigation complete in the matter, the police said. In a letter addressed to city police chief Amitabh Gupta, Pingle’s wife Shyamal stated that when she first met her husband at the hospital, he held the two constables responsible for his woes claiming they neglected his verification plea. The police ought to have recorded his statement well in time but they reached hospital only during the wee hours of Thursday, she stated and demanded a thorough investigation in the matter. When contacted, Gupta told TOI, “An inquiry has been ordered into the allegations made by the family members. We will also investigate a note that was found in the bag that Pingle was carrying at the time of the incident. All the angles in the case will be investigated. We will register a case under the appropriate sections with the Bund Garden police station.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-who-set-self-ablaze-succumbs-at-hospital/articleshow/85470025.cms||---
---||Mumbai||How many have high BP, diabetes? BMC survey soon||MUMBAI: After the pandemic revealed that people with diabetes and hypertension are at high risk of severe Covid infection, the BMC will start next week its most scientific survey to find out how many Mumbaikars suffer from either of both of these two diseases. In collaboration with the World Health Organisation, the BMC will carry out the STEP survey that will also capture those at the risk of other non-communicable diseases such as cancer, heart disease or stroke. “We plan to interview 6,000 people between 18-69 years and collect their samples to work out the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in Mumbai,’’ said BMC deputy executive health officer Dr Daksha Shah. Already work on identifying 25 houses in each of the 238 census blocks in the city has begun. “One person from each of these 25 households will be chosen for the survey,’’ said Shah. The participant will have to answer an elaborate questionnaire focusing on behaviours --- physical activity levels, smoking, alcohol intake, among others, and also submit physical measurements and samples. While the prevalence of diabetes in India is assumed to be around 10-11%, hypertension affects almost a third of the adult population. “Most of such estimates are drawn on national-level studies, but city-specific data is often missing,’’ said a senior BMC doctor. The National Family Health Survey-5 by the International Institute of Population Sciences in Deonar showed more men than women suffered from these twin diseases, often called lifestyle epidemics. It also showed almost 20% of the 15-plus population in the city needed medicines to keep their sugar levels in check. The corresponding number for hypertension is closer to 30%. The BMC hopes to get ward-level or even pocket-wise estimates for these diseases. “We will collect an almost equal number of samples from slums and non-slum pockets to understand the prevalence,’’ said Shah. The BMC has previously held diabetes detection camps in neighbourhoods, but it hasn't got a city-wide picture of the disease. The WHO has devised STEP surveys scientifically to assess the true prevalence of lifestyle or non-communicable diseases in any geographic area. Covid has brought public health into focus and the need for local and central governments to invest in the field. Knowing the vulnerable populations before an emergency strikes would help devise strategies to contain diseases, be they communicable like Covid-19 or non-communicable such as cancer or diabetes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-how-many-have-high-bp-diabetes-bmc-survey-soon/articleshow/85470060.cms||---

The judges also granted liberty to the private respondents to submit fresh representation. On receipt of such representations, the authorities shall consider the same on merits and pass orders in accordance with law, said the judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-asks-pwd-to-remove-3-check-dams-in-channel/articleshow/85472344.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Jetsetgo plans to import 10 more aircraft using Nagpur route||NAGPUR: Jetsetgo Fleet Management Private Limited, funded by cricketer Yuvraj Singh and industrialist Puneet Dalmia of Dalmia Bharat Group, on Thursday became the first Indian aircraft leasing company to directly import a plane. The company plans to import 10 more planes in less than a year for leasing out aircraft in the Indian market. The Mihan-SEZ at Nagpur would be the gateway for bringing in the aircraft, like the one which was brought on Thursday. It was parked in the Air India MRO here. The company also plans to raise over $60 million of additional funds through private equity (PE) investment. The first plane — a Hawker XP 800 — was acquired from a company in Dubai and flown down to Nagpur from London. Jetsetgo will be leasing out the plane to its fully-owned subsidiary Indo-Pacific Aviation. Kanika Tekriwal, CEO of the company, said that there are plans to eventually lease out the other planes to non-related companies also. “Indo-Pacific has an existing fleet of nine aircraft and more will be imported by Jetsetgo,” she said. Tekriwal, who is the co-founder of Jetsetgo, said she had formed the company with an initial fund of just Rs5,400. Rest of the amount was arranged through PE funding. She said the six-seater Hawker XP acquired by Jetsetgo cost $3.2 million. There are plans to bring in planes of more capacity in the subsequent batches. “We would observe the business for the next 90 to 100 days after which more planes would be imported. The company has already identified the aircraft and blocked the deals,” said Tekriwal. In a bid to encourage Indian companies take up aircraft leasing, the entities registered in GIFT City IFSC in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, have been exempt from taxes. Earlier, the planes were imported through overseas subsidiaries like those in Ireland to get the tax benefit. Now, the same benefit is available through IFSC. “However, the ministry of commerce rules say aircraft need to land in a SEZ. Only two SEZs are linked with the airport — Mihan in Nagpur and GMR in Hyderabad,” said Dipesh Shah, head, development and international relationship of GIFT City IFSC. There are four other companies in the GIFT City IFSC which have got the permission to lease aircraft. “If the other companies import planes, Nagpur route may be used too,” said Shah. Shah said that the commercial airlines are expected to lease 1,000 aircraft in another 10 years, also leading to a business opportunity for Indian companies. Tekriwal said that office of the development commissioner at Mihan offered prompt help and the approval was granted in two days. The Air India MRO was granted approval to provide warehousing and parking services to the aircraft. “We had already lost one aircraft deal due to the delay but finally the Mihan plan worked out,” she said Nagpur district guardian minister Nitin Raut, who was present at the function to receive the first aircraft, said, “Chief minister Uddhav Thackrey, who heads Maharashtra Airport Development Company, the agency developing Mihan, also gave a quick approval to the proposal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jetsetgo-plans-to-import-10-more-aircraft-using-nagpur-route/articleshow/85467619.cms||Shishir Arya

R Sabarinathan, 28, and A Kaliyamurthy, 26, both residents of Attur in Salem district, created a page ‘Call Coimbatore’ on Facebook claiming that they would get job opportunities for youths. A person from Kovilpalayam contacted the duo through the Facebook page a few months ago. Sabarinthan promised him to get a call boy job which could earn him lakhs of rupees every month. Later, Sabarinathan sent obscene videos to the man’s WhatsApp. The duo made lewd phone calls to the man and recorded the same. Later, Sabarinathan demanded Rs 7.5 lakh and threatened to send the recorded audio to his wife if he failed to pay the amount. The victim transferred Rs 7.5 lakh to Sabarinathan’s friend Kaliyamurthy’s bank account. A few days ago, Sabarinathan again demanded Rs 3 lakh from the man. This time, the victim lodged a complaint with the rural cybercrime police. Inspector Jayadevi registered a case against the duo on Tuesday and arrested them from Salem district on Wednesday. Police recovered Rs 2.24 lakh from them. The duo was produced before a judicial magistrate and later remanded in judicial custody.

---||Mumbai||MMR expected to record maximum housing sales, new launches in 2023||MUMBAI: The housing sector will take another two years to reach its peak following the pandemic with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) expected to record maximum sales and new launches in 2023, said Anarock Property Consultants. “Of the total estimated housing sales and new launches in 2023, MMR is likely to comprise a 28% share of total sales and nearly 30% of new launches,” said Anarock, in its report on the housing market in the top seven Indian cities released on Thursday. The residential sector could see a new peak only in 2023, but the levels of supply and sales will be unlikely those witnessed in 2014 anytime soon, the report said. On the brighter side, 2021 is expected to witness an increase of 35% in housing launches and a 30% increase in sales over the previous year, it said. However, against the peak year of 2019, supply and sales may be lower by 28% and 31% respectively. Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock, said, “The residential sector was showing healthy year-on-year growth from 2017 until the latest peak year of 2019, but this trajectory was derailed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Otherwise, 2020 was expected to be a watershed year for the housing sector. While the second half of the year did showcase the remarkable resilience of Indian residential real estate, a new bottom for the sector was created in 2020 with housing sales plunging to nearly 1.38 lakh units while new launches dropped to 1.28 lakh units. 2020 is not a year that the industry is likely to forget very soon.” The Anarock report said with the vaccination drive gaining significant momentum and spread of Covid-19 under better control for now, 2023 will very likely emerge as the new peak year that breaches 2019 levels. “Supply in 2023 will grow by 11% and sales by 22% over 2019,” it said. Housing market in the top seven cities is likely to attain a new peak by 2023, when sales are estimated to cross 3.17 lakh units and new launches by 2.62 lakh units during the year, said the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mmr-expected-to-record-max-hsg-sales-new-launches-in-23/articleshow/85472436.cms||---
---||Madurai||Zero waste variety beckons Tamil Nadu grape farmers||MADURAI: Grape farmers in Theni and Dindigul district are being encouraged to cultivate a new variety of grapes based on zero waste concept by Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Theni in coordination with National Research Centre for Grapes (NRCG), Pune, which would enable value addition and better returns. NRCG director Dr R G Somkuwar said grapes are cultivated on 4,000 acres in Theni and Dindigul. They are among the largest cultivators of “panneer grapes” (Muscat Hamburg). It is a double crop which yields twice a year, but since it is a single variety, they were losing out on opportunities. ``Diversification is the need of the hour, and hence we introduced Manjari Medika, a variety which also yielded two crops a year, but produced about seven to eight tonnes an acre per season, and would sell for as much as Rs 90 a kilogram,’’ he said. Hence, farmers stood to get about 14 tonnes to 16 tonnes an acre from this variety. Zero waste was its main feature, where the juice could sell well both in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Value addition goes a long way in ensuring zero waste, the pomace (pulpy residue) after extracting the juice can be used for replacing 15% maida in cookies to make grape cookies. ``It can also be used to make bread,’’ he said. Yogurt is another option. In addition, the seed from the grapes can be used for extracting the very expensive grapeseed oil, which is in demand in the cosmetic industry. He said NRCG was also conducting research on the extraction of Anthocyanin, a colour pigment, to make capsules, which are expected to have similar health benefits like vitamin B-complex. Farmers in Surulipatti in Theni were now cultivating these high yielding, profitable grapes on about eight acres. They were also planning to promote the fantasy seedless variety in the region. Manjari Shyama was a variety which could achieve uniform colour without plant growth regulators, and suitable for the region, he said. The MoU signed with Coca-Cola by KVK Kamatchipuram would help farmers in a big way, he said. Sub-surface irrigation technology, which could help farmers save 30% of the irrigation cost was something that was being promoted among the farmers of the region, and if the government could provide a subsidy for the same it would help them in a big way, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/zero-waste-variety-beckons-tn-grape-farmers/articleshow/85472377.cms||---

Satishchandra Kamble, the district secretary of CPI, said, “It has been more than six years since the murder of Govind Pansare and tomorrow (Friday) will mark the completion of eight years since the murder of Narendra Dabholkar. During this period, both left and right governments were formed, several IG and IPS came and went, but we were only given false promises. The police have become useless and they don't want to investigate these cases properly. We demand the investigation into the murders of Dabholkar and Pansare to be carried out by the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad.” To pay homage to Dabholkar on his death, August 20, a walk from the Ubha Maruti Chowk to Bindu Chowk has been organised in the morning. Chandrakant Yadav, of the Left front said, “The mastermind behind Dabholkar and Pansare's murders is still roaming freely. The government and police don't want to investigate this case with fair practices. The police need to investigate with an unbiased approach. Several extremely complicated cases have been solved easily by the police department within days but these two famous murder cases, which took place in broad daylight, are yet to be solved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cpi-demands-unbiased-investigation-into-pansare-dabholkar-murders/articleshow/85465084.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Nagpur||Don’t mislead patients, mention your full qualification: NMC to doctors||Nagpur: Now, doctors running small clinics and out-patient departments (OPDs) in various parts of the city will have to mention their complete qualification and specializations on their signboards. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) health department has received several complaints that many doctors mention only MD/MS degree or mere specialization like gynecologists and obstetricians, dermatologists, pediatricians on their boards and deliberately avoid mentioning their graduate degree.According to the complaint, this happens because doctors who are not from modern medicine and hail from the Ayush school of medicine want to create impression that they are experts of modern medicine. Patients who are not very well versed with the medical education degree pattern think that the doctor mentioning MD or MS on the signboard is a practitioner of modern medicine only.However, in Maharashtra, MD (Doctor of medicine) and MS (Master of surgery) are the post-graduate degrees available in ayurveda stream too. MD can be done in homeopathy too.“We received a complaint earlier this month in this regard. It is mentioned in the complaint that private doctors like BAMS, BHMS, DHMS etc are doing business by taking advantage of the popular and reputed MS, MD educational qualification by creating confusion among the patients who come for treatment as they don’t have proper and accurate knowledge about educational qualifications of doctors,” reads a letter signed by NMC health officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar.According to him, the complaint is mainly about the clinics running in Mhalgi Nagar Chowk to Pipla on Hudkeshwar Road as well as Narsala Road and Dighori Road.“If such incomplete educational qualification is found written on the board of a private dispensary in the city, we will check the educational qualifications, certificates of the private doctor concerned and make sure that the appropriate qualification is mentioned on the board of the clinic,” said Dr Chilkar.In case of any misleading or confusing signage, the doctor concerned will be instructed to put up a new signage stating the educational qualification properly. If the doctor concerned is refraining from putting up the right panel even after the instructions, the NMC health department will consider further action.Doctors of Ayush stream have welcomed this move and asked the NMC to also take action against those doctors who are graduated from modern medicine but write MD/MS without having a PG degree.“It’s a right move, but NMC should also focus on those doctors who have not registered their degree with respective council or those are not graduated in modern medicine from authorized University,” said Dr Manish Patil, president of Orange City Homeopaths Association (OCHA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-mislead-patients-mention-your-full-qualification-nmc-to-doctors/articleshow/85467677.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The office of deputy director of education, Kolhapur division has made the schedule available on its website regarding the admission process. Recently, the results of class X were declared. The marks were allotted based on the internal assessment and not on the offline exam. The admissions will open for 35 junior colleges in Kolhapur city. The admission to the top colleges is expected to be tougher owing to a large number of students with high scores this time. Students from Kolhapur district, but also across the region seek admissions to top colleges in Kolhapur city. Subhash Chougule, secretary of CAP said, “The students will have to register online between August 25 to August 30. The booklet with details of admission process, colleges, seats and courses will be uploaded a day earlier. The students have to check the details thoroughly to understand the process.” Chougule said that after the registration, the forms will be scrutinised for any discrepancies between August 31 to September 2.

It was when corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan inspected the Vellaikannu Theatre Road a few days ago, that we realised that they do quality checks of this kind,” said S Sakthivel, who has a shop on the road. “The road has been laid many times but this time it is definitely sturdier,” he said. Recently, the commissioner told residents at a public hearing that it would take about a month for the soil to settle after pipeline works are completed. Roads could be laid only after that and it was welcomed by the participants.During the inspections the corporation commissioner ensured that the workers drill holes to test the depth and quality of the materials used for laying the roads. “The best part of it is that the holes were closed properly after the checks, otherwise it will damage the roads,” said Thiagarjan of Ponmeni who is a regular commuter on the road.Among the roads that stretch more than 1,500km in the city, the civic body took up the work of relaying many roads in places including Muthupatti and Palanganatham. There were many roads like the Bharathi Cross Street in ward number 31, which was laid during the previous government’s term. But it got damaged two days after being laid when a heavy vehicle passed through it. These problems could be avoided if proper checks were conducted, he said.Corporation sources said that they are only being asked to follow the quality checks strictly under the new administration and so far not many issues have been noted. President of the Gomathypuram-Thendral Nagar Residents Welfare Association, D Raghavan, said that ensuring the quality of roads through proper checks was a must. “The 1.2-km stretch from the Melamadai checkpost to the Vandiyur tank shutters laid last December spending Rs190 lakh is an example of how bad work can affect the public. Water stagnates on the road after rain and it has already started developing fissures,” he said. Former councillor R Vijarajan said that such quality checks were not done earlier and that it is something that has to be welcomed under the new regime. Former councillor P Ganeshan says that this is one of the best steps, and that the new commissioner should ensure that all roads including those paved with paver blocks are laid with proper gradient.Commissioner Karthikeyan said that they were ensuring that the MoRTH standards were being followed as per the rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-checking-new-roads-for-morth-standards/articleshow/85472403.cms||---

City traffic police officials said one part of the road near the chowk had become slushy following the rain and there were reports of vehicles skidding and bikers falling. “As a precautionary measure, the stretch was closed, and that lead to a traffic jam at the chowk. We received many calls from motorists about the snarl at the location. We have deployed additional policemen to manage the traffic there,” the traffic police officials said. The Dwarka chowk is one of the busiest chowks in Nashik city as it is the entry/exit point to Mumbai, Pune and Dhule. The flow of vehicles not only from Nashik city, but even from outside the district, is huge on a daily basis. Sitaram Gaikwad, the assistant commissioner of city traffic police, said the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has asked the traffic police to shut the slushy stretch of the road as they wanted to clean it. “There was a huge jam at the chowk and we had deployed additional policemen to streamline the traffic,” he said. NHAI authorities said the work to clean the slushy part of the road has started and will be completed as soon as possible. Nashik district received more than 29mm of rain in the 24-hour period ending at 8.30 am on Thursday. Nashik city, meanwhile, got 24.6mm rainfall beltween 8.30 and and 5.30 pm on Thursday alone. The Met department said that light rainfall will continue for the next three-four days. Meanwhile, the water level in the Gangapur dam has increased by 2% following the rainfall. The storage in the dam has increased by 122 mcft to reach 4,620 mcft in the Gangapur dam. The revival of rainfall after the gap of over 15 days has helped the kharif crops in Nashik and the other three districts of north Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashiks-dwarka-chowk-clogs-up-as-rain-continues/articleshow/85465138.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune cops probe fake insurance racket; at least 3 cheated||PUNE: The city cyber police have launched an investigation into a racket in which fraudsters claiming to represent a prominent private insurance company sold fake vehicle, fire, and health schemes to the unsuspecting. The company in question has lodged a complaint with the police. The fraud come to light mid-July when the victims of the scam filed claim applications after loss or damage to property. On verification, the company’s officials realised that the policy documents were fake and submitted a complaint application with the cyber police on July 15. Following verification of the plea, the company’s vigilance officer, Vishal Katkar, lodged a formal complaint on Wednesday. Inspector Ankush Chintan of the cyber police said, “Preliminary investigations have revealed that the fraudsters have cheated three persons to the tune of ranging Rs 5,000-10,000 by ‘selling’ vehicle insurance policies.” A preliminary investigation has led police to believe this was a nationwide racket in which the suspects, using multiple phone numbers, would call up people and, posing as representatives of the insurance company, sell them policies. The police have unearthed at six mobile phone numbers and as many accounts with different banks in which the unsuspecting buyers would transfer the “premium” “An analysis of the call data records suggests that the suspects targeted people pan-India. We also traced some of the bank accounts where the victims were asked to transfer money.” When the TOI contacted the company officials in Pune and Mumbai on Thursday, they said, “We have registered a complaint and the matter is being investigated by the police. We have handed over all the evidence to them. We cannot make any further comment”. Chintan added, “The suspects would call people at random and urge them to buy vehicle, property, fire or health insurance products. They would then ask the buyers to transfer money to specific accounts via netbanking. After receiving the money, the suspects would issue fake and fabricated documents using the logo and details of the insurance company.” The police have invoked charges related to cheating and forgery, besides the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-probe-fake-insurance-racket-at-least-3-cheated/articleshow/85470108.cms||Gitesh Shelke

She cited the formation of a committee comprising MLAs from all the political parties to discuss and take decisions to curtail the spread of Covid-19. She said that such a practice existed when Karunanidhi was CM and is continuing during Stalin’s tenure too.Kanimozhi said that people taught a lesson to the AIADMK be dethroning them from power as they did not fulfil any of their poll promises during the 10 years they were in power. “All the (poll) promises cannot be fulfilled in one day. But they will fulfilled one after the other in a phased manner right from the day Stalin assumed office as CM,” she said. She added that the opposition is criticising the government on poll promises for the sake of politicising it.On the Kodanadu estate murder case, she denied that it is political vendetta and added that it is being probed to ensure that the rightful people get justice. “It is a major murder case with lots of twists and turns that happened when they were in power. The government will not be a mute spectator to it,” she said and added that those who are at fault are struck by fear over the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/oppn-boycotting-assembly-as-they-have-nothing-to-say-kani/articleshow/85472395.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Permit Stan Swamy’s next of kin to clear his name, HC told||Mumbai: Human right continues even after death, said the late Father Stan Swamy’s lawyers, seeking that his next of kin be permitted to clear the “stigma” to his name as the trial court, while denying him bail, gave a prima facie finding of guilt in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case. Father Swamy was accused of Maoist links and terror offences under a special anti-terror law—the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Given that he was a priest and had “renounced the world,” his guardian would be the Jamshedpur Jesuit Province as per Jesuit convention, and it has appointed Father Frazer Mascarenhas as next of kin, said his lawyer in a written note on submissions given to the HC, as sought earlier this month. Fr Swamy, 84, a tribal rights activist, was arrested last October in the Pune case. He was moved to hospital in May from Taloja jail on directions of the HC based on his frail health and died on July 5, while still hospitalized. The HC was hearing two separate appeals he had filed against rejection of his bail, both on merit and health grounds, by a special NIA trial court. On death of an accused facing a criminal trial, the proceedings stand abated under law. His lawyer’s submission note says, “Even assuming that the present Criminal Appeals abate,” he had filed a writ petition too before his death challenging the constitutional validity of certain rigorous provisions under UAPA dealing with grant of bail. The abatement provisions do not apply to the writ petition as the HC is empowered under the Constitution with wide plenary powers to render justice. It says that the HC also has inherent powers in its parens patriae (parent of the people) jurisdiction to “extend protection to those citizens who cannot protect themselves.” The note cites several SC rulings dealing with court’s powers to be protective of those unable to take care of themselves and seeks that HC exercise such powers to monitor the magisterial inquiry into thecustodial death of Swamy under Section 176 (1-A) of Criminal Procedure Code. Such enquiry, the lawyer submitted, is wider than to merely look at cause of death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-permit-stan-swamys-next-of-kin-to-clear-his-name-hc-told/articleshow/85470191.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Syringe shortage slows down vax drive in Gondia dist||Nagpur: Last week, Covid vaccination slowed down in Gondia and almost came to a halt on Monday. The crisis was not due to shortage of doses, which has become quite usual after the government allowed vaccination of more eligible beneficiaries across the state. The district health officials had run out of syringes which were disproportionate to the number of doses Gondia had been receiving for the last few weeks.While the vaccination drive gathered pace, the number of syringes are said to be nearly half the number of doses available with the district at any point of time. This has compelled the district to take breaks at certain centres or slow down the drive till it receives enough stock of syringes, officials said.From an average of 7,000 vaccinations at the start of this month, the figures fell to just over 600 on August 16. On Thursday too, just 130 vaccinations were done as compared to 15,000 and 11,000 in the previous two days.Both civil surgeon (CS) Dr Amrish Mohabe and district health officer (DHO) Dr Nitin Kapse admitted that the number of syringes was less as compared to doses. Yet, they ruled out any impact on the drive.According to the vaccination data available on the Co-Win dashboard, Gondia district’s single day figure stood at over 10,000 on August 4. Intermittently, the daily achievement kept dropping by half or even more than the district’s capability till Thursday.The CS and DHO said that the vaccination came to halt on Monday and Thursday as the staff was on leave. However, the drive was running full steam in Bhandara, Nagpur, Wardha and other districts in the division on both days.Till date, the district has achieved 7.28 lakh vaccination with just 1.51 lakh of them compeleting their second dose. The widening gap between first and second doses raises a question, especially when health officials have claimed that the district has plenty of stock.Dr Mohabe said, “Since beneficaires have increased, the drive is going on continuously. Once less syringes were received with doses. We did less vaccination when syringe stock depleted. We have received over 40,000 syringes from the deputy director of health services office (DDHS). The procurement is done at the DDHS level just like the vaccines.”DHO Dr Kapse said that syringe stocks are received in every couple of days. “We have more doses but the syringe stock ensures we will have a buffer of next few days. It is supplied as per requirement. As it gets exhausted, we are provided new stock,” he said.DDHS officials claimed to have sufficient stock but they didn't disclose the exact number of syringes and doses.

---||Agra||Agra mufti framed in I-Day case, say protesters||Agra: A large number of people staged a protest at the collectorate here on Thursday to press for withdrawal of an FIR registered against the city mufti and his son for allegedly opposing flag-hoisting and rendition of the national anthem inside the Jama Masjid premises on Independence Day. Some markets were also closed as a mark of protest. Aslam Qureshi, chairperson of the mosque management committee, had filed a police complaint to the effect against the Mufti Mazidul Kudhush Khubaeb Rumi and his son Hummdul Khudhush. Handing over a memorandum to the SSP, local Muslim leaders demanded a case to be registered against Aslam Qureshi for framing the mufti and his son. Leading the protesters, vice-president of the All India Jamaitul Quresh, Jamiluddin Qureshi claimed , “The shahr mufti had never opposed hoisting of the national flag but merely suggested that flag-hoisting should not be done at a sacred space where namaz is offered.” He alleged, “The shahr mufti has been framed in a wrong and false case when in fact is that the fault lies on the part of organizer of the event, Aslam Qureshi, who is chairman of the Local Islamia Agency, and Ashfaq Saifi, chairman of the UP Minority Commission who was chief guest of event organized within Jama Masjid on Independence Day. The Jama Masjid premises has its own sanctity and has been dragged into a controversy needlessly by organizing such an event.” Sources revealed that senior Muslim leaders in Agra had made efforts on Wednesday night to end the controversy by demanding that Aslam Qureshi withdraw his complaint. ‘The Independence Day event was opposed and the Tricolor was insulted merely because the chief guest and chairman of the minority commission is from BJP. I appeal that a case of sedition be registered against the shahr mufti,” said Aslam Qureshi on Thursday. Meanwhile, Muniraj G, Agra SSP, ordered the registration of an FIR against the protestors for violation of CrPC Section 144 and Covid-19 protocol. ``An FIR is being registered against those who lodged the protest on Thursday for violation of CrPC section and the Epidemic Diseases Act,” said Vinod Kumar, in charge of Mantola police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-mufti-framed-in-i-day-case-say-protesters/articleshow/85467746.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Teachers go extra mile to help students||Coimbatore: Many corporation schoolteachers have risen to the occasion during this pandemic time, helping their students cope with studies. Many students, the teachers said, could not attend the online classes as their parents used to carry the only smartphone available in the house to their workplace. “So, we create videos and send them on WhatsApp for them to watch whenever the phone is available at home,” said one of the teachers. Some teachers also conduct online classes in the evenings, mostly between 6pm and 8pm, when parents of most students would be back home from work. Christopher George, a teacher with Uppilipalayam corporation primary school, says while he takes online classes after 6pm, only 25 of the 37 students could attend the classes, as parents of the remaining six reach home late at night. “I will make a separate video for them and they will be asked to visit the school to watch the same. They will be given a worksheet to do the homework, which they will submit the next day. All the students are given an activity related to lessons to improve their critical thinking.” S Sumathi, headmistress, Sanganur corporation middle school, says the schoolteachers would visit the students at their houses to check whether they were coping well with the online classes. “If the students have any doubt, teachers will clarify them on the spot. They will check the students’ notebooks and ensure that they are watching Kalvi channel. The students who require more attention will be asked to visit the school for 30 minutes to clear their doubts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/teachers-go-extra-mile-to-help-students/articleshow/85470148.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Five engineering students in Goa build solar powered e-cycle||PANAJI: Five students of Agnel Institute of Technology and Design have built a custom solar electric bicycle that can comfortably cover the distance between Panaji and Vasco on a single charge. The electric cycle is powered by 20 lithium ion batteries which can be charged by two solar panels or a conventional power supply point at home. The five mechanical engineering students from the institute began toying with the idea of building a self-sustained cycle powered by energy from the Sun a year back as part of their final semester project. Endless power with little to no damage to the environment is the holy grail for transportation and the five boys wanted to help reduce carbon emissions. Beginning in early July, the students -Veloy Fernandes, Hrishikesh Mandrekar, Rohan Naik, Annal Prabhu Ajgaonkar, Beniston Ribeiro - fabricated a cycle frame made of stainless steel. They mounted two solar panels on the cycle to charge the 20Ahr 18650 Li-Ion batteries. “The cycle weights 29 kilos at present. We could have made an aluminium frame or even from carbon to reduce the weight but it would have been very expensive,” said Ribeiro, one of the five students who worked on the project. A pulse width modulation (PWM) charge controller ensures that the batteries do not overcharge or short circuit. The batteries power a brushless DC (direct current) motor which is mounted onto the rear wheel. “Charging your electrical vehicle (EV) on renewable energy such as solar or wind minimizes these emissions even more. All these energies available are eco-friendly when compared to traditionally-used fuels which cause serious problems of environmental pollution,” said the students while explaining their concept. Due to growing environmental concerns, high fuel costs and supporting policies, most automobile manufacturers are moving towards large-scale manufacturing of electric vehicles. Ribeiro admits that at 29 kilos the e-cycle is a bit on the heavier side and that if the weight is reduced, the cycle can travel a longer distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/five-engineering-students-build-solar-powered-e-cycle/articleshow/85472452.cms||---

Though there is no evidence that a third wave if any will affect children more, the wards are kept ready on the instructions from the state health department. At the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), a paediatric ward with 100 beds including 30 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 70 beds with oxygen, has been kept ready within the Covid-19 speciality hospital. “We are prepared to tackle any rise in paediatric Covid-19 cases. However, at present, there are no paediatric Covid-19 cases at the GRH. Covid-19 has only shown mild symptoms in children during the first and second waves and it is expected to continue to be so. However, to be safe, these beds have been allotted,” said Dr S Balasankar, head, department of paediatrics. He further said that children with long-term ailments or are immune-suppressive or obesity are at more risk and urged for Covid-19 safety measures to be followed.At the Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC), 30 beds have been kept exclusively for paediatric Covid-19 care, with ICU set-ups. “In children, it has been post-Covid-19 complications like multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) that is more dangerous than Covid-19 by itself. However, with children not vaccinated for Covid-19, the focus is on them in case of Covid-19 spread,” said Dr B Kannan, medical administrator of the hospital.He added that 50-60 nurses were also provided training in paediatric intensive care and paediatric Covid-19 care to be prepared as treating children varies from treating adults.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-hospitals-take-no-chances-keep-paediatric-covid-wards-ready/articleshow/85472409.cms||---

The police have already arrested Gaikwad’s wife (65) in the case. On July 1, the Chatushrungi police registered a case of domestic violence against the Gaikwad family members after their daughter-in-law lodged a complaint. The police then arrested a guruji (spiritual guide) on the charge of directing the family to torture their daughter-in-law for allegedly bringing bad omen to them and their business. Nanasaheb and Ganesh left Pune as soon as the cases were registered against them and police were since searching for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bizman-son-booked-in-mcoca-case-held-in-udupi/articleshow/85470144.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh govt to the rescue of Nellore rice farmers||NELLORE: In a big relief to farmers in Nellore, the state government has agreed to buy paddy variety MTU 1010 which is produced only in Nellore district. Initially, the government had refused to take the stock citing its inferior quality and people’s reluctance to consume rice made from MTU 1010 paddy. Taking requests of local public representatives and protests of farmers into consideration, the government decided to procure the paddy through Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). The Civil Supplies Department, which found it difficult to distribute the rice through Public Distribution System (PDS) due to opposition from the public, is planning to upgrade its quality by converting it as fortified rice. The Civil Supplies Department has been creating awareness among farmers for the past two years not to cultivate varieties that have no demand in the market. Keeping in view of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s promise to distribute quality rice through PDS, the Civil Supplies Department had stopped procurement of varieties that were not being consumed in the state. The officials of civil supplies department had suggested that the agriculture department should ensure that farmers switch to fine varieties to get remunerative prices as well as avoid trouble during the procurement. However, farmers in Nellore, who have been cultivating MTU 1010 (the grain is considered to be heavy and not preferred by people to consume), continued their practice as it is expected to give them good yields. Kharif season commenced a little early in Nellore district and has reached harvesting stage. According to official records, farmers have produced MTU 1010 variety in about 40,000 acres with an expected output of over 1 lakh metric tonnes. “The government had directed to procure the paddy keeping in view of the farmers’ troubles. We will send the stock to 14 identified mills and convert them as fortified rice before supplying to the mid-day meal programme and anganwadi centres,” said M Padma, district manager, Civil Supplies Corporation. She said they would buy nearly 2 lakh metric tonne paddy from the district in which 1 lakh tonnes would be 1010 variety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-to-the-rescue-of-nellore-rice-farmers/articleshow/85467720.cms||Samdani MN

A statue of Modi installed inside the temple built on private land was removed late on Wednesday night and the structure was covered with paper. Munde, a real estate agent, had said that he had built the temple as a mark of respect to the Prime Minister and because his work is an inspiration. The structure built in red stone and marble was brought from Jaipur. Toughened glass reinforced the structure for security. The 6ft by 2.5ft by 7.5 ft temple was built at the cost of Rs 1.5 lakh. It drew the attention and criticism of passersby. Munde was not available for comment on Thursday despite repeated attempts Opposition parties had criticized the move and blamed BJP workers of spreading an adverse political culture in Pune. The National Congress Party (NCP) city unit staged an agitation outside the temple on Thursday morning. “The temple was shut down before we arrived at the spot. We had brought petrol, diesel and cooking gas as we wanted to pray to the god in this temple to reduce the prices of these essential commodities and help the common man,” Prashant Jagtap, city unit chief of NCP, said. According to BJP leaders in Pune, party workers and leaders had advised Munde to remove the structure. BJP leader and leader of house in PMC Ganesh Bidkar said, “Such a temple is against our policy,” he told TOI.

---||Madurai||Schools shut for long will impact KG students severely, fear teachers||Madurai: Teachers and parents of kindergarten (KG) students fear schools remaining shut indefinitely will have long-term psychological impact on the young children. Hence it should be ensured that they don’t miss schooling. “More than higher class students like Class IX to XII, who are now more used to remote learning, reopening of schools should be considered for students of KG and primary levels. The longer there is lack of school routine, the more difficult it will be for both children and teachers to adjust when they return to school,” said M Senthilnathan, president, private schools correspondents’ confederation. Teachers said that at least having classes for few hours for two or three days per week could be considered.“If KG and Class I children miss school for so long, they grow attached to being at home and also get addicted to digital devices. In some homes, with both parents working, they may be left alone at home for long hours. Without socializing, it will be hard for children to adapt when they go to school for the first time,” said K Saravanan, a primary school headmaster and zonal president, Child-Friendly Schools (CSF). He further said that lack of bonding with teachers will also impact mental health of children and children will also struggle with improving their motor skills.N Jayanthi, parent of a Class I student, said that more than disruption in learning, social skills being affected is the main concern. “Before the Covid-19 pandemic began, my son was in lower KG and went to school for half day. But, now, for the last year, he has only been at home. He completely lacks bonding with peers and teachers,” she said.Teachers are urging for either reopening of schools or an alternative to be considered lke teachers can take learning to doorstep of children. “Video lessons alone cannot help such young children. Reopening in phases with restrictions would be ideal. Otherwise, efforts need to be made so that these children do not lose a significant part of childhood development to the pandemic. Teachers must also continue communicate with students,” said S Urmila, a kindergarten school teacher from Madurai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-shut-for-long-will-impact-kg-students-severely-fear-teachers/articleshow/85472430.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad institutes help Afghan students extend stay here||HYDERABAD: Universities and colleges have come forward to identify and help Afghans students in the city. With many of them almost at the end of their academic year, universities are now reaching out to the external affairs ministry seeking clarity and aid for these students, staring at an uncertain future. There are a total of 158 Afghan students in Osmania University (OU) of which 136 are men and 22 are women. Many of them have come through the Indian Council for Cultural Relations on scholarships. With many students set to complete their course by September-October, they are worried that financial crisis coupled with visa expiry would force them to go back to their country, which is now taken over by Taliban. Since they have been issued only student visas, they would also not be able to take up jobs to sustain their stay in India after their courses are over. Under this, many are planning to pursue further education as an alternative if the Indian government extends their visas. “My family members have lost their jobs in Kabul and I don’t know what I’d do once my course comes to an end. My scholarship would also be discontinued once my course concludes. What we desperately need is financial assistance,” said Rawnaq, an engineering student at OU. As uncertainty looms large, universities are open to extending aid to these students. “We have made a WhatsApp group of all the Afghan students and are set to hold a meeting with them on August 21. We are open to allowing them to stay in our hostels following guidelines from the central government.

The doctors had submitted post-graduate diploma certificates to the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) to get licenses to practice as specialists. When the MMC checked the results of these doctors with a Parel college, from where they claimed to have passed, it did not find their names on the list of successful candidates. The doctors had submitted documents claiming to have passed PG diploma courses in cardiology, general surgery, ophthalmology and gynaecology. “The investigation is at a primary stage. We are going through the documents and will call those who submitted these documents. It is too early to say anything. The investigation has just begun,” said a police officer. Some of the accused doctors are reportedly already practising. “We need to collect all the documents since the doctors submitted them to the medical council over a period of time. We have to establish the source of these documents and when they got them,” said the officer. During the course of the investigation, the police will try to find out where they got these certificates, how much money changed hands, and if more people are involved in it. A few years ago, various police stations in the city had registered cases against some medical students had submitted fake caste certificates to get admissions in the MBBS course. Several people were arrested in those cases and the police found the role of some people who did it for monetary benefit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-42-docs-booked-for-submitting-fake-pg-diplomas-to-work-as-specialists/articleshow/85470211.cms||---

---||Kolkata||‘Job-oriented’ zoology, commerce see huge demand in pandemic yr||Kolkata: Zoology and commerce, which did not get too many takers earlier, suddenly seemed to be on the top of choice list among undergraduate aspirants this time, said principals a day ahead of the application portals closing on Friday. The high marks that Plus-II students received after boards and councils adopted “pandemic formulae” pushed up the number of candidates making it to the eligibility cut-offs at most institutes. Moreover, the absence of application fees has removed the financial hurdle, as a result of which every college and university has received a deluge of forms for UG courses. Most candidates did not seem to take a risk with their career amid the pandemic and opted for “job-oriented subjects and streams, like zoology and commerce, principals said. Scottish Church principal Madhumanjari Mandal Choubey said, “Students always go for subjects like English, physics and chemistry. But if we list according to this year’s demand, English is in first position, zoology second and BCom third. This is absolutely new that a large number of forms have come in for BCom.” Bethune College principal Krishna Roy, too, said, “Zoology and English are of the highest demand.” Professors pointed out that average students scoring high opted for commerce and zoology because they were “job oriented” and most did not want to take a risk with their career amid the pandemic. At St Xavier’s College, the highest number of forms has been submitted for English and commerce, while at Lady Brabourne, it was for zoology and English. Lady Brabourne principal Siuli Sarkar said, “Form submission is higher than that last year. The number is especially high for subjects, like English and zoology.” New Alipore College principal Jaydeep Sarangi said, “Students are choosing basic subjects. Zoology may record 20 times more application forms than earlier.” Pointing out the reason, he said, “In Plus-II, zoology is 70% and botany is 30% in biology. It might have increased their interest and secondly, it is a job-oriented subject. Students are choosing BCom for the same reason.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/job-oriented-zoology-commerce-see-huge-demand-in-pandemic-yr/articleshow/85470241.cms||---

As many as 800 shops including bakeries, hotels, jewellery shops, grocery shops and workshops in Annur, Kariyampalayam, Ganeshapuram, Pogalur and Kunnathur were closed. However, flower shops, medical shops, milk booths and Tasmac outlets were open. Meanwhile, inspector general of police R Sudhakar convened a meeting with the representatives of farmer associations at his office and promised to look into the issue. Leaders of the associations later convened a meeting in Annur. Village administrative officer Kalaiselvi, 32, of Annur and village assistant Muthusamy of Gobirasipuram, who were attached to the Odderpalayam village, were placed under suspension on Monday for furnishing false information to a committee constituted by Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran to investigate charges against Gopalsamy. Based on Gopalsamy’s complaint, Annur police registered a case against Muthusamy for attacking him. A few days ago, Gopalsamy had an argument with Kalaiselvi over a property issue. Muthusamy intervened and slapped Gopalsamy. Noticing a person recording the incidents on his phone, Muthusamy fell at Gopalsamy’s feet. Initially, Gopalsamy was booked under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act of 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/traders-in-annur-seek-justice-for-farmer-down-shutters/articleshow/85470200.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He really wanted to do something big for Onam, so we are fulfilling his wishes by serving a grand Onam Sadhya at the restauran,” said the partner at Deccan Darbar in Kondhwa. This year, Onam will be celebrated on August 21. Many restaurants serving Kerala cuisine will serve Onam Sadhya over the weekend, and home chefs plan to deliver the traditional feast at home too. Chef Piyush Menon said, “We start preparing 2-3 days in advance. Since a lot of vegetables are involved in making the feast, we need to source, clean, peel and chop them. A lot of coconut must be grated, and the milk needs to be extracted. On the day of serving, we will cook the food.” He added, “Sadhya is an experience. Along with 25 items, we also send banana leaves and some instructions on how to serve the food on it.” Malayalees are happy to be able to eat out, but many also plan to make the feast at home. “Since it’s the weekend, we will make the Sadhya at home on Saturday and go out to eat it on Sunday ,” said Hadapsar resident Arun Dasan, adding that his family members have been fully vaccinated in time to take part in the celebration. Jayanthi Santosh, from Pimpri Chinchwad, prefers to stay indoors spending quality time with her family. “Last year, we could not do much on Onam, it was difficult to even get a banana leaf due to the restrictions. This year, our family members will come home, while some of us make a pookalam outside the house, others will cook the Sadhya,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malayalees-plan-grand-onam-celebrations-over-the-weekend/articleshow/85470195.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Currently, the civic body deploys 200 buses, including six electric buses, on different routes.“The decision was taken with the relaxations announced in the Break The Chain notifications issued by the Maharashtra government and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B,” said a senior official from NMC transport department.“Anticipating a rise in passengers post easing of lockdown-like curbs in the city, we have decided to increase the number of Aapli buses on city roads. Slowly, NMC will deploy more buses,” a senior official said.NMC has a fleet of over 400 Aapli buses including 150 midi, 45 mini and six electric buses. After remaining shut for almost seven months in 2020, the civic body partially resumed bus operations from October end. NMC reduced the numbers from 250 to 56 buses when the second Covid wave struck in April this year.Fewer buses on roads increased the travel time for commuters. Even today, commuters have to wait for at least one to two hours for a ride as NMC’s transport department plies only 200 buses which results in poor frequency of buses.TOI had earlier reported that due to limited number of Aapli buses, conductors were facing public wrath. “Most Aapli buses were plying from originating to termination point. Even the ridership on city buses has increased with the lifting of restrictions,” said an official from the transport department.Around 60,000 passengers travel in the 200 Aapli buses daily in some 2,500 trips across the city and in adjoining towns like Kamptee, Koradi, Kalmeshwar, Butibori, Wadi, Hingna etc.Citing an example, a source said on May 19, the earning per kilometre (EPK) was Rs11.99 and earning per bus (EPB) was Rs27.47. On June 9, EPK was Rs12.91 and EPB was Rs28.35 and now EPK has touched Rs18.30 and EPB crossed Rs40.45. Similarly, on August 15, EPK was Rs20.21, while EPB has increased to Rs43.90.BOXBetter Transport Depots---No. of routes---No. of busesOrange Street----23----95Patwardhan----26----95Khapri----15----52Koradi----21----47Matrushakti----1----6Total----86----295||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/90-more-aapli-buses-to-be-on-roads-from-today/articleshow/85467767.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The DLSA would also help the Covid orphans and the children, whose one of the parents had died in the pandemic, in fulfilling the documentation work to avail the government’s beneficiary schemes. DLSA secretary Abhijeet Deshmukh said the para-legal volunteers (PLV) have been engaged in helping Covid orphans to identify and ascertain their properties, bank accounts, fixed deposits, policies and such other investments made by their parents and transferring it to them as legal heirs. “The PLVs would also render help in filling up forms and complete other legal formalities for the Covid orphans so that they can avail the benefits and also their moveable and immovable properties are safeguarded from others eyeing them due to their vulnerabilities,” said Deshmukh. In a meeting held last week, collector Vimala R has instructed DLSA to come forward to legally help 51 Covid orphans to avail the benefits announced by the government for these helpless children. She had also expressed keenness to write letters to the sub-registrar offices to remain alert regarding properties of Covid orphans who should not get deprived of their rights by others usurping their moveable and immovable properties. The collector has also expressed her intention to make appeals to the schools for slashing their fees for such kids. Vimala said she would soon write to the sub-registrar offices and schools this week to ensure help to such kids. “Covid orphans are vulnerable as victims of fraud with their properties and hence the offices of the sub-registrars would be asked to remain alert while transferring their properties,” she said, adding private schools would be appealed to consider their tuition fees. During the meeting, Vimala had also instructed the women and child development department to complete home visits of the children who had lost one of their parents in Covid and submit the social audit report so that their names can be included as the beneficiaries for the government schemes. Though the state government’s announced assistance of Rs5 lakh can be availed by the orphans upon the attaining of 21 years of age, the interest on the fixed deposit can be had immediately. “We already opened the bank accounts of Covid orphans and are now waiting for the government to deposit the amount in them,” said the collector. The government is also now planning to include the children, who have one of their parents in the Covid, in the ‘Balsangopan’ scheme in which they would get Rs1,100 each month. This scheme is now existing for all the orphaned children. Around 1,370 children have been identified by the district women and child development department as the ones who have lost one of their parents. CP Amitesh Kumar said police would ensure there is no exploitation or trafficking of the Covid orphans or being pulled into criminal activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-orphans-to-get-legal-help-for-mutation-of-properties/articleshow/85467791.cms||Soumitra Bose

A total of 120 villagers in Belsar, including 15 pregnant women, have tested positive for mosquito-borne illnesses, mainly chikungunya and dengue, ever since the village reported the first case of zika on July 30. Among them, a maximum of 86 villagers have tested positive for chikungunya and 26 have tested positive for dengue-chikungunya co-infection. Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that transmits the zika virus, also transmits dengue and chikungunya. They are widely seen during the monsoon and post-monsoon period (June to October). “We have tested blood samples of the 27 pregnant women from Belsar village so far. Of them,15 have tested positive for chikungunya. All of them are at home and doing well. They will be monitored for overall health and pregnanc,” said taluka health officer Ujjwala Jadhav. Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) health officials have intensified Zika virus surveillance in the district’s 83 villages spread across 13 tehsils.

---||Hyderabad||GHMC moves in for the kill to take a bite out of dengue||HYDERABAD: After witnessing a spike in dengue cases, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has taken up a slew of activities, including effective surveillance, to control mosquitoes in Greater Hyderabad. This comes after GHMC recently found that with the onset of monsoon, there is a gradual increase in the presence of ‘Aedes aegypti’ mosquitoes, the carrier of dengue virus, in the city. A few of the preventive measures include release of gambusia fish in stagnant water bodies, indoor residual spray, door-to-door awareness campaigns urging people to ensure water does not stagnate in empty or broken vessels, tyres, air coolers, empty shampoo bottles, planters or other containers lying around homes. “Currently, we are seeing a gradual increase in ‘Aedes aegypti’ mosquitoes and we have started to take preventive steps from the past few weeks, which helps control the breeding of these mosquitoes. It is also important to remember that this particular species breeds in stagnant fresh water. Therefore, we must ensure that rainwater does not accumulate in small or big empty containers lying around homes,” GHMC chief entomologist Dr Rambabu said. “To address this problem, we have also started ‘Sunday 10 am 10 Minutes’ programme through which people are encouraged to clear stagnant water in and around their homes,” he added. The officials informed that they were also taking up the weekly anti-larval operations in which about 3,000 houses were being identified every week as vulnerable locations for mosquito breeding and these clusters were treated with larvicides. The weekly programme was being taken up by 642 teams. Meanwhile, 18 teams with 54 workers were deployed for anti-larval operations in the river Musi from Attapur to Chaderghat bridge. According to director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao, this year, 447 of the over 700 dengue cases reported in the state were from Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-moves-in-for-the-kill-to-take-a-bite-out-of-dengue/articleshow/85470204.cms||---

This has come as a disappointment for residents who have been anticipating its opening after being redeveloped under the smart cities mission at a cost of Rs 18.80 crore. The corporation has floated two separate tenders for establishing entrances made of aluminium composite panel at terminal 1 and terminal 2 of the bus stand at a cost of Rs 1.90 lakh. Another tender was floated to establish shops on the ground and first floor of the commercial complex inside the bus stand at a cost of Rs 89 lakh. As the project’s duration was mentioned as a maximum of six months, it is clear that the civil work of the bus terminus may take a few more months to complete. Already, the deadline for reopening the bus stand was missed twice early in the year. In November 2019, the facility was shut for launching the renovation work to facilitate wider bays for the mofussil and city buses to halt. Despite the pandemic, the civil work progressed and the bus stand was expected to reopen after February 2021, but it had to be put off to August. With three tenders floated, doubts were raised about commissioning the facility within the month. “At present, city buses are picking people from makeshift bus stops. It is causing traffic snarls and people lack proper shelters too,” J Nazeer, a resident of Kattur said. The delay in commissioning the renovated bus terminus is also causing hardships in traffic regulation. “Only a portion of civil work is left, we can complete the pending work within a few weeks,” a senior official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-bus-stand-renovation-set-to-miss-another-deadline/articleshow/85472501.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Nagpur||Fifth cycle of tiger estimation to be fully digital, paperless||NAGPUR: The fifth cycle of tiger estimation, in 2022, likely to start from October this year, will be completely digital and paperless. The national census is carried out by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, and the National Tiger Conservation Authority ( NTCA ) every four years. The last estimation was conducted in 2018. Talking to TOI, YV Jhala, WII scientist and coordinator of the census, said, “The estimation will be done with the help of existing MSTrIPES, a GIS-based patrolling module, which has an inbuilt ‘Ecological’ app. Entire field data related to transect lines, carnivore, and herbivore signs will be loaded in this app. The app is self-explanatory and easy to use.” Jhala added, “The app was there during the last estimation, but we did not use it due to limitations. We have introduced it with refinement this time. The training of staff has already started in states and we expect to launch the physical exercise in October, after the monsoon.” Last week, a two-day workshop for the All India Tiger Estimation (2021-2022) training of trainers (ToT) for Central India was held at Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan. Field directors and nodal officers from 17 tiger reserves attended it. Ravikiran Govekar, CCF & field director of Pench, who attended the workshop, said, “Barring the paperless data entry, there is no change in other methodology. The grid size has been kept at 2 sq km like last time for Phase-III camera trap data collection. Prior to 2018, it was 4 sq km. The closure period for camera traps is also 25 days like the last estimation. Earlier it was longer.” “One will have to load his selfie. The signs of animals and other ecological data have already been fed in the ecological app, and one just has to click on the particular sign when spotted. Secondly, there are least chances of any errors due to app based data entry,” said Govekar. Govekar further said, “The best part is that the app is available in over 20 languages spoken in tiger bearing states. A field staffer in Tamil Nadu will be able to fill the data in Tamil, and similarly, in Maharashtra, it can be done in Marathi. The first three days will be for carnivore signs and the remaining three days for herbivores and other ecological data.” Govekar said, “Shifting to the paperless regime will reduce manipulations and give accuracy. It will also save time. The plan is to release at least a summary report of AITE-2022 on July 29, 2022, which is World Tiger Day.” However, the flip side of the new paperless system is that all the forest field staff, especially those posted in tiger-bearing territorial areas, are not trained to handle MSTrIPES. “It is true that training will have to be imparted to territorial staff. Around 50% of the tigers are found in territorial areas. Lack of training would lead to errors in tiger numbers,” admit officials. Sources said, for the 2022 estimation, the NTCA-WII is reluctant to involve NGOs and has left the decision to the individual states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5th-cycle-of-tiger-estimation-to-be-fully-digital-paperless/articleshow/85470215.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The inauguration was conducted in the presence of senior deputy mayor Amrik Singh Somal and deputy mayor Kuljit Singh on Thursday. The mayor said the road to Kumbra Chowk would be renovated and opened to people in 10 days. Work of sewerage renovation was started last year by health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu. A new road has been constructed over the sewerage pipe from Bawa White House to Phase 10. This road was completely closed on the side of Phase 10 in front of Kumbra Chowk. Part of the road from Kumbra Chowk on the side of Balongi has been open to traffic from the beginning and work on the other side is on in full swing. The mayor has asked the company which has the contract to complete the work expeditiously. Mayor Jeeti Sidhu said due to frequent blockage of sewerage in the city, a large sewerage pipe was installed here and the road had to be dug up from one side. He said that Rs 10 crore was being spent on construction of the new road by laying sewerage pipe under the dug-up road. According to the mayor, automatic machines were being installed in Mohali to improve water supply. He said that all the machines of the water treatment plant would be replaced and automatic machines were being installed for chlorine mixing. Five water boosters with uninterrupted supply were also being installed in different areas, he said. Mayor Jeeti Sidhu said authorities have been directed to complete development works on time with emphasis on quality. Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Garg, councillor Jasbir Singh Manku, SE Sanjay Kanwar, Xen Harpreet Singh, Gurcharan Singh Bhamra and other area residents were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/road-closed-for-installation-of-sewer-pipes-inaugurated/articleshow/85467836.cms||---

With rain lashing the city for consecutive days, water stagnation in vacant plots and poor awareness among the residents only seem to aggravate the cases further.Corporation said that four dengue cases - two each in two houses - were reported in Thiruvanaikoil in Srirangam zone recently. In the past 10 days, the city also witnessed at least four rainy days recording 3cm to 12cm rainfall in several localities. With residents leaving scraps including coconut shells, containers open, they pose a potential breeding ground for aedes mosquito. Unlike the scenario two years back when corporation involved 500 domestic breeding checkers across the 65 wards to eliminate the dengue sources before monsoon, no such mass drive has been organised so far. “We have deputed 50 workers to check dengue sources in each of the four zones. Penalisation drive will be launched soon. We are also promoting awareness,” a sanitary official with the corporation said. Although all wards have a fogging machine each, residents complained that their locality was not covered. They claimed that corporation workers informed them that fogging will be done only if the locality reports dengue cases. “Big bazaar street, a densely populated residential cum commercial area is yet to witness any dengue preventive measures. No workers visited us to check dengue source,” K P Rangaprasad, a resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/suspected-death-from-dengue-fails-to-shake-up-trichy-corpn/articleshow/85472545.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Housing e-registration pilot project likely next month||MUMBAI: A pilot project for the state to usher in e-registration for housing projects listed under MahaRERA will commence from mid-September, ahead of the actual roll-out from October 1, inspector-general of registration and stamps Shravan Hardikar said in Pune on Thursday. The registration department is getting ready by ensuring that maximum developers are enrolled under the process and they have reached out to the builders’ association ahead of commencement of the pilot project. Hardikar told TOI that an app was being readied for the pilot project. “Over 100 developers have carried out e-registration of over 346 projects across the state. The e-registration process will enable sale and purchase of housing projects, so buyers and sellers will no longer have to visit registration offices. We will first roll out the pilot project in the third week of September. After this, we will enable all developers registered under MahaRERA to carry out the process from their offices,” he said. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat had told TOI in June that the e-registration process was among initiatives planned to streamline work, especially during the pandemic, and reduce footfall at the registration offices. A registration department official said the process was being implemented on a small scale. “Now, with this being mandatory from October 1, the registration department is ensuring that the software is being prepared by the middle of next month,” the official said. The pilot project is being carried out first to ensure that ahead of its actual roll-out, the app is being tested and there are no technical glitches. “The proof of the concept will be ready ahead of the pilot project. The process will also be decided and will cite the criteria, such as categorising developers with 100 or more flats, and 50 or more flats, and go ahead with the registration process in phases,” Hardikar said. Another official said, “The e-registration process can continue even at the time of the pandemic-induced restrictions. This will ensure that the real estate market does not get affected.” Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) chairman Satish Magar, who was among the first developers to register his projects in Nanded city with the earlier software, said, “Maharashtra is among the frontrunners to introduce such concepts.” State Credai president Sunil Furde said the developers’ body has been favouring a software that would ease registration and ensure transparency. “We are looking forward to this initiative and members have been briefed about it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/housing-e-registration-pilot-project-likely-next-month/articleshow/85470297.cms||Nisha Nambiar

All members of the Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Associations (FGPDA), i.e. some 4,000 petroleum dealers, did not buy fuel from oil companies on Thursday. This is the second time in August when the dealers did not purchase fuel from oil companies, they did not petrol and diesel on August 12 as well. Continuing their protest, petroleum dealers will not purchase fuel from oil companies on Aug ust 26 as well. Dhimant Ghelani, general secretary, FGPDA, said, “The margin of dealers has not been increased for four years. A petroleum dealer gets a margin of Rs 3 for every litre of petrol purchased, Rs 2 for every litre of diesel and Rs 1.75 for every kg of CNG. Despite representations to oil companies, our demands have not been met and therefore this black day was observed.” Sale of CNG was also halted at all stations in the state for an hour i.e. from 1pm to 2pm on Thursday, in protest. Dealers say they have suffered losses due to the lockdown and restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 and it is time that their demands for an increase in margins is met. According to FGPDA estimates, 1.46 crore litres of diesel and 72 lakh litres of petrol are sold every day in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/petro-dealers-protest-unchanged-margins/articleshow/85472604.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Admissions double in corporation middle schools this year||Coimbatore: The number of students admitted to the corporation schools in the city has almost doubled in the current academic year, compared to the previous one. The city has 84 corporation schools - 17 higher secondary schools, 11 high schools, 14 middle schools and 42 primary schools. As per the data available with the civic body, its primary and middle schools alone have so far this year seen a 98% increase in admission to 3,786 from 1,913 last year. Admissions to high and higher secondary schools have also gone up by 30% and 18%, respectively, this academic year. An official with the education wing of the city corporation attributed the rise in admissions to aggressive canvassing by teachers and headmasters. “Teachers met people at their doorsteps, explaining the infrastructure available in the schools and convincing parents of the prospective students about the quality of education offered in corporation schools.” Some schools had revamped the facilities as well to attract students. In one such initiative, teachers had come together to paint Uppilipalayam primary school and convert a vacant land on its backyard into a playground. It attracted many parents in the locality to enrol their wards to the school, which saw 82 new admissions, taking the student strength to 232. Almost all the corporation schools, the official said, have smart classrooms, playgrounds, libraries and clean facilities. “Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara used to hold meetings with the school headmasters once in a fortnight to ensure increase in student strength in the schools.” Another source said loss of livelihood to Covid-19 pandemic was also a reason for the parents to send their wards to corporation schools. “Many parents could not pay fees of their children, who were in private schools. Hence, they were admitted to corporation schools. While some private schools hadn’t issued transfer certificates to them as they haven’t cleared dues, the students were admitted to corporation schools without the document.” Pointing out that admission details of every student were available on the education management information system, a headmaster with a corporation middle school said they had obtained the students’ previous education details from it by entering their Aadhar number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/admissions-double-in-corporation-middle-schools-this-year/articleshow/85470313.cms||V Devanathan

Citing inadequate pay and workplace constraints, the woman in 2013 had voluntary discontinued her service after receiving various recognitions for taking up a profession mostly performed by men.Ankayarkanni, who belongs to a scheduled caste community hails from an agriculture labour family in Sempattu in Trichy. After finishing her schooling, she enrolled in the government music school, Trichy to study Tamil devotional hymns and poems like Thirumurai, Thirupugal, Thevaram and Abirami Anthathi. After completing the course, encouraged by her teacher Saravana Manickam, Ankayarkanni approached the state government and in 2006, she was appointed odhuvar in the Arulmigu Panchavarnaswami temple in Woraiyur as a contract employee. Eight years ago, she quit her job and shifted to her native. “The salary of Rs 1,875 was not revised for years and I could not afford to pay even the rent after relocating to the city,” Ankayarkanni said. “First female odhuvar of the state is my identity and I postponed my marriage for the job. I hope the state government will recruit me again for decent pay as per my eligibility,” Ankayarkanni told TOI. She said that monthly wage was not the only reason to quit but also a health factor as she developed complications due to lack of access to toilets at the workplace. A HR&CE official said that another person has already been appointed as odhuvar for a pay Rs 6,000 per month at the temple where Ankayarkanni served. Ankayarkanni said that she has planned to approach the CM special grievance redressal cell for a solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/first-woman-odhuvar-seeks-reinstatement/articleshow/85472559.cms||---

Soon, her friends alerted her about an Instagram account that described her as a sex worker and also had her photo and contact number. Left disturbed with the development, the woman lodged a complaint at the cybercrime police station. When the police tracked the accused through IT surveillance, not just the victim but her neighbour too were left shocked. It turned out that the culprit was a 17-year-old ITI student living in the victim’s neighbourhood. The boy created the fake account to take revenge on the woman. Since the accused, Palanpur Patiya resident, was a minor the cops released him with a warning. Before the release, the cops warned him about the consequences of such a crime in the presence of his parents. Police said that in the past the boy used to harass the woman through social media. Fed up, the woman complained to the boy’s mother about his behaviour. Following which the boy was scolded and beaten by his mother. “To take revenge he started harassing the woman by posting abusive messages on the woman’s original Instagram account. She then blocked him after which he started sending messages to the woman’s friends who too blocked him. Later to continue harassment he created the woman’s fake account. The accused also posted photos of the victim’s friends on her fake Instagram account,” said a police officer of the cybercrime police station.

It was only recently that the civic body carried out renovation work on the road which serves as an alternative route for the Karur bypass road in Trichy city. It was not revamped in the past few years. Connecting Trichy-Karur NH with Woraiyur, Salai road, and Thillai Nagar, the road was heavily accessed by city residents to skip the oversaturated Karur bypass road. As the city was witnessing good rainfall for the past few days, a portion of the bank abutting the road situated adjacent to Kudamurutti channel had caved in on Wednesday evening. While only a portion slid away initially, the continuous rain damaged about a 100-foot-long stretch. “We have placed sandbags and wooden poles to keep the road intact and ensure the safety of users,” an official with Trichy corporation said.  Official sources said that the road managed by the city corporation without retaining wall is highly vulnerable to such damage during monsoon. “We will propose a retaining wall along the road stretch bordering the channel,” the corporation official added.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/retaining-wall-sought-along-konakkarai-rd/articleshow/85472594.cms||---
---||Kolkata||High realty circle rates flummox flat buyers||Kolkata: At least four instances have come to light in which circle rates of projects have been revised upwards by 34% to 137% after the state budget announced a 10% reduction in circle rates to give a boost to the real estate industry that has seen sales dip due to the pandemic. The circle rate of a complex being developed in Tollygunge has been increased from Rs 4,180 per sq ft to Rs 9,900 per sq ft in August, nearly a month after the budget proposed a 10% reduction in circle rate along with a 2% cut in stamp duty till October 30. However, home buyers were unable to take advantage of the concessions due to a glitch in the software. Though that problem has since been resolved, the massive hike in circle rates in select projects has come as a shock to both developers and customers. In another project on the edge of New Alipore and Behala, the circle rate has been increased by 81%. A project on Alipore Road has seen the circle rate being revised by 42% while another on Christopher Road in Tangra has had a 34% increase in circle rate earlier this month. Incidentally, one of the projects has been under way for five years while another has been under development for three years. The legal officer of the Bengal chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) has written to inspector general of registration and commissioner of stamp duty T Balasubramanian, citing the anomaly that has deprived home buyers in these projects from availing of the concession announced in the budget. Speaking to TOI, Balasubramanian said two of the projects in question have been categorised as special projects since they offer better amenities than others in the locality and therefore command a higher sale price. “This is routine exercise. The new rates are being reflected now because the system has been upgraded recently,” he clarified, adding that the other cases were being reviewed by the department. Developers questioned why the rates were not revised either earlier or after the concession period expires in October-end. They also pointed out that the projects were under development for years and should have been categorised as special projects earlier. “The upward revision in circle rates should not have happened between the time the rate concession was announced on July 7 and October 30 when the concession period ends. Also, the reason behind jacking up rates to level much beyond the project sale price should be transparently explained,” said Credai Bengal chairman Nandu Belani. The revised circle rates of all the four projects is 30%-50% higher than the sale price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-realty-circle-rates-flummox-flat-buyers/articleshow/85467940.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Vijayawada||Herbicides sale jumps on agri activities||AMARAVATI: With agriculture activity picking up across the state due to good rains, the demand for regulated herbicides too has picked up. The state is likely to witness close to Rs 400 crore of herbicides sale during the current season. What’s, however, worrying is the laxity on the part of agriculture department officials to regulate the sale, due to which dealers are openly selling stocks, thereby causing damage to the health of humans as well as the environment. Though Andhra Pradesh is the first state in the country to have issued orders to regulate the sale of herbicides, the restriction is applicable only during the non-crop season. The Centre had, in fact, issued a draft notification to regulate the sale of about 27 ‘dangerous’ herbicides and chemical pesticides last July. After giving 30 days time for filing of objections and suggestions, the deadline was extended by another two months and expired in October 2020. However, the Centre is yet to issue a final notification to regulate sale of herbicides, which seems to have encouraged its manufacturers to make a killing when the demand peaks. Andhra Pradesh is one of the highest consumers of chemical herbicides and pesticides in the country, with herbicides alone accounting for over Rs 300 crore of the sale proceeds during the kharif season. Pesticide dealers even push some banned products of glyphosate to farmers who use them as weed remover. “It is high time both the state and central governments ban the sale of herbicides which are posing a threat to the life of humans and animals while also affecting the environment,” Padma awardee farmer and Rythu Nestham chairman Yadlapalli Venkateswara Rao says, adding that the agriculture department should conduct frequent inspections to at least prevent the sale of banned pesticides. Sources said some dealers are importing banned stocks from Karnataka and selling them at a premium of 100 per cent. Some products which cost around Rs 300 per litre in Karnataka are being sold at double the price in AP. “The dealers are making huge profits and are misleading the farmers,” alleged BJP’s Kisan cell leader YV Subbarao. He further claimed that the sale of glyphosate is rampant in Godavari, Krishna, Guntur, Nellore, Ananthapuram and Kurnool districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/herbicides-sale-jumps-on-agri-activities/articleshow/85467955.cms||Samdani MN

Officials have stressed that the process would also help increase the area under cultivation in both districts.The area under cotton cultivation in these districts has dipped to 50,000 acres now, from about 75,000 acres earlier. This was because of low productivity and absence of mechanization in cultivation, S Somasundaram, associate professor and head of Veppanthattai Cotton Research Station (CRS) in Perambalur said. To overcome the issue of yield, farmers were advised to use CO17 variety released by Tamil Nadu Agriculture University recently. Even then, the absence of mechanization escalates labour cost, officials said.To sensitise cotton farmers, mechanized sowing of high-density planting system and spraying was demonstrated CRS Veppanthattai for farmers and extension officials on Thursday. Somasundaram said farmers showed interest in planting cotton under a high-density system at five to 10 plants per square metre for improving yields and suiting mechanical harvesting in cotton. “For sowing under high density with good precision, pneumatic modern seed drill may be effectively used. It can sow both cotton and corn, the dominant crops of this region. The CO17 variety is suited well for high-density planting and mechanization,” he added. Elumalai, deputy director of agriculture, said. mechanical sowing and spraying alone can save 30% of labour in cotton.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cotton-farmers-must-mechanise-sowing-spraying-cut-30-on-cost/articleshow/85472639.cms||---

Since it was opened to traffic on October 1, 2019, the bridge is meant to cater one-way traffic from VIP Road to Salt Lake and has become a boon for motorists who can get to Salt Lake from Lake Town without the Ultadanga detour. However, in spite of multiple signage on the Salt Lake end of the bridge, a number of motorists regularly use the bridge to quickly hit VIP Road through Salt Lake AE Block without taking a deviation via Hudco crossing. “Last night, I took the Bailey bridge from Lake Town and I had nearly bumped into two bikes that had illegally taken the bridge from the other end. To avoid hitting them, I almost crashed into the iron rails,” said Samik Chatterjee, who was visiting a relative in Salt Lake AD Block. TOI stood at the bridge multiple times during the week and found gross violations through the day with several cars with “on government duty” and ‘advocate’ and ‘police’ stickers violating the one-way norm at will. Several vehicles of ministers and political leaders were also found violating the rule. Constables and civic police volunteers TOI spoke to said they had tried to stop the vehicles time and again but the drivers allegedly drop names or flank boards and car stickers to get away. Cops in charge of traffic maintenance on the bridge agreed minor violations do happen at times but said those are mostly limited to “emergency” needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/free-for-all-on-vip-rd-salt-lake-bridge/articleshow/85467973.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Rampur police had submitted two charge-sheets against the three under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable property, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (fraudulently using any forged document as a genuine document) and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. The court found sufficient evidence to frame all the charges submitted in two charge-sheets submitted by police. The FIR in this case was registered at Ganj police station in 2019 on the complaint of local BJP worker Akash Saxena after it was evident that Azam Khan’s son was holding two date of birth certificates which he used for contesting assembly elections despite being not eligible to contest. The Allahabad high court had given conditional bail to all three accused in this case last year in October following which Azam’s wife was released from prison. However, police filed a supplementary chargesheet against all three and added section 120b (criminal conspiracy) of IPC on August 11. Additional district government counsel Ramavtaar Singh Saini said, “The court has framed charges against Azam Khan, his wife Tazeen Fatima and son Abdullah Azam in the ‘date of birth’ forgery case. Azam Khan and his son, who are lodged in jail, were informed about the court proceedings through video conferencing while Tazeen Fatima, who is out on bail, was summoned in the court for the proceedings. The next date of hearing is August 26.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/charges-framed-against-azam-his-wife-and-son-in-dob-fraud-case/articleshow/85462130.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

A few weeks ago, New Town Kolkata Development Authority had asked the residents if they were willing to work as “vaccine volunteers”, helping their co-residents with different aspects of vaccination. Gautam Bhadra, 63, was one of the first one to send his name. “When the pandemic started, I was a part of several volunteer groups, helping out senior citizens procure medicines and getting admitted to hospitals. It was a very satisfying experience for me. So when the opportunity to help my fellow residents came up, I immediately opted for it,” said Bhadra. Fifty residents of New Town have been shortlisted and their names and numbers have been shared with others. Some are comfortable only with telephonic consultations but there are others who have opted for face-to-face consultation. “I have received several queries from residents of the township since I opted to be a vaccine volunteer. Many families are worried about the vaccination status of their house helps, guards and drivers but do not know how to go about it. Others are unable to register on Co-Win. On my off days, I have been visiting these residents and helping them out with their queries,” said Souvik Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-gets-vax-volunteers/articleshow/85468014.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Coimbatore||Forest dept forms special teams to curb man-elephant conflicts||Udhagamandalam: The forest department has formed special teams comprising 18 staff members for night patrolling in Pandalur and Nadugani forest ranges, where man-elephant conflict has been on the rise. In the early hours of Tuesday, an elephant had damaged a house at Puliyamparai tribal hamlet near Gudalur and injured two residents. The villagers had subsequently demanded the forest department to erect an electric fence around the hamlet or set up a trench to safeguard their properties from elephant attacks. In the past four years, 18 elephant attacks were reported in Nadugani and Pandalur ranges, which are home to several tribal hamlets. Prasad Ganeshan, forest range officer, said two elephants - a makna (male without tusks) and a pregnant female – were roaming in the tribal hamlets. “The two have damaged a few houses in the past few months.” According to him, the elephants are venturing into the tribal hamlets in the early hours of the day to grab food from the residents’ kitchens. “As per the request of the villagers, we have formed special teams to patrol their hamlets on shift basis.” The forest department has, meanwhile, written to higher authorities seeking permission to translocate the two elephants. It has also come up with a new method to chase wild elephants away into the forest. “We are going to use lightening gun on a trial basis to chase away elephants from the tribal hamlets. It will produce lightening effect with sound,” Prasad Ganeshan said. If it’s successful, he said, it would be used in future to chase away elephants from human habitats. “We don’t want to disturb wild elephants, while safeguarding human lives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/forest-dept-forms-special-teams-to-curb-man-elephant-conflicts/articleshow/85470365.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Liver Foundation West Bengal (LFWB), under a project called Vaccine Access Initiative, will be vaccinating around 1,000 hawkers with two doses of Covishield free of cost. The drive took off at the Sonarpur facility on Tuesday. “We decided to inoculate railway hawkers for two reasons. The scientific reason is that they need to get vaccine protection as they are vulnerable to the infection due to their profession. Also, they are in financial distress, rendering them inaccessible to paid vaccine,” said LFWB mentor hepatologist Abhijit Chowdhury. The vaccine vials for the special drive has been procured with funds from organisations like the Association of India’s Development, Friends of Liver Foundation and Oak Foundation. “We will be inoculating rail hawkers who work in local trains in the South Sealdah section. There are about 1200 hawkers in this section and we found that about 200 have already been vaccinated,” said IILDS secretary Parthasarathi Mukherjee. While free vaccines are being administered only from government-run CVCs, the inoculation camp at IILDS is the only other non-government CVC from where the jabs are being given free. Around 300 plus recipients have got the jab in the past three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/free-shots-for-railway-hawkers/articleshow/85468041.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Nagpur||Covid control: All 11 Vidarbha districts among best in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: The latest Covid-19 data released by the state government on August 18 shows that five of the six districts having less than 10 patients under treatment are from Vidarbha. The remaining six districts in Vidarbha are among the nine districts in the state having less than 100 patients under treatment. This indicates that Vidarbha is in a very good position as compared to other parts of Maharashtra in terms of Covid management, said experts. The data shows that 3.31 lakh patients are under treatment in the state, with only 2,614 of them in institutional quarantine while others are in home isolation. Vidarbha has only 313 patients, which is 0.09% of total under-treatment patients in the state. This indicates that majority of hospital beds in the region are vacant. Rural areas in Vidarbha where schools had reopened about a month back haven’t reported any spike in Covid-19 cases among the paediatric or overall population. According to expert doctors, conditions in Vidarbha are comparatively better than other parts of the state because the second wave of Covid-19 began early in Vidarbha. “The second wave started in mid-February in Vidarbha while in other parts it started in mid-March. As we started early, we are getting over it early,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. Shops and markets in all districts of the region have been permitted to function till 10pm. The opening up of marketplaces might bring a considerable spike in new cases but it is normal, said experts. “We are expecting a small spike in new cases. But as far as number of new cases is under control, this spike is natural and acceptable,” said a senior member of divisional Covid task force. Vaccination is going to play a major role in control of the infection. As per latest data, more than 50% of eligible population in Vidarbha (18+) have already received at least one dose of the vaccine while near 14% have received both the doses. Speeding up vaccination will not only control serious disease and hospitalization but also reduce chances of further mutations and virus will get limited scope for multiplication, said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-control-all-11-vidarbha-districts-among-best-in-state/articleshow/85470435.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Addressing a gathering of party workers at Cachar Club here after returning to her hometown on Thursday, Sushmita said her joining the TMC is unconditional. “I didn’t not seek anything from Mamatadi before joining the party led by her. I also didn’t want to know whether I would be given responsibility of Assam or Tripura or any other place in the country where the presence of TMC is the need of the hour. I don’t do such kind of politics. I simply wanted membership of Trinamool Congress from her. To speak the truth, I want to become the president of my party’s booth committee of my area in Silchar,” said the former president of All India Mahila Congress. Sushmita, the scion of veteran Congress leader and seven-time MP Santosh Mohan Dev, stated that she had joined the party not for any instant benefit, but for long-term politics. “If I had to do politics for instant benefit, I could have joined BJP and contest any bypoll like some other people who over the months shifted political allegiance for instant gain. But I didn’t run after this. Understanding that people of the Barak Valley and Silchar in particular want change, I joined the TMC,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/joining-tmc-will-be-turning-point-in-nes-politics-sushmita/articleshow/85468048.cms||BB Goswami

Accused Sunny Vasava, who runs an egg joint, was charged of stalking and leering at a female employee of a diamond unit for the past two years. After his wife approved of the woman’s allegations in her statement, cops arrested him for causing similar harassment to few other women in Bombay Colony area of Rander.

She said that despite being counselled by her multiple times, Vasava did not change his behaviour. Sub-inspector of Rander police station, A R Maadam, also confirmed that the wife confided in police about her husband’s wayward nature of stalking and harassing women in their neighbourhood. In the complaint registered with Rander police, the female employee said that she lives in a home near Vasava’s. The accused started staring at her couple of years ago whenever she came out of home, she alleged and added that he also would often follow her right up to her workplace or even if she goes out for some work.

The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) help desks, set up to issue special passes, began operations at the Pune, Shivajinagar and Talegaon railway stations on Wednesday. “There might be many people applying for the universal travel pass. This could be one of the reasons why the PMC help desks are not much crowded,” Pune railway division’s public relations officer Manoj Jhawar told TOI. Till Thursday afternoon, 10 passes were issued at Pune station and 12 at Shivajinagar. A universal travel pass can be obtained from epassmsdma.mahait.org, and is issued in 48 hours. Sources said while people came to the Pune station on Thursday for the special passes, many returned disappointed. “There were at least four cases where people had a final vaccination certificate but Co-Win showed that they had taken one dose. We don’t know what the error is, but in such a case we cannot provide a pass,” a source at the Pune station told TOI. Harish Meval of Sahkarnagar, who got a pass, said an acquaintance in the railways had told him about it. An official also said that two information boards would be installed at the earliest at the entrance gate of the Pune railway station following complaints that the help desk was difficult to locate. “We have taken cognisance of the matter,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/universal-travel-pass-valid-for-local-trains-too-railways/articleshow/85470468.cms||Joy Sengupta

Another Rs 50 crore will be used to create a common services centre. Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal, speaking at a meeting with export promotion councils, commodity boards and export development authorities, said space would be created in Seepz for more units. “New places shall be built in Seepz for newer units to come in and also to move existing units into new places,” he said. “About Rs 50 crore will be spent for setting up common services centre facilities and roughly Rs 200 crore for refurbishing and rebuilding in the Seepz.” The Santacruz Electronic Export Processing Zone (Seepz) was set up on May 1, 1973, as a uni-product EPZ solely for manufacture and export of electronic items. In 1987-88, the government permitted the manufacture and export of gem-and-jewellery items. Seepz was one of the three export processing zones converted into a special economic zone in November 2000. Rajiv Pandya, president, Seepz Gems and Jewellery Manufacturing Association, said several units were facing space constraints and could not expand owing to policy restrictions, which did not allow space transfer. “When a unit moves out, another unit desirous of taking over the space for expansion cannot do so because of policy restrictions. The government has promised to do away with such constraints,” he said. Pandya said jewellery sales were seasonal and they need work for slack periods, which would help them retain labour and remain competitive. The association also raised the issue of high premiums. Colin Shah, chairman, Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said the government promised an e-commerce policy as part of its Foreign Trade Policy in October. Pandya said the common facility centre would greatly benefit smaller units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-piyush-goyal-announces-rs-200cr-for-internal-expansion-of-seepz/articleshow/85470566.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Delhi||Nearly 1,000 waterbodies in Delhi put on map||NEW DELHI: The Wetland Authority of Delhi has given unique identification numbers to 1,040 waterbodies in the capital. While the city was always believed to have around 1,000 ponds, it is the first time that they have been identified in official records. Of those given the UID numbers, 995 have also been mapped on a GPS platform. The Wetland Authority has fixed a deadline of June 2022 for the notification of all wetlands for conservation and management. A monitoring committee appointed by National Green Tribunal had also recommended in 2019 that Delhi’s land-owning agencies should prevent encroachment of waterbodies and tag them with unique ID numbers. A Wetland Authority official said on Thursday, “After the allotment of the UIDs and successful mapping of wetlands, the district-wise details of waterbodies have been uploaded on our website. We are now preparing ‘brief documents’ for the regulations and notification of the ponds.” TOI earlier reported that Delhi currently did not have a single notified waterbody. The Union ministry of environment and forest and climate change issued guidelines last year on implementing the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. Under these rules, a ‘brief document’ was to be first prepared on each wetland proposed to be notified with information like demarcation of wetland boundary, supported by accurate digital maps with coordinates and validated by ground truthing. Other information to be included were ecological character description, account of pre-existing rights and privileges and modalities for the enforcement of regulations. For the 1,040 listed waterbodies, the land-owning agencies had submitted 520 brief documents till Thursday. “We have asked for the remaining brief documents by August 30,” said a Wetland Authority official. “A technical committee will review the brief documents and management plans prepared by the agencies by December.” The official added that the authority would forward the recommendation for notification of waterbodies to Delhi government by March 2022 and the final notification process is expected to be completed by June next year. Notification of a pond under the Wetlands Rules provides legal protection to the waterbody and prohibits acts like dumping of waste, discharge of untreated effluents and encroachment. “As most of the wetlands have degraded over the years, the agencies have submitted 587 plans for their restoration, management and conservation,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nearly-1000-waterbodies-put-on-map/articleshow/85470510.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Biodiversity study and tree census to fight pollution, reinforce Victoria Memorial Hall’s green barrier||KOLKATA: The green barrier along the perimeter of the sprawling Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH), which is preventing the white edifice from graying because of the increasing vehicular pollution from roads all around it, is going to get greater attention with VMH authority embarking on a series of projects, including biodiversity documentation, tree census, publication of green book and reinforcing its green wall on its centenary years.. The 57-acre manicured garden exclusively draws one third of Victoria’s total visitors. “Amid the manic movement of vehicles on the roads encircling it and concrete jungle on its south, the garden itself is a biodiversity hotspot.  This is why we are embarking on the study of its biodiversity — record all the living beings, including the tiniest insects the garden harbours. All these are very much part of the garden and we have to ensure a proper environment to protect them as well,” said VMH secretary and curator Jayanta Sengupta. VMH is in constant coordination with the state biodiversity board, Botanical Survey of India and numerous NGOs for this purpose. “The row of big trees along the perimeter of the garden and rows of dwarf trees and shrubs in the inner perimeter have been very effective in preventing the pollutants from greying the white marbles. We are thus constantly replacing dead and uprooted trees but also thinking of reinforcing the green barrier further,” Sengupta added. The wonderful growth of foliages, Sengupta said, had helped in significant improvement of ambient air quality of the garden. “We were a bit apprehensive seeing some fungal growth on the barks of some trees. Botanists assured us that such fungi grow only in a cleaner environment and are very good indications of its unique biodiversity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/biodiversity-study-and-tree-census-to-fight-pollution-reinforce-victorias-green-barrier/articleshow/85468082.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Only 2 corporators get an ‘A’ in Praja performance report||MUMBAI: Ahead of the BMC election scheduled early next year, an analysis of the performance of 220 corporators by NGO Praja Foundation shows only two of them received an A grade for the period 2017-2021 in the scoring system devised by the citizen watchdog. While 198, or 90%, of councillors received C, D, E and F grades, there were 20 who made it to B grade. The Praja report said the rankings showed there was a need for major improvement in corporator performance. Grade A is given for scores from 80 to 100, B from 70 to 80, and C to F grades are all for various scores under 70. Opposition leader Ravi Raja of the Congress was ranked first. The five-term corporator said taking people’s issues before the administration repeatedly ensured his top position. AIMIM corporator from Bharatnagar in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Gulnaz Qureshi, stood last. The public representative refused to speak on anything, only saying all questions would be answered by her husband. Salim, Qureshi’s husband, said they did not believe in “these report cards” and were confident they would win the election again for the work that they had done in the past years. Samadhan Sarvankar of the Shiv Sena, a first-time corporator from Prabhadevi, said he felt one of the reasons he was in the top three was that he not just raised civic issues but also ensured that these were solved. Corporators in the current BMC house were elected in 2017. Attendance of corporators in committee meetings dropped from 82.15% in 2017-2018 to 73.70% in 2019-20. “As citizens’ representatives, it is expected that corporators will raise questions with the municipal corporation about complaints made by citizens,” Praja Foundation director Milind Mhaske said. While the NGO analyses yearly performance of corporators, last year the Covid-19 pandemic arrived and Praja decided to bring out a consolidated report card which entails data covering the performance of councillors from 2017 to 2021. Though there are 227 corporators, the performance of only 220 was analysed as the mayors and some corporators who had not completed a certain period were not analysed. The report called for more meetings through the use of technology, greater coordination between stakeholders, and decentralisation of powers. “Now that BMC elections are around the corner, we need to understand how our current elected representatives have performed in the last term and this can act as an opportune moment to introspect on the performances,” Praja Foundation founder amd managing trustee Nitai Mehta said. Praja data showed that four more meetings per month were held during the pandemic months compared to the monthly average in previous years. In 2019-2020, the monthly average was 22 ward meetings, whereas when technology was used from October 2020 to March 2021, it went up to 26 meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-only-2-corporators-get-an-a-in-praja-performance-report/articleshow/85470547.cms||Richa Pinto

There is also a need to improve the quality of locally produced yarn for which manufacturing plants with latest technology are a must,” said Ashish Gujarati, president of SGCCI. Along with issues related to yarn, SGCCI is preparing a project report on development of a common facility centre for textile where manufacturers can be provided multiple facilities at one place. “In some cases, a small-scale unit owner does not have the financial capacity to install machines of the latest technology. CFC will have such machinery that can be used by unit owners,” Gujarati added.  SGCCI will also push for a specialized education hub for textile research. “We are preparing a report on textile university. All major textile centres in the world have high class education and research facilities for textiles. This will help us develop new technologies locally and we will not have to depend upon other countries,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/sgcci-to-raise-textile-industry-issues-with-centre/articleshow/85465417.cms||---

Police booked the councillor Manjur Salat, his brother Muddasar, mother Banu and sister Kausar Kadiya after Muddasar’s wife Mobina alleged that her husband was provoked by the trio on Wednesday morning. Based on Mobina’s complaint, an offence of attempt to murder, assault, cruelty and criminal intimidation was registered at Dabhoi police station on Wednesday late night. Mobina said that her husband had been harassing over demands of dowry. In 2016 too, she had lodged a case of cruelty and assault, but the couple had reached a settlement and started living together. Soon after, Muddasar again started harassing her and on Wednesday beat her up. A while later, after being allegedly provoked by his brother, mother and sister, Muddasar stabbed Mobina. She ran out of the house after the attack and was taken to a health centre in Dabhoi before being referred to SSG Hospital where she is currently recuperating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dabhoi-congress-councillor-kin-booked-for-assaulting-sister-in-law/articleshow/85466218.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Why practicing medical students being paid only 50% of stipend, U’khand HC asks state||Dehradun: Hearing a writ petition filed by 26 students pursuing Doctor of Medicine (MD) from Dr Susheela Tiwari Government Medical College in Haldwani, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday asked the state government why practising doctors, who are pursuing MD, are being paid only 50% of their stipend. The HC has asked senior officials of the health department, including health secretary, director of medical education and DG (health), to submit their reply and asked the respondents to file a counter-affidavit within four weeks. The students who filed the PIL are deputed in various community health centres as part of their course. They claimed that during the time of admission in 2019, they were promised a full stipend, but were given only half the amount. They subsequently approached HC with their grievance. In January 2020, the then-chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had announced full stipend for those pursuing MD course in state government colleges. After a few months, the stipend was restored, but according to the petitioners, the stipend was reduced to half again in January this year. The petitioners alleged the government has also made them sign a five-year bond of service in the state, but is hesitant in giving them full stipend. After hearing the petitioners’ statements, the division bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari and Justice Alok Kumar Verma asked the respondents, namely the state government officials, to reply within four weeks. Incidentally, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had last month announced that the stipend of MBBS interns in state medical colleges will be increased from Rs 7,500 to Rs 17,000 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/why-practicing-medical-students-being-paid-only-50-of-stipend-ukhand-hc-asks-state/articleshow/85465409.cms||Mohammad Anab

Malagatti was presented the D Devaraj Urs award at a ceremony organised by the Mysuru city unit of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, the State Backward Classes Forum and the Bharatiy Dalita Sahitya Academy as part of the birth anniversary celebrations of former chief minister D Devaraja Urs at Sahitya Vana in Mysuru. Hailing the contribution of Urs in empowering the vulnerable sections of society, Malagatti said, “He was the first politician who was vocal in expressing his views on the ills of the caste system, and work hard to ensure a united Karnataka.” Writer and rationalist KS Bhagawan, meanwhile, recalled Urs’s contribution in opening hostels for members of Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes, which helped promote education among their communities. “A large of SC/ST youngsters obtained degree during his tenure. In fact, Urs is believed to have been the first individual from Hunsur to have obtained a degree. He was a humble man, and even after he was elected as an MLA, continued his ancestral profession, which was agriculture,” Bhagawan said. Mysuru district Kannada Sahitya Parishat president YD Rajanna, State Backward Classes Forum president KS Shivaram, president of Karnataka state unit of Bharathiya Dalita Sahitya Academy C Venkatesh and former KSP president Maddikere Gopal were among those who participated in the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/politicians-must-empower-deprived-classes-says-malagatti/articleshow/85465689.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: How green is my lake! That sparkle hides a secret||NEW DELHI: The first phase of reviving Sanjay Van lake in south Delhi has been completed. The so-called floating rafters holding hormonally treated plants to extract excess pollutants from the water have done their work. A grid-based aeration system to enable bubble diffusion is now being installed to boost the level of dissolved oxygen in the water levels to catalyse the water purification process. An official overseeing the project said DJB had settled for a combination of wetland restoration system and aeration. “The waterbody falls under the Delhi Development Authority’s jurisdiction, but we are carrying out its rejuvenation under the City of Lakes project,” the official said. “There are five ponds in Sanjay Van and we selected this particular one because of its relatively high contamination level having received water from an untreated drain. This lake has a holding capacity of 149 million gallons per day of water.” The official disclosed that such interventions were also being made in the waterbodies at Jaffarpur Kalan, Nangloi, Rajokri and Sonia Vihar, while an aeration system had been installed in the Rani Khera lake. Delhi Jal Board proposes to revive and significantly improve the water quality at 50 sites at least by the yearend. The floating rafter technology, developed by CSIR-NEERI, employs hormone-treated species such as cyperus and canna to soak up pollutants. Each square rafter is made from PVC pipes and each is lined with geo-netting to support the plants. A blend of different plants is used on each float to increase the nutrient uptake from the water. These small floating islands in the lake are also being used by ducks for nesting. The official explained that aeration techniques to raise the dissolved oxygen levels have to be used in conjunction with floating rafters to enhance efficiency. “In the absence of such an aeration mechanism, only 10-12% of the desired purification is achieved,” the DJB official explained. “The roots of the plants provide the surface for bacteria to grow. Dissolved oxygen at 1-2 levels will be consumed by the oxidation process alone and constant aeration needs to be done to keep driving the process forward.” The number of rafters depends on the volume of water and the pollution load. DJB officials stated that the number of floating rafters employed in different waterbodies are 150 in Rani Khera, 294 in Jaffarpur Kalan A, 47 in Jaffarpur Kalan B, 401 in Nangloi, 597 in Sanjay Van and 1,375 in Sonia Vihar. DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha said that the board was working to realise the vision of Delhi becoming the City of Lakes. “We have successfully cleaned Sanjay Van lake and deployed floating rafters to enhance its water quality. This will not only beautify the lake, but also improve groundwater table,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-green-is-my-lake-that-sparkle-hides-a-secret/articleshow/85470590.cms||Paras Singh

The online donation platform is a collaboration between the district administration and private players. It will enable the administration, government officials, government agencies, NGOs, corporate houses, trade & industrial bodies, farmers and people from all walks of life work together for the benefit of Coimbatore. Any person, who is in need of support of any kind, can post a request. Several people have sought educational assistance, medical assistance and infrastructure support. “Many students from poor families struggle to buy mobile phones to attend online classes. Those in need should post their requirement in the column I Need Support. We will verify whether the requirements are genuine before donors can gift the required item,” said Sameeran. He handed over sewing machines to 15 women, mobile phones to 14 children who had lost their parents to the pandemic and appointment order to three women who lost their husbands to Covid-19. Namma Kovai WhatsApp group, created by Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore (Raac), Coimbatore for Tamil Nadu (C-4TN) and My City Clean City (MC3), was launched in 2016.

---||Vijayawada||Colleges contest online admission order in Andhra Pradesh HC||VIJAYAWADA: The Central Andhra Junior College Managements Association has moved the Andhra Pradesh high court challenging the online admission system announced by the state government for intermediate admissions. They contended the way the new system was introduced and sought relief from the high court by setting aside the same and allow them to conduct admissions as was done earlier. Arguing on behalf of the college association, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao told the high court that the new online admission system for intermediate was introduced arbitrarily and unilaterally by way of a press release without framing any rules or guidelines. He said that the sudden change in system is in contrary to Andhra Pradesh Intermediate Education and Andhra Pradesh Educational Institutions Regulation of Admission and Prohibition of Capitation Fee Act. Adinarayana Rao further argued that the high court had earlier allowed a similar petition by the managements of junior colleges when the state government tried to bring in a new admission system. The high court while allowing the petition also said that if the state government has to bring in a new system, it has to be done by framing proper rules and guidelines under the governing statutes.  The state government is again trying to bring in the new system without framing any guidelines and rules which is not only arbitrary and unilateral but also unreasonable and irrational with ulterior motives, the counsel for petitioners said. Arguing on behalf of the state government, senior counsel Dushyant Dave requested the high court for time to file a counter affidavit in the matter. Considering his request, Justice Ninala Jayasurya posted the matter for further hearing on next Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/colleges-contest-online-admission-order-in-hc/articleshow/85468150.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The boy, Aaryan Singhal, teaches elementary and middle school students fundamentals of computer science, game development and web development. He conducts two online sessions per day and has set up a campaign on a fundraising platform to raise $15 per student-hour generated through his programming classes. The teen has already raised $7000 (over Rs 5 lakh) from the initiative which has been donated to the Uttarakhand CM’s Covid Relief Fund. Speaking to TOI, the young teacher said that he started the project to help children at a time when the pandemic had hit their education adversely. “I empathise with the underprivileged. I am always looking for ways through which I can use my skills to reach out to people in need,” he said. One of his students, 13-year-old Mateo Maz Beltran, whom TOI contacted, said, “In today’s globalised and highly competitive world, coding skills have become necessary for the job market. Coding promotes both logical and creative thinking.” Beltran is a Class VII student from Colombia. Maryan Khan, a Class VI student who is also taking the online classes, added, “It was slightly challenging at first but I have now got the hang of it. Coding is really fun and you can create new games or apps with it using your imagination.” Meanwhile, the teenager’s parents, Gagan and Parul Singhal, said that they were proud of Aaryan’s commitment towards social causes. “It makes us proud that our son has committed himself to a social cause at such a young age. The dedication with which he has been sharing his knowledge with other children is commendable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/coding-for-covid-19-teen-raises-rs-5-lakh-for-cm-relief-fund-through-online-classes/articleshow/85465422.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Delhi||MHA recommends prelim inquiry by CBI into Delhi Transport Corporation bus deal||NEW DELHI: Not satisfied with the scope of probe or findings of the three-member committee that investigated the purchase and maintenance deals for 1,000 low-floor buses to be procured by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), the Union ministry of home affairs has recommended a preliminary inquiry by CBI into the matter. Sources indicated that DoPT, to which MHA wrote on August 16 seeking action for undertaking the CBI preliminary inquiry, may have already forwarded the relevant file to the investigating agency. A preliminary inquiry may or may not result in an FIR that shall warrant a fullfledged CBI investigation. BJP’s Delhi unit has alleged corruption in the low-floor bus deal, a charge strongly refuted earlier by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. Interestingly, Sisodia had, at a press conference last month, insisted that “a Centre-appointed committee has said there was no scam” and accused the opposition party of “misleading people”. TOI has now reliably learnt that the three-member committee set up by by the Government of NCT of Delhi — comprising ex-IAS officer O P Agarwal and two Delhi government officers, principal secretary (transport) Ashish Kundra and principal secretary (vigilance) K R Meena — had in its report concluded that there were indeed some procedural issues in the annual maintenance contract bid, although no criminality on part of DTC or any Delhi government official was established. The panel, incidentally, did not delve into the purchase bid while probing the low-floor bus deal, and is said to have totally focused on examining the annual maintenance bid floated by DTC separately. A source said the home ministry, upon studying the report of the inquiry committee forwarded to it by LG’s office, found it odd that it did not examine issues relating to purchase of the buses. The ministry is said to have concluded that there were more issues to be probed, including financial implications and procedural matters relating to both purchase and maintenance deals for the low-floor CNG buses, that failed to find mention in the findings of the committee. This is why, an officer told TOI, a preliminary inquiry by CBI was felt necessary. While the purchase contract for the low-floor, air-conditioned buses for DTC was for Rs 850 crore, the 12-year AMC was for Rs 3,412 crore. The purchase tender was awarded to JBM Auto and Tata Motors on a 70:30 ratio while JBM Auto had also emerged as the L1 bidder in the AMC tendering. The primary issue in the deal was DTC’s decision to split the bidding process by floating separate bids for purchase of buses and for their annual maintenance. Sources indicated that splitting of the contract may have led to monopoly pricing and cartelisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mha-recommends-prelim-inquiry-by-cbi-into-bus-deal/articleshow/85468155.cms||Bharti Jain

The ADG has ordered the police department to make announcements in areas where people fly kites in groups about the order and ensure a complete ban on the use of Chinese manjha. The order comes ahead of Raksha Bandhan when kite flying activity increases significantly and markets are flooded manjhas, including the banned Chinese manjha which is life-threatening. Several incidents were reported in the region where bikers were grievously injured by Chinese manjha. Five persons, including two RSS functionaries, were reported injured in the past three months, while a youth died in Rampur district in June. On August 15, LLB student Hari Om and his friend Anshu Kumar, a BA second-year student, were grievously injured on their way back home after attending an Independence Day function organised by the RSS. One Mohammed Shahbaz fell off the bike and sustained severe injuries after Chinese manjha slashed his throat in Kohadapeer area here in June. Despite a ban by the Allahabad high court, the sale of Chinese manjha is rampant in UP due to low price and better strength (durability) as compared to traditional manjhas. After several fatal accidents, UP Ppolice had seized consignments of Chinese manjha and arrested a few suppliers, but the sale of Chinese manjha continued. Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said, “A drive against the Chinese manjha has already been going on in the district. But, after receiving the order, we will now ensure necessary action is taken against those buying and selling or storing the banned manjha.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/adg-orders-fir-against-people-buying-selling-chinese-manjha-in-bareilly-zone/articleshow/85462458.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Accused let off 29 years after murder over doubtful proof||MUMBAI: Twenty-nine years after a Goregaon resident was murdered at home by inflicting 65 injuries with a chopper, an accused, now 58, has been acquitted with the sessions court observing that the possibility that the evidence was concocted cannot be ruled out. Suresh Jamsandekar, a Bhandup resident, had been absconding for nearly three decades and was arrested only this May. “On the basis of doubtful evidence, the court cannot come to the conclusion the guilt of the accused is proved beyond reasonable doubt,” said the court. Five other accused were acquitted in a separate trial in 2004. The court said the statement of admission of guilt of one accused, since acquitted, cannot be accepted as proof against the co-accused unless it is corroborated by other cogent evidence. “The story of the prosecution about the making of the memorandum statement by the accused Vijay (Jadhav) is itself doubtful and not accepted by this court,” said the court. It added that creating false evidence in the form of the statement created doubt about the integrity and bonafides of the prosecution. “I, therefore, feel that the benefit of doubt is to be given to the accused,” the court said. Rajendra Khade was found murdered in his flat on December 26, 1992, after the watchman found blood trickling out of the main door. He immediately informed the housing society officials and an FIR was lodged at Goregaon police station. Robbery was believed to be a motive, with gold ornaments belonging to the victim recovered from a gold shop. But the court found that invoices related to its purchase by the shop owner were “fishy”. “There were four articles of different weights and, so, it is not possible there could be five receipts of Rs 8,000 each. This creates doubt in accepting these documents to be genuine,” said the court. About 10 witnesses deposed during the trial. Among them were the watchman, the victim’s brother, jewellery shop employees, cops and medical officers. Interestingly, the brother told the court that his family did not want any of the victim’s properties. “I could clearly see the anguish on the face of the witness when he made that voluntary statement. The possibility is that the deceased must have had a criminal record, therefore, his brother does not want that property, possibly earned in an illegal manner,” said the court. It added that while passing order on disposal of the property, it will keep his wish in mind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-accused-let-off-29-yrs-after-murder-over-doubtful-proof/articleshow/85470614.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The department of personnel and training was requested by the ministry on August 16 to take necessary action to start an inquiry.Delhi cabinet in July 2019 decided to procure 1,000 CNG-run, low-floor buses for DTC. Last year, two separate tenders — one for the buses and another for annual maintenance.BJP MLA Vijender Gupta had alleged several irregularities and financial losses in the deal and following his complaint, a three-member inquiry committee was formed by the LG.“There is absolutely no truth to these allegations. A committee was already set up to investigate the matter thoroughly, which gave it a clean chit. This is a politically motivated conspiracy against the AAP,” Delhi government stated on Thursday.A statement by the government alleged that BJP wants to prevent Delhiites from getting new buses. “In the past too, the Centre has tried to harass Delhi government through CBI, but not even once has their attempt been successful because there has never been any truth to any of their allegations. Delhi government does not believe in the politics of slander, it only believes in good governance and is committed to delivering upon its promise of Good Governance,” it said.Delhi BJP president Adesh Kumar Gupta welcomed the home ministry’s recommendation of a preliminary inquiry by the CBI and said that the party had raised the issue and run a long agitation for scrapping of the deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allegations-false-its-a-politically-motivated-conspiracy-says-aap/articleshow/85468175.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Minor can seek pre-arrest bail as Juvenile Justice Board silent on it’||MUMBAI: In a significant order, a sessions court has clarified that while the Juvenile Justice Board apparently does not have any jurisdiction to grant protection from arrest, a child in conflict with law apprehending his detention by police is justified in invoking the jurisdiction of the court to protect his welfare. The court granted pre-arrest bail to a 16-year-old boy. The court said that in the present case, the minor, even if not apprehended or detained by police, is certainly entitled to seek protection under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. It was alleged that on July 4, the teenager mimicked a differently abled boy. The boy’s brother intervened and that led to an exchange of words. The teenager then allegedly called his family members. While the minor’s mother was accused of slapping one of them, the other family members assaulted them with a bamboo and iron bar. The informant managed to escape. However, his brother was allegedly assaulted by the family members and stabbed in the stomach. The informant said he managed to reach Wadala police station and lodge the FIR. “Considering the incident of which the applicant was a part, nothing is to be recovered from him nor is there any other ground to even justify denial of bail to him. In such circumstances, it shall be quite reasonable to gra-nt protection from arrest to him,” the court said. It added that the minor is not to tamper with the prosecution witnesses and evidence. Other adult accused named in the case were granted relief earlier. The victim’s family opposed the minor’s plea and submitted that no protection from arrest can be granted to the applicant and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act bars the jurisdiction of the sessions court on this aspect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minor-can-seek-pre-arrest-bail-as-juvenile-justice-board-silent-on-it/articleshow/85470712.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Environmental activist Vikrant Tongad, who filed the RTI, says each tree can fulfill the oxygen needs of around four people. Saplings planted for compensatory afforestation take several years before they grow into adult trees again. “The data fetched has a list of trees for which permission was given. However, a large number of trees are cut illegally for which there is no data available and hence, the actual impact on Delhi’s greenery would be much more,” said Tongad, stating the survival rate of saplings planted as part of compensatory plantation also needed to be monitored. While Tongad had filed his RTI application in 2018, he said he was able to receive the reply only on Wednesday. “This is the latest data provided by the Delhi government’s forest and wildlife department and pertains to the last five years,” said the activist. A senior forest and wildlife official said the figure of 15,000 trees was a conservative one for a city having a green cover of nearly 25 per cent. “Over five years, this figure is fairly low and largely includes permissions for projects wherein tree felling was inevitable. These are largely public projects for the larger benefit of the citizens of Delhi,” said the official, stating permission was given to several projects, including NHAI projects, NBCC projects and DMRC work. A five-member Supreme Court-appointed committee had earlier this year stated the value of a tree to be Rs 74,500 that increases with its age. This included the costs of generating oxygen and other benefits to the overall ecosystem. Trees over 100 years old were said to have an economical value of more than Rs 1 crore. The committee consisted of expert members Soham Pandya, B K Maji, Niranjita Mitra, N K Mukarji and Sunita Narain. According to the latest India State of Forest Report released in 2019, Delhi’s green cover stood at 21.9% (324 sqkm in area). In 2017, it stood at 20.6%, or 305.4 sqkm of the total area of Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/8-trees-felled-daily-on-avg-in-last-5-years-rti-reply/articleshow/85470626.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Missing’ man killed, wife held; body may be exhumed today||MUMBAI: Two months after a 35-year-old man from Kurla had been reported ‘missing’, his wife her sister have been detained, along with four other relatives, for allegedly killing him and burying the body near the airport. The corpse is likely to be exhumed on Friday, said sources in the police. No one had been arrested until the time of filing this report on Thursday evening. The man, Deepak Sangle, had been reported ‘missing’ in June. His sister had lodged a missing person’s complaint at Vinobha Bhave Nagar police station in Kurla. Sangle’s wife had also accompanied her sister-in-law at that time. Sangle had a few criminal cases registered against his name, said the police. The crime branch (unit 5) had started a parallel investigation in the case. Crime branch officials said they recently got a tip-off that Sangle did not get along too well with his wife and in-laws. The police scanned through his cellphone call details in order to trace the location he was last found at and calls made to him. From this, they also interrogated certain people known to him. Among these were Sangle’s wife, her sister and a few others who were questioned separately. The replies that they got had inconsistencies, said a police officer. When they further interrogated the wife, she admitted to having killed him along with her relatives. Sangle used to harass and threaten her over petty issues, said an officials. The police said that the wife informed them that he accused her of infidelity and often beat her up. Her family members too were fed up of the harassment and they hatched a conspiracy and killed him and buried the body close to the wall of the international terminal of the city airport, said an official. “We have detained some suspects and their interrogation is going on. Once it is clear how they murdered him and disposed of the body, we will arrest them,” said a senior police official. Officials of the crime branch said they handed over these suspects to Vinobha Bhave Nagar police station who were in the process of registering a murder case. Sources said that the police have intimated the officials of the state forensic science laboratory at Kalina and a team from the laboratory will accompany police officials to the scene of crime to exhume the body on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-missing-man-killed-wife-held-body-may-be-exhumed-today/articleshow/85470635.cms||Ahmed Ali

Sarangpur has been adopted by city MP Kirron Kher, while Khuda Lahora is situated near the choe.The civic body has given one month’s time to all the residents to divert their wastewater to sewage line or get ready for action that can even be disconnection of water supply. The MC will also rope in the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee in this exercise.“We have issued notices under the Water Prevention Act of 1974, asking the violators to ensure that their wastewater goes to the sewage line. Since the survey is going on, in the coming days more such notices will be issued to the violators, so that wastewater can be diverted to the sewage line and treated,” sources in the MC said.The move follows physical surveys of these villages. Thirteen villages were transferred to the municipal corporation around a couple of years back from the Chandigarh administration, the survey of remaining villages is still going on. “We will cover all the villages one by one and inspect them to check wastewater disposal. We are surprised that the UT administration did not bother about such things in the past,” sources said.Works allotted Since the MC has received dedicated funds for the development of 13 villages transferred from the administration, its engineering department has allotted majority of the works. Initially, the work of sewage, storm and water supply line worth Rs 50 crore has been allotted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-notice-to-200-houses-in-sarangpur-khuda-lahora/articleshow/85470627.cms||Deepak Yadav

Forest department officials are of the view that the five lionesses have been caught for health monitoring reasons, given the large number of deaths in the region in last few months. “There have been 45 lion deaths since January this year in Gir East and Shretunjay division and we have captured the five lions for health monitoring purpose,” said a senior forest department official. In January this year, eight lions captured from Jetpur area, were kept confined for a month without any proper reason before they were released following uproar by the lion activists. The wildlife lovers and locals fear that a similar treatment could be meted out to these big wild cats. The five lionesses, including three adults and two sub-adults, were caught from the Pipavav port area on Wednesday night and the port authorities had recently written to the forest department to relocate lions from the area, said government sources. “The five lions caught are part of the same pride whose video of moving around the port had gone viral recently,” sources further said. Congress MLA Amrish Der from Rajula constituency said that some locals informed him on Wednesday about the forest department having set up five cage traps to capture lions. “We have spoken to the government officials but there seems to be no clarity if these lions will be released back in the area from where they are caught,” said Der. The chief wildlife warden had on July 7 issued a written directive for monitoring the health of lions in Pipavav port area, said sources. The five lions have been taken to the Jasadhar animal rescue centre. D T Vasavada, chief conservator of forest (wildlife circle) told TOI, “We have captured the lions for health check-up following reports of deaths in the area. We will release them once all the reports are confirmed negative. We have examined ocularly and didn’t find any issue with their health, but we will want to be sure.” “We want our lions back else we will launch a widespread protest,” said Pratap Bepariya, sarpanch of Uchadiya village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/locals-fear-lion-relocation-as-5-big-cats-caught-for-check-up/articleshow/85472846.cms||---

---||Shillong||Shillong peaceful, overall normalcy in daily life||SHILLONG: The state capital remained peaceful as overall normalcy prevailed in day-to-day life with extension in the curfew relaxation period, restoration of mobile internet services and business back to average. There has been no report of any law and order situation in the city or its suburbs with people going about their essential daily chores, prompting the administration to further extend curfew relaxation by one more hour on Friday. “Based on the present situation, it is deemed appropriate to continue with partial lifting of curfew on the 20th August, 2021,” said district magistrate Isawanda Laloo in her order on Thursday, announcing relaxation of curfew in the Shillong Agglomeration from 5 am to 6 pm on August 20. Opening of essential and non-essential shops will be allowed till 5 pm on Friday before the curfew is re-imposed from 6 pm till 5 am of August 21, the order said, while underlining that any kind of gathering, public meeting or rally is not permitted. Curfew, which was imposed in the whole of the Shillong Urban Agglomeration from the night of Independence Day in the wake of violent protests following the death of former Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) general secretary Cheristerfield Thangkhiew in police firing during a raid on his residence on August 13, was relaxed for 13 hours from 5 am to 5 pm on Thursday. “It is a great relief for us to be back to business as we were faced with uncertainty as curfew had been imposed,” said a vegetable vendor from the nearby Smit village who has been been selling locally produced vegetables. Meghalaya Human Rights Commission (MHRC) chairperson Justice (retired) T Vaiphei will head the judicial inquiry into the killing of the surrendered militant leader, as announced by chief minister Conrad K Sangma on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/shillong-peaceful-overall-normalcy-in-daily-life/articleshow/85468203.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Mansukh Mandaviya reaches out to Patidars during Rajkot yatra||RAJKOT: The Jan Ashirwad Yatra of senior BJP leader Mansukh Mandaviya in Rajkot on Thursday assumed political hues with the recently appointed union health minister reaching out to electorally important Patidars. On his maiden visit to Gujarat after assuming the key portfolio, Mandaviya aggressively advocated the cause of Patidar representation in state and central governance, more than the yatra’s primary agenda of ‘exposing’ the opposition for stalling the monsoon session of Parliament. In the meeting held during his Yatra on Thursday with Patidar leaders in an auditorium, Mandaviya said that ‘BJP and Patidars are one’. When asked to elaborate on his statement in a press conference later, he said, “The relationship between Patidar community and the BJP is like the umbilical cord and navel. The community remained with the party in the past and will be in the future too.” Mandaviya also visited Khodaldham temple, the apex religious body of Leuva Patels, about 65 km from Rajkot in Kagvad, where he addressed a gathering of Patidar leaders. “It’s the first time after Independence that two Cabinet berths in Modi’s council of ministers were allotted to Patidars,” said the minister who asserted that the community has given many MLAs, ministers and chief ministers in the state. Mandaviya also recalled former Patidar chief ministers of the BJP government, late Keshubhai Patel and Anandiben Patel. “For Anandiben, on one hand there was the community and on the other, there was Constitutional duty. She chose her duty over community,” said Mandaviya, without naming the 2015 Patidar agitation. “MPs Mahendra Munjpara and Darshana Jardosh who hail from smaller communities also got representation in Modi’s cabinet. Eleven women and youth have also got ministerial berths,” said Mandaviya, while hailing Modi government’s inclusive growth and the equal importance all communities gets here. Naresh Patel, head of Khodaldham temple trust, said, “Patidar is a big community. There are community members in Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress too.” In a meeting of Leuva and Kadva Patidars held in Khodaldham in June had openly voiced his desire that the next chief minister should be from their community. Patel had then also added that the Patidars are under-represented in the government. When asked to comment on Mandaviya’s statement about BJP and Patidar, Patel on Thursday termed it as the minister’s personal opinion. Expressing his satisfaction that two Patidars got Cabinet berths, Patel, however, skirted a query on their ‘Patidar chief minister’ demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mandaviya-reaches-out-to-patidars-during-rajkot-yatra/articleshow/85465474.cms||---

From 2019, the state government had marked his birthday as a state holiday like other famous personalities to make the date a significant one for Tripura, Deb said. “We have renamed Agartala airport after Bir Bikram who had built it in 1942, which played a crucial role in World War II against the British.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/tripura-leaders-pay-tribute-to-last-king-on-113th-birth-anniversary/articleshow/85468191.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: IIEST Shibpur collects rain water to recharge aquifer on campus||KOLKATA: Scientists at IIEST Shibpur have started collecting rain water on the rooftop, filtering it through a plant that they have constructed and recharging an underground aquifer that contains drinking water. IIEST is the first central institute to start such an underground water recharge project under the Prime Minister’s Jal Shakti Abhiyan. The project was commissioned this week. Researchers studied the underground water table and found that the aquifer — the water of which is as pure as of drinking quality — is 260-feet below the surface. Faculty and researchers of the civil engineering department, who have formed the Institute Works Department, laid down pipelines that would take rain water from a surface pool directly to the aquifer. The entire 6,000 square feet space on the rooftop of the science and technology building was cleared up for the project. Special pipes were fitted to collect the rain water from the roof to a pool below. “We let roof be cleaned with rain and prevented the dirty water from flowing into the pool. When the roof was cleaned, the key was opened so that the water could collect in the pool,” said Tapas Kumar Roy, faculty of civil engineering, who headed the project. The faculty members think such rainwater recharging project can solve water crisis in the city. The Howrah Municipal Corporation’s commissioner, D Jain, said he will be happy to explore the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iiest-collects-rain-water-to-recharge-aquifer-on-campus/articleshow/85468250.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bail for doc who ‘forged’ hubby’s sign on IVF form||Mumbai: A sessions court granted anticipatory bail to a 37-year-old doctor who was accused of forging her estranged husband’s signature on an IVF consent form. The woman gave birth to twins prematurely but both died. The woman had claimed that her husband lodged a false complaint to avoid paying alimony. According to the investigating officer, her custodial interrogation was required only in respect of the children. The court, however, said the death certificate and medical reports are on record, so proper investigation can be conducted without custodial interrogation. The court said that while the husband stated that he did know about the 2019 pregnancy, the FIR was lodged in April 2021. The court said the delay was not explained. “The bail cannot be rejected only because she is residing presently in Uttar Pradesh. She is a lady and doctor. Considering these facts and circumstances, it would be just and proper to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant,” the court said. The woman had told court that a co-accused was granted bail earlier by Bombay high court. Imposing conditions, the court said the woman had to visit the police station everyday between 10am-1pm for eight days, and thereafter, when required by the investigating officer. “The applicant shall co-operate in the investigation and shall not tamper with evidence,” the court said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-for-doc-who-forged-hubbys-sign-on-ivf-form/articleshow/85470688.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary ESZ: Ministry says pursuing matter with states||CHANDIGARH: In response to UT administration’s letter, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) stated that it is pursuing the matter to expedite the process of notifying eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary for the area falling in Punjab and Haryana. Recently, the UT administration had urged the ministry to take up the matter with Punjab and Haryana. In 2017, the UT administration had notified to leave a 2-to-2.75-kilometre radius from the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary as eco-sensitive zone. UT’s chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai, in a recent letter to the ministry, had requested expedition of the ESZ notification for the area falling in Punjab and Haryana. UT had also reiterated that 90% area falls in Punjab and Haryana, therefore to protect the entire sanctuary, it was important to notify ESZ immediately. Recently, UT adviser Dharam Pal had directed the UT forest and wildlife department officials to take up the matter afresh with the Union government. Last year too, in a meeting convened by the MoEFCC’s Wildlife Division, the UT administration had asked for declaring ESZ around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary at the earliest. The ministry has issued final notification on ESZ around the sanctuary for Chandigarh alone, while Punjab and Haryana to date have not declared the zones in their respective territories. The UT is pushing that Punjab and Haryana should also follow in its footsteps. The Chandigarh administration had in the past too urged the two states to regulate human activities in the catchment area as the Supreme Court had also upheld that huge construction should not be allowed close to the sanctuary. In December 2019, the UT had urged the ministry to expedite the ESZ process. Haryana had recently planned to declare areas ranging from 1 to 1.5 km as ESZ and also sought comments from the department concerned. The UT administration has already opposed the Punjab government’s proposal to declare only a 100m ESZ on its side. IN THE PAST On January 25, 2017, the Union ministry had issued the ESZ notification for Chandigarh. On September 17, 2015, the ministry had issued a draft notification only for the sanctuary area that fell under UT and not for the section that came under Punjab and Haryana. Thereafter, the UT had submitted its objections, urging the ministry to issue a notification for the entire ESZ to protect the sanctuary, whose 90% area fell under the jurisdiction of Punjab and Haryana. Turning down its demand, the ministry declared ESZ only for Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhna-wildlife-sanctuary-esz-ministry-says-pursuing-matter-with-states/articleshow/85470676.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

According to a notification issued by Delhi environment department, 4,365 trees will be transplanted for the project, while 2,314 trees will have to be felled. Under the project, three highways will intersect across north, south and western part of the capital, with five stretches, including the NH-I intersection to Karala-Kanjhawala Road, Karala-Kanjhawala to Nangloi-Najafgarh Road, Nangloi-Najafgarh Road to Sector-24, Dwarka, Spur to Sonipat bypass and Spur to Bahadurgarh bypass. For the project, Delhi government has allocated 36.45 hectares, while NHAI has been asked to deposit Rs 38.07 crore to deputy conservator of forest (West) for carrying out compensatory plantation and maintaining them for seven years. “A notification for the project has been issued and 10 saplings will be planted for every tree felled or being transplanted. This means a total of 66,790 saplings will now be planted,” said Navneet Srivastava, DCF (West). For compensatory afforestation, native species, such as neem, peepal, amalta, gular, sheesham and Arjun, have been chosen, which will be planted in locations, such as Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park, Kamla Nehru Ridge and the Yamuna floodplain. The transplantation of 4,365 trees will be done by NHAI “within the project site at vacant area UER-II (Package-I to V) along the road proposed to be constructed with their own funds”, the notification read. In October 2020, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that Delhi government had approved the draft tree transplantation policy, which makes it mandatory for 80% of the trees being felled for any development project to be transplanted elsewhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-gives-nod-to-cut-transplant-6600-to-make-way-for-nhai-project/articleshow/85470668.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

SSP Anand rushed to Shahjahanpur’s Jahanabad Khamariya village soon after the incident. The accused are notorious hooch manufacturers and were caught twice on the complaints of Sunil Kashyap, a police source said. Recently, on the basis of information provided by Sunil and his elder brother Santram Kashyap, local police had raided the house of the accused, Ramladete Kashyap, and seized a consignment of illicit liquor. The family of Sunil alleged that someone from the police station tipped the accused about them. On Thursday, Ramladete and his six sons barged into the house of Sunil and Santram. They first grabbed Sunil and started beating him with rods. His brother Santram and his daughter, 15, were also brutally attacked. While Sunil died, the other two were taken to hospital in a serious condition. The girl has serious injuries on her chest and her clothes were also torn asunder. The accused are on the run and three police teams have been pressed into action to arrest them, SSP Anand said. Station house officer (SHO) of Kalaan police station, Dharmendra Kumar, told TOI, “The accused have been booked on multiple occasions while manufacturing and selling spurious liquor.

Despite seeing her colleague, Yogita Vartak (34), lying in a pool of blood and being grievously injured herself, the plucky cashier, Shraddha Devrukhkar (32), who had passed out for a few minutes, pressed the security alarm. Dubey (35), who had filled his bags with cash and gold worth over Rs 3 crore after assaulting the two women staffers, was taken by surprise when she rushed towards the main door and screamed for help. In her statement to Virar police, Devrukhkar, who was recently discharged from hospital, recounted the July 29 ordeal. Devrukhkar said that on July 29, Vartak had requested her to stay back. Around 8pm, she heard the sound of a chair crashing. She ran to Vartak’s cabin and saw her in a pool of blood and Dubey holding a razor. He charged towards Devrukhkar and slashed her on the head, neck and chest. As she collapsed on the floor, with around 17 injuries, Dubey headed towards the locker, she told the police. When Devrukhkar regained consciousness, she pressed the security alarm and ran towards the main door, which was locked from inside. She said that Dubey tried to grab her, but she managed to open the door and scream for help. Dubey, who was trying to flee with the loot, was nabbed by passersby, who also rushed Devrukhkar to hospital in an autorickshaw. Devrukhkar, who has been working in the Virar branch since 2017, told the police that Dubey used to often borrow money from colleagues. Dubey worked in the Virar branch till August 2020, before joining the Naigaon branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/virar-bank-robber-presumed-i-was-dead-too-cashier/articleshow/85470757.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Coimbatore||Palaniswami fears Kodanad case probe: Mutharasan||CPI state secretary R Mutharasan alleged that former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami fears Kodanad heist and murder case probe.Talking to reporters in the city on Thursday, Mutharasan questioned the rationale behind the sudden panicking of EPS after one of the accused Sayan was re-investigated recently. “If he has nothing to worry, he could have ignored the fresh inquiry with one of the accused,’’ Mutharasan said.Mutharasan said that the probe so far has indicated that all those arrested in the case were only henchmen. “They did not carry out the heist and murder at Kodanad bungalow on their own,’’ he said.Mutharasan said CPI would hold ‘People’s Parliament’ in 5,000 places across Tamil Nadu from August 23 to 27 in a symbolic protest against the functioning of the Centre. “The People’s Parliament would be akin to the actual Parliament where there would be speaker and ministers. Resolutions passed at these parliaments would be sent to the Centre,’’ he said.This apart, CPI would also print 5 lakh booklets on the alleged malfunctioning of the Centre and sell them at a cost of Rs 5 to the public. He said 25 bills were passed in Parliament without any debate or discussion. “From farmers protest to Pegasus snooping scandal, nothing was discussed in Parliament,’’ he charged.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/palaniswami-fears-kodanad-case-probe-mutharasan/articleshow/85470709.cms||---

Hospital officials said they were able to save Syed Nadipi Peera’s life by conducting an advanced bronchoscopy treatment. Peera was suffering from continuous cough and respiratory problems for the past few months. About three months ago, he was having chicken kebab at lunch when he had a seizure, and the chicken bone went into his lungs. Despite visiting multiple doctors, the issue couldn’t be diagnosed. Finally, a CT scan was done which showed a bone stuck in his left lung. The bone blocking the lung had led to pneumonia and it had to be removed immediately. Following a 40-minute procedure with advanced fiber-optic bronchoscopy treatment, hospital consultant and interventional pulmonologist Dr Kona Muralidhara Reddy managed to extract the bone safely. “Cases of external substances going into the lungs are common in children less than 5 years. Only 1/4th of cases we see in adults. People with under-treated seizures (fits), neurological problems with poor swallowing ability, and the habit of keeping clone or beetle nuts in the mouth are more prone to such types of problems,” Dr Reddy explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/chicken-bone-stuck-in-lung-removed/articleshow/85468289.cms||---

The malaria department teams of AMC’s seven zones checked 511 commercial and construction sites and found major breeding sites at 57 of them. Total Rs 6.7 lakh in fines was collected as administrative charges from the buildings where mosquito breeding sites were found. As many as 348 of these 511 sites checked were given notices. The highest fines were collected from commercial buildings located in areas falling in the East zone of the city, Rs 1,98,000, followed by Rs 1,54,500 from the West zone and Rs 1,01,000 from the South zone. Among the fined commercial buildings, Pancham Mall in Nikol was fined the largest amount of Rs 50,000, followed by Rs, 25,000 each from Home Town and Signature Complex in Thaltej. These commercial establishments include automobile showrooms and workshops, shopping malls, complexes housing offices and factories. “These are the places where people go to work and also for shopping every day. Daily footfalls at these establishments are large in number. People may keep their residential places clean and mosquito-free but they are exposed to diseases like chikungunya and dengue when they visit such commercial establishments,” said a senior official with health department, AMC. He said that it is impossible for the civic body’s staff to keep these premises clean and mosquito-free as this is the duty of the managements of these establishments who are careless about keeping the premises clean. “We found mosquito breeding sites on terraces, in flowerpots, in overhead and underground water tanks, elevator pits, scrap materials lying on the backyards, basements and in some cases even in refrigerator trays,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/57-buildings-fined-for-mosquito-breeding-sites/articleshow/85470949.cms||---

---||Delhi||History repeats itself as railways allots upper berth to wheelchair-bound athlete-activist Suvarna Raj||NEW DELHI: Wheelchair-bound para-athlete and social worker Suvarna Raj booked a train ticket to Nagpur under the disabled quota on Wednesday. To her shock, she found a bitter episode of her past playing itself out once again. The ticket she got on the Delhi-Visakhapatnam Special had an upper berth reserved, exactly like four years ago. And as in 2017, this time too she claimed to have clearly mentioned she was a person with disability (PwD) when booking the ticket but had been allotted an impossible top berth by the rail system. Raj said she eventually exchanged seats with a senior citizen, who too struggled to climb up to the top berth. The para-athlete suffers from 90% immobility of the lower limbs owing to a polio infection during childhood. “In the four years since I faced a similar issue and assurances were given by the then railway minister, Suresh Prabhu, it seems nothing has changed and PwDs still have to struggle for accessibility,” Raj told TOI. TimesViewThe Railways should not only offer an unqualified apology to the victim but also take immediate steps to ensure that such errors aren’t repeated. A simple technology-based solution can permanently rectify this recurring problem.In June 2017, Raj had faced such an ordeal on a Nagpur-Delhi train. After being allotted the upper berth, she had approached the travelling ticket examiner, but was told the coach was full and no alternative berths were available. Just months later in September, she again found she hadn’t been given the lower seat as appropriate for her PwD status. On Wednesday, she boarded a train going to Nagpur to find that she had allotted an upper berth despite booking under the disabled quota. “In 2017, I had to travel sitting on the wet floor of the coach with my son,” she said. “This year, with the TTE not helpful at all, I had to exchange my seat with a fellow passenger. I hadn’t expected problems like these to occur again after all these years.” She rued this lack of compassion for travellers with disabilities. When contacted, a railway official claimed that seat allocation was done by Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), with the Railways having no role in the allotment process. An IRCTC official told TOI that while the system has been fed information to automatically allot a lower berth if someone booked under the Divyang option, an upper berth was provided whenever all lower berths were already allotted. “This has not been done deliberately or to cause any inconvenience,” said the official. “The software has to allot a berth but if all lower berths are occupied, it has no option but to reserve an upper berth. In such cases, officials on board the train have been instructed to get the said seats adjusted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/history-repeats-itself-as-railways-allots-upper-berth-to-wheelchair-bound-athlete-activist/articleshow/85468396.cms||---

Speaking to reporters after inaugurating Rajiv Marathon to mark the former PM’s 77th birth anniversary, he Srinivas recalled the Congress leaders’ contribution to the growth of India. According to him, Ravi is making such statements to appease Prime Miister Modi, home minister Amit Shah and RSS top brass. “Ravi aspires to become a minister again. He believes that if he speaks against the Nehru-Gandhi family, he will be rewarded with a ministerial post. He should not speak about the Nehru-Gandhi family without reading history,” he said. In Mysuru, KPCC spokesperson M Lakshmana criticised Mysuru MP Pratap Simha for claiming that the 10-lane Bangalore-Mysuru national highway was sanctioned during the BJP rule. He told reporters the then public works minister H C Mahadevappa had sent the proposal on upgrading the highway, including two service roads, in 2014 when Siddaramaiah was the chief minister. “There are records to prove that the then Union minister Oscar Fernandez had initiated the project,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cong-youth-chief-condemns-ravis-statements-on-nehru-gandhi-family/articleshow/85465454.cms||---

In the Covid-19 pandemic situation, the school had continued the online education for primary classes in the interest of students’ education, it said. “This had been communicated to the concerned authorities. You are aware that the school has not collected any fees for the current academic year. The school meanwhile was awaiting recognition. The order received today, does not point out any deficiency and confirms that the school meets all necessary requirements and supporting documents for the same have been submitted,” the school principal said in its letter dated August 18 addressed to the parents. “But, the efforts of the school to remain operational in the interest of the students were not considered. The school is considering going for appeal against the order. We hope that the dept. takes the requisite steps towards your child’s education and helps with enrollments in your preferred school,” it further stated. The director of primary education (DPE) on Wednesday rejected the school’s application to start English medium classes for Classes 6-8. The DPE has also warned the school management – Calorx Management and Research Foundation of facing penalty of Rs 1 lakh and a daily fine of Rs 10,000 if the school is run illegally without getting the mandatory clearance from the government authorities. In the letter to the parents, the school management has asked parents to apply for school leaving certificates for their children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dps-east-may-fight-dpes-closure-order/articleshow/85470939.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Ponduru Jamdani sari variety may fade into memories soon||VISAKHAPATNAM: Popular Ponduru Jamdani saris may soon fade into memories. The specially designed saris are still in high demand in country and abroad. but there is just one weaver left in Ponduru of Srikakulam district who knows how to weave the variety. The weavers’ community feels that soon the popular sari brand will vanish as the younger generation of weavers has no skill needed to weave Jamdani saris. Ponduru is renowned for its long, unbroken tradition of making fine khadi. Ponduru khadi had made its mark during the freedom movement and became the favourite handmade garment of Mahatma Gandhi. There are around 100 weavers in Ponduru but many are struggling to meet both ends meet. Except for a couple of weavers, others can weave only dhotis, shirtings and towels. They are engaged by Andhra Fine Khadi Karmikabhivruddhi Sangham (AFKKS) of Ponduru. It is affiliated to Mumbai-based Khadi and Village Industries Commission which manages the weaving and marketing activities of Ponduru khadi. Speaking to TOI, president and secretary of AFKKS, GK Prasad and DV Ramana respectively, said they had around 10 to 12 designers for Jamdani around two decades ago. But only three are left now. Among them, two have given up the profession on health grounds. Now, only M Hemasundara Rao, who is around 60 years of age, knows the art of designing Jamdani sari, they added. “I have been in the weaving profession for more than four decades. But my son M Pydiraju didn’t take up the art citing hard work and poor returns. He is working in a private firm. Similarly, my daughter didn’t want this profession. It’s clear that I am the last man standing for Jamdani sari. Probably, the art will end with me,” Hemasundara Rao rued. Weaving Jamdani sari is not an easy task. It takes at least 30 days to weave one. I can’t weave more than 10 Jamdani saris in a year. Most of the customers are rich people from Gujarat and parts of Andhra Pradesh. Price of the sari ranges between Rs 13,000 and Rs 25,000, Rao added. Though there is demand for the Jamdani sari among the rich families, the AFKKS is not able to accept orders citing the lack of skilled manpower to do the job. The number of weavers in the region may go down further in the coming years as the younger generation is not interested in the profession due to the poor returns, weavers said. In another couple of years, AFKKS may stop production of Jamdani saris as Hemasundara Rao will call it a day. AFKKS members said only red cotton and hill cotton varieties, grown in and around Ponduru region, and the Punasa cotton, grown around Gollaprolu in East Godavari district, are used to weave Ponduru khadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jamdani-sari-variety-may-fade-into-memories-soon/articleshow/85468415.cms||Nalla.Babu

Rejecting the bail pleas of Bilal Shaikh (25) and Mohammed Khan (27), the court said that the offence is serious. “The specific allegation against the accused that while he was accused in another case, he prepared fake and forged documents — an identity card, rubber seal of government officials and rationing officer and also salary slip,” the court said. It also said that the accused did not stop at preparing the documents but also used them during the court proceedings too. “Therefore, considering the seriousness of the offence, involvement of the accused and the fact that the investigation is in progress, I find that the accused is not entitled for bail,” the court said. The accused had been previously booked in a case of cheating. The prosecution submitted that to get bail in that case, the accused cheated the court. It was also alleged that during investigation, the police found that the accused produced duplicate documents. It is also contended that the accused produced false sureties and false documents and accordingly, FIR was registered against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-denied-to-two-accused-who-gave-fake-docus-in-court/articleshow/85470800.cms||---

Rummaging about his bag for a cell phone, Rahimudur Hasanzai of Kabul dials home. Not just Hasanzai, Nabi Marufi of Jowzjan province, Shareefullah Daulatzai from Nangarhar and Mujahid Shegewar from Paktia province of Afghanistan are on tenterhooks after the Taliban takeover. These Afghan students, who have completed their post-graduation in agriculture sciences, receive scholarships under the Indo-Afghan fellowship programme. Now, uncertainty stalks these youths. It’s not just the volatile situation in their country, but the fate of the scholarship programme hangs in balance. Talking to TOI, Nabi Marufi said, “We feel secure in India and desperately want to bring our families here. We are tormented by round-the-clock updates on turmoil back home and spend sleepless nights worrying about our families. Also, we don’t know whether the fellowship programme will be scrapped by the Taliban. There’s no working government in Kabul and we fear Afghanistan could sink into civil war.” But they are all praise for the varsity for their unflinching support in trying times. Dean of students’ welfare, Narendra Dev University of Agriculture and Technology, Dr Debashish Niyogi, has been regularly conversing with Afghan students and assuring them of all help and cooperation even if their fellowship programme is scrapped by the new government. Talking to TOI, Niyogi said, “We are taking care of them and assuaging their fears. The university staff and students have expressed solidarity with the Afghan students and have assured them of moral and financial help. We also told them that we would arrange for their return after the situation normalises in Afghanistan.” Mujahid Shegewar from Paktia province, who’s pursuing a doctorate in fruit technology, said, “I stay on the campus with my wife and two sons. We are grateful to the dean and the varsity staff for taking care of us in crisis.” Shareefullah Daulatzai, who is pursuing MSc in agriculture science, said, “I feel at home here, but constantly worry about my wife and two children . I want settle down in India with family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/afghan-students-on-edge-fear-talibs-could-scrap-fellowship-programmes/articleshow/85472968.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh generated maximum 74,693 kg Covid biomedical waste in May||CHANDIGARH: The city generated maximum biomedical Covid-19 waste in May this year, which is 74,693 kg. The UT administration has submitted a report for a period of 16 months (April 2020 to July 2021) to the Centre on the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). As per the report, this year’s May was followed by last year’s September and August with 73,746 kg and 70,793 kg waste generated, respectively. The city produced Covid biomedical waste from top three medical institutes, including PGI, GMCH-32, GMSH-16, and other civil hospitals, quarantine centres and the municipal corporation. Last year in April and May, the UT administration had prepared Covid-19-related report for the first time. Earlier, the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) had written to institutes to submit a weekly report on how they managed Covid-19 biomedical waste, such as used gloves, masks, and protective suits. The CPCC had written to the civic body, PGIMER, GMSH-16 and GMCH-32 for these procedural details. The committee’s queries were based on guidelines from the Central Pollution Control Board and orders from the NGT. In the last year’s order, the NGT had observed that dumping Covid-19 waste in general bins or sewerage without safeguards was hazardous. It recommended using best practices and new ideas under supervision, besides compiling data from all sources to prevent accidental spill and aid strategic planning. The order asked for educating waste handlers, staff, and citizens about the precautions they must take, and demanded a local model plan. The green court told the Central Pollution Control Board to coordinate with the media and Central and state departments for the purpose. The NGT had also directed the UT administration to ensure scientific storage, transport, handling, management, and disposal of Covid-19 waste and submit a report on its compliance with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016. At present, there is one incinerator in the city operated by Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility (BWTF) and has a capacity of 200 kg/hour. All the waste from private and government hospitals is collected and treated by BWTF, which is provided by the Alliance Envirocare Company Pvt Ltd located in Industrial Area, Phase I, Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-generated-maximum-74k-kg-covid-biomedical-waste-in-may/articleshow/85470782.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Delhi||New frog species named after hills of Arunachal||NEW DELHI: A new frog species (Amolops adicola) discovered in Arunachal Pradesh by researchers has been named after Adi hills, which are home to Adi tribes, an indigenous group of people from the Himalayan regions of the state. A team of Indian and American biologists from the Wildlife Institute of India, University of Delhi and North Carolina Museum of Natural Science (USA) discovered the new species of cascade frog from the Adi hills. Historically, this region was also known as Abor Hills. The biologists were investigating a group of medium to large cascade frogs from Northeast India for the last five years. Cascade frogs are named so because of their preference for small waterfalls or cascades in flowing hill streams. The frogs scientifically belong to the genus Amolops. The genus is one of the largest groups of ranid frogs of family Ranidae, with currently 73 known species widely distributed across Northeast and North India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, through Indochina, to Malaya Peninsula. The new species was identified based on multiple criteria, such as external morphology, DNA and calling pattern. The study also resolved century-old taxonomic confusions surrounding the identity of another cascade frog species, Amolops monticola, which was described from the Sikkim Himalayas 150 years ago. These discoveries have important implications on the taxonomy and geographical distribution of several other members of this group found in India and the neighbouring regions of China. The findings were published in a scientific article titled, “Phylogenetic position of the poorly known montane cascade frog Amolops monticola (Ranidae) and description of a new closely related species from Northeast India”, in the Journal of Natural History, London. “This study is testament to how little is known about frogs, the most threatened animal groups in northeastern India,” said professor S D Biju of University of Delhi, the corresponding author of the article. “Many frogs in this region are reported to occur widely, but, in fact, have relatively small geographical ranges and require special attention for conservation before they go extinct forever. Northeast India is a treasure house of species still unknown to science.” Abhijit Das, from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun said the new species was discovered while revisiting the century-old Adi expedition in 2018. “It was named after the land of Adi tribe in Arunachal Pradesh where this species dwells, particularly during the post-monsoon season,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-frog-species-named-after-hills-of-arunachal/articleshow/85468452.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

While more than 34 lakh people have received both doses, out of the 1.5 crore Delhiites who are eligible for vaccination, 86.8 lakh have received at least one dose. In all, 1,21,15,909 doses were administered till 8pm on Thursday, including 86,86,338 first doses and 34,29,571 second doses. Out of these, the highest number of doses, 64,37,313, had been given to those in the 18-44 years category, which was 53.1% of the total vaccination. Although those above 45 years have received 46.8% of all vaccine doses, it has to be kept in mind that 92 lakh people in the 18-44 years category were the last to become eligible for inoculation from May 3. Also, vaccination drives for this age group closed for more than once in May and June due to vaccine shortage, while those eligible for their second dose were given priority. Despite all these factors, 69.9% of people in the 18-44 age group received at least one dose. In comparison, those aged 60 and above have received 20,62,970 vaccine doses, which is 17% of total inoculation, and those in the 45-59 years category have been given 36,15,626 doses, which is nearly 30% of all doses administered.

---||Delhi||Creating a talent pool: Delhi University offers fellowship for focused research||NEW DELHI: Delhi University’s Institute of Eminence (IoE) is working on creating a pool of talent that will help catalyse research in the university. The pool will have postdoctoral fellows, both from India and abroad, who will work on topics like climate change and sustainability, public health, public policy and governance, transnational affairs, and skill enhancement and entrepreneurship development. The Maharishi Kanad postdoctoral fellowship will be offered to scholars with excellent publication record. Elaborating on the title, M K Pandit, CEO of IoE, said, “Maharishi Kanad is supposed to have spoken about the centrality of physics much before Germans and others. The name has been chosen to honour him.” The last day to submit application is August 23. There are sub-themes within each broad topic. For instance, for climate change and sustainability, there are six positions with sub-themes such as ocean-atmosphere interactions, climate change and water resources sustainability, and human health impacts of climate change. Public health also has six positions with sub-themes such as social issues in public health and public health epidemiology. For public policy and governance, and transnational affairs, there are five positions. Skill enhancement and entrepreneurship development have three positions with sub-themes such as technologies and policies for drug discovery and development, and intellectual property right laws. “The idea behind calling research scholars with good publication record is to enhance the publication profile of the university. Our aim is to create a pool of 70-100 such scholars. A good track record in terms of publication will be the sole criterion to get the fellowship,” said Pandit. The fellows will be given a grant of Rs 1 lakh per month. IoE will also provide them an annual research grant of up to Rs 2 lakh in the science stream and up to Rs 1 lakh for humanities, social sciences, law, management, etc. The duration of the fellowship, a full-time position, will be initially two years, which may be extended by one or two years, subject to availability of funds and satisfactory performance of a fellow on the basis of an evaluation by an expert review committee. The selected fellows can’t relinquish the fellowship before two years unless they accept a permanent position in any institution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/creating-a-talent-pool-du-offers-fellowship-for-focused-research/articleshow/85470819.cms||Shradha Chettri

A report in this regard claims that some 2,500 audiobooks were recently added to the reference and regular book stacks. The library also possesses Braille books. The special section for the visually impaired was established in 2017. In the first year, a total of 127 visually impaired individuals accessed the 150 audio CDs and in 2019 around 140 visually impaired persons accessed 210 audio CDs. There was a 9% increase in membership of visually impaired persons in 2019. “We are now carrying out a special drive to invite more visually impaired persons to become members. The pandemic had put the brakes on our plans. We have begun approaching special institutions for suggestions to improve our collection,” says a senior official at MJ library. There are 3,641 audio CDs for visually impaired persons and a library section equipped with six audio player-cum-recorders. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opened the library in 1938, with nine branches across Ahmedabad district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mj-to-increase-visually-impaired-members/articleshow/85470927.cms||---
---||Delhi||Extortion from behind bars: Bank manager, two aides held in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Economic Offences Wing has arrested the manager of the Connaught Place branch of RBL Bank as well as two of his associates on charges of facilitating and laundering money for the high-profile conman, Sukesh Chandrasekhar. The Economic Offences Wing identified the manager as Komal Poddar and his aides as Avinash Kumar and Jitender Narula. “The accused were involved in dubious transactions related to circulation of funds and arrangements for cash,” said R K Singh, additional commissioner of police, EOW. On August 10, TOI was the first to report about the sensational extortion case and the arrest of Chandrasekhar, who was operating from behind bars. He had allegedly extorted Rs 200 crore from the family of a businessman for settling his legal cases. The EOW on Thursday confirmed that Chandrasekhar was using the “number spoofing” technology to impersonate high-ranking government officials. While the cops are yet to crack open his iPhone, they suspect the fraudster was using an app called Crazy Call to spoof numbers, sources said. Using the technology, Chandrasekhar would call his targets to strike deals and the victims would see the numbers decided by the conman on their phone screens, an official disclosed. In one of the last calls to a victim, the criminal impersonated the Union law secretary, a source said. Apart from Chandrasekhar, the Special Cell had also arrested two associates, Deepak and Pradeep, and two jail officials in the case. Sandeep Goel, director-general, Tihar Jail, had transferred five officials of the ward in Rohini jail where the conman was lodged in and started an inquiry regarding the seizure of an iPhone from his cell. In her complaint, the victim said that she had received a call in June last year in which the caller introduced himself as a secretary in the Union law ministry and proposed to help her in securing bail for her husband. This person demanded Rs 200 crore for getting the work done and conveyed the modalities regarding delivery of money. Later, the victim realised she had been duped when her husband did not receive any legal relief. When she approached the law ministry, she was informed that no such communication was made from them. She contacted the cops and lodged a complaint. The investigation was transferred to the EOW in order to establish the trail of funds and to identify the sources and ultimate beneficiaries of the money so transacted. “Further searches are being conducted in various places to get leads on the crime,” the Economic Offences Wing said in a statement on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/extortion-from-behind-bars-bank-manager-2-aides-held/articleshow/85468491.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Percolation pits at BMC gardens to save rainwater||MUMBAI: In a bid to raise ground water level of the city, the BMC has started digging rain water percolation pits at civic gardens. So far, such pits have been dug at 70 gardens and officials said 250 more spots have been identified where these will be created in coming days. The city has around 860 gardens which are open to the public free of cost. Jitendra Pardeshi, superintendent of the garden department said the pits are dug at spots in gardens where rainwater stagnates. “Construction of these pits is being done and a board is put up at the site, explaining to the public the benefits of a rainwater percolation pit,” he said. Subhajit Mukherjee, ambassador of ‘Majhi Vasundhara’ Abhiyaan’ — the state government’s environment and climate change department who is a part of the initiative said that the aim is to send rainwater back to the ground which will provide multiple benefits like supporting trees whose roots may be spreading and help in indirect recharge of borewells on the premises. “We have created pits at Rajesh Khanna garden at Khar, Muktanand park in Santacruz (west), Dadoji Kondadev Kridangan, Kandivli (east). Before we dig a pit, we do a percolation test... We dig a hole and fill water in it. The water should percolate inside and if it flows, it means we need to look at another site at the garden,” he said, adding that digging the pit costs about Rs 5,000. At civic gardens, a team digs a pit with perforated drums which act as a collection chamber. When it rains, water flows in all directions through the perforation. Over the last weekend, locals at Coastal Garden at Juhu beach created a pit. Nidhi Chaturvedi, from Juhu Citizens Welfare Group, said, “The process to create the pit wasn’t very laborious and yet it has multiple benefits. We were keen on implementing the initiative at the garden.” In Andheri, MLA Ameet Satam said many such percolation pits are being dug at Amboli’s Sant Ramdas ground. “One major problems with the playground is that water accumulates during monsoon and so I have asked Subhajit to help us create pits so that water can percolate into the ground instead of stagnating,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-percolation-pits-at-bmc-gardens-to-save-rainwater/articleshow/85470833.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Nagpur||BSP corporator alleges bias in fund allocation||Nagpur: A day after leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve alleged discrepancies in the distribution of funds by deputy mayor Manisha Dhawde, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader and senior corporator Jitendra Ghodeswar approached municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, claiming that funds earmarked for the weaker section of society were not being allotted to his party’s corporators. Ghodeswar claimed that the ruling party corporator and chairperson of Durbal Ghatak (weaker section) Committee Kanta Rarokar was releasing funds for works only in the constituencies represented by BJP corporators. Ghodeswar warned of staging a demonstration outside the civic chief’s chamber if things do not improve. In a letter to the civic chief, Wanve alleged massive irregularities in allocation of Rs3 lakh funds for various development works by Dhawde. Urging the municipal commissioner to issue stop work orders, Wanve sought a departmental inquiry into the funds sanctioned by the deputy mayor. According to Wanve, works were allegedly being split under the deputy mayor's fund to sidestep the tendering process. “NMC engineers were also involved in this scam,” he claimed. Though Dhawde refuted Wanve’s allegation, corporators from Congress, BSP, NCP and Shiv Sena have been claiming since many years that the ruling party is focusing on development works in wards represented by them. It is not the first time that the ruling BJP in the NMC is facing such allegations. In the past too, Congress, NCP and BSP had alleged bias in fund allocation by NMC. Senior Congress corporator Ramesh Punekar has been accusing BJP-ruled NMC of hiding information about distribution of development funds. “In 2017, I had sought information from the civic administration and standing panel about ward-wise allocation of funds, but in vain,” he claimed. Punekar alleged that BJP leaders were not sanctioning development work in wards represented by other parties. Ruling party leader in the NMC and senior BJP corporator Avinash Thakare termed the allegations of corporators from other parties “baseless”. He said since in the 151-member NMC House, the BJP has 108, Congress 29, BSP 10, Shiv Sena 2, NCP 1 and Independent 1 member, it is obvious that the funds allocated in BJP-ruled wards will be more. Thakare however claimed that each corporator receives funds of at least Rs1 crore every year for basic development works. Besides, the standing committee chairman, mayor and deputy mayor allocate funds for various major development works even in wards represented by Congress or BSP corporators, Thakare said, citing the examples of Ghodeswar who recently got a special fund of Rs50 lakh from the mayor’s fund. “Wanve also received over Rs5 crore for various works in his ward in the last three years,” he said. “It is nothing but their frustration ahead of the NMC elections due in early 2022,” Thakare added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bsp-corporator-alleges-bias-in-fund-allocation/articleshow/85468506.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Chandigarh||Civic body to issue Rs 24 crore tax notice to 6 Chandigarh department divisions||CHANDIGARH: With Rs 24 crore property tax outstanding against the UT administration, the tax department of the municipal corporation (MC) is ready to send separate tax notices to all six divisions of the engineering department of the UT instead of just one, which was the practice earlier. Though all these divisions are of the engineering department and the tax has to be paid by the department only, the UT wants the civic body to issue separate notices. This because the control or jurisdiction of the buildings falls under different divisions. “The CP-3 division of the UT, which deals with the maintenance works of the buildings, used to make tax payments earlier. But it has asked to prepare separate notices of all the divisions, citing many buildings don’t fall under it. The matter was discussed at the senior level in the UT too. It has now forced the MC to prepare notices to six divisions, CP-1 to CP-6,” an official in the MC said. “Significantly, the move comes when all the divisions of the engineering departments are being controlled and supervised by top bosses of the engineering department. But since the decision has been taken by senior officers following a meeting, we are left with no option but to prepare details division-wise,” sources said. The administration owes a huge amount in property tax. “We have been raising the issue of payment of property tax with the administration for many years. Though the UT has paid the amount earlier and in reconciliation of the tax amount, it was decreased also but still a big amount is pending. We are hopeful that the UT will make the payment soon, sources said. The tax branch of the MC has already started sending property tax notices to the defaulters of both commercial and residential properties. They had failed to make the payment during the rebate period from April to June. Out of a total around 1.20 lakh taxpayers, around 80,000 paid their property tax in the three months. The defaulters will have to pay 25% penalty and 12% interest amount on the tax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-issue-rs-24cr-tax-notice-to-6-ut-dept-divisions/articleshow/85470834.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Delhi||Experts to give verdict on how well CP smog tower works: Rai||New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday inspected the anti-smog tower coming up at Connaught Place and said experts had been asked to submit a report to the government on how well the tower performs. Based on that, a call will be taken by Delhi government to establish more such smog towers in the future, he said. The tower will be inaugurated on August 23 by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Rai said, “Delhi government is committed towards reducing the pollution levels in the capital. Taking into account the current situation, the smog tower is being established at Baba Kharak Singh Marg, Connaught Place. The tower is estimated to clean 1000m3 of air every second, helping reduce PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels in the area. The efficiency and impact of this smog tower will be very crucial for the Delhi region.” He added, “If the performance of the smog tower is found to be satisfactory, we will have similar smog towers across Delhi.” After the inauguration, experts will start monitoring the performance of the tower and then assess its impact on the environment. Rai said Delhi government was working on reducing pollution in the city with full force. “I am certain that the smog tower built at the cost of Rs 20 crore will contribute immensely towards this cause. The smog tower will work with full force after the monsoon season. Scientists of Delhi Pollution Control Committee will assess the performance of the tower and present a monthly report,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/experts-to-give-verdict-on-how-well-cp-smog-tower-works-rai/articleshow/85468590.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Her brothers, who were soldiers in the Afghan Army are currently at home in Kabul, while her parents are in Turkey for her mother’s medical treatment. The 26-year-old BBA student is stuck in Ahmedabad, wondering when and whether she will be able to reunite with her family. Nafisa’s friend, Sakina Nazaria, who is also from Kabul, has just completed her postgraduate course in mass communication from Gujarat University and is awaiting her results. Sakina’s visa is valid for about a month. Flights have stalled and there is uncertainty in Afghanistan after the Taliban take over. Nafisa Joya“If I go back, I don’t think I will ever be allowed to work. But I want to be with my family. My family has asked me to wait till the situation gets normal, but my visa is going to expire soon. I don’t know what future I am going back to,” she says. Nafisa and Sakina are part of the Afghan student community in Ahmedabad, all of whom are battling uncertainty due to the situation in Afghanistan and are worried about their families. There are many students whose visas expire soon and they hope the Indian government will extend some support. Sakina Nazaria“Things are really uncertain and we’re watching the situation closely. We are currently being supported by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and till our final semester results are out, we will be here. After that, we’re not sure how things will be,” said Barakatullah Rasully, another mass communication student from the Ghazni province of Afghanistan. “I definitely want to get back home to my family but I don’t know what the future holds under Taliban rule. There is a whole new generation in Afghanistan which aspires to progress, work and to remain connected with the world. We don’t know how things will pan out,” said Barakatullah. A number of girls who came to India for a better education aspired to go back to their home country and make a difference. With the recent developments, they stare at a bleak future.

The government proposes to build a new complex at this site after it’s vacated and the complex will have a new PMO, PM residence and an Executive Enclave as a part of the revamped Central Vista area. Sources said a detailed on-site review by top officials was carried out last week at the Africa Avenue site and the agencies concerned have been asked to finish all necessary works in the next 12-13 days. The office complex was originally slated to be ready by February this year, but it got delayed due to the pandemic. The office complex with four eight-storeyed (G+7) blocks is one of the two new buildings that are being built to shift some offices from the Central Vista Zone. The other complex is under construction at K G Marg. It has three nine-storeyed (G+8) blocks. The two complexes can accommodate around 15,000 government employees. Officials said the revised deadline for the KG Marg building is March, 2021. As per the plan, ministries operating from Transport Bhawan and Shram Shakti Bhawan would be shifted to this complex. Once the ministries vacate these buildings, the government will start preparation for creating office space for MPs. This has been planned since the spacious new Parliament Building under construction can’t meet the office requirement of MPs. Meanwhile, sources said the pace of construction of the New Parliament Building and the Central Vista Avenue or Rajpath is going on as per the schedule. They claimed both the projects will be completed as per schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/august-end-deadline-for-completing-work-at-africa-avenue-complex/articleshow/85470880.cms||Dipak K Dash

According to Mussoorie-based historian Gopal Bhardwaj, the names inscribed on this rock are those of an early group of surveyors who arrived here around 1814 for the great trigonometric survey. “The inscription on the stone says John Anthony Hodgson, JSB [initials for John Stuart Boldero] and WLG [initials for William Linnaeus Gardner] and Lady Hood – 1814. Major General John Anthony Hodgson went on to become Surveyor General of India in 1821. This stone, which records the account of early Britishers who set foot on these hills and of Hodgson, has great historical value,” Bhardwaj said. Pilgrims who visit the Bhadraj temple are damaging this rock by scribbling or chiselling their names, said Ramesh Semwal, a village resident. He added that rain and snow are also causing weathering of the rock’s surface. “This rock is part of the town's heritage and it must be suitably preserved by the archaeological department or the Survey of India,” said Raj Bijalwan, a resident. RS Patel, superintending archaeologist of Archaeological Survey of India, Dehradun circle, when queried about the matter, said, “I am not aware about this rock. We will send a team to examine it.” Incidentally, the rock is referred to as a “surveyor’s stone” and is believed to be a survey marker used for triangulation in the great trigonometric survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rock-outside-bhadraj-temple-with-early-19th-century-inscriptions-lies-in-neglect/articleshow/85465691.cms||Anmol Jain

---||Nagpur||RSS farmers’ outfit to protest for law on MSP||Nagpur: Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), the farmers’ outfit of RSS, will hold protests seeking a law that makes purchase of farm produce at minimum support price (MSP) mandatory, even for private traders. The organization has also raised objections against some provisions in the three new farm laws that had led to farmers’ protests in Delhi. Addressing a press conference at RSS Smruti Mandir campus, BKS organizing secretary Dinesh Kulkarni said the protests will be held in 525 districts across the country on September 8. “The demands were discussed with the government, but there was no further action. The government appeared to be indifferent on all the farm issues, especially after the talks with protesting farm leaders (from Bharatiya Kisan Union) failed. The government was ready to accept almost all the demands but the outfits were only interested in the agitation,” Kulkarni told TOI over telephone. The September 8 protest will held symbolically, adhering to the Covid protocol. Further course of action will be decided after the first protest, Kulkarni said. On the three farm laws, Kulkarni said that as they they allow purchase outside the agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC), farmers cannot be left at the mercy of traders. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (promotion and facilitation) Act allows trade even outside the designated APMC market. Under the new law, any person simply having a permanent account number (PAN) can purchase farm produce. “This can be a risky proposition and there should be stronger norms to ensure payment to farmers. This can be in the form of a bank guarantee or any similar mechanism,” said Kulkani The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act is biased against small and medium traders, said Kulkarni. The law calls for imposing stock limits on traders if the rates of non-perishable produce increase by 50% as compared to the preceding 12 months. It is 100% for perishable items. The limit is only applicable to small and medium traders; bigger players don’t have any restriction, he said. Kulkarni added, “Remunerative price is the key solution to the farmers’ problems and also their main demand. At present the MSP is merely on paper. Even as the price is declared for a number of crops, there is no mechanism to get the rate to farmers. There need to be strict laws, making it mandatory to buy not below the MSP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rss-farmers-outfit-to-protest-for-law-on-msp/articleshow/85468548.cms||Shishir Arya

They have been remanded in 14-day judicial custody. The accused have been identified as Gagan Negi, manager, FCI and Ravinder Singh Bunty, a resident of Amritsar. CBI sleuths arrested Gagan Negi for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 2 lakh and Ravinder for offering the bribe to the manager to manipulate the process of procurement and e-auction of foodgrains from Chandigarh. The CBI registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act against both. Ravinder Singh, who was involved in the sale and purchase of food grains, allegedly connived with the manager, FCI, regional office, Punjab, Chandigarh to take undue business from FCI by manipulating the process of procurement and e-auction of foodgrains. CBI sources said that Ravinder had allegedly paid a bribe of Rs 8 lakh to the manager on different occasions to manipulate the procurement process. After verifying the facts and keeping a close eye on the manager, CBI sleuths laid a trap near the mall in Chandigarh and arrested Negi while accepting a bribe of Rs 2 lakh. Ravinder Singh was also arrested for giving the bribe to the manager on August 17. CBI produced both the accused before the special CBI court which remanded them in two-day police custody for further interrogation. During the two-day remand, CBI sleuths conducted searches on the premises of the accused in Chandigarh, Zirakpur and Amritsar. After expiry of the two-day police custody, both the accused were produced in CBI court and sent to Burail jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/man-tries-to-bribe-fci-manager-for-undue-favours-both-arrested/articleshow/85470860.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board’s first ammonia removal plant will provide clean water to 7,000 families||NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board’s first ammonia removal plant with a capacity to treat 1 million gallons water per day has been made operational in a ranney well near Vikas Marg. Several areas in Delhi have high groundwater levels, but ammonia contamination makes it difficult to use this resource for domestic supply. Such decentralised ammonia treatment plants are expected to help DJB ramp up its raw water supply. DJB chairman Satyendar Jain visited the V-11 ranney well on Vikas Marg on Thursday to examine the plant. Jain said the plant would be sufficient for providing water to 7,000 families as it would add clean water directly to the underground reservoir. “More such plants are being installed across the capital for augmenting water availability,” he added. DJB had carried out a pilot project in the Shakarpur ranney well in December 2018 where a smaller version of the same technology was used in a 10KLD ammonia removal plant. The project showed encouraging results by reducing ammonia levels from 6ppm to treatable limits of 0.4ppm. The cost of purification was estimated to be Rs 3-4 for 1,000 litres of water. The raw water coming from Haryana has ammonia levels of 0.5-0.7ppm due to industrial pollutants being dumped in the Yamuna, but anthropogenic causes like untreated sewer discharge have contaminated groundwater to over 10 times (7-11 ppm). More than 100 borewells and seven ranney wells are non-functional in Delhi. With this technology, all these closed water extraction points would be made functional. A senior official working on the project said the Vikas Marg plant was the fully operational model of the pilot project and the same underlying technology using nitrifying bacteria had been used. “We had issued tenders for ammonia removal plants of 5MGD capacity. The project will be replicated at 10 more sites. Delhi does not have large dyeing and fertiliser industries, so most probably the reason behind such high levels of ammonia in groundwater are anthropogenic,” added the official. In 2018, after inspecting the pilot project, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had stated that the project had the capacity to generate 63 million litres of potable water every day. DJB water treatment plants have the capacity to treat water with up to 0.9ppm of ammonia by neutralising the compound with chlorine gas. However, experts say using chemical methods for levels beyond that leads to creation of toxic chlorine-based byproducts called chloramines that render the water unfit for human consumption. This is where the bacteria comes into play. Nitrifying bacteria consume ammonia and produce nitrites, which are then turned into nitrates within safe limits. In the pilot project, DJB used a ceramic-quartz medium to grow the bacteria. Water left for 10-20 minutes in the crystal-quartz medium lowered the ammonia content and oxidation was carried out by the bacteria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-ammonia-removal-plant-will-provide-clean-water-to-7k-families/articleshow/85468650.cms||Paras Singh

The Maoists have, in fact, claimed they have no drones in their armoury. DIG, Naxal range, Sandip Patil said Maoists have made a false claim they don’t have drones. “Maoists have drones which they have used for surveillance of police station premises and adjoining areas in Gadchiroli on a number of occasions,” he said. “The Maoists use hillocks to fly drones and we have also tried to bring them down in the past,” he said. Patil also clarified that police never claimed that Maoists used drones to attack the Burgi post. A major controversy had erupted over reports by a section of the media that Maoists used drones to fire on cops. The Maoists are now seeing conspiracy theories behind the drone attack misinformation. The Maoists have also claimed cops have used drones at Bastar in Chhattisgarh to drop bombs on a village in April this year. They have said in the press note that security forces are trying to legitimize their drone attacks by saying the Maoists are using drones too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maoists-refute-drone-attack-allegations-claiming-they-have-none/articleshow/85468636.cms||Soumitra Bose

Red Cross Road is a notified one-way road with traffic moving from Rail Bhawan roundabout towards Parliament Street. For people travelling from the East to West corridor, Red Cross Road is an important stretch and the closure will increase traffic volume by 20 % on other corresponding roads. “Vehicles will be diverted towards Maulana Azad Road from roundabout Sunheri Masjid. They can take Maulana Azad Road–Janpath–Windsor Place or Maulana Azad Road–Akbar Road–C-Hexagon for their onward journey. The traffic police officials suggested commuters who took Red Cross Road via Rajendra Prasad Road and Rail Bhawan to proceed via Janpath-Windsor place for their onward journey. Vehicles can take Jantar Mantar Road–Ashok Road for Patel Chowk or Windsor Place–Janpath for Connaught Place,” said SD Mishra, additional commissioner of police, traffic (southern range). As per the advisory, buses reaching roundabout Sunheri Masjid via South Avenue–Tyagraj Marg–Krishna Menon Marg will be diverted from roundabout Teenmurti towards Mother Teresa Crescent. Those buses approaching roundabout Sunheri Masjid from Sunehri Bagh Road will be diverted towards Janpath via Akbar Road–MLNP from roundabout Gol Methi. They will take Janpath upto Windsor Place and instead of turning onto Ashok Road will move via Janpath towards Connaught Place for their onward journey, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traffic-diversions-in-place-for-sewer-work-at-red-cross-road/articleshow/85470973.cms||---
---||Lucknow||KGMU docs bag prize for dental implant tech||Lucknow: Doctors of the prosthodontics department, Faculty of Dental Sciences, King George’s Medical University (KGMU) have developed two techniques that reduce the time of dental implants and makes them durable besides reducing pain and chances of infection. The techniques were conferred first and second prize for the year 2021 by the Indian Prosthodontics Society on Thursday. Dental implant surgery is a procedure that replaces tooth roots with screw-like posts and then places an artificial tooth that looks and functions like real one. The first prize of Rs 1 lakh went to the technique developed by Prof Balendra Pratap Singh and junior resident Dr Shahid A Shah. “We sterilised the bone gums of implant site after removing decayed tooth with ultraviolet rays instead of traditional disinfectant, and then fixed the metal post. The process reduced the rate of degeneration of jaw bone by restricting accumulation of bacteria. As a result, the implant stayed for a longer period with less chances of infection,” Prof BP Singh told TOI. The technique was successfully tried in 2017 on 80 patients who were observed for over a year in follow ups. The usual side effects — infection, injury or damage, pain, numbness and tingling in gums and lips — were substantially less in these patients in comparison to those in whom implant was done without UV treatment, he added “Post implant often jawbone degenerates by 2mm, but in our technique the degeneration was not over 0.75mm,” he added. The study based on this technique, ‘Bio and Prosthetic Impact of Platelet Rich Plasma and Ultraviolet Rays on Tooth Implant’ was published in the journal of Indian Prosthodontics Society this year. The technique which got the second prize of Rs 75,000 was developed by Prof Kaushalendra Singh and junior resident Dr Pooran Chand. The study was titled ‘A randomized controlled trial for evaluation of bone density changes around immediate functionally and non-functionally loaded implants using 3D CBCT’. “In the traditional method, no gap is left between the implanted tooth and natural teeth over or below it. The other teeth put pressure on the implanted tooth, hence, after fixation of metal post, patients had to wait for 4-6 months for it to be firmly installed in position before putting the crown cap over it,” said Prof Kaushalendra Singh. “In our technique successfully tried on 80 patients in 2018, we kept a gap of 0.44mm between the implanted tooth and teeth vertically above or below. Since there was no pressure on implanted tooth, it allowed us to cap the metal post with a crown soon after the surgery. Follow up of the patients for over a year revealed that the site healed faster and implant was firm,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-docs-bag-prize-for-dental-implant-tech/articleshow/85473144.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation lens on construction debris dumped in ponds||KOLKATA: A sizeable portion of construction waste and debris generated in added areas like Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Behala, Jadavpur or areas located off EM Bypass are being used to fill up ponds by land sharks. This issue featured prominently in a meeting between the KMC board of administrators and senior Lalbazar cops. The meeting was convened at the civic headquarters to discuss ways to prevent encroachment of ponds and illegal constructions. Formation of a special joint team comprising senior civic officials and cops has been planned to pay special attention to complaints from Metiabruz, Behala, Jadavpur and EM Bypass. Sources in the KMC buildings department confirmed that land sharks were active in filling ponds in added areas where demand for affordable housing projects is steadily rising and a section of the civic officials and police officers was caught napping. “The land sharks take a cunning approach in filling ponds or small waterbodies. When they set their eyes on a particular pond which needs to be filled to facilitate construction of flats in an adjacent land, the entire land including the pond is barricaded. Then they start filling up the pond with construction waste. This work is carried out at night. Side by side, an attempt is made to pump out the water of the pond. This filling process is done very fast,” said a KMC buildings department official. KMC board of administrators chairman Firhad Hakim recently stressed on formation of a special team to prevent rampant pond filling. He said this after he got a call from Nadial in Garden Reach during a “Talk to KMC” session. The caller informed him about filling of a large pond in the neighbourhood. Hakim assured the person that necessary action would be taken. Accordingly, a KMC team of officials were sent to the spot and the pond was restored by the civic officials in a week. The KMC buildings department has warned the assistant engineers in the boroughs against any sort of inactions in the event of filling of ponds or construction of illegal buildings under their jurisdiction. According to a KMC buildings department official, the borough executive officers of the buildings department would need to keep in touch with the OCs of the local police stations. “If any assistant engineer or even an executive engineer is found dragging his/her feet even after a genuine complaint of pond filling or illegal construction we will take stern action,” the civic official said. According to a department source, the civic body will step up its vigil over pond filling activities in added areas and prepare a list of the ponds which need immediate protection from land sharks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-lens-on-construction-debris-dumped-in-ponds/articleshow/85468657.cms||Saikat Ray

Construction will begin in the next six weeks, Lodha said, with completion expected within three years. “We are planning a significant focus on Pune, due to the economic dynamism of the city, with both manufacturing and IT jobs. When we speak of the metropolitan cities in India, we generally refer to the four metros and Bengaluru. We believe that Pune is reaching that level very soon,” said Abhishek Lodha, MD and CEO of Lodha group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lodha-returns-to-housing-mkt-in-pune/articleshow/85470984.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Threatened by father’s team, says Deeg-Kumher MLA Vishvendra Singh's son||JAIPUR: The ongoing dispute between Deeg-Kumher Congress MLA Vishvendra Singh and his son Anirudh turned serious, with the latter accusing the core team of his father of issuing threats of an “extremely serious nature”. Anirudh, who has earlier attacked his father on social media, has filed a complaint against the Congress legislator. In his complaint addressed to Bharatpur superintendent of police, Anirudh has alleged that these threats were of an “extremely serious nature, to cause all kinds of physical injuries to me and the people who accompany me”. The Bharatpur police has now handed the matter over to a deputy superintendent of police rank officer for investigation. TOI got a copy of the letter Anirudh had written to Bharatpur SP Devendra Kumar Bishnoi on Thursday. “I am receiving threats continuously from the core team of my father Shri Vishvendra Singh ji, MLA Deeg-Kumher... Through this letter, I would request you to kindly take cognisance of these threats. If any physical harm is done to me – I hereby clearly state that the responsibility of the same would rest with Shri Vishvendra Singh,” Anirudh said in the letter. He has also marked copies to ML Lathar, DG, police; and Malini Agarwal, ADG (jail) and IG Bharatpur Range. When contacted, SP Bishnoi said to TOI, “We have received the letter. I have asked Satish Verma, the circle officer (city), to look into the matter. The complainant will have to substantiate his claims and allegations through evidence, including phone numbers or names responsible for these threats.” Despite several attempts, Vishvendra Singh could not be contacted. Earlier, in June this year, a family dispute had surfaced after Anirudh accused Vishvendra of turning “violent” against his mother, and alleged that the former Rajasthan minister had destroyed the business of his friends. In a tweet which was later deleted, he claimed that he has not been in touch with his father, and accused him of accumulating debt and turning alcoholic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/threatened-by-fathers-team-vishvendras-son/articleshow/85471033.cms||---

While the district has nearly 3,308 active cases, 2,465, which is 75% of them, are in home isolation as on Wednesday. While 643 people have been admitted to various hospitals, only about 200 are in CCCs in the district. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai in his recent visit to the district, had directed officials to shift a majority of the cases to CCCs or hospitals through proper triage by medical officers. DHO Dr Kishore Kumar M told TOI that health staff have been convincing people to shift to CCCs. “We have been facing resistance from people when they are asked to shift to CCCs. Our staff have been reaching out to people who have got infected, and are trying to convince them to shift to CCCs. It is difficult to manage home isolation cases, as health staff will have to visit every house to monitor the health status of infected persons. Similarly, our staff have to trace the primary contacts of all positive cases, and monitor them also. Further, they have to conduct visits repeatedly, if primary contacts also test positive. Hence, the management of cases and prevention of the spread of the disease is very easy when a majority of the cases are either in CCCs or hospitals. We have directed health staff to compulsorily shift all positive cases with comorbidities and vulnerable to CCCs,” the DHO said. Dr Ashok H, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Dakshina Kannada, said the cooperation of the public is important when it comes to the prevention of the spread of Covid-19. “People should follow the instructions of doctors when they are asked to shift to CCCs or hospitals. People should avail treatment at CCCs or hospitals and get treatment as per the medical officers’ advice. Patients with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and malignancy should compulsorily get admitted to CCCs or hospitals,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/cms-diktat-goes-for-a-toss-75-of-covid-cases-in-home-isolation/articleshow/85465780.cms||---
---||Nagpur||65% leopards in Maharashtra are outside wildlife parks||NAGPUR: Of the 1,690 leopards in Maharashtra, 65% population stays outside sanctuaries, national parks, and tiger reserves. Is this the answer to questions as to why leopards are rare to sight in parks? Why human-leopard conflict is high outside forest areas and why mortality of leopards is high on roads? As per the ‘Status of leopards, co-predators, and megaherbivores in India-2018’ report released recently, of the state population of 1,690 leopards, nearly 600 (35%) have been recorded in protected areas (PAs). Though the ‘Status of leopards in India 2018’ report was earlier released by former environment minister Prakash Javadekar in December last, the ‘Status of leopards, co-predators, & Megaherbivores in India-2018’ is a modified version that has counted numbers in individual protected areas (PAs) in the country, similar on the lines of tiger population. India now has 12,852 leopards as compared to the previous estimate of 7,910 conducted 2014, a jump of 60%. As per the report 3 states have recorded the highest leopard estimates — Madhya Pradesh 3,421, Karnataka 1,783 and Maharashtra 1,690. Using spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) framework, the latest report assesses the status of leopards from camera trap data and occupancy surveys conducted in 2018-19 across 20 states where tigers are present. Of the total leopard population in Maharashtra, Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) has the highest number 150, followed by Tadoba-Andhari 91, Navegaon-Nagzira 76, Pench 67, Sahyadri 40, Bor 33, Painganga 22, Umred-Karhandla 11 and Tipeshwar 5. Besides, in the territorial divisions under Chandrapur circle, Bramhapuri recorded 70 leopards followed by Central Chanda 18 and Chandrapur 41. A total of 12 sites were camera trapped in Maharashtra that yielded 3,790 detections of 588 adult leopards. “The number of leopards estimated is bare minimum. The population in the state may be more because the tiger estimation was done in a limited area but there are pockets like Aurangabad, Junnar, Ahmednagar and Nashik where there may be no tigers but there are many leopards,” said Sunil Limaye, PCCF (wildlife), Maharashtra. Secondly, Limaye added, “There may be leopards using both tiger reserves and its multiple-use areas. Hence, the estimation shows leopards outside the parks also using tiger reserve. The number may be more as areas in Marathwada and Gadchiroli have not been counted.” “Leopards are spread throughout the forested landscape of Maharashtra and with 65% population staying outside PAs is really a cause of concern. There is competition inside PAs. Leopards being opportunistic, move out near villages in search of easy prey. Straying leopards are escalating human-leopard conflict and mortality in road kills as well as population fragmentation by linear infrastructures. People will have to co-exist with them,” said Limaye. As per the report, camera traps deployed at 26,838 locations across India resulted in over 3.48 crore photographs of the wildlife of which 51,777 were of leopards. A total of 5,240 adult leopards were photo-captured. Panna in MP had the largest leopard population at about 273, followed by Sariska 231. Both these reserves lost tigers between 2004 and 2009 and in the absence of tigers, leopards occupied the major forested habitats within the reserves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/65-leopards-in-maha-are-outside-wildlife-parks/articleshow/85468722.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kolkata||‘Job-oriented’ zoology, commerce see huge demand in pandemic yr||Kolkata: Zoology and commerce, which did not get too many takers earlier, suddenly seemed to be on the top of choice list among undergraduate aspirants this time, said principals a day ahead of the application portals closing on Friday. The high marks that Plus-II students received after boards and councils adopted “pandemic formulae” pushed up the number of candidates making it to the eligibility cut-offs at most institutes. Moreover, the absence of application fees has removed the financial hurdle, as a result of which every college and university has received a deluge of forms for UG courses. Most candidates did not seem to take a risk with their career amid the pandemic and opted for “job-oriented subjects and streams, like zoology and commerce, principals said. Scottish Church principal Madhumanjari Mandal Choubey said, “Students always go for subjects like English, physics and chemistry. But if we list according to this year’s demand, English is in first position, zoology second and BCom third. This is absolutely new that a large number of forms have come in for BCom.” Bethune College principal Krishna Roy, too, said, “Zoology and English are of the highest demand.” Professors pointed out that average students scoring high opted for commerce and zoology because they were “job oriented” and most did not want to take a risk with their career amid the pandemic. At St Xavier’s College, the highest number of forms has been submitted for English and commerce, while at Lady Brabourne, it was for zoology and English. Lady Brabourne principal Siuli Sarkar said, “Form submission is higher than that last year. The number is especially high for subjects, like English and zoology.”  New Alipore College principal Jaydeep Sarangi said, “Students are choosing basic subjects. Zoology may record 20 times more application forms than earlier.” Pointing out the reason, he said, “In Plus-II, zoology is 70% and botany is 30% in biology. It might have increased their interest and secondly, it is a job-oriented subject. Students are choosing BCom for the same reason.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/job-oriented-zoology-commerce-see-huge-demand-in-pandemic-yr/articleshow/85468726.cms||---

The Taliban have taken positions on the roads as well as at the airport. I had to drag my luggage in the midst of a large crowd and vehicles on the road. Thousands of people are trying to flee. I managed to reach the second gate at the airport, but then the Taliban started shooting in the air, in order to control the crowd. Before I reached the airport, thousands of people had managed to enter the airport building, but the airport staff had abandoned the place. People went into planes without any security check or boarding passes.” He also shared in his message that Jesuit Refugee Services (JRS) activities have been suspended for an indefinite period of time in Afghanistan. His family said that he was in contact with them, and that they were praying for his safe return to India. A close family member of the priest told TOI that Fr Jerome is safe. “At this time of distress, we would not like to divulge any further information about his condition and whereabouts,” the family member said. Fr Jerome heads JRS, an international NGO in Kabul, since January 2021. When Fr Jerome had spoken to his brother over phone on Tuesday morning, he told him that he was staying close to Kabul airport. Fr Jerome’s family also contacted Society of Jesus heads, who are now in contact with MEA officials and the Indian embassy in Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/stranded-jesuit-priest-raises-alarm-in-dispatch-from-afghanistan/articleshow/85465880.cms||---

These tips were shared by the deans and heads of various departments of Lucknow University to help candidates prepare for the entrance examination scheduled to be held from August 24. “Admissions to undergraduate course in faculties of arts, commerce, law, science and fine arts will be done on the basis of marks obtained in the under-graduate entrance test (UGET) of the university. There is no change in examination pattern. It will be a multiple-choice-based examination with 100 questions to be answered in 90 minutes,” said spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava. “There will be no negative marking this t ime,” he added. Dean, law, Prof CP Singh said the candidates aspiring to crack law entrance test should focus on solving model papers of general studies like other competitive examinations in law, like CLAT. “LU’s entrance examination doesn’t ask hardcore questions related to law but from everything that comes under general studies,” he added. Science students appearing for entrance test need no special preparation if they are preparing for national level engineering and medical entrance test. “Since it is MCQ-based examination, candidates with good understanding of concepts will find it easier. Candidates assume that only class 12 syllabus is important for preparation, but in science, we consider the syllabus of classes 9 to 12 as one. Candidates should revise Board examination syllabus along with that of classes 9-11,” said dean, student welfare, and head of physics department, Prof Poonam Tandon.  A senior arts faculty member said a candidate should give equal attention and time to subjects like geography, history, English, economics. “The question paper is based on general awareness that covers a number of subjects. The syllabus of general studies from classes 10 to 12 is important,” he added.  A senior faculty member of commerce department said candidates shouldn’t run after too many competitive examination books. “Just stick to what you studied in classes 11-12,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/focus-on-concepts-practise-tests-teachers-tips-to-crack-lu-entrance/articleshow/85473178.cms||---

The limited edition of the Vespa will be offered in its usual 125cc and 150cc engines, but with facelifts and accessories designed to evoke its original aerodynamic design, as well as some of its previous features, such as a back-mounted pouch, to evoke the previous provision of a spare tyre. Like all of its product line, the limited edition will also be made at Baramati plant. “The response to the product is definitely overwhelming, with bookings of the scooter already open. It is something people are eager to get, as this edition has been designed and developed to resemble the original Vespa, which we are doing to celebrate the legacy of the product,” said Diego Graffi, the chairman and MD of Piaggio India, in an interaction with the TOI. Piaggio launched an electric version of the scooter in Europe in 2016, with the firm insisting that producing and launching an electric Vespa is in their long-term plans in India, but challenges remain. “Of course, such a product would work in India. Vespa is an aspirational product, with people buying it for its style and design, as well as for its powertrain,” Graffi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/piaggio-brings-limited-edition-of-vespa-scooter/articleshow/85471070.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

In several instances, patients are reporting infection of both dengue and chikungunya together, said experts. Dr Manoj Vithalani, a city-based consulting physician, said the present weather with scarce sunlight and low temperatures is giving rise to mosquito breeding in open areas and homes. “Chikungunya is more prevalent this year with patients reporting fever and joint pain. As mosquitoes for both dengue and chikungunya bite during the day, we recommend wearing full-sleeved clothes, using mosquito repellent and keeping your premises free of water accumulation,” he said. Doctors said the viral infection caused by the H3N2 influenza A virus is also on rise in several parts of the city. Dr Pragnesh Vachcharajani, a city-based family physician, said cases have been on the rise ever since the start of August and among almost all age groups are being hit. “Children and the elderly of the family must be protected. Stay hydrated, avoid stale food and maintain proper hygiene,” he said. Western city parts are more affected by vector-borne diseases with developing areas having open fields and water accumulation due to rain. The condition will improve only after a change in the weather, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-seeing-vector-borne-diseases-spike/articleshow/85471083.cms||---

He also said that if there were any issues with the police investigation, the case could be transferred to the CBI. Alleging that some sections of society were trying to stir up a controversy in the matter as the state assembly elections were just around the corner, Tanavade said, “The father of the deceased is a good BJP supporter and he should get justice.” He assured that there would be no political control over the investigation and said that even if the victim’s family did not support BJP or wasn’t related to a party functionary, it should get justice anyway. “I am of the opinion that there should be no injustice to any resident of the state,” he said. According to the BJP state president, the father of the deceased teen is closely related to a BJP MLA. “The (teen’s) family should get full support and cooperation. Whatever they feel should be done. The party as well as the government is with them,” Tanavade said when asked whether the pace of the current probe was slow. “If somebody raises doubts over the girl’s death, there should definitely be a re-inquiry. I have told the chief minister that a reinvestigation could be conducted to get to the bottom of the case.” When asked if the opposition was trying to take advantage of the incident, Tanavade said it is the duty of the opposition to do politics, but it should not be done on a personal level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teens-death-could-be-reinvestigated-or-transferred-to-cbi-bjp-state-prez/articleshow/85471192.cms||---

In April-May when Delhi-NCR was facing an acute shortage of oxygen, JRG Automotive Industries India Pvt Ltd posted a buyer’s query on an international B2B website, following which the fraudsters — posing as Abu Karim, Indian representative of US based Brands LLC owned by Banning Field Quentinas — had approached the management assuring them to ensure delivery of oxygen concentrators in four working days. JRG Automotive had soon placed orders for 70 oxygen concentrators and even made all payments after receiving the details of bookings and dispatch, but the concentrators never reached their destination, according to a police complaint filed by JRG Automotive officials. “After receiving the payment, the accused stopped responding to our emails. Finally we realised that we were duped. Further, the shipping details and the address of the Indian partner of the accused are non-existent,” a JRG Automotive representative said in the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/firm-orders-oxygen-concentrators-online-cheated-of-lakhs/articleshow/85473230.cms||Bagish Jha

According to police, Ismail Appasaheb Nadaf,24, from Mudalagi in Belagavi, appeared for the exam on behalf of Praveen Koth at Mount Rosary English Medium School, Kallianpur Santhekatte, on October 18, 2020. However, Koth had appeared for the physical test and medical examination held on December 19, 2020, and January 13, 2020, in Dharwad.

Based on their report, a case was registered at the Malpe police station. Police arrested Hanumantha Meistry, 30, from Gokak, Appayya Naik, 29, from Mudalagi, and Holeppa Muthyappa Bhagewadi, 28 from Belagavi.

---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Elderly man duped of Rs 1.31 crore on insurance policies’ lure in Panchkula||PANCHKULA: Two persons duped an elderly Kalka resident, who retired as executive engineer (XEN), of Rs 1.31 crore on the lure of insurance policies. A case of fraud has been registered. The victim, identified as K D Lal, 77, a resident of Basant Vihar, Kalka, who retired as XEN in 2002, said that in 2012, he purchased three policies of Max Life Health Insurance for five years. Lal alleged that when his policies were about to mature, he received a call from one Kirmoni, representative of Max Life, who told him that they would not be able to refund the amount on his matured policies, if he did not purchase more policies from them. At this, Lal alleged that he started getting multiple calls from other numbers also. K P Ahuja, who claimed to be a senior representative, called and insisted on purchasing the policies. “The accused started inducing me to buy further policies on fake assurance of good returns for my children and grandchildren,” Lal said. On their requests, Lal purchased a few policis in 2015. Initially, some payments were made in the company account. Later, they started taking money in different accounts assuring that Lal would get discounts by booking from their accounts. The accused issued policies of various other firms, including three policies of Exide Life, one each of Bharti AXA, Aegon Religare and Reliance. The victim kept paying the money asked for by the accused through RTGS between 2017 and 2021. In April 2020, when the victim checked the status of his policies, he came to know that he had been cheated by the accused and no payment had been deposited for his policies, except the first installment of each insurance policy. When he contacted the accused, they assured him that they would get a refund of his money in some time. They also asked him to make a payment saying the money would be used to help him get a refund. Lal said “Till date, the accused has duped me of Rs 1,31,53,770, which was taken from me on the pretext of installments of policies and other charges involved in refund, out of which only Rs 14.67 lakh (first installments of each policy) was deposited in my account.” The victim filed a police complaint along with bank statements showing transfer of the amount to the alleged accused. Police registered a case under sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc.), 468 ( forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document or electronic record) and 34 (act done by several person with same intention) of the IPC at Kalka police station and initiated the investigation in the case. Invstigation officer ASI Rishi Pal said, “We have registered a case based on the complaint. Further investigation is on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/elderly-man-duped-of-rs-1-31-crore-on-insurance-policies-lure/articleshow/85471129.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Dhanbad judge’s death: Jharkhand high court asks CBI to probe injury angle||RANCHI: The Jharkhand high court has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct its inquiry from the angle of injury caused to former Dhanbad judge Uttam Anand. A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad while hearing the petition here on Thursday observed that the deceased judge had an injury on the right side of his head on the temple which has been corroborated in the post mortem report. Such injury could not have been caused by the auto rickshaw which had hit the judge. Instead, the bench observed that the co-passenger sitting in the auto rickshaw may have used something to hit the judge causing him to fall on the road on his left side. The injury on the head of Anand cannot be caused by the rear view mirror of the auto rickshaw, the judges said while hearing the proceedings online. They also directed the home secretary and the director of the Forensic Sciences Laboratory to appear in the matter. The court also lamented at the lack of resources in the FSL. The court while going through the investigation report submitted by the CBI said that investigation on the point of injury ought to be undertaken by the agency. The case will now be heard on August 27. The Supreme Court is also monitoring the investigation of the case. The death of Uttam Anand was caught on camera and the CCTV footage had gone viral showing him walking near the Randhir Verma Chowk, a posh area in Dhanbad on July 28 at 5am. The judge was hit by an autorickshaw with a passenger sitting in the front along with the driver. A motorcyclist is also shown going behind the autorickshaw who saw the injured judge fall on the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dhanbad-judges-death-court-asks-cbi-to-probe-injury-angle/articleshow/85470222.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Union minister Arjun Munda upset with slow implementation of central schemes||RANCHI: The Union minister for tribal affairs, Arjun Munda, on Thursday expressed his dissatisfaction over the slow implementation of various central schemes, like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and the Jal Ka Nal scheme, in Jharkhand and directed the officials concerned to make sure those enrolled in such welfare schemes receive the benefits within a stipulated time frame. Munda made these statements while chairing a meeting of the district infrastructure scheme advisory in Ranchi. He said the real-time monitoring of all centrally- sponsored schemes is important for an all-inclusive development. He added, “We have discussed the implementation of over three dozen welfare programs, which have been rolled out throughout the country with an aim to improve the lives of the rural population. I have directed the officials to make sure that these schemes do not just exist in black and white and are implemented properly.” As an example, Munda was told during the meeting that slightly over 900 PMAY beneficiaries are yet to receive the benefits but the minister said, “Although it may not seem like a huge statistic, it goes up to a huge number when one takes into account the number of families who have been deprived of the benefits.” Other public representatives from Ranchi, including MPs Deepak Prakash and Sanjay Seth, raised several issues during the meeting. Congress’s Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey said they always receive complaints about the names of eligible beneficiaries being removed from the centrally-sponsored schemes and they have to intervene for getting them registered. “I do not understand the logic behind the deletion of names. There have been instances where 500 people submitted their names but only 100 names appeared in the list,” he added. The public representatives also discussed the progress of the ongoing vaccination drive in the districts. Many raised the issue of lack of amenities at the vaccination centres. “Even though people are queueing up for vaccines the centres lack basic amenities like drinking water and sanitation,” Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/munda-upset-with-slow-implementation-of-central-schemes/articleshow/85469674.cms||---

Only he could not reach the airport on time. Later the flight was cancelled too. Bablu is among several other Indians who are currently stranded in Afghanistan following its takeover by the Taliban early this week on Sunday. A resident of Gandhinagar area, 37-year-old Bablu Kumar’s family back home is concerned over his safety and has appealed to chief minister Hemant Soren and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his safe return. Talking to TOI over a WhatsApp call on Thursday, he said, “I had booked the ticket in advance for August 16 for India but I am stranded now.” Recalling the scenes of chaos in Kabul and on roads leading to the airport that day, he said, “I could hear sounds of gunfire all around and such was the situation that I got frightened and rushed back to my flat where I lived. Later on, the Air India flight to India too got cancelled.” Kumar works as an operator in a battery manufacturing company in Kabul. In October 2018, he went there for work. But he used to visit home twice or thrice a year to meet his family which includes three brothers, his wife Lakho Devi, and his two sons, aged 10 and 7. “I am in touch with my family back in Bokaro regularly,” he said. “I work for a company called Afghan Rana,” he informed. The owner of his company has kept them in a guest house which is about 10 minutes away from Kabul Airport. “All of them were asked to stay inside the house because Taliban fighters are moving outside. Arrangements have been made for food items in the house by the company's owner. We have no idea what to do now. What can we do to return to our country? It is terrifying to stay here," said Kumar. Kumar is currently on a 180-day Visa. Following a visit to his family on April 25, he went to Afghanistan on June 2. As the situation worsened rapidly, his company told him that it’s better he returns to his country. So he booked a flight ticket for August 16 but could not catch the flight. Members of his family have requested the Prime Minister and the chief minister through Twitter to ensure his safe return. Lal Babu, his elder brother, said, “We are a joint family. Bablu has gone to Kabul to earn money and lift our family out of poverty. He is stranded there now. We are concerned about his safety. The government must act soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-man-stuck-in-af-family-seeks-help/articleshow/85469248.cms||Divy Khare

Those who have been allegedly taken away are the man’s father, sister, wife and two minor children.  It must be noted that the man’s sister had filed a rape case against Sunil Tiwari, the political adviser of former Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi. While the man did not say the reason behind their ‘forced detention’ but his brother, who stays in Chennai, had filed an online FIR on August 16 alleging that the police coerced his family members to register a false complaint against Tiwari. Tiwari has not been arrested in the case yet but the issue has snowballed into a major political controversy. Marandi, in a press conference, had claimed that Tiwari was being framed by the Hemant Soren government. Senior leaders of the state BJP, however, maintained a studied silence in the matter.  When contacted, the state police refused to comment and no reactions were forthcoming from the government either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tribal-man-files-plea-in-hc-to-trace-missing-family-members/articleshow/85470309.cms||---

Meanwhile, the Ranchi office of the India Meteorological Department on Thursday predicted light to moderate showers across Jharkhand on Friday. It also predicted that the state’s north eastern districts, including Sahebganj, will have scattered rains (15.6 mm – 64 mm rain) in the next 24 hours. The district administration deployed two units of the National Disaster Response Force personnel, one unit comprising 25 men each, in Sahebganj and Rajmahal blocks for evacuating affected residents from their inundated houses and their livestock. Statistics assimilated by the administrative officials said a total of 2.65 lakh people were affected by the flood. “The extent of the damage can only be evaluated once the water levels receeded,” Sahebganj deputy commissioner Ram Niwas Yadav told TOI over phone. As many as three people, including two infants, have died by drowning so far. Chief minister Hemant Soren, who was camping in Patna village in Barhait assembly constituency of the district, also huddled the district officials on Thursday to take stock of the situation. Soren, who took an aerial tour of the flood-affected areas on Wednesday, on Thursday directed the officers to ensure that the affected families are provided with dry ration and cooked meals. As many as 10 of the 74 relief camps were occupied in the district as on Thursday, each of them having approximately 70 people. Flood-affected families were being provided 25 kg rice, milk and dry fodder for those who had livestock. The Central Water Commission (CWC) said the water level at the Ganges was at 28.90 meters as of 6am on Thursday, which was higher than the danger level of 27.25 meters. “Several points along the river’s course such as Buxar Ghat, Patna, Hathidaha, Munger and Kahalgaon have recorded water levels above the danger mark,” CWC said. Yadav said the district administration was drawing comfort from the fact that CWC had predicted a gradual decrease in water level from Friday onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/flood-situation-worsens-in-sahibganj-21k-more-affected/articleshow/85470188.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Azam Ansari, son of Nasirul Ansari of village Hesla under Bagodar police station of Giridih district, was booked on Wednesday, officer in-charge of Bishnugarh police station Jaglal Munda informed on Thursday. He said the case was filed based on a complaint by a woman identified as Shakila Khatun. He said, “Shakila belongs to Hethley Murgawan village under Bishnugarh police station. She married Azam about five years ago and had three children. But she alleged that ever since she was married, her husband and in-laws were torturing her for dowry. She was even kept without food for days.” On Wednesday, Azam, while bringing her to her native place at Hethley Murgawan village, allegedly threw her out of the running vehicle pronouncing triple talaq, she claimed. The victim also alleged that her husband took the children with him. The OC said, “After all efforts of reconciliation failed, the father of the victim lodged an FIR against Azam. Cases were also filed against Azam’s father, Nasirul Ansari, mother and other relatives who tortured her.” Munda said since triple talaq is banned in India, it is now a serious offence. “If any anybody says triple talaq through any means, it is a cognizable offence. The police have registered a case under triple talaq act, dowry act and various sections of the IPC,” he said. Bishnugarh SDPO circle Anuj Oraon said he is going through the FIR and necessary action will be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-booked-for-triple-talaq-in-hazaribag/articleshow/85469544.cms||---

But Benudhar Behera, a transgender, had to quit his job as he faced workplace harassment due to him being a third gender. But he has now decided to become a Covid warrior and serve those in need amid the pandemic. “After quitting my job in 2012, I left for Mathura as I was completely clueless about how to deal with my life as a transgender. After spending some years as a vagabond, I came in contact with Lakshya Trust, which is based in Vadodara and shifted here four months ago,” said 39-year-old Behera said. He then decided to give a new direction to his life and become a Covid warrior. “I took up this course offered by Deepak Foundation to learn the skills of caring for patients and management of Covid cases. I will soon join an institution that would help me in serving Covid patients,” Behera told TOI. Like him, eight other transgender persons are also pursuing the Home Health Aide course that is being offered by Deepak Foundation since last five years. But this year for the first time they decided to integrate transgender persons with the other students. “Our aim is to bring transgender community into the mainstream and offer them livelihood too. “This course includes identification of signs and symptoms of Covid, use of antigen testing kits, pulse oximeter and orientation to management of Covid-19. The students are also taught palliative care and counseling in mental health cases,” said Archana Joshi, director, Deepak Foundation. “I was involved in lot of social work during my stay at Noida and hence I decided to become a Covid warrior and serve people,” said Parvati Nair, another transgender from Vadodara. She did her schooling in the city and then shifted to Kerala for graduation before taking up a job in Dubai. “I returned to India five years ago and joined a private company in Noida.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: IED explosion kills villager out to collect firewood in Gumla forest||GUMLA: A man was killed in an IED explosion at Judwani forest under Bishunpur police station of Gumla on Wednesday night. The victim has been identified as Budheshwar Nagesia, a resident of Judwani hamlet under Nirasi panchayat of Bishunpur police station, 75km from Gumla district headquarters. He was 45. Police on Thursday rushed to the spot and launched an investigtion. Nagesia had gone into the forest to graze cattle and collect firewood on Wednesday afternoon but was blown up after he stepped on an IED planted in the ground. Gumla SDPO Manish Chandra Lal said, “A villager died in an IED blast in Judwani forest. A team of police visited the spot on Thursday.” “This forest region also covers some parts of adjoining Lohardaga district where Maoist zonal commander Ravindra Ganjhu's squad is learnt to have planted IEDs to prevent security forces to come after them. But the villagers are falling victim to their design. In the past, a few jawans were also killed and wounded by IEDs,” he said. This was the seventh IED blast in recent months in both Gumla and Lohardaga districts. Judwani forest shares a border with Maoist-hit Peshrar of Lohardaga district. The forest has long been a safe haven of Ravindra Gaunjhu, member of the Bihar Jharkhand Regional Committee of CPI ( Maoist), sources said. In July this year, a dog handler of Commando Battalion of Resolute Action (CoBRA) force, Vishwajeet Kumbhkar, sustained grievous injuries and a sniffer dog died in a similar blast in Keragani forest under Kurumgarh police station in Gumla. That same month, a villager, Ramdeo Munda of Bardih village, died in a landmine explosion in the same forest. In June, another villager, Hiralal Tana Bhagat of Kerar village under Peshrar police station of Lohardaga district, died in an IED blast in Bulbul forest while Duledhwar Prass, a jawan of Lohardaga district police, was wounded in an explosion in the Serengdag police station area of Lohardaga in February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ied-explosion-kills-villager-out-to-collect-firewood-in-gumla-forest/articleshow/85470352.cms||K A Gupta
---||Ranchi||Babulal Marandi under fire from Jharkhand Mukti Morcha over aide’s ‘sex assault’ case||RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) continued its attacks on Babulal Marandi for the second day in a row over the implication of his advisor Sunil Tiwari in a sexual harassment case and also put BJP in the docks for siding with a man who has been accused of a crime against a woman. “While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has coined a slogan ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’, the members of his party here in Jharkhand are owning a man, accused of sexually harassing a tribal woman, as one of their own. On behalf of our party, we ask BJP to come clean on its stand against such incidents. Does the party on a whole condemn crimes against women or does it not?” questioned JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya on Thursday. Marandi, the BJP’s legislative party leader and the first CM of Jharkhand, had addressed reporters at BJP office on Wednesday and claimed that the incumbent mahagathbandhan government had implicated Tiwari, his political advisor, in a sexual harassment case after he became the intervenor in a sexual harassment case against incumbent CM Hemant Soren. Bhattacharya urged Marandi to make public his international travel details in recent months. “JMM urges Marandi to make public his international travel details and his co-passenger details. It will become clear that Tiwari is very close to Marandi. Marandi, on the other hand, is in know of everything which happened with the complainant. Instead of misleading the public, Marandi must cooperate with the police officers who are investigating the case and provide them with necessary information,” Bhattacharya said. JMM questioned Tiwari’s position within the BJP rank and file again on Thursday. “What position does he hold within the BJP and what is Tiwari’s membership number? The party must make it public,” Bhattacharya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/babulal-under-fire-from-jmm-over-aides-sex-assault-case/articleshow/85469291.cms||---
---||Goa||Agri marketing board lists measures to hike revenue||Margao: Various measures aimed at increasing revenue of the Goa agriculture produce and livestock marketing board were suggested to the government at a special meeting of the board held on Thursday. Agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, who was present at the meeting, assured the board of considering the suggestions positively. Extending the scope of the term “market yard” to include areas extending up to the state’s boundaries and not just limited to the compound wall of the yards was among the major measures suggested for revenue enhancement. “This will bring any selling activity of agriculture products in the state under the purview of the marketing board,” vice-chairman Premanand Mhambre said. Pointing out that the board was paying its employees on par with the 7th Pay commission scales, Mhambre said that the salary burden on the board had thus increased. The board’s chairman, Prakash Velip, informed Kavlekar that various revenue generating measures were being chalked out and that a memorandum in this regard would be presented to the government soon. This is the first board meeting Kavlekar attended after the marketing body was brought under the aegis of the state agriculture department. Director of agriculture Nevil Alphonso, officials of the agriculture, animal husbandry departments were present. Addressing the board, Kavlekar dwelt at length on various new schemes introduced by the agriculture department. Providing subsidy at source for community farming will help attract more people to agriculture, he said. “Difficulties in getting a Krishi card made are being eased out to facilitate farming in the state. Goa is steadily making progress towards adopting modern techniques in farming, which is also expected to attract the new generation towards farming. The vision of this department is ‘Healthy Goa, Wealthy Farmer,” Kavlekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/agri-marketing-board-lists-measures-to-hike-revenue/articleshow/85471319.cms||---
---||Goa||Limited crew, rising fuel prices, weather contribute to slow start to fishing season in Goa||PANAJI: The start to this year’s fishing season is seemingly slower and rife with challenges compared to the pre-pandemic era. While delays in arrival of the workforce in Goa, even weeks after the start of the fishing season, is a common scene, this year the pandemic has further delayed the arrival of crew members. Cutbona Fishing Boat Owners’ Association president Frank Martins said that less than 40% of the trawlers from the Cutbona jetty have been able to venture into the sea. “A majority of the trawlers are still anchored by the dock.” At the Malim jetty, the situation is even worse, with only five to 10% of the vessels venturing into the sea. “Our workers usually wait until August 15 to return to Goa. This time, some are taking even longer. We are hoping that the labour force will come by the first week of September so that at least 70 to 75% of the trawlers can start operations,” Mandovi Fisheries Cooperative Society member Francisco Fernandes said. While trawler owners lament a slow start owing to limited crew, the season has been an “absolutely no start for purse seine boat owners,” according to owners of the large vessels. Unlike trawlers, purse seine boats require a greater work force as they stay at sea for anywhere between two to three weeks. Moreover, if rising fuel rates weren’t already enough of a burden for fishing boat owners to get started, they now also have to bear the fuel cost of bus transport being arranged to bring the workers from their respective states to Goa. “Like last year, we may have to send buses to Jharkhand or other states to bring back our crew members. Diesel rates have increased by 40% and the cost of transportation is extremely high,” a purseiner said. With the minimum cost of ferrying one person amounting to Rs 6,000, this results in an expenditure of nearly Rs 2 lakh to transport a bus full of 35-40 passengers. “The Tamil Nadu government has given its fishing boat operators VAT reimbursement on diesel cost. If the Goa government doesn’t do something similar, the state’s fishing industry will collapse,” All Goa Purse Seine Boat Owners’ Association president Harshad Dhond said. And, for vessels that are equipped with both fuel and crew, it’s the weather that’s playing spoilsport. “The sea is slightly rough owing to which we are not venturing too far. There is mostly mackerel in the part of the sea that we can access, and even that catch is poor. We are able to fetch only about half to one ton of fish in a day. It is not a very productive start to the season,” a trawler owner from Cutbona jetty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/limited-crew-rising-fuel-prices-weather-contribute-to-slow-start-to-fishing-season/articleshow/85471423.cms||Nida Sayed

Onam is a 10-day harvest festival celebrated in Kerala which ends on August 23 this year. Loss of loved ones is also a major reason why grieving Malayalis are opting to not indulge in this year’s festivities. “I have lost many of my close friends and neighbours not just in Kerala but also in Goa. It’s a very unfortunate situation and we are not exactly in the festive mood,” said PC Prasad, secretary of All India Malayali Association – Goa. Members of the community said that there will be no sarvajanik celebrations with a common sadhya (feast meal) this year, but the Ayyappa temple in Goa will have the ritual prayer and pookalam (flower art) on display. There are a total of 14 organisations across Goa that represent the community and they come together to collaborate for the ten-day festival annually. “Earlier all Malayali organisations would get together to hold programmes that extend up to October. Due to Covid-19 we are not organising any offline events over the course of the 10 days. We will largely be celebrating the festival at our respective homes only,” said Vasco resident, Vasu Nair. The associations usually raise money during the festival for social causes. Last year the money was used to distribute ration and Covid-19 kits which continued this year as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/malayalis-in-goa-opt-for-low-key-onam-festivities-this-year/articleshow/85471569.cms||---

The latest project under consideration for approval by the government is the Rs 130 crore underground cabling work of Mapusa city. Approval is expected soon following which the work order will be placed and work initiated. The electricity department which is covering major cities and towns is in the planning stage of conversion of overhead to underground cables of Vasco city, chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni said. In some areas conversion of existing overhead 11 KV and low-tension lines to underground system are on the verge of completion- major portions of Old Goa, Cumbharjua, Saligao and Britona. Orders for conversion of overhead lines to underground cabling of the 11 kv Hodar feeder, part Xelvona feeder and 11 kv Kakoda IDC feeder, have been placed. The department has also taken up the work of conversion of high and low tension overhead lines to covered conductors in Querim, Veling, Priol and Cuncolim in Priol constituency through additional central assistance to tribal sub scheme. Similar work has also been taken up at Tivre-Orgao, Bhoma-Adcolna and VP Betki- Khandola in Priol. Other major works of laying underground 33 kv double circuit cable from Porvorim substation to Saligao substation, conversion, work of conversion of overhead to underground in Cuncolim Industrial Estate, bifurcation of Balli feeder, underground cabling at Fatorda, Porvorim under phase I, underground cabling in Curchorem, conversion of overhead to underground at Anjuna under the NCRMP scheme funded by World Bank, Margao industrial estate at Nessai, Cortalim feeder benefiting areas falling under Quelossim panchayat areas and underground cabling of Netravali feeder in Sanguem. The department has also replaced around 2.24 lakh electro-mechanical and non- working meters with electronic meters with 60 percent grants from the central government. This enables recording of actual consumption of energy instead of being billed on minimum/ average billing, an engineer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-130cr-underground-power-cabling-for-mapusa-soon/articleshow/85471744.cms||---

Around five basalt quarries are in operation at Boracachi-Gally at Uguem in Sanguem taluka. Locals said that one of the quarry leases has expired, but operations are still on. Uguem resident Diego Martin told TOI that most quarries have been carrying out excavations extremely deep, beyond the permissible limit, creating huge ponds. “Water gets accumulated in the ponds during monsoon and it is dangerous for the people residing around the quarries if they fall in the ponds,” said Martin. Fernandes said that the lease holders are discharging the dirty accumulated water from the ponds into the nearby nullah by using heavy duty pumps. The water from the nullah directly flows into the river. “People are using the nullah water which comes from the springs for drinking purposes, washing clothes and bathing,” said Martin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/uguem-locals-upset-over-effluent-discharge-from-basalt-quarries/articleshow/85471823.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Threatened Mahseer fish spotted in Goa's Mhadei||KERI: The threatened freshwater fish species ‘Mahseer’ has now been found in the Mhadei river and its tributaries. The ‘Pistyachi kond’ situated on the Kelil-Krishnapur border in Karnataka and Cadwal in Sattari have provided the ideal habitat for the Mahseer on account of the perfect flow regimes for spawning, deep pools, various trees along the bank, loose sand at the bottom and huge boulders restraining the flow. The fish belonging to Cyprinidae (carps) family is a commercially important species and considered as threatened due to increasing pollution, habitat loss, introduction of invasive fishes and over fishing. It is also regarded as the tiger among the fish. The presence of this once abundant species has now shrunk to a few small pockets. With protection being accorded by villagers of Krishnapur in Karnataka and also of Savarde and Nagargao panchayat areas of Sattari, the Mahseer has been thriving. “Local people believe in the Pisto, the guardian spirit, and do not dare fish here. During broad daylight one can enjoy an enthralling sight of the Mahseer fish in large congregation at Pistyachi kond,” Vithoba Gaude from Caranzol, Sattari said. In April 2020, Umeed Mistry an aquatic wildlife photographer captured images of the Mahseer at Pistyachi kond which showcases natural beauty of these fishes. The images have brought the presence of the Mahseer in and around Goa’s borders to the limelight. The fish species are known to choose definite and special spawning grounds which are usually rich in dissolved oxygen content and cool water temperature. They are highly sensitive to the slight alternations to their environment and spawning habitats. Vidyadhar Atkore, a researcher and aquatic ecologist from Karnataka, said, “The Deccan Mahseer can be seen just below Dudhsagar waterfall and near Vasant Bandhara in the Bhagvan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park. After the monsoon one could easily see the young ones of Mahseer along with other fishes. It consumes plant parts, fruits, drifted insects, molluscs and shrimps.” “If damming and diversion on the Mhadei materialises it will pose a serious threat to the natural habitat of this fish,” Suryakant Gaonkar from Bhuipal, Sattari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/threatened-mahseer-fish-spotted-in-mhadei/articleshow/85472038.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Bhopal||44 new flights in 35 days, Madhya Pradesh’s dreams take UDAN||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh is flying high when it comes to air connectivity. In the past two months, around 44 new flights have been given to the state. Union aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has recently claimed to the media that he has started 44 new flights in the last 35 days from Madhya Pradesh. Scindia — who joined the BJP in March last year after a 19-year career in the Congress — was rewarded with the civil aviation portfolio in the last restructure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Council of ministers last month. The portfolio was once handled by his father, Madhavrao Scindia. Major cities benefited from the new flights are Gwalior, Jabalpur and Indore. During his recent visit to Indore, Scindia had said, “I am dedicated and it will be my endeavour to take India forward in the civil aviation sector under the leadership of the Prime Minister”. Notably, several newly added flights that have been started are under UDAN scheme. When contacted, director airport (Gwalior), Ajay Shrivastava told TOI that weekly frequency of flights has been increased from 56 to 78 in the past two months. “Cities like Pune, Ahmedabad and Mumbai were connected with Gwalior airport from July 16. From August 20, Mumbai and Jaipur will be connected. Besides, from September 1, Indore and Delhi will be connected.” He added that new flights have been started by SpiceJet and Indi-Go. Sources added that a few more flights are on the cards which are likely to start by the end of this year. “Connectivity with Gwalior has witnessed a major boost in the past few months. The frequency of flights from Gwalior airport per week will be increased from 78,” said a senior official without quoting his name. New cities to be connected with Gwalior include Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Jammu. Incidentally, Bhopal has a frequency of 26 flights daily. At present, Bhopal is connected with Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Prayagraj and Pune. Sources said that flights to Lucknow and Agra may also start soon. “It is likely that Bhopal will be again connected with Raipur in the near future,” said an official without quoting his name. Jabalpur has also witnessed a sudden boost in the flights’ movement. There were only 8 flights two months ago. Another 8 are being added. “We will have 16 new flights by the end of this month,” said director Jabalpur airport, Kusum Das. New flights for Mumbai and New Delhi will be launched from August 20. Besides, Indore and Hyderabad flights will take-off from August 28. From Indore, 6 new flights have been added. Surat and Gondia are the new destinations connected with Indore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/44-new-flights-in-35-days-madhya-pradeshs-dreams-take-udan/articleshow/85475263.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: After a year, cinemas open to tepid response but hope is alive||BHOPAL: Cinema halls and multiplexes opened to a lukewarm response from the public on Thursday, coinciding with the release of ‘Bell Bottom’ Multiplexes and single screen cinemas have stayed shut for most of the 18 months of the Covid pandemic, the shutdown beginning with the nation-wide lockdown in March 2020. People are still cautious although the government has allowed cinemas to reopen with struct Covid precautions. It was a small beginning on Thursday with the hope that things will get better. While cinema hall owners were more frank in expressing their disappointment over the response, Amber Saxena, general manager of Inox multiplex, which is screening the film in Capital Mall, appeared to be optimistic, saying, “Expecting the response of pre-Covid times is futile at the moment but people are coming for the shows. Cinemas have been allowed to operate after the second wave and there was greater presence for ‘Bell Bottom’ today”. Not all multiplexes have opened, though. President, Bhopal Cine Association, Deepak Simhal, said response continues to be “poor”. There is apprehension that cinemas may be closed down again if the third wave hits. “Though there are films like Amitabh Bachchan’s ‘Chehare’ and the next edition of ‘Fast & Furious’ ahead, if all the theatres start showing the same films, it won’t be viable even if more people start coming to cinemas and multiplexes,” he said. Bunny Singh, owner of Rangmahal Cineplex, which is also open for business’, appeared disappointed by the turnout. Talking to TOI, he said “Only 15 to 20 people are sitting to watch the film. Days of cinema halls are over. The producer has released the film on OTT platform as well. They want to recover the money they have invested in making the film. But, cinema halls can’t be run this way, they will close down again.” Pragya Pathak, who was among the first to buy a ticket at Jyoti Cineplex along with her friend Bhavya Mishra, when asked how she is feeling coming to the cinema hall to watch a film after such a long gap, said “We were not bereft of entertainment even while the cinema halls were closed. We were watching films on OTT platforms but cinema halls have opened after such a long time, we thought let’s watch a film in cinema halls before the third wave comes and we are prohibited from coming to cinema halls once again”. Bhavya said, “I am very happy. Being an actor I know it’s a different feeling watching a film on the big screen.” Like every other sector, those connected with the business of cinema are also keeping their fingers crossed and praying that vaccination halts the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-after-a-year-cinemas-open-to-tepid-response-but-hope-is-alive/articleshow/85475345.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Vadodara||Swift police action, mass awareness not proving enough in tribal Dahod||Vadodara: Since last month, four incidents of women being ‘punished’ in full public view have come to light in the Dahod district. While the police had swung into action and awareness drives were being held since the first incident came to light, three more incidents surfaced since. Registration of offences and arrests of accused are seemingly proving to be no deterrents. If police and activists are to be believed, merely law taking its course may not be enough to stop such incidents from happening in future. “In most cases, it is relatives who are involved. People are present at the place where the incident takes place, but nobody seems to intervene,” said Dahod superintendent of police, Hitesh Joysar. He pointed out that the awareness drives are now being stepped up to handle the situation on a war footing. The police have already said that there will be ‘zero tolerance’ for such acts. Most such incidents have at their roots the love affairs, particularly extra-marital relations. This leads to family members getting involved in mob justice. In Dahod, extra-marital affairs were responsible for mob justice in two incidents, while in one incident a girl was beaten up as it was believed that she was speaking to a boy on the phone. In the fourth incident, a woman speaking to members of a rival family was the trigger factor. Tribal activist and writer Kanji Patel said that extra-marital affairs used to take place earlier too, but seldom led to incidents like the present ones. “With interaction with the society, they are adopting religious and caste identities. Women are now treated like property and such treatment is meted out to them and videos are recorded to set an example and satisfy the egos of men,” said Patel. Patel pointed out that earlier such incidents were settled amongst themselves by the tribals. “The proliferation of electronic and social media too has also contributed to the rise in such incidents,” he said. The Dahod police too are looking to take action even on those who circulate such videos. “In some cases, the videos are such that they outrage the modesty of a woman. We will book those who circulate such videos under relevant provisions,” Joysar said. Joysar added that the police were working at two levels. “On the one hand, we are taking immediate action and, on the other, intensive awareness drives have been started. “The incidents have largely been taking place in areas where education is very low,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/swift-police-action-mass-awareness-not-proving-enough-in-tribal-dahod/articleshow/85467056.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Kolkata||Calcutta HC orders CBI probe into post-poll murders, rapes in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Thursday ordered a “court-monitored” CBI probe into cases of murder, rape and attempted rape during the poll process in Bengal and set up a special investigation team under the supervision of a retired Supreme Court judge to probe other criminal cases. Both the CBI and the special probe team — comprising senior IPS officers Suman Bala Sahoo, Soumen Mitra and Ranveer Kumar — will have to submit their reports in six weeks. A five-judge bench, led by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, also directed the NHRC, the state government and any other commission or committee that received complaints to hand over all records relating to murder and crime-against-women cases to the CBI. But all cases not related to poll violence would have to be handed back to the local police, the court said, adding that “any obstruction to investigation shall be taken seriously”. Acting CJ Bindal made it clear that both the CBI and the SIT would have to work under the court’s supervision. Three members of the bench — Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon and Soumen Sen — gave their “concurring judgments” separately. The court declined to specify any particular period for “post-poll violence” but included all complaints made during the entire election process, starting from the first day of polling (March 27). “If any offence was committed before declaration of results and had a connection with the election process, it too can be considered as part of post-poll violence,” the bench said. The state government was considering filing an appeal against the judgment in the Supreme Court “on some specific points”, Sanjay Basu, an advocate for the Bengal government, said. “Many asp-ects (of the judgment) vindicate our stand,” he claimed. The acting CJ, in the lead judgment, recorded the NHRC committee’s report, the state government’s “exception” petition to the NHRC report, the procedure adopted by the NHRC and commented on the allegations of “bias” against the NHRC and the Election Commission’s resp-onsibility. The court also noted the contradictions between the NHRC-led committee and the state government. The NHRC reported 13 rape cases, including two gang rapes where complainants had moved the SC; the state government reported one attempt-to-rape case. The NHRC reported 59 murders; the state government acknowledged 29. The bench also noted that police “closed” some cases after initiating FIRs suo motu. The judges dealt separately with the allegations of bias against three members of the NHRC because of their affiliation to a political party. “The allegation against the committee is not material because this court has considered not only the report but other materials, including the arguments of the counsels,” Justice Mukerji observed in his judgement. But, on some of the controversial NHRC observations, he observed that the NHRC panel “had no jurisdiction to make any recommendation or to express any opinion”. “We did not vest them with that power,” he said. Justice Sen, referring to this issue, said: “The fact-finding committee has made scathing remarks and made recommendations against politicians and police officers. I am of the view that such remarks and recommendations were uncalled for and to that extent the committee transgressed its limits.” Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal observed: “There was no objection from anyone when the committee was formed or when the committee started looking into the complaints. The three members against whom allegations were made were not the only members of the committee.” The five-judge bench also turned down the argument that law and order was under the EC till the new state cabinet took oath on May 5. “No such law or rule has been cited in support of the argument. The EC was in charge of holding free and fair elections in the state. That does not mean that police should stop discharging its duties of law and order,” acting CJ Bindal wrote in the judgement. But Justice Mukerji wrote in his order that it was “also true that the EC had directed the administration to transfer officials with administrative duties and post them according to its direction when it was in charge of the election”. “If offences had occurred as a consequence of polls, it was also the EC’s duty at least to direct or advise the administration to register complaints, which it did not. Furthermore, between the polls and assumption of office by the new government, the EC should have played a more positive role in directing the administration to register the complaints.” Basu, an advocate representing the Bengal government, said any possible move by the state in the SC would highlight some points. One, he said, was the fact that the state government had responded in detail to the NHRC charges but the HC still held that the state was in “denial mode”. And the discrepancy in NHRC and Bengal government data was because of an attempt by the NHRC to “play all incidents as post-poll violence”, Basu added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-orders-court-monitored-cbi-sit-probes-into-poll-violence/articleshow/85472540.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Kolkata bars to come under CCTV watch in 2 weeks, will share audio-visual data with excise dept||KOLKATA: All the city bars will now come under CCTV surveillance. The state excise has issued an order making installation of CCTV cameras mandatory for all restaurants which have bar licences. Some bar-cum-restaurants in the city already have CCTV installation, but a lot of them are yet to have this surveillance system. The bar-cum-restaurants will get two weeks’ time to implement the system. “In view of some recent incidents in more than one excise district, where the restrictions on hours of service of liquor were found to have been transgressed, all the foreign liquor ON establishments in excise districts are hereby required to ensure the following for the sake of a hassle-free and business-friendly compliance mechanism in the interest of public law and order,” the order says. As per the directive, every ‘ON’ category licensed establishment will have to install CCTV camera/s at the bars, additional bars in such a way that operations at such counters can be clearly captured. The devices installed should capture audio-visual data and not just visual data. “The cameras in question may commence capturing such audio-visual data every evening from one hour before the scheduled hour of closure, depending on whatever such hour of closure may be on a given day, till 4am on the following morning. Such recording of data may be done over the same duration even on the days when no liquor is mandated to be served,” it said. “The management of all such licensed establishments may share such data access with the authorized excise officials who should be in a position to check on their own electronic device as to whether closure hours are being abided by. Such data should be preserved at least for the next 30 days following the date of recording and the same should be presented for inspection in case asked for the same for any official purpose,” the directive added. According to excise sources, the licensed establishments themselves will be responsible for such installations and they may get it done by any expert agency. The positioning of the cameras will cover the movements around the bar counter, entry and exit points of the bar and additional bars. Sources pointed out that the video surveillance system should provide video feeds at full HD resolution at minimum 25 frames per second (FpS). The digital cameras of video surveillance systems should be such that the live video feeds of ‘ON’ shops are made available through web browsers to excise authorities. Peter Cat and Mocambo owner Nitin Kothari said they would comply with the order within the time frame. “We already have CCTVs and are installing some at bar counters,” he added. Director of Chapter 2, Debaditya Chowdhury, said they have already installed CCTV cameras. Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, also said they have already installed the system. Charles Mantosh, owner of Floriana, Waldorf and Moulin Rouge, also said that he would abide by the law but added that somebody might have made a mistake by adding the audio data part in the order.

During the season, nearly 350 shacks are set up along the state’s beach stretches, with the majority being along the coastal belt of Calangute, Baga and Candolim. The tourist season in Goa starts in October and closes by May-end. “Beach shacks have done badly for the last two seasons and so we hear that some may not be setting up shacks for the upcoming season. But we will start renewing their licences from next month. Let them decide if they want to or not,” the tourism official said. The last season, due to the second wave, all shacks had shut operations three months before the season could end, while the year before that they were compelled to close earlier than usual due to the pandemic-related lockdown. The cost of setting up a beach shack can be anything between Rs 2 lakh to Rs 4 lakh. This cost can still go higher if allottees opt for fancy decor. Though the material used for setting up a shack is reusable, 10% wear and tear can’t be avoided, a shack allottee from Calangute said. He said beach shack operators at Calangute, Candolim and Baga are trendsetters in terms of decor. “Some even have mini-ramps to hold fashion shows and ultra-music systems. A few even hire DJs on certain days when it is expected that footfalls will be more. Naturally, the cost of operation soars,” the shack owner said. Naturally, when footfalls drop, it is not easy to sustain operations, he said. Last season, the government had given a 50% discount on licence fees to beach shacks. The beach shacks have made a plea this year seeking relaxation in fees. The tourism official said the government hasn’t decided on their request yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-slow-restart-tourism-dept-decides-to-renew-shack-licences/articleshow/85470476.cms||---
---||Goa||In ODF Goa, no data on open defecation in urban areas||PANAJI: Goa was officially declared an open defecation free (ODF) state in September 2019, but while it is not surprising to find people with no access to toilets still, what is concerning is the lack of government data on the number of homes without lavatories. The government had an interesting reply to give during the recently held monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly when urban development minister Milind Naik was questioned if he was aware that open defecation still happens in municipal areas. “No information was available about open defecation in municipal areas,” Naik stated in his written reply. While most municipalities provided information about the number of houses in their respective jurisdictions with toilet facilities, Margao Municipal Council had no data. It has been asked to conduct a survey and provide an individual household latrine (IHHL) to every household. An official from the urban development department said that the Margao municipality has not been able to complete the task of providing latrines to those households under the government scheme where applicants have not been able to make available space for setting up the facility. “Wherever space is a problem, we are going for community toilets. The problem has been in areas that are congested, and no space is available for building toilets,” the official said. He said the scheme is still open and those who do not have toilets can apply. In all other municipal areas the work has been completed. Similarly, the Mapusa Municipal council also does not have data on the number of houses in its jurisdiction that have toilets with the septic tank. Under the jurisdiction of the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), as per service level benchmark, 85% of the area is covered under sewerage network services and as per the Census 2011, as many as 3,840 households have toilets with a septic tank. The officer said there may be some exceptions, but it is seen that even people who give spaces on rent in shanties provide toilet facilities for their tenants. Builders are also required to provide sanitary facilities for labourers who stay on construction sites. A sanitary inspector regularly conducts inspections, he said. However, a citizen Praveen Naik (name changed) said that except for big real estate agencies, smaller contractors do not provide their labourers with toilets. “Open defecation is common at such sites. Workers bathe along the road ride and throw waste in the open. The civic bodies collect the waste of registered residence. Any guesses where that waste must be going?” Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-odf-goa-no-data-on-open-defecation-in-urban-areas/articleshow/85470492.cms||Bindiya Chari

Though the rise is marginal, experts have stressed on continuous monitoring of the situation. Along with Kolkata, health officials are also seeing a rise in positivity rate in a few other districts, including the neighbouring Howrah and South 24 Parganas districts and also Darjeeling. The public health wing of Swasthya had prepared the weekly data for three weeks starting from July 19 till August 15. The data sheet with various aspects, including weekly positivity, number of tests, deaths, active cases and recovery rate pertaining to each district, has been prepared to see the current trend in the state. According to the data, the case positivity rate in Kolkata was 1.6% between July 19 and 25. It rose to 1.9% the next week. Even as it had dipped to 1.7% the following week, the rate again climbed to 1.9% between August 9 and 15. “Even if the rise is not sharp, we need to keep a tab. If the rising trend persists for a few weeks, it should sound an alarm bell for us. In such a case, we can find out the reason behind the rise, zero in on the problem and try to implement the solution as quickly as possible before the situation turns worse,” said a senior health department doctor. Hospitals in the city have been seeing a gradual rise in number of patients. Many hospitals had started recording patients in single digit in the first two weeks of July. But now most hospitals have patients in double digits. In Howrah, the positivity rate, which stood at 1.9% between July 19 and 25, shot up to 2.2% between August 9 and 15. In South 24 Parganas, it climbed from 1.5% to 1.7% during the same period. “The most worrisome district, however, is Darjeeling where the positivity rate jumped from 2.7% to 3.3%. During these two weeks, the average weekly positivity rate for the state was 1.60% and 1.61%, respectively,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. The Union health ministry two weeks ago had mentioned about Darjeeling being a cause of concern. Jalpaiguri, Bankura, West Midnapore and Malda are some other districts where positivity rate is on a slight rise. The number of fresh positive cases as well as deaths across the state on Thursday went up to 731 and 12, respectively, from 643 and seven reported on Wednesday. Unlike the tail end of the first wave, when the number of cases had plunged to only about 200 or less per day and remained this way for a good part of February and March, this time, even as the cases have come down drastically, the daily average number has remained around the 700 -mark for weeks now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/marginal-positivity-rise-in-kol-suburbs/articleshow/85468790.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

There are a total of 3,499 taxis registered in the series of which 796 have either installed or booked for the device. This means that 2,703 taxis are likely to face cancellation of their vehicle permit for failure to comply with the directorate of transport’s orders as per the high court of Bombay at Goa’s directive. “The fitments (for the remaining series) will continue and we are complying with the high court’s directions,” director of transport, Rajan Satardekar told TOI. There was poor response for the fitment of the preceding series — vehicles registered in the zero to one series — as well. There are 3,584 taxi operators in the this series, but only 137 vehicles installed the digital meter before the deadline in July against 513 bookings made for fitments. The directorate of transport has already issued nearly 3,000 orders for cancellation of taxi permit in the zero to one series, Satardekar said. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that permits of the defaulting taxis will be cancelled if they fail to oblige by the directive by the due date. The department will now take up the next series in line and set a fresh deadline for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fitment-of-taxi-meters-in-2-3-series-sees-poor-turnout/articleshow/85470605.cms||Nida Sayed

This, however is a one-time measure aimed at providing financial assistance to families of the students. In April 2020, the department of public instruction had undertaken the distribution of provisions and milk powder to students, who were unable to attend schools, shut owing to the pandemic. Joint director of midday meal scheme MR Maruti said that the government had in its database details of the bank accounts of 50% of the students, who were beneficiaries of the midday meal scheme. “Soon, all students will get the amount that would have been used for the preparation of midday meals for the 50 days,” he said. Sources said the cost of cooking one meal for students from classes one to five was estimated at around Rs 5, while the sum was Rs 7.5 for those in classes VI to IX. However, students in classes IX and X will not receive compensation since it is the state government that bears the expenses for their meals. General secretary of Government Teachers’Association Chandrashekar Nuggi said, “Teachers have been directed to ensure all students open a zero-balance bank account into which the money can be credited. We welcome the Centre’s initiative. The government never stopped supply of provisions to the students’ families. Payment of cooking cost will them further.” Parents are understandably pleased. “The salt and other provisions supplied by the DPI are of good quality. Keeping students engaged through such social welfare initiatives is a good decision,” said Ravi Kumar, parent of a Mysuru-based student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/centre-will-credit-cooking-cost-to-44-lakh-midday-meal-beneficiaries/articleshow/85465459.cms||Shrinivasa M
---||Goa||Goa: Panchayats to get accounting system, says minister Mauvin Godinho||PANAJI: The state government has decided to introduce a proper accounting system in all the 191 panchayats in the state to increase their revenue and make them financially sustainable. Panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho said that he has already moved a file to start double entry accounting system and proper auditing in all panchayats. “Ultimately when we call them local self-governing bodies they should also learn to stand on their own feet in the long run,” he said. Godinho said that the Institute of Charter Accountants of India (western region) has said that “we will see that this happens and we are ready to collaborate”. He said that the Goa Institute of Public administration and Rural Development (GIPARD) will train the panchayat members and others in panchayat areas. Asked if panchayats will be ready to take help from charter accountants, Godinho said, “All over India that practice is already being followed, and all the panchayats have done it and we are lagging behind. We have to follow it.” He said he will call a joint meeting with GIPARD, director of panchayats, representatives of charter accountants to work out some schedule to training the panchayat members. He said that it is part of reforms and we have to move with the times and see that proper systems are followed even in the panchayats. Referring to the non-collection of house tax by most of the panchayats, Godinho said that by adopting proper accounting system, even such things would fall in place. “Panchayats would be forced to collect the house tax,” he said. Asked whether panchayats will be able to adopt to an accounting system given their financial weakness, Godinho said that the state will help the smaller panchayats and if such a situation arises then the state will give them grants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panchayats-to-get-accounting-system-godinho/articleshow/85470816.cms||---

Police said a PSI of Vastrapur police got an input that two men and two women entered a hotel in Thaltej and were thought to be holding a booze party. Acting on the input, a team of Vastrapur police reached the hotel and inquired with the receptionist about the four persons. They were told that they had booked a room on the third floor to celebrate the birthday of one them. A police team went upstairs and knocked on the door of room number 307 and the birthday boy, a 21-year-old youth from Gandhinagar, opened the door. The cops then barged in and found that two women, aged around 21 and 19, residents of Bodakdev and Paldi, and a man, 21, a resident of Thaltej, were having beer. A police officer said that they found two empty beer cans shared by the four and the third one was still unopened. Cops seized the unopened beer can and on checking all the four youths found them to be intoxicated. Police also seized a packet of namkeen and a water bottle as ‘muddamal’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/four-students-caught-at-thaltej-booze-party-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/85475489.cms||---

The society has alleged that the government went behind its back and didn’t follow due process of law. “We expect that state of affairs as on date would not be disturbed till next date,” the division bench of the high court comprising Justices Sunil Deshmukh and Mahesh Sonak stated at the last hearing. Sociedade has questioned the government’s move of “correcting” the records of rights without issuing them any notice and without giving them an opportunity of being heard in the matter. The petitioner is alleging that instead of 173 hectares of land, the government reverted to itself more than 360 hectares of land illegally in Ugem, Costi and Patiem villages of Sanguem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-ugem-land-matter-hc-seeks-replies-from-govt/articleshow/85470943.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Apex court seeks info from Madhya Pradesh govt on school fee order||BHOPAL: The Supreme Court Thursday asked the Director of School Education of Madhya Pradesh to compile details regarding compliance of directions given by the state high court last year that schools can recover only tuition fees from students during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Madhya Pradesh high court had also said in last year's November 4 order that there shall not be increment in fee for academic session 2020-21. It had further stated that when the government declares pandemic is over and schools return to normal physical functioning, the district committee shall within 30 days from such declaration take decision on increment of fees for remaining period of the session. The apex court, which was hearing pleas against the high court order, said the details received from the respective district committees regarding compliance of directions given to the schools shall be displayed on the official website of the education department of the state. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna said if the students of the academic year 2020-2021 have any grievance regarding non-compliance of directions given by the high court, they can make representation to the district level committee. Court ordered salary of teachers, staff to be paid on timeWe direct the Director, school education, of state of Madhya Pradesh to compile the details from the respective district committees about compliances made by the concerned schools within the concerned district and display that information on the official website of education department of the state of Madhya Pradesh,” the bench said, adding the high court order pertained to academic session 2020-2021. It said if the data displayed by the education department on the official website is discrepant in any manner, it would be open for the schools to bring that to the notice of the concerned authority. During the arguments, advocate Mayank Kshirsagar, appearing for some of the petitioners who are parents, argued that the high court had said that schools can only charge tuition fee but there was no protection in case of non-payment of fee. Kshirsagar claimed that some of the schools have clubbed other charges in the tuition fees. "You have to ask your officers to ensure that order of the high court is implemented in letter and spirit," the bench told the counsel appearing for the state. The high court had passed the order on a batch of petitions filed by parents, teachers or employees of unaided CBSE schools and others which emanated from the notifications issued last year by the Central Board of Secondary Education and school education department of Madhya Pradesh regarding payment of fee in private unaided schools amid the Covid-19 induced lockdown period during the pandemic. It had also directed that salaries of teaching and nonteaching staff shall be regularly paid on the due date. “In case if any reduced salary is paid, the reduction shall not be more than 20 per cent and arrears towards reduced amount shall be paid with the restoration of normalcy in six monthly equal installments,” the high court had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/apex-court-seeks-info-from-madhya-pradesh-govt-on-school-fee-order/articleshow/85475515.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pavements to make way for wider flanks at Chingrighata crossing||KOLKATA: The pavements on either side of EM Bypass at Chingrighata will be temporarily demolished to increase the width of the two flanks and prevent a traffic bottleneck during the construction of a Metro pier. Officials of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL), the implementing agency of the New Garia-Airport corridor, said barricading of the road around the median divider will reduce the width of both the Ultadanga-bound and Science City-bound flanks. Since this is an extremely busy stretch where reduced carriageway could lead to traffic snarls, the pavements will be demolished to broaden the carriageway and compensate for the 15m that will be cordoned off. This will ensure smooth traffic flow on both directions during the 45-day construction period. “We will be taking up one-fourth of the road, 4m on either side of the centre point where the pier will be constructed. The pier itself will occupy 5m space. Thus, 15metres will be barricaded,” an RVNL engineer said. Construction is set to start in September and will continue till after Pujas. A narrow pavement will be constructed along the start of the new road space for pedestrians. RVNL will later construct a pedestrian subway at the intersection. Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), the agency that maintains EM Bypass, had asked RVNL to drop the pier (no. 318) so that the road remained encroachment-free. This had led to an impasse that was finally cleared after engineers from IIT-Kharagpur judged the pier indispensable to the project. The pier, after construction, will occupy 4.1 sqm space. RVNL, Kolkata Police and KMDA conducted a joint inspection of the site last Thursday. The former shared an elaborate plan on how traffic could flow once 15.3m in the middle of the crossing is barricaded. A 132KV CESC underground cable will also be shifted along with water pipelines, sewerage line, street lights and traffic signals. The traffic signal is currently at the spot where pier 318 is due to come up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pavements-to-make-way-for-wider-flanks-at-chingrighata-crossing/articleshow/85467958.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
