The Global Tuna Alliance, made up of retailers and tuna suppliers, said, “At the IOTC meeting in June, scientific advice called for a catch below 403,000mt to rebuild the stock. The IOTC reached an agreement to limit catch in 2022 to 401,011 mt. Three member states have now objected to the plan, forcing the sustainability of Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna back into the danger zone, and compromising the efforts made by the majority of nations willing to follow scientific advice.” Since objecting member states will not have to implement the measure and instead be bound by previous catch limits, the Alliance calculates they could increase the total 2022 catch by 48,140mt, if their 2022 catches equal their 2019 catches — far exceeding the scientific advice. In its letter of objection, India said, “Fisheries is a major source of employment and food security for four million Indian marine fisher populations, who undertake fishing by multi-gear and multi-species non-selective fisheries, mostly confined in near-shore coastal areas. Most of these small boats do not target tuna but tuna is recorded as bycatch.” The letter, written by I A Siddiqui of the department of fisheries, said it was difficult to implement catch reductions for a non-targeted species in such small-scale fisheries. “India is of the opinion that large-scale industrial fishing fleets of developed and distant water fishing nations that are engaged in targeted fishing of yellowfin tuna are mainly responsible for the present status of stock of yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean, and such fleets shall bear the major responsibility by reducing their catch. Putting the burden of responsibility on small-scale fishers and impacting the livelihood of millions of resource-poor fishers may not be a wise decision,” it said. The Global Tuna Alliance, however, said that it is just for this reason that the scientific advice for this iconic species must be adhered to. “Local populations in nations like India will be hardest hit when their source of income and food is depleted by ongoing overfishing. It is about taking measures now, to protect livelihoods in the long term,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/india-accused-of-derailing-efforts-to-protect-yellowfin-tuna-stocks-in-indian-ocean/articleshow/85747944.cms||NAOMI CANTON

India recorded more than 2.9 lakh fresh Covid cases in the week (August 23-29), a 32% jump from the tally in the preceding seven days. This was the highest number of weekly infections since the June 28-July 4 week when 3.05 lakh cases were recorded. Kerala alone reported over 1.9 lakh cases, a massive 55% rise from the previous week's tally of nearly 1.25 lakh. This was the highest number of infections recorded in the state in 14 weeks since May 16-23 and the highest in any Indian state in 13 weeks. Coronavirus live updatesNot since the early days of the pandemic has any single state accounted for two-thirds of all Covid cases in the country in a week. That Kerala currently appears to be in a league of its own can be gauged from the fact that none of the state's neighbours -- Karnataka and Tamil Nadu -- have reported any significant rise in numbers this week. The only other large state where weekly Covid numbers seem to have risen is Maharashtra, which recorded a marginal increase of less than 1%. Kerala, meanwhile, also became the second state in the country after Maharashtra to record more than 4 million (40 lakh) cases of the coronavirus so far. Kerala crossed the grim milestone on Sunday, when the state recorded 29,836 new cases. Maharashtra's total caseload is over 64.5 lakh. India recorded a 10.5% rise in deaths from the virus during the week. There were 3,439 fatalities in the period as opposed to 3,111 in the previous week. Meanwhile, India logged more than 40,000 daily cases for the fifth straight day, with Sunday's tally at 43,399 (with Jharkhand figures yet to arrive). The day saw 373 deaths while the number of active cases rose by around 7,000 to nearly 3.8 lakh. Of these, more than 2.1 lakh were in Kerala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-cases-up-32-to-8-week-high-2/3rd-are-from-kerala/articleshow/85752080.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The defence ministry (MoD) has delivered a stern message to the arms companies, seeking repeated time extensions to discharge their offsets commitments, that it won’t be business as usual any longer, say top sources. “This is the first time the MoD has shown its teeth in such a manner. A warning has been issued that if companies do not fulfil their offsets obligations in a timely manner, their existing performance bank guarantees in other contracts could be forfeited or deductions made from scheduled payments to them,” said a source. “If these options are not available against a company, then a show-cause notice will be issued to explain why it should not be banned. The US company in question, which was earlier issued five-six notices to discharge its offsets obligations, is contesting the show-cause notice to ban it. The MoD, however, has a strong case,” he added. Under the defence offsets policy first promulgated in 2005, at least 30% of the total contract value in a deal had to be ploughed back into India as re-investments. The offsets in some contracts, like the Rs 59,000 crore one for 36 French Rafale fighters inked in 2016, has been set at 50%. Overall, India has inked around 55 defence offset contracts with a total value of around $12 billion (Rs 87,600 crore) till now. “But only around $5 billion have been discharged so far, some of which is still under clarification or examination. The figure should have been much higher by now but companies are dragging their feet in fulfilling contractual obligations,” said an official. In a report tabled in Parliament in September last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) had called for a major overhaul of the entire offsets policy, stressing it had “scarcely met the objectives” of inducting advanced technology, attracting FDI and bolstering the domestic defence industrial base. The offsets policy mandates a foreign original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to discharge offsets through a combination of permissible avenues if it bags a capital procurement deal of over Rs 2,000 crore. Earlier, the threshold limit was fixed at Rs 300 crore. MoD officials admit arms companies “load extra costs” into contracts, often increasing the price by around 8-10% to cater for their offset commitments. Some reforms in the offsets policy were included in the revised Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) last year, with a renewed thrust on attracting investment and transfer of technology for defence manufacturing by assigning higher multipliers to them. Offsets in government-to-government deals and “ab initio single-vendor deals” were also abolished in the new DAP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-warns-arms-companies-of-action-for-default-in-offset-commitments/articleshow/85752556.cms||Rajat Pandit

Farthing tweeted: “Arrived Heathrow with partial success of #OpArk Mixed emotions & true deep feeling of sadness for Afghan today.” Arrived Heathrow with partial success of #OpArk Mixed emotions & true deep feeling of sadness for Afghan today. Hea… https://t.co/fPWqTa8IeD— Pen Farthing (@PenFarthing) 1630249317000His Norwegian wife, Kaisa Markhus, who was working for a Norwegian NGO in Kabul, was waiting for him at the airport. She had been evacuated from Kabul on 20 August. Farthing is now spending time with her in Oslo. The animals were given check-ups at the Heathrow animal reception centre and have now been dispersed to different quarantine kennels around the UK, where they will have to stay for up to six months, depending on when they had their rabies vaccine. His dramatic escape from the Taliban began when a Boeing 727 plane flew from Karachi to Kabul airport to pick him and his animals up on Saturday evening. Farthing had got inside the airport 24 hours earlier with 170 animals, but without his Afghan veterinary staff, in a rescue mission dubbed Operation Ark. He then spent 24 hours waiting inside an aircraft hangar with the dogs and cats loaded onto trucks whilst Kabul airport was under constant threat of attack. He fed and watered them, but at one point the animals were so dehydrated that a US marine had to spray the trucks down with a hosepipe. After the charter plane landed in Kabul, British military stationed in Kabul airport, which by then had finished evacuating people back to the UK, helped load the crates of dogs and cats onto the plane. Then it flew to an undisclosed neighbouring country where they all switched onto a Boeing 767 plane to fly to London. Apart from rescued strays, the animals onboard included all the British embassy cats from Kabul, some cats from the United Nations in Kabul, and a few others that individual expat contractors had left with Farthing since they were not allowed to take them on their repatriation flights. But Farthing, CEO and founder of the Nowzad charity, was not able to bring his 68 Afghan veterinary staff and their dependents, who work for his animal shelter in Kabul back to Britain –- even though they had all got on the approved list for entrance to the UK, and found jobs for them in Britain. Some of the animals have already been adopted and the others will be adopted. “There won’t be any shortage of homes for them to go to. We have had a lot of interest," said independent vet Dr Iain McGill, who was co-opted onto the rescue mission. McGill set off at 6am on Saturday on a commercial flight to the unnamed neighbouring country, together with Dan Tatsch, a Nowzad board member, to meet Farthing off his flight from Kabul. “The animals were generally in pretty good shape. I was amazed at what good shape they were in. We were expecting the Nowzad vets and nurses would be there to help us, but owing to the fact they couldn’t come, it was myself, Pen and Dan, who offloaded them and loaded them onto the larger plane and we checked them over.” Asked how Farthing was, he said: “Pen has had an incredibly stressful time, but he is a very tough guy. He himself was in good shape, but was very concerned he did not manage to get his staff out and very concerned for all the other people who are still suffering and could not get out. It was bittersweet really. We didn’t manage to get the staff out, which was the biggest part of the mission, and so we still have work to do." The animals all arrived at Heathrow alive, he said, but two, including a puppy, are on a drip and have had to be hospitalised. Thirty-five of the dogs had already been cleared for entry to UK and so within a few days will be able to go straight to their new owners. Three of these are Farthing's own rescue dogs. Farthing lives in the UK but had been stuck in Kabul since March 2020 when he had travelled there with supplies for his animal shelter and flights stopped owing to the pandemic. His group had been caught up in the hellish scenes on Thursday when Isis-K bombs killed at least 170 people, including 13 US service members. On Thursday they had first tried to leave Afghanistan. But when they got inside the airport gate, the Taliban refused to allow his Afghan staff to go inside any further, saying they did not have the right paperwork, even though they had a letter from the UK government confirming they were on an approved list to enter the UK. The Taliban told Farthing that US president Joe Biden had changed the entry requirements a couple of hours earlier stating Afghans needed passports with visas stamps, and such letters were not sufficient. Farthing was forced to turn around and go back to the shelter with the animals and staff, driving through teargas and dodging Taliban bullets en route. That night he and his staff made the difficult decision he should leave the next day with just the animals. “They wanted him to leave because they were worried about his security and also that his continual presence there might be making it more dangerous for them, as he had become so high profile together with the dogs, that they thought the Taliban could end up killing the dogs, so they decided for the good of the animals and his safety and theirs, it was probably better he left and took them”, his campaign coordinator Dominic Dyer told TOI. “It was not an easy decision. They are pleased he has landed in the UK and that he is safe and the animals are safe, as they were deeply concerned about the welfare of the animals. They are ok at the moment, so far, from what we know - it is the next few weeks which will be very challenging. We will explore all avenues as to how we might be able to get them safely to the UK in due course,” Dyer said. Both charter planes were paid for by wealthy US businessman Spencer Haber, founder of USA-based animal rescue non-profit H/3 Foundation Inc. Farthing had thought he may have to euthanise some animals prior to leaving, but Haber wanted him to take them all. “He made it clear even if they were not very well he would pay for their care,” Dyer said. Farthing started Nowzad as a dog shelter in 2007 when he was a Royal Marine commando serving in Afghanistan. It then developed into an animal shelter, laboratory and surgery clinic in Kabul which rescues and rehomes cat and dogs, carries out a neutering and vaccination programme and is a training ground for trainee Afghan vets. Three of his staff are the first ever Afghan national female vets, all in their 20s.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pen-farthing-lands-at-heathrow-with-170-cats-and-dogs-from-afghanistan/articleshow/85752680.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Speaking in the context of Pakistan while delivering an address at the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington, Tamil Nadu, Singh said India has demonstrated its resolve that not only will it end terrorism on its own land but will also not hesitate to hit the adversary on its territory if needed. Turning to the continuing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, he said a unilateral attempt was made last year to change the status quo on the northern borders, which also led to the Galwan Valley clashes. “Here too, we have faced our adversary with a new dynamism. Our soldiers displayed bravery as well as restraint, when required, to thwart enemy plans,” he said. The minister said the country’s enemies no longer need to enter our borders. “They can also target our security apparatus from outside the border. Alignment and realignment of global powers have added to these already changing security challenges.” “The changing equations in Afghanistan are a recent and important example of this. These circumstances have forced every country to re-think its strategy today. The Quad, a group of India, US, Australia and Japan, has been constituted keeping these things in mind,” he added. Singh said “some evil forces” have resorted to various methods to try and create an atmosphere of instability in India ever since Independence, but the armed forces have ensured the country’s unity and integrity is maintained. “When our neighboring country (Pakistan) realised that it cannot fight a frontal war with us, it resorted to proxy war and made terrorism an integral part of its state policy. This was a major paradigm shift in the challenges faced by our country,” he said. Referring to the cross-border “surgical” and the Balakot air strikes on terror camps, Singh said they changed the reactionary mindset into a proactive one. “Despite the challenges on India’s border, the people are now confident that there will be no compromise on national security,” he said. “There is a strong belief that India would not only end terror on its own land, but if needed it would not hesitate to end terrorism anywhere else. This change defines a new era of national security in India,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/afghanistan-situation-a-challenge-led-to-strategy-rethink/articleshow/85752801.cms||---

Currently, pilgrims have to take a long trek to Kedarnath from Gaurikund and though there is a limited chopper service, many find it expensive. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited bids for preparing the feasibility and detailed project reports for eight ropeway links in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh connecting the most sought after pilgrimage and tourist sites. The authority has been tasked with developing ropeways in these two hill states. The identified ropeway links include connectivity to Tara Devi temple, Hattu Peak, Chunja glacier and Bharmani temple in Himachal Pradesh with a combined length of 42.5 km in the state. Three links have been proposed in Uttarakhand with a combined length of 29km, including a ropeway link to Hanuman temple in Nainital and Ghangaria in Chamoli. According to the bid document, the consultant will identify critical success factors for these projects, suggest the best suitable standards considering the project function and location and estimate the current and future demand potential. Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari had recently urged the Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir governments to explore the possibility of more ropeway links to boost tourism and economic activities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-ropeways-are-going-to-help-in-pilgrims-progress/articleshow/85752938.cms||Dipak K Dash

Similarly, when it comes to promoting exports, the government has pushed traditional produce, such as cashews from Goa or chillies from Guntur. But the one-district one-product (ODOP) strategy, being pursued by the commerce department as part of the recently unveiled export strategy, is seeking to change that. Not that the traditional items in the basket have been given a go by, but newer ones have entered. So, while South Goa’s Feni and Muzaffarpur’s Shahi litchis and Darjeeling Tea do occupy a majority of the slots in the initial list of 106 products, there are some surprise additions — from LED bulbs in Karnataka’s Chitradurga to wine from Nashik. Mysuru has made it not for the sweet named after it but for capacitors and integrated circuit boards. Pulwama, the militant hotbed in Jammu & Kashmir, has made it for pencils, thanks to the special poplar tree found there. The additions also reflect the push from the government to diversify the export basket and target a boost for export of goods where Indian producers are competitive. Product diversification is a key element of the $400 billion export target for this year formulated by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal. The task of ODOP is being handled by Invest India, which has worked on the initial list and is in the process of preparing a list for all 739 districts. Listing apart, it is also working with the producers to improve the quality of the products. For instance, it has asked turmeric exporters not to crush the “wonder food” but instead cut it so that the curcumin content is better retained, explained a source. Similarly, a small tweak by drying a variety of coffee on concrete surface instead of earth has helped improve its quality. For Kolhapuri chappals, it is getting help from buyers in Italy to improve quality. IITs, IIMs, NID and NIFTs are also being roped in for identifying potential solutions and adoption of minimalist technology to enhance productivity and supply chain without disrupting the traditional ecosystem, a source added. Besides, efforts are also being made to get Indian sellers on board e-commerce platforms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hyperlocal-plan-jk-pencil-karnataka-led-in-exports-push/articleshow/85753109.cms||Sidhartha

Sources said these clusters include food processing parks, electronics and IT, pharmaceutical and medical devices, fishing clusters and harbours, besides mega textile parks. The “PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan for Multi-Modal Infrastructure Connectivity to Economic Zones” with tag line ‘Gati se Shakti’ will include projects under existing flagship schemes of different ministries such as Bharatmala, Sagarmala, Udaan, expansion of railway network, inland waterways and Bharat Net. High supply chain and logistics cost make Indian products less competitive in the global market. The current supply chain and logistics costs in India account for around 14% of the country’s GDP compared to the global average of approximately 8%. Modi on August 15 had announced that the total size of the Gati Shakti project will be Rs 100 lakh crore for developing holistic infrastructure. The aim of the project will be on improving efficiency by optimising the necessary infrastructure, which will help reduce the logistics cost.

Taking the first step towards physical hearing on the request of Bar Associations, Chief Justice N V Ramana took the decision on the recommendations of the Committee of SC Judges and issued a standard operating procedure (SOP). Initially the physical hearing will be allowed only on non-miscellaneous days when comparatively less number of cases are listed for hearing. Normally fresh cases are listed for miscellaneous days when number of cases on board is more and those cases generally do not require extensive hearing like matters which are taken for final hearing on non-miscellaneous days. “As per the latest SOP, those appearing before the court in the final hearing/regular matters listed on non-miscellaneous days will have the option of being heard in the physical mode. Any other matter may also be heard in physical mode on non-miscellaneous days if Bench directs likewise. Unless otherwise directed by the Bench, final hearing/regular matters where the number of Advocates for the parties are more than 20 per Courtroom at any given time, will be listed for hearing through video/tele-conferencing mode,” the court said.. In case the lawyers opt for physical hearing, one Advocate-on-Record (who files the case) or his nominee, one arguing counsel and one junior counsel per party will be allowed entry in the courtroom. One registered clerk, per party, will also be allowed entry to carry paper-books/journals etc. of the counsels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-17-months-supreme-court-to-resume-physical-hearing-in-a-limited-way-from-september-1/articleshow/85753674.cms||---

The intention behind the scheme is to help them buy tools needed for their professions. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the state government introduced the scheme for the groups of people, who have been serving society for centuries. Under the scheme Rs 247 crore was credited to the accounts of 2,47,040 beneficiaries as the first instalment. Of this, Rs 82,34,70,000 was provided at the rate of Rs 10,000 to 82,347 Rajakas, Rs 38,76,70,000 to 38,767 Nayi Brahmins and Rs 125,92,60,000 to 1,25,926 tailors. The government advised the banks to not deduct this amount, even if the beneficiaries have any loans in their name. As per the latest directives of the chief minister, the government is preparing an action plan to provide financial assistance to the beneficiaries under the second tranche of the Jagananna Chedodu scheme. The prepared lists will be displayed at the village and ward secretariats. If the scheme does not reach the deserved or eligible beneficiaries, they can approach village/ward secretariats for rectification.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/ap-prepares-for-2nd-tranche-aid-under-jagananna-chedodu/articleshow/85749024.cms||---

A day after recovery of Rs18 lakh cash from the vehicle of a Rural Works Department (WRD) superintending engineer in Muzaffarpur, Tejashwi alleged that the unholy nexus between the ruling alliance and the government officials was promoting corruption and bribery in the state. “The high-handedness of the officials is at its peak. The negligence of the government officials (in development works) has led to corruption. However, the government and the ministers are little worried about all this,” he tweeted. The RJD leader said even the people’s representatives were being subjected to humiliation by the corrupt officers. Moreover, they have scant respect for the citizens, which is reflected during their visit to government offices, he alleged. Reacting to Tejashwi's allegations, JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said, “It is ridiculous that the man, who believes in promoting the family only, is talking about the people’s concern.” Reiterating that the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government has zero tolerance on corruption, the JD(U) MLC said even DGP (former) had to feel the heat of stern action for his corrupt practices. Referring to Tejashwi’s allegation about humiliation of people’s representatives, Neeraj said people should take lesson from RJD, which is in the thick of controversy over Tej Pratap’s relationship with his party’s state president Jagadanand Singh. BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel also said Tejashwi should introspect before attacking the ruling NDA in the state on the issues like corruption and officials’ apathy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/tejashwi-flays-govt-for-failure-to-check-graft/articleshow/85746657.cms||Ramashankar

JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi said a coordination committee or convener in the NDA is needed like the one in the era of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and JD(U) leader George Fernandes. Talking to mediapersons before attending the JD(U)’s national council meeting here, Tyagi said such a committee would help maintain proper coordination among the NDA allies and put a break on unnecessary statements issued by the leaders of different alliance partners. “When Vajpayee was the NDA chairman, George Fernandes used to be its national convener. Fernandes served as the NDA convener till 2008. He was replaced by Sharad Yadav, the then national president of the JD(U). Yadav resigned as the NDA convener soon after the JD(U) left the alliance on June 16, 2013,” a senior JD(U) leader told TOI. Currently, JD(U) is the BJP’s biggest ally in the NDA with 16 Lok Sabha members after the BJP’s 301 members. All the JD(U) Lok Sabha members are from Bihar. Reacting over Tyagi’s demand, BJP leader and Bihar’s deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad said the NDA’s top leadership would take a decision. “There is no need of such a demand by the JD(U),” he said. To a question, Prasad clarified that there would be separate coordination committees for Bihar and at national level. He admitted that there would be better coordination among the NDA allies after formation of the coordination committee. Nearly two months ago, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi had also demanded a coordination committee in the NDA at the state level.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/form-coordination-panel-in-nda-jdu/articleshow/85746571.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi hails ‘Sukhet model’ of Madhubani||PATNA/SAMASTIPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday praised the ‘Sukhet model’ of Madhubani district in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Sukhet model is named after Sukhet village in Madhubani district where it is being implemented by the scientists of Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agriculture University, Pusa (Samastipur). “Under this project, garbage and dung from houses are collected door-to-door and then converted into vermicompost (organic manure). From the income generated from the sale of organic manure, every family is provided LPG cylinders every two months in exchange of the waste and cow dung. This project also provides employment to 14 to 15 people at the village,” Dr Ramesh Chandra Srivastava, vice-chancellor of the university, said. “The Sukhet model is not only promoting cleanliness, but also providing organic manure to the farmers. It is also helping the village in getting rid of pollution,” the PM said. He also appealed to the panchayats across the country to replicate the Sukhet model. Dr Shrivastava said as this project was first implemented in Sukhet village, it was called the ‘Sukhet model’. The vice-chancellor said the PM’s appreciation would boost the morale of all the scientists and employees of his team.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pm-modi-hails-sukhet-model-of-madhubani/articleshow/85747314.cms||S K Jain
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Disciplinary action against woman cop||Thiruvananthapuram: Disciplinary action was initiated against pink police squad officer Rajitha, who allegedly harassed an eight-year-old girl and her father in public. The officer was removed from the squad and was attached to Kollam city police. The action has been taken by DIG K Sanjaykumar Gurudin based on a preliminary inquiry report submitted by district police chief (rural). The DIG has also prescribed mandatory 15-day training for the officer. He said in his order that despite her accusations being proven false, she refused to tender an apology to the girl and her father. Meanwhile, the father of the girl Jayachandran termed the police action as hogwash. Speaking to TOI Jayachandran said the action taken by the police was not at all justifiable while considering the mental trauma it inflicted on his daughter. In fact, the police action has compelled him to file a complaint before higher authorities. ‘’I have decided to file a petition before the State Human Rights Commission, Chief Minister and the state police chief,” he said, adding that he was not planning to file any such complaints earlier hoping the authorities would take appropriate action. But now he has no other option as the so-called disciplinary action is a mere transfer. He learned about the disciplinary action when he visited the Attingal Deputy Superintendent’s office on Sunday to give his statement against the woman officer, Jayachandran said. The incident happened on Friday afternoon and its visuals went viral on social media soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/disciplinary-action-against-woman-cop/articleshow/85748724.cms||---

Most petrol stations may still go dry on Tuesday since petroleum dealers are yet to withdraw their ‘no-purchase-no-sale’ agitation. As a result, 3,000 petrol pumps in the state, including those in Kolkata, may remain shut on August 31. Oil tankers resumed supply of fuel from the Indian Oil Mourigram depot on Sunday afternoon following an assurance from IOC about resolving the issues faced by fuel transporters. But petroleum dealers have stuck to their decision to observe August 31 as a no-purchase-no-sale day. Motorists and commuters may face trouble on Tuesday, with vehicles without adequate fuel likely to stay off roads. “We are extremely happy that IOC has agreed to our demand not to lower the rate of transportation cost of fuel from Rs 240 per kilolitre per km in the free-distribution zone. Moreover, they also agreed to allow 10-12 tankers to ply even though their service-contracts had expired. After receiving the assurance from the IOC, we immediately resumed supply,” said Ajit Kumar Das, secretary, West Bengal Tankers Association. Panic buying of fuel continued throughout Sunday. “We cannot take any chance. The twin strikes might leave most of the stations dry. If there is an emergency requirement, I will have a major problem,” said Subir Goswami, an engineer with a power utility company who queued up at a petrol pump at Behala. Like Goswami, Anita Sonthalia and her husband brought their two cars to a fuel station in New Alipore. “From Monday, we have a hectic schedule. Non-availability of fuel will create major chaos. To avoid that, we sacrificed our Sunday morning walk and our weekly get-together at our home to fill up the tanks of our cars,” said Anita. “We have been facing a long list of issues. We have conveyed them to oil marketing companies from time to time and we have written them several letters. But our issues remain unresolved. Thus, we were forced to take this stance,” said West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association vice-president Snehasis Bhowmik. The demands included stopping supply of ethanol-blended petrol to fuel dispensing stations during the monsoon. “Ethanol, being a hygroscopic agent, attracts moisture from the highly humid air of monsoon. This phenomenon is causing us tremendous trouble. Both reservoirs and tanks of the vehicles are accumulating water. We are incurring losses and motorists are facing engine dysfunctions,” Bhowmik said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tanker-strike-off-fuel-stns-still-on-warpath/articleshow/85748447.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The incident took place near Mauna Phatak under Chhapra Town police station area when the victim, , Raghubar Dayal Sharma, was returning home from Kutchery-Station road on a rickshaw. The miscreants tried to snatch his bag, leading to an altercation. Eyewitnesses told the police that Sharma caught hold of one of the miscreants and raised an alarm. Apprehending trouble, another criminal attacked Sharma with a dagger, causing grievous injuries. Later they escaped with the victim’s bag. The locals informed Sharma’s son Deepak Kumar, who rushed to the spot and admitted the injured to the Sadar hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The deceased, a resident of Mauna Phatak locality, owned Deepu Medical Agency at Mauna Chowk. When contacted, Chhapra Town police station SHO Bimal Kumar said efforts were on to ascertain the identity of the accused. CCTV footage was being obtained from the nearby business establishments for the purpose, he added. He, however, hastened to add that the motive of the criminals was yet to be ascertained. The rickshaw-puller told the police that two youths riding a motorbike had a brawl with Sharma after the rickshaw hit their vehicle. Deepak, however, said his father was killed for his attempt to foil a loot incident. There was police patrol car in the vicinity, but the criminals managed to escape. The incident enraged the drug dealers of the town, who have threatened to resort to agitation if the culprits were not arrested soon. Earlier on Thursday night, a grocery shop owner, identified as Krishna Singh, was attacked with a knife at Sonepur in the district. Singh was rushed to a private nursing home where he died during treatment on Saturday night. The SHO of Hariharnath police outpost, Vibha Kumari, said the incident took place when the victim was on way back home after closing his shop near the Hariharnath temple.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/medicine-dealer-stabbed-to-death-for-resisting-loot/articleshow/85746860.cms||Ramashankar

The search operation followed the recovery of Rs18 lakh from his car during a vehicle-checking drive on Muzaffarpur-Hajipur road under Phakuli police outpost area in Muzaffarpur district on Saturday. Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said on Sunday that around Rs49 lakh was recovered from Anil’s rented accommodation at Bahreta in Darbhanga late Saturday night. Some documents related to his assets were also seized during the operation. So far, a total of Rs67 lakh has been seized from him, he added. During investigation, it came to light that the engineer owned two flats on Jagdeo Path and Veterinary College road in the state capital. His wife was present in one of the flats in Patna during the search operation, the SSP revealed. The SSP said Anil’s ancestral house at Alouli in Khagaria district was also searched. However, no incriminating document was found there. The investigating officers would access his bank accounts once the banks opened, he added. Jayant said a team of the economic offences unit (EOU) from the state police headquarters joined the investigation on Sunday. The EOU team headed by a DSP quizzed Anil at Kudhani police station in Muzaffarpur on Sunday. The SSP said the Income Tax (IT) department officials had also reached the Phakuli police outpost soon after Anil’s detention for interrogation for carrying a huge cash with him. A case of violation of model code of conduct was lodged against him. The code of conduct was enforced on August 24 following announcement of the panchayat elections in the state to be held from September 24 to December 12. A senior police officer associated with the investigation said the case may be transferred to the EOU for further action against the engineer concerned. “We will submit the evidence to the court, which will decide the future course of action,” the SSP told this newspaper paper over phone. Anil was on way to Patna from Darbhanga on Saturday when the police detained him. He is posted as superintending engineer in Darbhanga division, which comprises Darbhanga and Madhubani districts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rs-49l-more-seized-during-search-at-engrs-residence/articleshow/85746505.cms||Ramashankar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Carry own bag, get discount on mutton and chicken in Guntur||GUNTUR: The Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC) has asked mutton and chicken stall owners to offer discounts to buyers who bring jute, cloth bags or steel cans from Sunday to discourage use of plastic carry bags. GMC commissioner C Anuradha said the sellers would give Rs 10 per kg discount on chicken and Rs 20 per on mutton to those who do not ask for carry bags. Many carried own bags to meat stalls on Sunday. Although use of single-use plastic carry bags has been banned in the city, the GMC is struggling to enforcement the ban. The civic body has been conducting raids at the premises of wholesale traders and slapping huge penalties. Retailers are being booked for use of non-prescribed plastic carry bags. “We have noticed that mutton and chicken stall owners are using huge quantities of plastic carry bags, particularly on Sundays, to cater to their customers. We held several meetings with the mutton and chicken stall owners and asked them to stop using plastic carry bags,” said Anuradha. As a last resort, the GMC suggested the dealers to offer discounts to those who bring containers. “They have agreed to give reasonable discount on both sales of chicken and mutton which would help limit use of plastic carry bags,” said the commissioner. The commissioner said plastic carry bags have become a menace, particularly during monsoon, as huge quantities of plastic waste clog the drains resulting in the flooding of residential areas. The commissioner appealed to people to carry own bags for the purchase of fruits, vegetables and groceries to avoid use of plastic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/carry-own-bag-get-discount-on-mutton-and-chicken-in-guntur/articleshow/85748932.cms||Samdani MN

Mohammed Leton Ali had been staying at Ravulapalem police station in East Godavari district ever since he was released from jail in 2006 for illegal entry into India. Ali (37) was arrested in 2004 when he was wandering in a suspicious manner at Ravulapalem bus stand. A case was registered against him under Sections 14(A) (b) of Foreigners Amendment Act 2004 in Ravulapalem police station as Ali had no passport and visa. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment and released from Rajahmundry Central Prison in 2006. Ever since he had been staying in Ravulapalem police station. The police wrote several letters to the Bangladesh embassy and the Ministry of External Affairs to send him back to Bangladesh, but in vain. He was eking out a living as a carpenter. In 2018, Ali allegedly damaged a road safety vehicle of Ravulapalem police station as his mental condition was not sound. A case was booked against him. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and was released in 2019. In July 2021 East Godavari SP M Ravindranath Babu spoke to higher authorities and made efforts to get “travel permit” from the high commissioner of Bangladesh in New Delhi on August 3. A special team was formed by Amalapuram DSP Y Madhava Reddy with Ravulapalem SI P Bujji Babu, head constable K Venkata Ramana and constable V Chiranjeevi to escort Leton Ali to the Indo-Bangladesh border.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/after-yrs-in-eg-police-stn-illegal-bdeshi-immigrant-goes-home/articleshow/85749741.cms||Samson Raj

---||Vijayawada||Arrack brewers fly under SEB radar, thrive in urban areas||Vijayawada: With liquor prices continuing to be on the steeper side, coupled with non-availability of desired brands, there is high demand for arrack in urban areas. Despite the stringent enforcement by the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), which destroyed more than eight lakh litres of arrack and about 2.5 crore litres of fermented jaggery that would otherwise have been turned into 70 lakh litres of arrack, illegally distilled liquor continues to make its way into urban areas. Conventionally, arrack is brewed in interior rural areas. The complex brewing process also confined it to the interior in order to evade the radar of excise officials. However, a new trend is emerging, in which arrack is being brewed in regular kitchens in urban areas with advanced utensils. These utensils are even available on e-commerce portals. Director of SEB, P H D Ramakrishna told TOI there has been a massive crackdown on arrack brewing right from the inception of the bureau. This is evident from the number of cases that increased manifold after SEB came into existence. As organised arrack brewing becomes difficult, many are resorting to alternative ways to brew it at home. Ramakrishna further observed that demand for arrack in urban areas increased during the first Covid-19 lockdown. With no availability of liquor for days together in 2020, arrack was found in areas such as Guntur city that had been arrack-free for many years. As conventional brewing is not possible in urban areas, perpetrators found new methods and utensils for brewing smaller quantities. SEB officials also noticed that usage of sugar and white jaggery has become more prevalent instead of black jaggery. As the sale of black jaggery is regulated to prevent it from going to arrack brewing rackets, they are now using other materials. They are also using chemicals to reduce fermentation process of jaggery from seven days to one day. Ramakrishna said though they have curbed conventional arrack brewing to a large extent, the new modus operandi by the perpetrators is throwing up new challenges. As demand is high, brewers are making a fair amount of money, even with smaller quantities, and escaping the SEB radar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/arrack-brewers-fly-under-seb-radar-thrive-in-urban-areas/articleshow/85749431.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Kolkata||AR Rahman joins Bangladeshi lyricist for songs on Bangabandhu for his birth centenary||KOLKATA: A R Rahman has collaborated with Bangladesh’s national award-winning lyricist Zulfiqer Russell to compose and lend his voice to two theme songs to celebrate the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Both songs were recorded at Rahman’s Chennai studio last year.  The Hindi version — ‘Bolo Joy Bangabandhu’ — was played at an event to mark the 50th independence anniversary of Bangladesh while the Bengali song — ‘Aj O Shuni Bojrodhoni’ — is awaiting release. This is the first time Rahman has composed for and sung a song in Bengali. “It was a great honour that they thought of me and came to India to do this. India and Bangladesh have always had a very special relationship. We share the language — Bengali. We share a bond, a culture,” said Rahman. Russell was asked by the Bangladesh Cricket Board to write two songs on the birth centenary of Bangabandhu. The CEO of the cricket board had introduced the lyricist to Rahman’s agent and, after an initial Skype meeting, the trio met in Mumbai. Last year, Russell went to Chennai for a week. “It was nice to have him in Chennai for the recording so we could share the stuff and respond to it,” Rahman said.  “He knew about Bangabandhu, but wanted to know which aspects of his life could be highlighted in the songs. He had asked me to send him details about his protest and how he became the ‘Father of the Nation’ in Bangladesh,” said Russell, who has also penned the theme song for 50 years of Bangladesh’s independence and ICC’s official welcome song for the 2011 World Cup. This research became a crucial aspect of the project since it gave a basic idea about the themes that the songs would highlight. Apart from the biographical and political details, Russell also referred to Cuban leader Fidel Castro’s quote: “I have not seen the Himalayas. But I have seen Sheikh Mujib. He is the Himalayas in personality and in courage. I have thus had the experience of witnessing the Himalayas.” While composing, Rahman tried to be “more sensitive” towards which “instrument” he was using and which “melody” he was choosing. “Especially when singing in Bengali, there were a lot of back and forth iterations on pronunciation. So, we wanted to make sure we did it right,” Rahman said. “He infused so much passion while singing the chorus: ‘Aajo Shuni, Bojrodhoni Haway Haway Resh/Joy Bangla, Joy Bangla, Joy Bangladesh’. It still feels unbelievable that two songs written by me have been composed and sung by A R Rahman. This has given my work a historical significance,” Russell said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ar-rahman-joins-bdeshi-lyricist-for-songs-on-bangabandhu-for-his-birth-centenary/articleshow/85750601.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The event began with Sister Rani Jacob, president of the association and principal of the school, lighting the lamp, followed by an evening of quiz and antakshari, and of stories shared by former students about their school. Sister Joicy Madassery, member of the Congregation Leadership Team, Rome; Sister Anita Moolan, the Provincial, Kolkata, and Sister Smitha Thomas, director, International Missions Office, Rome, addressed the gathering. The school anthem, composed by alumni Preeti Roy Choudhury, was a journey back to the solemn morning assemblies. “The celebration will be followed by a series of programmes, which include Menopause Cafe, interviews and the launch of an e-magazine. Our motto says ‘Virtue and Knowledge’ and we in QMS believe these qualities, bound by humility and empathy, create a better environment for the overall well-being of students,” said Nasreen Latif, an alumna. Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions, an international missionary congregation, started the all-girls’ school at Park Circus under the Archdioceses of Calcutta in 1946 with five Sisters from Chittagong. The then parish priest of Christ the King Parish, Park Circus, Father Kawea, had invited them to work in his parish and christened the little entity Queen of the Missions to match the name of Christ the King Parish. The school principal said, “As part of the experiential learning through enquiry and research-based methodology, QMS has partnered with ISR and engaged students in regular participation in TED discussions promoting critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity. In addition to this, we offer the global platform of ISR Muse to showcase their creativity through art forms.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/s-kolkata-school-takes-e-way-to-celebrate-75-yrs/articleshow/85750546.cms||Althea Phillips

I had gone there even a day before yesterday. Right now, we are strengthening our party’s base with our resources in the 165 constituencies,” he said. When told that JD(U), another NDA ally, would prefer to contest the UP polls with BJP, Sahani said, “As of now, the VIP has decided to go solo in the UP polls.” Sources said Sahani’s party is making preparations in those constituencies which have significant population of Nishad, Mallah, Kewat and other allied castes in UP. Few weeks ago, Sahani had announced to distribute 50,000 statues of bandit queen-turned-politician and former MP late Phoolan Devi among the party workers to woo Mallah and Nishad votes in UP.

---||Business||Insolvency board seeks fairer, quicker process||MUMBAI: The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has proposed major changes in the insolvency process to bring more discipline and transparency and to address issues that have come up in recent cases. The IBBI, which regulates both insolvency professionals and the process, has sought public views on amendments by September 17. A key development is the introduction of a code of conduct for the committee of creditors (CoC) proposed by a parliamentary standing committee headed by Jayant Sinha. The 31-point code of conduct, among other things, requires creditors to disclose any conflict of interest, maintain full confidentiality and not try to adjust funds of the corporate debtor against their dues during the resolution process. However, it does not mention how violations in the code will be addressed. Some of the proposed amendments are based on observation of the tribunals in various cases. The discussion paper seeks to cap revisions in bids to two times. This will prevent delay on account of multiple bid revisions, which was seen in some cases. Also, unsolicited bids have been expressly banned, which will save lenders from an awkward situation like in the DHFL resolution. The CoC has been empowered to decide on the timeframe and thresholds for improvement on the resolution plan in advance. “The proposed changes to IBC regulations pertaining to both resolution and liquidation are timely and intend to plug the loopholes, which are affecting the timelines and value-maximisation. The measures also aim to bring in greater accountability and transparency in the conduct of key stakeholders driving the process,” said UV Asset Reconstruction Company director Hari Hara Mishra. The ‘Swiss challenge’ sale process, which has worked well, has been proposed as a standard for both the resolution as well as liquidation processes. In this process, bidders get an opportunity to better the highest bid. Once the bids are received, the original bidder has the right of refusal for the best price. In a separate paper on the liquidation process, the board has proposed that more powers be given to the stakeholder’s consultative committee. Besides, the board plans to ban liquidators from appointing commission agents in the sale of assets. The changes come even as the government is proposing to amend the Act by introducing a pre-packaged insolvency resolution (PIRP) for small businesses. “Under this Bill, even after the PIRP is initiated, the management or the partners of the corporate debtor retain control on the company and the affairs, except in cases of fraud or mismanagement. This will ensure that the autonomy of the management is retained, and will, in turn, promote businesses to grow in India,” said DSK Legal partner Samir Malik. This is unlike the process for corporates where promoters are banned under Section 29A of the Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/insolvency-board-seeks-fairer-quicker-process/articleshow/85751464.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Seller of defective raincoat gets a dry lesson on business ethics||VADODARA: For selling a faded, damaged raincoat and also denying to refund the money, an insurance agent in Gotri decided to teach a popular shop in Alkapuri a lesson on ethical business. Insurance agent Janmejay Moghe took merchant MM Jariwala to court for a raincoat which he had purchased for a paltry Rs 950 and not only got his money back but also along with interest and compensation of Rs 1,000 even though the litigation took him two years. The shop is known for different types of bags and other accessories. Just a week after Vadodara was flooded by the torrential rains in 2019, Moghe bought himself a raincoat and paid the amount through credit card on August 8. However, a day after the purchase, Moghe returned to the shop to replace the raincoat, which was not only faded but also had a few holes in it. Salesman at the shop showed Moghe a banner stating that goods sold will not be replaced or taken back by them. But incidentally, the invoice that Moghe was given mentioned that goods sold can be replaced within three days! So, when Moghe requested for exchange and even offered to pay more if needed, he was shown other alternatives for replacement. The customer was, however, was not happy with the raincoats he was shown and so, asked the salesman to return his money and take back their defective piece. But the shop authorities denied returning his money and said that it was not their policy. Upset over the shop’s indifferent treatment, Moghe filed a case against them at Vadodara District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum. “For meagre amounts, people do not pursue legal options. But the amount is always not important, as are the principles. So many buyers would have faced similar injustice and simply given up,” said Moghe’s lawyer, Mithil Dave. “Such established names believe that they can get away with anything. They will have to change if there will be awareness among the consumers,” Dave further said. Dave submitted the photo of the defective raincoat, invoice and credit card receipt as evidence which were upheld by the court. The court also noted that by selling a raincoat of inferior quality and by not refunding the money, the shop had adopted unfair trade practices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/seller-of-defective-raincoat-gets-a-dry-lesson-on-biz-ethics/articleshow/85746686.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Speaking to the media here in Visakhapatnam on Sunday, the MLA said TDP leaders tried to damage the brand image of Visakhapatnam on various counts. “They are now shamelessly trying to hold debates on the development of north-coastal Andhra Pradesh. TDP has no interest in developing Visakhapatnam or north Andhra region. They looted the place for personal and political gains during the previous government’s regime, but are now shedding crocodile tears,” said Amarnath. Terming former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu as a ‘betrayer’ of Vizag and the north Andhra region, Amarnath said Naidu has to reveal on what basis he chose Amaravati as the capital while Visakhapatnam was readily available with all resources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/tdp-tried-to-damage-brand-image-of-vizag/articleshow/85749360.cms||---

The cops traced the 15-year-old girl, who was kidnapped from Amreli’s Chalala town, to the city’s Maan Darwaja area and also arrested the accused. Police officials informed that a complaint was lodged, at the Chalala police station of Amreli district, against unidentified persons for kidnapping a minor girl around five months ago. Apart from the mobile number of the accused, cops had no other clues to solve the crime. But that information proved enough for the cops. Sometime ago, Amreli police alerted their Surat counterpart after they came to know that the accused lives in Surat. “We arrested Jaffar Qureshi (24), a resident of Maan Darwaja area of Surat, on Sunday and rescued a minor girl from his custody. He is a native of Maharashtra’ Buldhana district. Qureshi told police that he had accidentally come in contact with the minor girl when he had dialed a wrong number. Later, the two started talking over the phone regularly. Both fell in love and the accused promised to marry her,” police said. The minor was the adopted girl of her parents. After the death of her first foster mother, her father remarried. “Her second mother too died and afterwards the father allegedly started harassing the girl over domestic issues. Fed up with the harassment, she did not want to live with her father so the accused asked the girl to come to Surat. The minor girl left her house on May 8 and reached Surat. Since then she has been living with Qureshi,” police said. “After the arrest, the accused confessed to having hidden the girl in a slum in Sanjay Nagar area of the city. We reached the spot and rescued the girl,” police added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/kidnapped-minor-girl-rescued-after-5-months/articleshow/85747377.cms||---

Accordingly, a high alert has been sounded by the West Champaran district magistrate. People living in the downstream have been asked to move to safer places. Meanwhile, four north Bihar rivers – Gandak, Kosi, Bagmati and Kamla – continued to threaten people living along their downstream. The water level in these rivers had crossed the the danger level at most places. The flood bulletin released by water resources department on Sunday said the water discharge through the Valmikinagar barrage across the Gandak increased from 2.48 lakh cusecs in the morning to 2.67 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. On Sunday morning, the discharge had fallen from the high of 2.64 lakh cusecs on Saturday afternoon to 2.48 lakh cusecs overnight. Similarly, the water discharge through the Birpur barrage across the Kosi had fallen to 2.03 lakh cusecs on Sunday morning from the high of 2.14 lakh cusecs on Saturday evening. However, on Sunday afternoon, the discharge level increased to 2.58 lakh cusecs. The Gandak was flowing 1.28 metres above the danger level at Dumariaghat. The Kosi, on the other hand, was flowing 1.66 metres above the red mark at Baltara on the north and 67cm along its lower reaches at Kursela. Similarly, the Bagmati was flowing 1.09 metres above the danger level at Dubbadhar, 1.90 metres at Kataunja and 1.20 metres at Benibad. The Kamla was flowing 35cm above the danger level along its upstream at Jainagar and 2.40 metres at Jhanjharpur. Meanwhile, the disaster management department said Rs 454.18 crore has been distributed as gratuitous relief at the rate of Rs 6,000 per family among 7.58 lakh flood-hit families till August 28.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/heavy-rain-in-nepal-worsens-flood-scene/articleshow/85746612.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh Transco saves Rs 16 crore in cloud services tenders||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (APTransco) has saved nearly Rs 16 crore in the tenders of SAP HANA (high performance analytic appliance) enterprise cloud services. APTransco entered into an agreement with a private organisation five years ago for providing cloud services for Rs 20.22 crore on a nomination basis. APTransco has now rejected the request of the same company for renewal of services for the next five years and called open tenders. APTransco recently finalised the tenders for Rs 3.94 crore, while the one time migration activity would cost Rs 31.22 lakh. This saved the transmission corporation nearly Rs 16 crore or 80% public money compared to the earlier tenders. Joint managing director, APTransco, Karri Venkateswara Rao, who participated in the pre-bid meeting and took the initiative on the SAP services’ tender, said that the cloud platform means providing data storage (cloud storage) to one organisation (APTransco) by one company on a payment basis. “The APTransco is effectively implementing an online file clearing system and disposing files as early as possible, aiming at clearing the files within 24 hours,” said Venkateswara Rao. Energy secretary and chairman & managing director, APTransco, Srikant Nagulapalli, released a special report on reduction of losses. Srikant said the power utilities took serious measures to reduce technical and commercial (AT&C) losses. The losses reduced to 10.95% in 2019-20 from 13.79% in 2018-19. “All these measures will help save public money in the power sector. The state has turned into a model in terms of cost-effective power purchases and best practices. We will continue the same efforts to fulfil the objective of making the state’s power sector sustainable and financially robust,” said Srikant. According to the CMD-APTransco, state energy minister, Balineni Srinivasa Reddy, has appreciated the sustained efforts of all power utilities in saving public money by implementing cost effective measures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/aptransco-saves-rs-16cr-in-cloud-services-tenders/articleshow/85749694.cms||---

If immediate steps were not taken to check this indiscriminate exploitation, a severe water crisis will hit the country soon, said leading hydrogeologist and former member-secretary of Central Ground Water Authority, Dipankar Saha. Delivering the inaugural lecture of Patna University Geology Department platinum jubilee lecture series through videoconference on Sunday, Saha pointed out that with 18% of the global population, India is having just 4% of the world’s fresh water resources. At the time of independence, India’s water availability stood at 6000 cubic metres per person per year. Today, it has declined to nearly 1300 cubic metres. A country is said to be water-stressed, if its water availability becomes less than 1700 cubic metres, he said. Saha observed that despite huge investment on surface water resources so far, dependence on groundwater has increased considerably. Irrigation is the greatest consumer of groundwater as 22 million tubewells are operational in the country at present. He said groundwater resources are being exploited more indiscriminately in the Indo-Gangetic region leading to pollution of groundwater. He said the Geogenic pollution of groundwater has resulted in arsenic and fluoride menace in states like Bihar, affecting a large segment of the human population. Emphasising the need for proper management of water resources in the country, he pleaded for strengthening of the groundwater organisations at state level and detailed studies of different aquifers in the country. He also pleaded for devising ways for augmenting groundwater recharge through artificial recharge. The government must also ensure greater participation of community in water management programmes. PU geology department head Atul Aditya Pandey welcomed the guests. Bhavuk Sharma proposed a vote of thanks. A large number of teachers, students and alumni of the department participated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/avoid-indiscriminate-use-of-groundwater-expert/articleshow/85746158.cms||B K Mishra
---||Chennai||Here’s to a hamper full of memories||Chennai: Fresh air, greenery and lots of yummy food — that’s what Sharon Deepak remembers of the picnics she went on with her family while growing up in Tuticorin. In the hustle and bustle of city life though, these experiences have remained mere reminiscences locked in the past, even as the pandemic kept her indoors. But recently, when the homemaker passed a scenic spot on Old Mahabalipuram Road, the memories came rushing back."We chanced upon this beautiful pond with shady trees. It reminded me of the times when my family used to pack food and picnic in the fields, so I decided to come back with my mother and daughter. We made curd rice and chicken gravy, spread out a rug and relaxed," says Sharon, who has since moved into an apartment complex near the spot. "It was the first time my eight-year-old had been on a picnic, and loved looking at the cows and birds. This stretch of road has plenty of beautiful spots and we intend to spend more such leisurely afternoons."Life’s no picnic, especially during a pandemic. But small getaways spent in the lap of nature and in the company of friends and family are gaining popularity in a world that is battling a difficult year. They are light on the wallet, involve little travel, and allow you to meet and greet loved ones in safe spaces.For some, they bring on nostalgia. "Picnics were part of my life while growing up and, after I had children, a few families we know used to get together, drive down East Coast Road and enjoy a picnic in a shady spot somewhere along the way," says Jayashree K P. "My kids have grown up but, in July, four of us couples got together and drove to a friend’s farmhouse on OMR where we enjoyed a picnic lunch we had packed in the fields, just like the old days."For others, it’s a way to bond as WFH and online classes have disrupted the work-life balance. "We had our first picnic after the first wave last year. We didn’t want to risk having food from outside so we packed homemade vegetable biriyani, rasam, rice, raita, and potato chips. We took a rug, drove down ECR and picnicked in a shady spot full of trees and a pond nearby," says Divya Karthik, adding that they have since gone on two more such trips. "Usually, we eat within the four walls of our home or at a restaurant, so enjoying a meal outdoors, in nature, is refreshing. WFH doesn’t leave much family time, so a picnic also gives us a chance to sit, chat and share memories."Hotels and companies have also been quick to cater to this segment. "Our hotels in Yercaud and Kodai do picnic hampers for guests. Many visitors like to go on treks or explore the place, and enjoy a meal outdoors," says Vikram Cotah, CEO, GRT Hotels & Resorts.In Bengaluru, friends Bhawna Rao and Shwetha Gupta launched The Picnic Company in October 2020. "People were confined indoors and yearning to step out, but also concerned about safety. Since I run a travel company and Shwetha runs a restaurant, we came up with the idea of curating food-related experiences outdoors," says Bhawna.The two help people choose a location, come up with a menu and even set it up at scenic spots in and around Bengaluru. "You just have to land up and enjoy the experience," says Shwetha, adding that they work with local farmers, who live next to reserve forests. "Depending on the customer’s preference we pick a spot that involves less travel and ensure that we offer security along with exclusivity. If people want to pick their own spots elsewhere, we just give them the hamper, as we cannot take responsibility for their safety or experience."The fare offered includes good old picnic food that travels well and can be eaten cold — dips and breads, fresh fruits and cheese, biriyani, pasta, sandwiches, khow suey, and the like.For Monika Manchanda, who grew up on a steady diet of Enid Blyton books, the picnic experience made her birthday special. "My husband contacted the company for a picnic in Kolar, on a small island in the middle of an artificial lake. The décor and food were very Mediterranean and it was a safe space for me to catch up with friends," says Monika, adding that trips to spots like India Gate with relatives, friends and sumptuous hampers were a big part of her childhood in Delhi.These small, curated trips also help people who are still working from home enjoy some down time with friends amid a hectic weekday. "Our friend’s birthday fell on a weekday and since we were all working, we wanted a space that was within city limits. So it was arranged on the lawn of a five-star hotel, but we had the whole space to ourselves," says Bengaluru-based Nritya Ganesh. "We had a picnic hamper with finger food and mocktails, low seating with jute mats and cushions. We wore dresses and hats, and with all the greenery around, didn’t even feel like we were in the city," she says. "We could have brunch, be done by 1pm and continue with our work day."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/heres-to-a-hamper-full-of-memories/articleshow/85738795.cms||Priya Menon

Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the schools, colleges, technical institutions and coaching centres would have to follow the standard operating procedures for the safety of students and staff. “Physical distancing is a must. Well-defined protocols for entry of students and teachers to the educational institutions should be in place. Morning assemblies and other gatherings are not allowed. The option of online teaching will continue for students unwilling to attend physical classes,” the minister said. Staggered timing for entry and exit through multiple gates, frequent sanitisation of campuses, installation of sanitiser dispensers, deployment of volunteers to ensure social distancing, thermal screening and medical facilities are some of the steps taken by the schools and colleges to ensure safety of students and staff. Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, principal of Baldwin Academy, said, “As the school has bigger classrooms, we can easily accommodate 40 students in each class by maintaining six-foot-gap between each desk. There will be no morning assemblies and other activities. Students will be allowed to take lunch inside the classroom. Staggered timing for classes will be there to avoid crowing at entrance and exit gates.” Sharat Kumar Singh, principal of Litera Valley School, said the school management has asked the teachers to be more vigilant as classes will resume with full capacity from Monday. “Thirty students will sit with proper distancing in each class. At the time of dismissal, students will leave to board their buses and vans section-wise and there will be an interval of two minutes between each section,” he said. Principal of Don Bosco Academy, Mary Alphonsa, said for classes IX to XII, they will allow 100% attendance from Tuesday onwards. “However, for elementary classes, only 50% students will be allowed on rotational basis. Even though Covid-19 cases have declined, we will wait and watch. Parents of many students of junior classes are still reluctant to send their wards to the school,” she added. Marie D’Cruze, vice-principal of St Michael’s High School, said no decision has so far been taken on reopening of the school with full attendance. Prakash Chandra, dean (student welfare), National Institute of Technology-Patna, said students of MTech branch and PhD would attend regular classes from September 1. “Precautionary measures will be taken as most students are from other states. For BTech branch, online classes will continue for the time being,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/min-to-schools-colleges-follow-covid-norms/articleshow/85746004.cms||Faryal Rumi

Petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri provided details of taxes levied by different states on petrol and diesel while replying to a question raised by Lok Sabha members Kumbakudi Sudhakaran and Pradyut Bordoloi. In a detailed response to the starred question on impact of rising fuel prices, the minister had enclosed the list of all the states and their capital cities to give the break-up of state taxes on the fuels. Although the minister made an attempt to provide comprehensive information about taxes imposed by the Centre and states on fuels which resulted in the steep increase in the cost of petrol and diesel, the reference about AP’s capital city has led to a heated debate among rival political parties in the state. The minister provided the prices of fuels in ‘AP capital’ Vizag along with capital cities of other states in Lok Sabha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/petroleum-min-mentions-vizag-as-states-capital-triggers-row/articleshow/85749781.cms||Samdani MN
---||Delhi||Hand-made tale: How Afghan women refugees are stitching their lives back||NEW DELHI: After Razia Assa, a former schoolteacher in Afghanistan, arrived as a refugee in New Delhi with her family eight years ago, it took her a while to rebuild her life. In November 2019, she got a boost when she got a job at Silaiwali, a social enterprise in Delhi that upcycles waste fabric from garment factories to create handcrafted products for export to the United States and Europe. Her co-workers too are Afghan women refugees, most of them the sole jobholders in their families. Assa, whose husband lost his job at an Afghan restaurant in Malviya Nagar when the pandemic shut it down, says, “When I reached Delhi, I knew nothing that could help me earn a living. I am happy that I learnt craftwork and can support my family. I also feel empowered at having been able to help other Afghan refugees to get a job here.” The 45-year-old is the team leader and guides the women in handcrafting products like dolls, bags and garlands. Assa’s husband was a journalist in Kabul but threats from the Taliban forced him to move his family to India. The idea of Silaiwali came to textile designer and French citizen Iris Strill when working with Afghan women refugees a few years ago. She and her husband, Bishwadeep Moitra, approached the United Nations High Commission for Refugees with the idea of capitalising on Afghan women’s skill with sewing and embroidery. “We collect waste fabric from textile industries abroad as well as from factories in Delhi-NCR to create home decor items,” said Strill. “We have 90 Afghan women working with us, of whom 15 are salaried while the others make products at home for which we pay them per item. Most of these products are exported.” Silaiwali is a boon for the refugees, most of whom do not have Aadhaar cards and other documents. And because they cannot speak Hindi or English, it is difficult for them to get a well-paid job. Shikiba Ahmad, 45, a single mother of five children, baked cookies for years before she got a salaried post at Silaiwali. “There was no need for me to work and earn a living back home. But after the Taliban captured our petrol pump, two cars and a house and we had to flee our country, work and income are necessities. I have to take care of the rent, food and education of my children,” said Shikiba as she stitched on the face on a doll. Her eldest son is 24-year-old and has been jobless for around a year. Her youngest is nine-year-old. Najiba Hussaini, 23, who stitches dresses for the dolls, also carries the responsibility of her family on her shoulders. A Class V dropout, Hussaini, her parents and two sisters have been in Delhi for seven years. “My father is hearing impaired,” she said. “I used to make carpets at a factory in Kabul.” Her friend, Moghgan Gawhary, 24, is educated and has a bachelor’s degree in computer science. She was employed in an IT company in Kabul before migrating to Delhi in 2018. “The first years here were difficult,” said Gawhary. “But I didn’t give up and today I am able to earn an income for my family.” Her elder sister has been hired by a restaurant, while her four younger siblings are in school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hand-made-tale-how-afghan-women-refugees-are-stitching-their-lives-back/articleshow/85748786.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Delhi||Delhi: Three teens drown in Yamuna river, one saved by locals||NEW DELHI: Three teenage boys died after drowning in Yamuna river, while one was rescued by local divers, early on Sunday. The deceased were aged around 15 and lived with their families in Brijpuri of northeast Delhi. Police have initiated inquest proceedings into the incident. A PCR call was made by a passerby around 5.30am informing that four children were drowning in the river near Sur Ghat at north Delhi’s Wazirabad. A police team rushed to the spot and found that the local divers had rescued one of the boys, but the other three had allegedly drowned. An operation was launched to retrieve the bodies and the divers eventually fished out the three bodies. They were rushed to a hospital but declared dead on arrival. The boy who was saved was identified as Bunty (15). His brother, Somveer (16), died. The other two deceased were identified as Pankaj and Sumit who were aged around 15 years, a police officer said According to police, the four boys had gone for a morning walk at 5am at a nearby park. From the park, they planned to go to Sur Ghat to swim in the river. According to Bunty, some construction work of Delhi Metro was going on near the ghat so the boys went ahead and jumped into the river.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/3-teens-drown-in-yamuna-one-saved-by-locals/articleshow/85748891.cms||---
---||Chennai||Twigs in my tiara, malli in my ring||Chennai: These flowers don’t fade or wilt, they’re in bloom all year round. And not just that, you can carry them with you wherever you go. Botanical jewellery, it’s got a nice ring to it, don’t you think?For architectural designer Gayathri Jagadeesan, it all began with a bid to collect funds for the more than 200-year-old Madras Literary Society. She decided to collect the twigs, leaves and branches she found lying around the MLS campus on College Road, fashion them into tiaras and sell them to raise funds. "People loved it and soon we were holding workshops on how to make tiaras and wreaths out of them," says Gayathri, whose efforts at fundraising were halted by the pandemic, though she continues to create fashion, home décor, bouquets and potpourri, and gift them to friends.Gayathri now uses the roots, climbers, twigs and branches she finds in her garden, which is why her ‘collection’ depends on changing seasons and the occasional strong gust of wind.During the lockdown in May, botanical jewellery designer Amrita Giriraj began cycling long distances to pass the time. "In the peak of Madras’ summer, I soaked in not just the UV Rays but also the city’s various nuances. I’d been so keen on incorporating rare and exotic flowers into my jewellery designs that I’d overlooked how unique my immediate surroundings were," she says.Under her brand Alankaara, Amrita, specializes in fossilising flowers and leaves, an idea that came to her when she was a post-graduate student in Kanyakumari. In Chennai, during her cycle trails, she spotted arrays of saamandhi (chrysanthemums) at the entrance of stores and homes, jasmine strands coiled up inside the baskets of temple goers, the bright Vedchi Poo (Ixoras) entwined in votive garlands, and even the tulsi plants thriving in everyone’s backyard, and thus was born the collection, ‘This is Madras’. She has even made engagement rings for a couple, with honeysuckle wildflowers and Anne’s Lace ensconced in 14k white gold."We have a flower directory with almost 47 flowers now," says Amrita, who adds that though it is a three-step process to crafting the jewellery, the prep work takes months. "It starts with the pressing of flowers, then preparing the moulds to cast in, and finally preserving the botanicals in resin. It’s all very basic but it takes time to figure out which botanicals work and what kind of hardware suits them," she says.Elakya Karthikeyan, who works with a software company in Chennai, says she has made the switch to botanical jewellery because she likes the idea of carrying a bit of nature with her. "Every flower has an emotion and a meaning to it, and that’s why I like it," says Elakya, who has taken a fancy to wearing an Iris bracelet crafted by Alankaara as it signifies strength. In Bengaluru, biotech engineer Supriya Donthi started Leafyaffair in 2016, when she decided she preferred bio to tech as a career. "I began by creating terrarium jewellery that preserved moss and then expanded to creating jewellery and stationery out of leaves and flowers," says Supriya, who adds that Leafyaffair is now being incubated at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore. "The concept is to bring nature home," says Supriya. And of course, wear your favourite bouquet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/twigs-in-my-tiara-malli-in-my-ring/articleshow/85738827.cms||---

Vigilance has been conducting a probe into the allegations that Thankappan gifted money to a few councillors on the occasion of Onam. The secretary pasted the notice on the door of the cabin preventing anybody from entering the room, where the monitor, CPU and hard disc of the CCTVs in the municipal office are kept. The notice has been issued under Section 228 of the Kerala Municipality Act which says the secretary shall exercise supervision and control of the work of all officers and staff. It says the prohibition to enter the chamber is to safekeep the CPU, monitor and hard disc of CCTVs which are evidences (in cases). The footage allegedly contains visuals of councillors leaving the chamber carrying money.

Soon after Rajinder Kumar Chawla was shot dead on Thursday afternoon, the two gunmen were spotted somewhere between Queens road and the 200-ft bypass. Since then, there has been no clue about gunmen’s whereabouts except for some grainy CCTV grabs. Officials contacted their counterparts in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi police about the identity of gunmen, but in vain. “We were hopeful of a breakthrough by Saturday evening after a criminal intelligence unit of a neighbouring state claimed that men in grainy CCTV could be found on their records. But close examination later eliminated the possibility,” an official said, adding that the chief hurdle is unclear CCTV footage. “Faces of the gunmen in CCTV clips are very blurry. So, all we have is to rely on their height and gait to identify them, and that has made the task all the more arduous,” the official said, adding that Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police are sharping constant inputs but nothing conclusive has emerged till Sunday evening Cops said that some sublet contractors are under their scanner. Multiple teams pored over series of documents to check two things, first, if dues and payments to some work were pending for Chawla’s approval. Secondly, if the victim was holding back a no-objection certificate (NOC) which could have upset a contractor. So far, according to police, the focus remains on sharp shooters. “Once shooters are nabbed, they will reveal the plot,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/vaishali-nagar-murder-cops-suspect-shooters-chased-target-from-ggn/articleshow/85750975.cms||---

The restrictions will be in effect from Sunday midnight. Kilimanoor, Mudakkal, Nanniyode, Pazhayakunnumel and Pulimath are the five panchayats coming under triple lockdown. All wards in these panchayats will be under restrictions. Ward number 5,12,14,16,23,24,28 in Attingal municipality and ward number 11, 14, 20, 21, 36 in Nedumangadu municipality will also be under lockdown. Only shops selling essential goods will be allowed to open from 7 am to 7 pm in these panchayats and civic body wards. Meanwhile, lockdown restrictions were withdrawn in two wards - 4 and 10 - in Attingal municipality and ward number 24 in Varkala municipality on Sunday. Attingal municipality has recently encouraged Covid testing in exchange for vaccination by setting up antigen testing centres close to vaccination centres. Attingal municipality had been in C category for more than two weeks in July under the categorisation based on test positivity rate (TPR). The TPR had remained above 10% for two weeks in Attingal municipality in July. This had forced the health team and municipality to devise a strategy to integrate vaccination with testing. TPR had gone below 7% in Attingal earlier, however, post Onam the cases are spiking in the municipality.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh seeks trust to guard employees’ interests||CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh administration has sent the power privatisation file to the ministry of home affairs (MHA) for approval. The file has been sent after the approval of Punjab governor and UT administrator V P Singh Badnore, seeking formation of a trust and corporation besides proposing to approve the highest bid of Rs 871 crore. Now, MHA will go through the process and the cabinet committee will give the final nod to the project to start the process of handing over the UT power department to the highest bidder, Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution. Currently, the UT power department has around 600 employees working under different categories in different areas. Therefore, the administration has focused on the issue of Trust before the MHA. The Trust will look into the monetary and other issues of employees. Employees have been protesting against the privatisation bid for the past several months and one of the issues they are apprehensive about is protection of their financial interests post privatisation. “Since there are issues related to pension, funds and other monetary benefits, the UT has strongly requested for the formation of the trust which could guard the financial benefits of employees. It will also have to be seen how many employees remain with the power department till its privatisation, as many are seeking transfer in other departments and some are looking for voluntary retirement, but keeping safety of monetary benefits of employees is one of the crucial elements in this exercise of power privatisation,” a senior UT official said. Formation of a corporation will pave the way for handing over of the department to the highest bidder. “Since the government cannot directly give any department to a private firm, there will be the need for formation of a corporation first. Thus, MHA has to approve the same also. With the formation of a corporation, the stake will be of the government and other equity issues will also be covered,” sources said. Another key factor is financial approval for the project by the Centre. “The financial power of the Punjab governor and Chandigarh administrator on projects related to Chandigarh is Rs 100 crore and the power privatisation project is worth more than that, therefore MHA will have to give its financial clearance,” sources said. Box: Highest bidder Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution was the highest bidder for privatisation of the power department of Chandigarh administration with Rs 817 crore against a reserve price of Rs 174 crore. The company, which defeated big groups like Tata and Adani, is a subsidiary of Kolkata Electric Supply Corporation Ltd, a flagship of RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group. Earlier, out of 20 companies, seven were selected to participate in the tender process. Only these six companies deposited the EMD (Earnest Money Deposits) of Rs 10 crore with the engineering department of the Chandigarh administration.

Potholes were also filled with earth, and beaten. But, a sudden burst of rain washed it all. Video: Agitated locals make UP cabinet minister #BaldevSinghAulakh walk on a potholed, muddy road in #Rampur https://t.co/6d7dyNqZD7— TOIWestUP (@TOIWestUP) 1630296790000 Saturday afternoon gave locals of Rampur’s Bilaspur tehsil a chance to vent their anger. They gathered and stopped the convoy of cabinet minister Baldev Singh Aulakh. He was told to get down and take a walk on the road. And he did, as his cavalcade followed him. Later, the minister, who is also the local MLA, slammed the irresponsible attitude of local administration and the civic body. The BJP minister’s convoy, accompanied by Rampur district magistrate (DM) Ravindra Kumar Mander and several other senior district administration officials, was headed to inaugurate a newly-built oxygen plant in the city. It was stopped on a road which also leads to a community health centre (CHC). The locals who stopped the minister’s car were agitated as several complaints to repair the road over the last several months didn’t yield any result. Sukhdev Singh, a local, said, “Nothing has been done to address the problems of people, despite several complaints. The road’s condition is continuously deteriorating. Rains make it worse. We just cannot walk. Hundreds of people use this road daily.” Saleem Ahmed, another local, said, “After recent rain, the potholes on the road have been filled with rainwater. It becomes difficult to identify which of these is deeper. The risk of accident is always there. Not just pedestrians, it’s challenging for those on two wheelers too.” A few hours after the protest, Rampur DM held a meeting with several senior officials and asked them to repair the road immediately. The BJP minister said, “The issue being faced by people must be addressed at the earliest.” While addressing people at the inauguration event, he accused the local administration of being “irresponsible towards the developmental work in the area”. Aulakh also assured people that he will take up the matter at state-level. Last month, BJP MLA of Garhmukteshwar, Kamal Malik, who was on ‘padyatra’ to a village in Hapur’s Nanai area ahead of next year’s state polls, was dragged into a waterlogged street.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/up-minister-stopped-taken-through-potholed-muddy-road-by-angry-locals-in-rampur/articleshow/85746390.cms||Maria Khan

Police, who detained Devji Chavda, a resident of Rajiv Nagar on Jamnagar road, said that the offender didn’t even attempt to flee after his fanatical act as he claimed he wanted to be arrested. The incident happened at around 4pm at Bajrang Wadi police chowki located on Jamnagar road when Chavda, who lives opposite the police chowki, marched up to the place armed with fuel and set it ablaze. Some traders who saw the chowki burning rushed in to douse the flames and also informed the police. “As the chowki was closed, no one was injured,” Khumansinh Vala, inspector, Gandhigram police station told TOI. He said that police personnel immediately rushed to the spot and found the arsonist standing there and not making any attempt to escape from the spot. “We detained him and are probing the case,” Vala added. “During questioning, he told the police that he was tired of his wife and wanted to go to jail so that he would at least get food there. The man earns his livelihood by working as a daily wager,” police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/desiring-to-be-jailed-harassed-man-sets-police-chowki-afire/articleshow/85748837.cms||---

The cops later recovered the body with the help of locals. “The incident occurred around 11:30am. According to people around, the deceased slipped into the pool and was swept into the deep by strong current and drowned," station officer Kempty, Navin Jural, said. The deceased has been identified as Arvind, a resident of Hirapur village in Bulandshahr district. The flow of water at the Falls has increased during monsoon and the areas around the waterfall, particularly near the pools, has become quite slippery, according to locals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/man-from-up-drowns-while-taking-a-bath-at-kempty-falls/articleshow/85746363.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Goa||Behind Panaji’s risk to climate change lies lack of action plan||PANAJI: Even as Panaji sees regular flooding every monsoon with even the slightest acceleration of rainfall activity, the city, which is among India’s most vulnerable to climate change, is yet to switch to full-fledged action mode. As the same stories of waterlogging recur every year, scientists, environmentalists and activists are worried over the lack of plans to tackle climate change. One of the prime suspects is the status of the St Inez “nullah”, which is actually a creek that is capable of draining massive amounts of water. For decades now, politicians have managed to suppress and downgrade its true status. And lessons refuse to be learned despite regular warnings from nature, as the creek has been omitted from the state’s draft coastal zone management plan (CZMP). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently sounded a grim warning about extreme weather. This came close on the heels of the worrisome flooding episodes in Goa during Cyclone Tauktae in mid-May and during the monsoon. “Time is running out for saving the low-lying areas of Panaji and the densely populated areas of Ribandar, Merces, Chimbel, Calapor (St Cruz) and Taleigao from an ecological catastrophe, irreversible flooding being one of them,” said Nandkumar Kamat, environmentalist and former non-official member of the state-level steering committee (SLSC, 2008-15) of the Jawaharlal Nehru urban renewal mission (JNNURM). The hydrography of Tiswadi island was different during the centuries past, as it was drained by the wider floodplains of the Zuari and Mandovi rivers. Three creeks, including St Inez, sustained Panaji’s ecological security. “Successive governments have turned a blind eye to monitoring these creeks, and allowed massive ecological destruction. The St Inez water body has faced the worst conspiracy. The tidal flow has largely stopped after its bed level was raised below the D B Bandodkar road during IFFI 2004,” he said. The reasons are not hard to find: Hutments on the creek edge and rows of tall buildings — the setback rule being shockingly waived — are found leaning into the creek, and narrowing the channel. “On a single day, the St Inez creek can drain 300 million litres of water, but its capacity is reduced now,” Kamat said. The channel of an arm of the creek — behind the fire services complex emptying into the River Mandovi in an east-west direction — was allowed by politicians to be diverted for a building, and even narrowed a couple of decades ago, sources said. Now, the latest attempt to omit water bodies on the city periphery like St Cruz, and keep St Inez creek out of CRZ-1 provisions, has rankled citizens. “This is absolutely not right when Panaji will go under water. The most glaring omission of the creek in CZMP means CRZ is not applicable while a few other things are omitted,” said architect Tallulah D’Silva. D’Silva had pointed out at a public hearing on CZMP recently that the GIZ (Deutsche gesellschaft fur internationale zusammenarbeit, or German society for international cooperation) report in 2013 on Panaji’s vulnerability to flooding had suggested various measures — putting up infrastructure and strengthening existing systems to mitigate a sea level rise. “But considering the best climate change practices being pursued by some cities globally, Panaji has gone nowhere. Though we have a few plans for Smart City, none of these envisage planning for maintaining traditional systems — of which St Inez creek is one,” D’Silva said. Water bodies in khazan, which are interlinked to city creeks, are critically important, too. “All these poims (water bodies) should be clearly indicated with a distinct colour code and listed in eco-sensitive areas, which in some cases are missing or shown with ambiguity in CZMP,” said St Cruz-based activist Arturo D’Souza. The creek’s eco-restoration by removing natural and man-made obstructions — encroachments and sand deposition blocking the St Inez channel — is considered critically important to minimize climate change impacts. “Since the St Inez creek criss-crosses the city, it can serve as a vital outlet for excess rain water during extreme weather floods. The channel should have been properly used to divert rain water, but it is blocked on all sides,” said former NIO scientist Antonio Mascarenhas. Regarding the debate whether it is a creek or nullah, the issue had been settled more than a decade ago, after Mascarenhas, as an invitee of SLSC, had explained to then chief minister Manohar Parrikar the proof of tidal influence in the creek. “The survey of India topo sheet of 1964 clearly shows that the St Inez creek was a tidal water body. The tidal influence was observed about 2 km up to Tonca and beyond,” Mascarenhas said. All development on its banks has to be restricted beyond 100m or as per the width of the creek, whichever is less. CCP deputy mayor Vasant Agshikar said that the Covid-19 pandemic had stalled follow up action on climate change issues, but assured focussed action. “The flood water level has gone up, and we are identifying vulnerable spots to improve drainage systems. We are taking inputs from experts, while a comprehensive plan by the government (as part of climate resilience) in assessing water flow dynamics in and around city would help matters,” Agshikar said. He also said that the drainage system needs to be improved, as the water holding capacity of water bodies has diminished. Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) has asserted that instances of omissions and corrections suggested by stakeholders would be incorporated in the coastal plans. Kamat, along with another non-official member of SLSC of JNNURM, Joe D’Souza, and Mascarenhas, an invitee, had ten years ago opposed the creek’s beautification at a cost of Rs 19 crore. “Rich urbanites in Panaji hardly support its eco-restoration but want its beautification, as they don’t like to be regulated by CRZ, but there will be a heavy price to pay,” Kamat said. Meanwhile, CCP is planning to introduce electric buses to cut down carbon emissions, Agshikar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/behind-panajis-risk-to-climate-change-lies-lack-of-action-plan/articleshow/85751011.cms||Paul Fernandes

Chicalim Bio-Crusaders members Cyril Fernandes and Edwin Mascarenhas said that they noticed that the building’s sewage water was flowing into the STP from where it was then flowing into the public drainage. Fernandes shot a video and sent it to GSPCB’s environment engineer for his record and perusal. The engineer assured to send a team to the site for verification and investigation. They requested Fernandes to collect a sample of the discharge. In their complaint, the Chicalim Bio-Crusaders stated that the complex regularly discharges sewage in this manner every Sunday, a day on which the authorities are not working.

MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar told TOI that a demonstration will be held to check and iron out technical glitches in the online property tax payment software, as part of the trial and error run on Monday. The city corporation will be able to launch the online Self-assessment system (SAS) property tax payment system soon after rectifying all initial issues, the commissioner said. “We are in the process of aggregating the software with the support of Karnataka Bank, to facilitate online payment options,” he said. SAS tax calculation depends on the basic guidance value of the property, which is pre-determined by the MCC, based on the street, area and property type. Owners of the property may submit details of the property, including the number of floors, area and tenant details. Meanwhile, the software of the MCC will calculate the property tax to be paid by an owner, he added. Mayor Premanand Shetty said that the process of introducing the system is in the final stage. “The new software will have options for property owners to view details of their properties. People may log on to the property tax payment section, by clicking the link on MCC’s website. They may search their property by entering the ward name and door number. After accessing details of the property, people may generate challan to make payment of tax online,” he said. “At present, there are nearly 2.5 lakh properties in the city. The new system will not only make property tax payment convenient for residents, but also help the MCC to achieve its long-pending goal of converting the city corporation into a paperless office. The city corporation has already launched the online facility to pay water bills and trade licence fee for fresh and renewal applications,” the mayor said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mcc-to-hold-demo-on-online-property-tax-payment-system/articleshow/85746368.cms||---

The highways have been blocked due to landslides triggered by incessant rainfall since the past few days. While the Gangotri and Yamunotri highways have been obstructed for the past three days after a 10-12 meters stretch of the highway near Narendra Nagar in Tehri district was washed away, Badrinath highway was blocked at Totaghati and a couple of more places. According to the latest PWD report issued on Sunday, restoration work was being carried out at 70 roads that were blocked due to rain-related reasons. Besides the national highways, 10 state highways, 14 district roads, 49 village roads and 33 roads constructed under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY) were reported blocked due to landslides. PWD chief engineer Hariom Sharma told TOI, “ We are monitoring the situation and are in touch with officials looking after relief work at all the routes which got blocked after landslides and rains. Every effort is being made to streamline the traffic at the earliest.” Officials involved in opening up the blocked roads said that their work was being hampered due to continuous rainfall. “Even if we clear the debris, more rubble falls after fresh rain. The roads can be opened up fully only after the rainfall subsides. Till that time, people should travel in the hills only if it is absolutely necessary,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/rain-woes-persist-108-roads-still-blocked/articleshow/85746411.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa CM ignored objections by minister, govt officials on Bhumi bill||PANAJI: The Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill was introduced and passed in the Goa assembly ignoring the red flags raised by revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate and bureaucrats, RTI documents reveal. The various questions that were raised by the citizenry after the bill was passed were all put in the file on July 29 and 30 by the revenue minister, revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar, finance and law department officials. “The bill has not been administratively approved by the revenue minister. The bill has not been examined thoroughly and may have unforeseen wider ramifications,” said revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar, in his note. He had also suggested that the bill be published “for obtaining public comments”. The RTI documents show that in a note on July 29, Monserrate had warned that the proposed law was faulty on many counts and would jeopardize the interests of private owners, government departments, comunidades, devasthans and eco-sensitive zones. The revenue department also warned the state government that the provisions of the bill enabled the “forceful transfer of land” which would violate Article 300A of the Constitution. Monserrate also warned that as per its provisions, government employees staying in government housing could claim rights over their quarters. “There are many other implications of the bill which need to be examined by having a detailed discussion on each provision... After examination of the above points, the same may be introduced in the next assembly session,” said Monserrate in an official note. The RTI documents obtained by Congress’ RTI cell chairman Dominic Noronha prove that despite revenue secretary Kumar clearly writing on July 30 around 2am that the bill has not been administratively approved by the revenue minister and needed to be examined, Sawant ignored the concerns and introduced the bill in the House at 4am. The revenue, law and finance departments raised questions over the provisions of the bill and called for more details to be obtained before it was introduced in the state legislative assembly. Sawant overruled the adverse comments. “The proposal is not recommended in the form that it is in right now, and requires more detailing as land is a precious resource. Further, the introduction of the bill is not recommended,” said finance undersecretary Pranab Bhat. “The notings and the comments clearly expose the ulterior motive of the BJP government in misleading the general public who would fall for such political gimmicks, as it was well-known much beforehand that the bill would not stand the test of legal scrutiny as well as that it would require presidential accent,” said Congress spokesperson Aashish Kamat. Congress said that Sawant not only ignored the demand from the opposition to hold detailed discussions on the bill, but also brushed aside similar requests from IAS officers and his cabinet colleagues. Using the official documents, Congress said that Sawant got the bill approved by the cabinet on July 27, a day before the state legislative assembly session commenced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/sawant-ignored-objections-by-min-govt-officials-on-bhumi-bill/articleshow/85751043.cms||---

At 10.15 pm on Sunday, when the figures of daily vaccination were still being complied, the state crossed 10 lakh vaccinations in a single day. This was the second time the state reported more than 10 lakh inoculations, with the contribution of private hospital being almost negligible. Only 56 private vaccination centres provided jabs to beneficiaries in the state, while 5,683 vaccination centres conducted the inoculations. On June 25, the state had set the record of highest vaccinations done in a day when 10.45 lakh beneficiaries had received Covid vaccines. It was the biggest ever single-day vaccination in the state since the drive was launched on January16. “Despite being a Sunday, the health department’s vaccination team worked hard and achieved the milestone of vaccinating more than 10 lakh doses,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, project director (immunisation). Long queues were seen in different vaccination centres across the state with people gathered in large numbers for the jab. Out of more than 10 lakh doses, Sikar reported more than 1 lakh inoculations, the highest done in a district. Sirohi reported lowest number of doses with just 2,565 people receiving the jab. Till 10 pm, Jaipur reported 78,100 vaccinations. “I came here in the morning and waited for an hour. Since it was a Sunday, a lot of people came to get a jab,” said Sunita, a 30-year-old resident of Jhotwara, who came to get a dose of Covid vaccine at an urban primary health centre (UPHC) on Niwaru Road, where 351 persons were vaccinated. The enthusiasm for vaccination was not only seen in Jaipur, but also in other parts of the state as people turned out in large numbers. At Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs) at UPHC, Chomu, people started gathering since morning. As many as 1,641 beneficiaries received the jab at the vaccination centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/for-2nd-time-raj-administers-more-than-10-lakh-vax-in-a-day/articleshow/85751051.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat cities stare at water rationing||AHMEDABAD: Beginning September, major Gujarat cities may be staring at a rationed drinking water supply. From September onwards until March next year, of the 206 major and minor reservoirs, there will be an average of six reservoirs that will have drinking water reserves, and that too during specific periods. It will be the first time in many years that Gujarat’s Water Resources department has been compelled to adopt a staggered water supply to tide over the tight drinking water crisis. TimesViewIt will help if the Gujarat government, like 14 other states in the country, scripts its own water policy to manage the priceless and scarce resource. Instances of irregular rains will be a recurrent issue in the near future. The state, apart from enforcing metered water supply in cities, should also speed up the formulation of its own rules for groundwater governance The law that was passed by the Parliament in 2005 is yet to be implemented in the state.For instance, between September and October 2021, reservoirs such as Sani, Vartu-2, Ghee, Vadiya, Hiran-2 and Sipu will be tapped for drinking water stock. After that is exhausted, between November and December, the state will draw its drinking water reserves from Machchhu-1, Nyka, Brahmani-2, Fatehgadh. Between January and March drinking waters will be available at Hasnapur, Khambala, Sasoi, Trivani Thanga and Suvi reservoirs. Between April and July , which is the next monsoon reserved waters will be available with seven reservoirs Mukteshwar, Machchhu-2, Ozat-2, Bantva-Kharo, Sarthi, Raidy and Gajansar. A senior official of the Narmada, water resources department admitted that cities like Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot and Surat will have to stick to minimum supply of that is above 145 litres per capita per day (lpcd). “In Ahmedabad the norm should be 185 lpcd, but we see that consumption in certain areas goes beyond 220 and 270 lpcd. This is untenable. There is serious issues of drinking water,” said the official. A concept note presented before state government claimed that only six dams have water reserves of more than 90%. There are 54 dams that have water reserves less than 10% water, while there are 54 dams that have water reserves less than 10%. Last year during this time there was a storage of 12,347 million cubic metre (MCM), this year it is down to 8109.20MCM. “While strategizing the drinking water draw, each region was considered as a unit to optimize drinking water usage. We have also factored in the 7% evaporation that is expected to take place till April 2022 in these reservoirs,” says the official. The only consolation is that Sardar Sarovar dam has a reserve of 4,310MCM, which received 78MCM of water from Madhya Pradesh state in last 10 days. The average inflow into the Sardar Sarovar dam is 34,629 cusecs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guj-cities-stare-at-water-rationing/articleshow/85748850.cms||---

Pointing out that the number of people caught for not wearing masks has plunged to 4,000-5,000 from 15,000 during the peak of the second wave in March this year, Chahal told the ward officials to assign minimum targets to their ward marshals and ensure that the same is achieved. According to BMC data, on August 28, around 5,174 ‘mask-less’ people were penalised a total Rs 10.3 lakh in comparison to 24,809 violators who were fined a total Rs 49.6 lakh on March 6. Following the Covid outbreak in March last year, the BMC had made it mandatory for Mumbaikars to wear face masks in public areas. Violators are fined Rs 200. During the second wave in March this year, the BMC had doubled the number of marshals to penalise those who do not wear their mask properly and spit in public places. The marshals were given a target to act against 25,000 citizens per day. Chahal, in his message to all ward level officials, said: “I direct all assistant municipal commissioners in charge of wards to immediately act on this issue to ensure that citizens not wearing masks in public domain are fined and the minimum targets assigned earlier are achieved on a daily basis. I shall be personally monitoring the achievement of every ward.” Till date, nearly 32.1 lakh people have been caught for following the mask rule and over Rs 64.6 crore has been collected in fines. Mahim resident Mushtaq Ansari said: “Earlier we would see marshals at various locations in the city and even autorickshaw and taxi drivers would wear their face masks properly to avoid being penalised.

As there is no doctor at the PHC, which is surrounded by tribal settlements, ensuring the medical services and ramping up vaccination drives in border villages is affected. The demand for appointment of a doctor has fallen on deaf ears all these days. The government was handed over the PHC to a local NGO under public private partnership of Arogya Bandhu scheme. When doctors hesitate to work in distant remote and rural areas, the government has introduced this scheme in 2011-12 to ensure medical services to such areas by having an understanding with local NGOs and charitable trusts. Twenty PHCs in nine districts including the one at DB Kuppe have been handed over to NGOs. Apart from this, diagnostic and dialysis services have also been outsourced under PPP arrangements. CT scan services in 14 district hospitals and MRI services in five are provided this way. As per the scheme, the state government must pay the expenses of running the PHCs, including building maintenance and staff salary and also renew the agreement every year. The agreement terms ended three months ago, and the government has not paid the local NGO running the PHC in DB Kuppe. The PHC was running without a doctor and other staff for the last three months. People who depended on the PHC are now forced to travel to the Anatharasanthe PHC, nearly 25km away by passing through Nagarhole forest areas, Thirupathi, former DB Kuppe GP president told TOI. As Covid cases were also increasing in Kerala, people in the border areas are worried about spread of the virus, he said. The lack of staff at DB Kuppe is also affecting the vaccination drive and other services. People have urged the district administration to appoint a doctor to the pHC soon. District health officer Dr TH Prasad said told TOI that the state government has appointed four staff including a doctor to the DB Kuppe PHC on temporary basis. As the government has sufficient staff, it may discontinue the services of the NGO, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/phc-in-hd-kote-along-kerala-border-has-no-doctor/articleshow/85746412.cms||---

In a big move, the state government plans to create a fund of funds that will be used to incentivise startups that want to shift their operations to Goa. Giving a brief snapshot of the coming policy measures, director of IT Ankita Anand said that women entrepreneurs whose business concept is still in the ideation phase could receive a monthly allowance of Rs 22,000 per month for a year till their enterprise takes off. Anand was speaking at the Goa Startup Conclave and Entrepreneurship Summit. The current Goa Startup Policy 2017 is set to lapse by September end after being extended twice. “The new policy will offer assistance for startups to relocate to Goa,” said Anand. “We will be creating a fund of funds and I will be seeking assistance of the DPIIT (Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade) and Startup India with respect to the fund of funds. This will help startups setup their major operations in Goa and employ more than 50% locals.” She said that the incentive could be utilised by various startups, particularly those headed by Goans, but which are in other states, so that they can return to Goa. “It is an opportunity for them to come back to Goa, to come back to their roots and motivate students here too,” said Anand. The new startup policy will be sector agnostic, allowing new business ventures from any industry and not just from the IT sector, to seek incentives. Stating that women constitute about 30% of Goa’s startup sector, Anand said, “The government will provide a monthly allowance for women entrepreneurs at the idea stage with Rs 22,000 per month for a period of one year and technology support for women for up to Rs 10 lakh.” Under the existing policy, there are 111 certified startups in Goa and around Rs 1.1 crore has been disbursed to startups under the policies. The state has decided to discontinue the popular seed capital fund scheme which used to sanction Rs 10 lakh as seed capital in three tranches to startups. Instead, Goa’s IT department will help Goan startups obtain funding from the Startup India Seed Fund scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/revamped-goa-startup-policy-to-woo-tech-cos-to-relocate-ops-to-state/articleshow/85751070.cms||Newton Sequeira

The woman and her daughter had left the bag in the auto to visit a public toilet. When a team of police reached Chahal village in Kaushambi district in UP looking for accused Laxmikant Tripathi (45), his relatives prevented his arrest and called the sarpanch of the village to refrain Mumbai Police from taking his custody. It was then that the team took the help of top officials in UP and arrested Tripathi. The victim, Magimiri Kondar (26), a resident of Versova, was leaving for her native place on August 11 with her husband when the incident took place. “Magimiri was not keeping well and vomited in the auto after which she asked the driver to stop near a public toilet near Halav Pool in Kurla. The couple went inside to clean up leaving the bag in the auto. But when they came out, the auto rickshaw was gone,” said senior inspector Shashank Shelke.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-auto-driver-who-fled-with-bag-containing-gold-nabbed-in-up/articleshow/85752558.cms||Ahmed Ali

The task force, equipped with earth-movers, trucks and other vehicles, will commence the drive from Monday, to clear encroachments, said MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar. A decision in this regard was taken by the city corporation, following pressure from corporators, who insisted that footpaths should be made free from street vendors and other encroachers. The issue was discussed in the council meeting held in July, and recently on Friday. Corporators from the Congress in the opposition including Jacintha Vijay Alfred and Praveenchandra Alva, had raised the issue at the council meeting on Friday. The corporators had demanded the city corporation to act against encroachers and clear encroachments. Alva had urged the city corporation to depute more staff, and procure additional vehicles and equipment, to evict vendors who are illegally occupying footpaths, as well as other encroachments. Mayor Premanand Shetty said that the city corporation has been carrying out drives against encroachments on footpaths. “We will launch a massive drive from Monday, to clear all encroachments in the city. The officials will have no pressure from corporators and political leaders, as all corporators have demanded unanimously, that they will not interfere when officials carry out drives to clear encroachments,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/special-task-force-to-clear-encroachments-on-footpaths-in-city/articleshow/85746446.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Like Ladakh, Uttarakhand pushes for astro tourism, to build 4 ‘star gazing’ spots||NAINITAL: There is little that the remote village of Benital — 60 km from Uttarakhand’s summer capital Gairsain — is known for, except its vast alpine meadows. There are no industries, hotels or tourist facilities in the hamlet. And so it has remained, for years, relatively untouched by tourism that has overrun most of the hill stations. That’s precisely why the Uttarakhand government is now turning the area — at an altitude of around 2,500m — into an astronomy tourism spot, equipped with telescopes and night-vision domes to give a clearer view of the heavens. “There is minimal light pollution — which can blur the skies — in Benital. In fact, there is very little disturbance caused by human habitation or activities. Its location also provides a clear glimpse of the sky, making it an ideal spot to introduce astronomy tourism in the state,” Chamoli district magistrate, Himanshu Khurana, told TOI. The government will install telescopes, night-vision domes and tourist huts in the area, which falls in Karnprayag in Chamoli district, for an estimated cost of Rs 5 crore. “But tourism will be highly regulated here,” said the official, adding they would be building approach roads to provide smooth access to astronomy buffs. “The under-construction Rishikesh-Karnprayag railway line will also enhance connectivity to the site. We will start construction as soon as the transfer of forest land is complete,” he said. Secretary (tourism) Dilip Jawalkar told TOI that apart from Benital, three other locations would also be developed as astro-tourism spots. These include adjoining villages of Taklula and Devasthal near Nainital, the Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary in Almora and the cartography museum near George Everest Estate near Mussoorie. “The cartography museum was selected since it already has a few huts that were used for star gazing. The site in adjoining villages in Nainital will be developed by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) and the district administration. In Binsar, existing cottages can be used by tourists,” said Jawalkar. The astro-tourism in Uttarakhand will be built along the lines of Ladakh, which is gradually emerging as an astronomy tourism hub with its low light pollution and distinctive geographical features. For instance, astrostays, a network of homestays that provide stargazing sessions, have recently come up in the union territory which harbours The Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO), located in Hanle near Leh, which is among the world’s highest located sites for optical telescopes. S B Pandey, a scientist at Aries, said the telescopes used for tourism purposes are generally ones with 10-20 cm diameter. “They are the ones used for astro-photography as well. But telescopes with higher diameters are used for research purposes and their cost can run into crores. For eg, the telescope used in Hanle has a diameter of 2m while the one in Aries is larger, at 3.6m,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/like-ladakh-ukhand-pushes-for-astro-tourism-to-build-4-star-gazing-spots/articleshow/85746479.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Delhi||Skywalk crawls to completion, to connect metro station with New Delhi Railway Station||NEW DELHI: After many delays, engineering challenges and several waves of Covid-19, the skywalk planned at New Delhi Railway Station is finally nearing completion and is expected to become operational by October. It will help passengers reach the nearby Delhi Metro stations without crossing four lanes of busy traffic with baggage in tow. The 210-metre state-of-the-art skywalk, which would be an extension of the foot overbridge (FOB) inside the railway station and take commuters directly to New Delhi Metro Station, Airport Express Line, autorickshaw bays and parking lots, is being constructed by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in collaboration with Northern Railway. The project is expected to help streamline traffic flow on the Ajmeri Gate side of the railway station. In the pipeline for nearly three years, the project faced delays soon after taking off in 2019. A ban on construction last winter and the Covid-19 outbreak halted the work. Construction resumed with safety guidelines in place, but just when the skywalk started taking shape, the second Covid-19 wave brought work to a grinding halt. A DMRC official said all steel spans of the skywalk were erected and 100 metres of the total 188 metres of the “diagrid” structure, which would support the roof, had been completed. The skywalk would have a contemporary and sleek design and be a lightweight structure with metal and glass fittings. It would have an open design to ensure ventilation. There would be a canopy to protect commuters from harsh weather. A plaza would be made with a small visitors’ lounge offering comfortable seating and toilet facilities. “All entry structure work has been completed, except the existing staircase of the railway FOB. Finishing is in progress at all entry and exit points and zinc cladding has started in the junction building,” the DMRC official said. At present, commuters coming out of the Ajmeri Gate side of the railway station have to walk a considerable distance with baggage in tow to reach New Delhi Metro Station and the Airport Express Line station. Those coming out of the Metro station have to cross the road, enter the railway station and then climb an FOB again to reach the platforms. Another reason for the long detour to reach the Metro station is because DMRC had made the gate closest to the railway station exit to avoid crowding. Those entering the Metro station have to take a long walk to reach the other gate leading to the Airport Express Line. By October, the FOB would be extended to the Airport Express Line parking building across Bhavbhuti Marg through the skywalk. There would be escalators and elevators to take passengers to the different gates of the Metro stations, autorickshaw and taxi bays and the railway station parking lots.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/skywalk-crawls-to-completion-to-connect-metro-station-with-ndls/articleshow/85749059.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Till now, over 17.24 lakh doses have been administered in the district. According to the health department, “On August 2, the number of people vaccinated against Covid was 12,22,404, which surged to 17,24,827 on August 29. Altogether, over 5.02 lakh recipients were covered in August alone.” As many as 7,800 women were vaccinated at ‘Pink Booth’ at MLN Medical College, while 4,100 international flyers were also given the shot. On an average, over 15,000 recipients were being given jab every day and over 40 percent of targeted recipients have taken jabs in the Sangam City so far. Health officials have set a target of 42.39 lakh recipients, including 29 lakh aged between 18 and 44 and 12.87 lakh above 45 years. The number of recipients vaccinated till August 21 was 15,68,335 and over 1.56 lakh were covered in one week as the graph of vaccinated people reached 17,24,827 on August 29. Officials said recipients sharing their experience, easing of misconceptions about vaccination and its side-effects and busting of various myths about vaccination are the three prime factors that have helped in ramping up the exercise. District Immunisation officer and additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that the department is ramping up the drive to cover the maximum number of recipients in coming days. He said the department has been successful in its endeavour as over 40 percent of targeted recipients have been given jabs so far. On Saturday, as many as 14,022 recipients in Prayagraj received jabs, which included 22 of first dose and 13,973 of second dose.

His condition was precarious as he had just recovered from a condition known as Extra Hepatic Portal Vein Obstruction (EPHVO) where the vein that supplies 80% of blood to liver gets blocked. Dr Aashay Shah, a city-based pediatric gastroenterologist, said that the primary sign of this disorder is recurrent heavy bouts of blood and enlarged spleen. “We planned an endoscopy and found the giant varices which were endoscopically ligated. The procedure was repeated to save his life by preventing excessive bleeding. Meanwhile, the child was later diagnosed with MIS-C and spent days at ICU. Once he was free of that, we performed glue therapy to seal the bleeding sites from stomach and esophagus,” said Dr Shah. Pratyush on Friday took part in Janmashtami celebrations in the costume of Lord Krishna, being able to be a part of the function for the first time, said the treatment givers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/from-mis-c-to-playing-krishna/articleshow/85748976.cms||---

Many temples usually had celebrations at midnight. For the festival night, curfew timings have been relaxed as devotees will like to visit the major temples. The chants of ‘Nand gher aanand bhayo, jai Kanaiyalal ki’ will reverberate in temples and homes.

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Municipal schools reel under poor infrastructure, apathy||AMARAVATI: Municipal schools, which are catering to education needs of the poor children from urban slums, are struggling with inadequate infrastructure and proper monitoring system. With the government setting its focus mainly on strengthening rural schools, the municipal schools were neglected. The absence of a separate directorate to monitor the functioning of municipal schools has become a setback in resolving the issues of teachers, students and other staff. The state’s municipal school education system, commissioned 163 years ago, is one of the oldest streams in the country. Academicians say that the school managements continuing the old rules are leading to disorder in urban public schools. The directorate of municipal administration is not focusing on the issue although over 1,500 slums came up in municipal towns with a population increase of over 10 to 15 per cent in the last two decades. “This is a serious issue. Unlike the daily wagers in rural areas, the urban poor lost work during Covid-19, which might force them to discontinue education of their children,” said SVS Lakshminarayana, social activist and historian. Municipal Teachers Federation (MTF) state president S Ramakrishna said no new school has come up in municipal towns in the last two decades. “Municipal teachers are treated shabbily by the department as many municipal commissioners are unaware of the importance of teachers and municipal schools,” said Ramakrishna. In 1966, the Kothari Commission suggested appointment of school supervisors. The commission had also observed that school supervisors should have expertise in education psychology, children’s psychology and pedagogy. Several decades have passed since then, but nothing has changed in the field. Teachers in rural and urban areas are recruited through the test conducted by District Selection Committee (DSC) where toppers of the test would prefer municipal schools. The toppers are left in the lurch while the others have better facilities in rural schools, said K Malathi, a school teacher. “The education stream is being managed by the School Education Department and infrastructure and services of the teachers are managed by Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA). No one is really interested in looking into the issues concerning urban schools,” said B Heena.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/municipal-schools-reel-under-poor-infrastructure-apathy/articleshow/85748987.cms||Samdani MN

VHP regional secretary Lal Mani Tiwari said that VHP (gauraksha division), apart from forming gauraksha mobile squad at block and tehsil level to check the smuggling of cows, and irregularities being held at cows shelter houses, are also promoting biofertilizers among farmers. Tiwari said that chances of cancer and other fatal diseases go up due to the consumption of vegetables and fruits grown with the help of chemicals and fertilizers and claimed that biofertilizer is the key to protect people from several diseases. On Sunday, farmers and other volunteers from 150villages of trans-Yamuna pockets were imparted training for use of biofertilizers. Farmers were also told about the ill effects of chemical fertilizers and claimed that there is a strong need to promote the nursing of indigenous breeds of cows. VHP leaders said that in the current situation, indigenous breed cows are missing in the villages and people are more interested in rearing jersey cows. They claimed that many people are not aware of the ill effects of jersey cow's milk, which can also cause diseases and other health issues. Meanwhile, Tiwari said that at least 10 volunteers would be inducted into the gauraksha mobile squad at tehsil, block and city level, and the volunteers would be taking and promoting measures to protect cows.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/vhp-promotes-use-of-biofertilizers/articleshow/85751173.cms||---
---||Dehradun||‘Road widening causing recurring landslides on stretch on Dehradun-Mussoorie road’||MUSSOORIE: After the rains started this year, wreaking havoc across Uttarakhand, debris and boulders started rolling down the hillside on a stretch near Galogi power station on the Mussoorie-Dehradun road. As a result, frequent roadblocks and subsequent traffic jams have been reported on this extremely busy tourist road, with several vehicles even being hit by falling debris. Residents believe it all started last monsoon, after the PWD scraped off the hillside for road widening and did not put any barriers to protect the road. Two tourist vehicles have been damaged in the last one week and after heavy rainfall on Thursday, the road was blocked the entire night and traffic snarls continued till Saturday. Geeta Kumai, ward member of Mussoorie Municipal Council, said, “Frequent landslides not only stall traffic but also pose grave risks to motorists. Are officials waiting for a major disaster to occur? Immediate precautions must be taken to secure the site.” “This area needs to be treated on priority. It might be a good idea to hand over Mussoorie-Dehradun road to the National Highway Authority or get it included in all-weather roads for better maintenance,” suggested Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand hotels’ association. Hugh Gantzer, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed Monitoring Committee for environmental issues of Doon Valley and Mussoorie, said, “The landslide zone that has been created at Galogi clearly indicates how fragile the hills around Mussoorie are. Disturbing these hills for constructing the ropeway between Dehradun and Mussoorie or for making a tunnel near Gandhi Chowk might prove to be disastrous.” When queried by TOI, Hari Om Sharma, chief engineer of PWD, denied any connection between road widening and the recurring landslides. “Although road widening has been done at this location, these landslides are not an outcome of that. We are in the process of preparing a detailed project report (DPR) for the treatment of this site and hopefully we’ll be able to initiate it in the next few months,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/road-widening-causing-recurring-landslides-on-stretch-on-doon-mussoorie-rd/articleshow/85746537.cms||Anmol Jain

Traffic had been blocked by Hyderabad police who deployed a large number of personnel to ensure that the no-traffic enforcement was followed through. For this, motorists were diverted to alternative routes as announced earlier by the city police. Officials said that traffic movement had slowed down in the alternative routes and there were occasional traffic congestions on these routes. “Now, the Tank Bund beautification work is almost completed. Only pedestrians are allowed around the waterfront area just like in several countries abroad,” a police personnel said. To check the enforcement of the no-traffic hours, Hydeabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar himself made an inspection visit to the area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/no-traffic-hours-on-tank-bund-a-success/articleshow/85752589.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Gambling cash seizure up by 1,800% in August||AHMEDABAD: The tradition of gambling in the month of Shravan is at a new high with cops seizing Rs 26 lakh cash from gamblers this month. The trend shows that there is a rise of 1,800% in cash seizures from gamblers, which rose from around Rs 27,000 on August 1 to Rs 5 lakh on August 29. There is a tradition in Gujarat of Shravanio Jugar (gambling) in Shravan month, which started on August 8 this year. People, even families, try gambling on Satam and Aatham (Krishna Janmashtami) in the state, mainly in Saurashtra. According to the figures of city police, the cops filed 194 cases under the gambling act, arrested 945 persons and seized Rs 26.29 lakh between August 1 and August 29. In July, city police filed 149 cases, nabbed 636 persons and seized Rs 21.48 lakh cash used in the offences. If a major raid in the Dariapur area where 198 persons were caught and around Rs 11 lakh cash seized on July 6 is excluded, then the seizure in August is double of that in July. According to the city police, the highest 26 cases of gambling were registered on Sunday — the festival of Satam – a day before Janmashtami. “On Sunday, 144 persons were arrested and Rs 5.19 lakh cash was seized. This is the highest seizure and arrests in August. The numbers of cases, arrests and seizures are likely to exceed on Janmashtami,” said a city police officer. Joint commissioner of police, sector-1, R V Asari, said that there is no change in the traditional way of gambling, especially during the Satam-Aatham festivals. “Apart from the professional gamblers who are often caught, we register an increase of cases due to tradition of gambling in the festival time,” said Asari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gambling-cash-seizure-up-by-1800-in-aug/articleshow/85749064.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Airline ordered to pay flyers for delay, hefty rebooking cost||HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here has directed SpiceJet Airlines to pay Rs 2 lakh as punitive damages and pay about Rs 55,000 to complainants for the delay in flight and forcing them to rebook tickets at a higher price. The forum directed the airlines to pay half of the amount of the punitive damages to complainants and the remaining half to deposit with the State Consumer Welfare Fund. J Suryanarayana and his wife Bharati, the complainants, submitted that they had purchased flight tickets from SpiceJet, Regional Office, Hyderabad, through an online travel company on October 31, 2018, to and fro from Hyderabad-Delhi-Srinagar. Accordingly, they made accommodation and other arrangements. They said that on December 22, 2018, they received an SMS as well as a recorded message stating that their flight from Hyderabad to Delhi scheduled at 8.30 am will be delayed and will depart instead at 4.16 pm. After contacting and taking the advice of the online travel firm, they said they rebooked tickets to catch the connecting flight of SpiceJet from Delhi to Srinagar, without any disturbance. The complaints said they were later informed that partial cancellation from Hyderabad to Delhi was not possible. So, left with no alternative, they had to cancel Delhi-Srinagar flight tickets as well. To their surprise, the complainants said that they found they had been again booked on the same flight which they were forced to cancel, but at a much higher cost. They said their request to the airline to refund Rs 30,000 they had to spend extra due to wrong guidance was rejected. They said they filed that complaint with the consumer forum after approaching the nodal officer and appellate authorities who offered only Rs 1,000 per person as compensation. During trial, the bench noticed that the airlines failed to submit documentary evidence. “Mere pleading of delay, which is due to operational reasons/technical snag, but failing to prove the same by filing no documents to substantiate their pleadings has no value in the eye of law,” the bench said, adding that cancelling booked tickets and rebooking them at a higher price amounted to unfair trade practice. The airlines, in its written version, denied the allegations made in the complaint and urged the forum to dismiss the complaint with heavy costs||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/airline-ordered-to-pay-flyers-for-delay-hefty-rebooking-cost/articleshow/85752587.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Sealing buildings cannot be the way forward now, complain Pali Hill residents. With the state government opening up most of the city, restricting their movement now would mean having to skip work and taking a pay cut, they added. BMC officials, however, said that the rule is clear: Buildings with more than five Covid cases will be sealed to curb spread. H-West ward, which covers Bandra, Santacruz and Khar west, is currently recording the second highest growth in daily cases at 0.07%, which is above Mumbai’s average ward-wise growth in cases of 0.04%. Madhu Poplai of the Pali Hill Residents’ Association said: “Residents are worried about the entire building being sealed as people who are not infected cannot afford to stay locked in for two weeks, especially now when everyone is getting back to work. This cannot be the way ahead.” “This is like going back to March, during the second wave, when buildings were sealed. People still need to take precautions—wear masks properly and ensure social distance in crowded places even if they have taken both vaccine doses,” she added. Local corporator Swapna Mhatre said that though the case count is increasing, the intensity of the symptoms is not severe. “Most patients are recovering well in home quarantine. So far, it has not been as bad as the second wave, when many needed hospitalisation,” Mhatre added. —Richa Pinto||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pali-hill-upset-with-sealing-of-bldgs-when-mumbai-city-opening/articleshow/85751529.cms||Richa Pinto

According to police, CCTV footages played a big role in laying bare their crime. Palani all woman police said they were informed about a girl stranded at the bus stand close to midnight on August 24. The police led by inspector P Kavitha admitted her at a home for children in Dindigul. Assuming that the child could have strayed away from her parents, the police began efforts to trace her whereabouts. CCTV footage at the bus stand showed an unidentified man and a woman getting down from a bus from Rajapalayam, abandoning her there and returning on the same bus. The police managed to trace the bus in which they travelled. Inquiry with the bus conductor revealed that the duo got down at Thirumangalam bus stop in Madurai in the early hours of August 25. CCTV at Thirumangalam showed that the duo went to a lodge there, where they spent a day before going to his house in Periya Alangulam. On Sunday, the two were in disbelief when the police reached their doorstep at Periya Alangulam. Inspector Kavitha said they got their address and contact details at the lodge. The duo confessed to the crime as they considered the child a hindrance to their affair as the girl was born from her first marriage. Anandhakumari was married to Mohan Kumar of Tirupur in 2019 and bore the child. The couple got separated and she lived with her sister in Pollachi, Coimbatore. She developed a relationship with Maruthu who worked as a mason there and moved in with him. The duo was booked under the Juvenile Justice Act. The mother was booked under section 75 for abandoning her child and exposing her to harm, while the man was booked under section 87 for abetting the crime. They were arrested and sent to judicial custody. The inspector said that the child was troubled for one day after her recovery and is now active. But for the words amma (mother) and mama (uncle) she does not speak anything else.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/mother-paramour-held-for-abandoning-2-yr-old-at-bus-stand/articleshow/85751242.cms||---

If prices of ‘shahjeera’, imported from Kabul, continue to soar due to short supply, pretty soon a dive into your favourite biryani is going to be costlier. Price of ‘shahjeera’ has risen from Rs 380/kg to Rs 490/kg due to break in supply following the Afghanistan crisis, said Avinash Devda, joint secretary of Hyderabad Kirana Merchants Association at Begum Bazar. “Most popular eateries in twin cities buy the Kabul ‘shahjeera’ in bulk from Begum Bazar, especially for biryani,” Devda said. A staff of a well-known biryani joint in Secunderabad said that the spice added flavour along with other dry fruits. “Apart from offline, we are selling over 500 biryani parcels online. Currently, chicken biryani prices are between Rs 250 and Rs 350 per plate. The prices may go up by Rs 50 per plate if there is ‘shahjeera’ shortage,” he said. As the spice can’t be stored for long, a trader in Begum Bazar said the prices would rise further once the current stocks are exhausted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/shahjeera-shortage-to-cost-biryani-lovers-dear/articleshow/85752590.cms||Sunil Mungara

Dudekula Rehana (26), the main accused, had made a deal for Rs 50,000 with Dudekula Haleem Begam (33) through Shaik Rahamathunnisa Begum (34) to provide them a baby. Police arrested the women on charges of kidnap and human trafficking. One Yeruva Komali, a native of Karampudi in Guntur district, was admitted to Markapuram Government Hospital on August 23 and gave birth to a baby girl the next day. As the baby was diagnosed with jaundice, she was kept under phototherapy on August 27. The girl went missing on August 28 evening from the phototherapy room. Komali and her husband Sriramulu made enquiries in the hospital and complained to the authorities about the missing of their child. The hospital authorities informed the police as eyewitnesses told them that a burkha-clad woman had left the hospital with a baby. Prakasam district SP Malika Garg alerted all police stations in the district and ordered for vehicle checks at district border check posts and key junctions in the district. Meanwhile, the hospital CCTV footage was retrieved in which Rehana was seen leaving the hospital with the baby. Police used the CCTV footage to track Rehana’s movements by matching the footage from other CCTVs and traced her at a children hospital in Cumbum. She admitted that she kidnapped the baby to give her distant relative, Haleema Begum, for Rs 50,000. Police then arrested the other two women and rescued the baby. The cops also recovered Rs 50,000 from Rehana.

Speaking to TOI, panchayat president K S M Manimuthu said the project has helped to scientifically deal with the garbage generated by the panchayat and also help reduce its electricity bill. “The panchayat spends around Rs 12 lakh every year on electricity bills. This plant would pave the way to reduce the money spent for payment of electricity bills so that funds which are saved could be used for other developmental activities in the panchayat,” he said. The plant was set up at a cost of Rs 65 lakh under National Rurban Mission following Sivaganga district collector P Madhusudhan Reddy’s idea. The plant was inaugurated by minister for rural development K R Periyakaruppan on August 10. Manimuthu explained that the plant grinds the wastes and converts it into biogas, which is subsequently used to generate electricity. “The plant has a capacity to produce 200 units of electricity by processing two tonnes of waste. Currently the electricity generated at the plant is used to power 20 street lights. Steps are underway to power 200 street lights.” He said that before work on the plant began, a meeting was organised with the villagers where they were asked to hand over biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste separately. He said that six battery operated vehicles are used to collect the biodegradable wastes for the plant from houses. Now these vehicles are charged using the electricity generated from the plant. Around 70-80kg of biodegradable waste is collected from the panchayat daily. Apart from this, they receive waste from Sivaganga municipality and hotels situated in towns. Nearly 200kg of wastes is collected per day for generating electricity. “Apart from generating electricity, the wastewater generated from the plant can be used as organic pesticide and the sediment can be used as organic fertilizers in agricultural lands. These by-products are also being sold by the panchayat,” said Manimuthu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/kanjirangal-panchayat-earns-pms-praise-for-making-power-from-waste/articleshow/85751221.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Delhi||N Delhi fire: NGT panel imposes a Rs 96.2L cost on bldg owner, tenants||New Delhi: A National Green Tribunal-appointed committee has calculated an environmental compensation of Rs 96.2 lakh to be imposed on the property owner and tenants of the building that caught fire in north Delhi’s Pratap Nagar, leading to the death of a 35-year-old man and three other getting injured. The building was missing a number of permissions and was operating multiple small factories and packaging units inside, when a fire broke out in February this year. The committee consisted of expert members from North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board, who found that the factory was running in a residential area, had no fire safety equipment or fire extinguishers and an emergency staircase was found to be permanently closed. The committee in its report, a copy of which is with TOI, also recommends setting up a special task force (STF) to identify all industries operating in residential areas and without permission, asking for discoms to not provide electricity connection to a factory or industry that operates in a non-conforming area. Following orders from the NGT in March, the panel calculated the environmental compensation amount factoring in the total number of days the building had been violating norms, the pollution index of the type of industry operating inside the premises and the population factor in the vicinity. The committee held an inspection in the area on April 9, 2021, with the members concluding that the blaze started from a room where nail polish or lipsticks were being stored or manufactured. “The said premises is located in a residential area, which is not as per the Master Plan of Delhi. The premises consisted of ground floor, first floor and a terrace covered with a tin shed. The ground floor was being used as a godown, while the first floor consisted of 14 rooms, of which three rooms were being used for manufacturing lipstick and nail polish,” the report, submitted to the NGT on August 24, stated. It further claimed that the panel found that the owner had rented out the property to a tenant, who had further sub-let the property to three other people. “In the said premises, all activities were operating without obtaining any statutory permission from any of the department,” the report added, stating an amount of Rs 96.18 lakhs should be imposed as environmental compensation, which has been calculated from the period of the initial rent agreement (October 1, 2019) till the date of the fire (February 27, 2021).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/n-delhi-fire-ngt-panel-imposes-a-rs-96-2l-cost-on-bldg-owner-tenants/articleshow/85749127.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||India||Justice Nagarathna to have third shortest term as CJI||NEW DELHI: Justice B V Nagarathna will take the first step towards becoming first woman chief justice of India (CJI) on Tuesday when she takes oath as a Supreme Court Judge but with a scheduled tenure of 36 days as the head of judiciary, from September 24-October 29, 2027, it would be the third shortest in the 77 year history of SC. Among the nine who would be administered oath of office as SC Judges in the biggest auditorium on Tuesday by CJI N V Ramana, there will be two more who would go on to head the judiciary. Justice Vikram Nath would be CJI for seven months and 21 days from February 2 till September 23, 2027. After Justice Nagarathna, senior advocate P S Narasimha would head the judiciary for six months and four days from October 30, 2027 till May 3, 2028. Justice Kamal Narain Singh had the shortest tenure of 18 days as CJI, from November 25 to December 13, 1991. Justice S Rajendra Babu had the second shortest tenure of 30 days from May 2-May 31, 2004, more than half of which was consumed by the summer break. Justice J C Shah had a tenure of 36 days as CJI from December 17 1970 to January 21, 1971, overcoming strong rumours that the Union government wanted to supersede him by bringing an outsider. The SC had till then followed the convention of the senior most judge taking the mantle from the retiring CJI. It was only in 1973 that Justice A N Ray, fourth in seniority, was appointed as CJI superseding Justices J M Shelat, K S Hegde and A N Grover. All three had resigned. Justice Nagaratha's 36 day tenure as CJI would be identical to that of Justice Shah. Her father, Justice E S Venkataramiah, too had a short tenure of six months as CJI, from June 19 till December 17, 1989. It will be the second instance of father-child duo becoming CJI, after the Chandrachuds. While Justice Y V Chandrachud will have the unbreachable record holder for the longest tenure as CJI of seven years and four months, his son Justice D Y Chandrachud would be CJI for two years and two days from November 9, 2022 till November 10, 2024. Justice Gopal Ballav Patnaik spent just 40 days as CJI, from November 8 to December 18, 2002, with the last few days of his chief justiceship being during the winter break. With the nine new Judges taking oath on Tuesday, the working strength of SC would be 33, leaving just one vacancy. This increment in the number of Judges has allowed CJI Ramana to create history on Tuesday by setting up nine three-judge benches along with three two-judge benches. Never before, the SC had so many three-judge benches on a single day. When the SC began its journey on January 26, 1950, it had a sanctioned strength of eight, including the first CJI Harilal Jekisondas Kania, who died in office on November 6, 1951, which cut short his scheduled tenure by four years. The first increase in the sanctioned strength of SC Judges to 11 took place in 1956 on the initiative of the fifth Chief Justice Sudhi Ranjan Das. Four years later, sixth CJI Bhuvaneshwar Prasad Sinha, shortly after becoming the head of judiciary, persuaded a "skeptical PM Jawaharlal Nehru that more Judges were needed to cope with an increased workload and increase of cases in arrears." According to renowned SC chronicler G H Gadbois, "Nehru told Sinha that he was under the impression that judges didn't work very long hours." In 1960, the sanctioned strength was increased to 14 judges. In 1977, the strength of SC was increased by four to 18 judges during the chief justiceship of M H Beg, who was controversially appointed as CJI by superseding Emergency era hero SC judge H R Khanna, who penned his lone historic dissent on a five-judge bench in A D M Jabalpur case in 1976. Justice Khanna had tendered his resignation on being superseded. This was the second time in succession that the Indira Gandhi government had resorted to the devious tool of supersession to anoint convenient judges as CJI, the first being Justice A N Ray, who in 1973 superseded three - Justices Jayendra Manilal Shelat, Kawdoor Sadanand Hegde and Amar Nath Grover. Previously, all 13 CJIs were appointed as per the tradition of senior most SC Judge succeeding a retiring CJI. The three superseded judges, all senior to Justice Ray, lost no time in tendering their resignations. The tool of supersession has never been used since then by any government after appointment of Justice Beg as CJI in 1977. The next increase in sanctioned strength, from 18 to 26, was notified by the government on May 9, 1986 during the chief justiceship of P N Bhagwati, who is said to be opposed to such increase and wanted the court to be lean and thin with permanent larger benches for constitutional matters and small benches for hearing appeals. Despite spiralling litigation after the opening up of the economy in the 1990s, the SC had to wait for 23 years for the next increase in sanctioned strength from 26 to 31, which happened in 2009 during the tenure of Justice K G Balakrishnan as CJI. The final increment in the sanctioned strength to 34 was notified by the government in 2019 after the then CJI Ranajan Gogoi wrote a long letter requesting this. However, his suggestion to increase the retirement age of HC judges from present 62 years to 65 years is still pending consideration of the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/justice-nagarathna-to-have-third-shortest-term-as-cji/articleshow/85753831.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Kochi||Kerala: Former chief minister Oommen Chandy gets the blame for DCC fiasco||KOTTAYAM: Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Oommen Chandy is facing trouble at his home turf Puthuppally after the Congress party workers as well as the members of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church here alleged that the senior leader has deserted his close aide Philson Mathews in the race for the Kottayam DCC president. Mathews, a known Chandy loyalist and the managing committee member of the Jacobite church, was the front runner for the post till Saturday morning. However, the last-minute changes made in the Alappuzha and Idukki districts saw Mathews losing out, giving way to Nattakom Suresh, who was the nominee of senior Congress leader and MLA Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan. Mathews, who hails from Puthuppally constituency from which Chandy had won all the 12 elections since 1970, has also been Chandy’s election manager in the last few elections. The Jacobite Church forms a decisive vote bank in the constituency. The dispute between the Orthodox (Chandy belongs to this denomination) and the Jacobite and the support of the Jacobite to the LDF had resulted in the drastic reduction of the winning margin of Chandy in the last elections. Even when the solar scam allegations were at its peak in 2016, Chandy enjoyed the support of Puthuppally voters and won with a comfortable margin. However, things have started taking a dip for Chandy since the 2021 elections with the resistance from the Jacobite group. Meanwhile, the leaders of Jacobite Church expressed their protest at being ignored for the posts of the presidents of the Congress party in any of the 14 districts. However, they were not ready to talk openly about this as they said the Church is going through a crisis following the Supreme Court judgment on the dispute between the Jacobite and Orthodox church. “Philson was purposely removed after being considered till the last minute,” said a senior Church official, who did not want to reveal his identity. “The Congress party has intentionally rejected the members of the Church from the post. Among the 12 lakh faithfuls belonging to the Jacobite Church, around seven lakh have Congress leaning. Jacobite Church was a fixed deposit for the Congress party. The silence of the Congress party leaders during our crisis has invited the protest of our members and this has reflected in the recent elections,” he said. Meanwhile, majority of Congress workers in the constituency have dismissed the claims made by Chandy that no effective discussions were made with him regarding the selection of the DCC presidents. He had said that attempts were made to feel that such talks were held. He also said that he has informed the Congress high command about his objection to this. However, KPCC president K Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan refuted Chandy’s allegation and said that talks were held with him before finalizing the list. His son Chandy Oommen, who has high political ambitions, is expected to land with a key post in the KPCC soon. However, following the rejection of Mathews to the DCC post and the displeasure of the Jacobite Church, Chandy Oommen will have a task cut out for contesting and winning from Puthuppally in the future. Meanwhile, Mathews came up with an FB post on Sunday saying that he has no complaints in losing out the post and said that he will remain as a loyal Congress worker. He also said that he consider it as a great achievement to head the election campaign of Oommen Chandy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/chandy-gets-the-blame-for-dcc-fiasco/articleshow/85746681.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

Acting on specific intelligence, an NCB team arrested three peddlers — D Shinde, MR Kamble and N Joganand, natives of Latur district in Maharrashtra. The offenders were caught at a toll plaza on the Outer Ring Road in the outskirts of the city on Saturday night while they were transporting 3,400 kilos of ganja from Andhra Odisha Border area of Andhra Pradesh to Maharashtra. “The ganja was packed in 141 gunny bags and covered under a tarpaulin. Saplings of various plants were placed above the tarpaulin,” an NCB official said. The seized consignment was procured as per orders of an absconding accused operating from Maharashtra. “The absconding kingpin has been operating multiple teams of peddlers to supply ganja in Pune, Mumbai, Thane and other areas. The gang members further distribute the ganja to students, party-goers through their elaborate ground network,” an NCB investigator said. In 2020, NCB Bangalore Zonal Unit, which covers the two Telugu states and Karnataka, had seized 1,971 kilos of ganja and arrested eight peddlers. So far, in 2021, NCB seized 7,500 kilos of ganja and arrested 25 peddlers. “The high quantity of seizures this year indicate that the peddling gangs became desperate due to the increased demand and taking risk by transporting maximum quantity of contraband at a single go to maximise profits. We have stepped up surveillance on the organised gangs to curb their activities,” an NCB official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ncb-sleuths-bust-ganja-racket-seize-3400-kg-of-contraband/articleshow/85752595.cms||---

---||Varanasi||Man returns from Afghanistan, Taliban terror still haunts him||It’s been five days since Rajesh Pandey returned safely from Afghanistan and is with his family now at Jaanpur Mudiyari village of Bansdih, Ballia, but the dreadful memories of the bedlam in Kabul, bombings and sudden bursts of firing after Taliban took over still continue to haunt him. “On many occasions, I had lost all hopes of being able to return home and meet my family again. But, thanks to the Government of India, I could reach my home safely,” said Rajesh, mentioning how the memories of the turmoil in Kabul still haunt him. Rajesh worked in an iron grille manufacturing company only seven km away from Kabul. He went to Kabul on February 22 this year to work and returned on August 23, but the fear of Taliban is still evident on his face. Recalling the dreadful last few days in Kabul before he was evacuated by the government, Rajesh is now just not willing to go back to Afghanistan again. Recalling his stay in Kabul after Taliban took over, Rajesh said, “There was a state of anarchy. I had to struggle for over 10 hours to cover eight km to reach the airport. It was scary with bombings and firings all around.” “I was moving in a group of Indians headed back home. We were only a hundred metres away from the airport when Taliban abducted around 150 Indian nationals and took them to a secluded place on August 21,” Rajesh said. “The more difficult time was to wait for getting my passport checked. The process took over five hours as everyone’s passport was being checked at a single point. At that time, I felt I would not be able to return home alive. We heaved a sigh of relief when our passport was checked and we entered the Kabul airport,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/man-returns-from-afghanistan-taliban-terror-still-haunts-him/articleshow/85751286.cms||---

The woman reportedly wanted to eliminate her husband as she was not interested in continuing their relationship. Shabad police said Manikya Rao, 35, and his wife Shobha Rani were at loggerheads for the last two years as they could not get along well. Nearly six months ago, she left her husband and returned to her parents’ house. In the meantime, she allegedly started an affair with one Yadaiah. Recently, elders of both families called Manikya Rao and his wife for a settlement. They convinced them to stay together, police said. Though she agreed for the compromise in front of everyone, she was actually not interested in the relationship. A few days later, she hatched a plan to kill her husband and discussed it with Yadaiah. On August 13, after consultation for her health issues at a local hospital, the couple was returning back to their house by walk. On the information given by Shobha, Yadaiah arrived and strangulated the victim to death. Later, his dead body was thrown into the bushes. The next day Yadaiah, with the help of his friends, brought a car and shifted the body into the vehicle. From there, they drove the car to Srisailam, where the body was dumped into a gorge from a hill. On August 24, the victim’s father lodged a missing complainant, stating that Manikya Rao was not seen since August 13.

Drawing a parallel, they recollected how they fled to India with whatever they could gather, fearing for their lives. Cynthia Pereira, a class V student then, was caught unawares of the situation and chaos outside her house, and had to pack all her belongings to leave Kuwait in August 1990. “It was summer holidays. My uncle, who was in a state of panic, came home and asked me to switch on the TV. The news was all about Iraqi president Saddam Hussein invading the country. There was chaos, rocket blasts and sirens blaring near our place. After a few days, when my family realized that it’s hard to stay back, we decided to leave for India,” recalls Cynthia, who hails from Miyar in Karkala. “My family sold all their belongings at dirt cheap prices and left for India. There was not much money with my parents and others. It was a week-long journey in a bus. On the way, the Red Cross Society and other organisations provided us food and shelter. We slept in tents and queued up for food,” says Cynthia. She again landed back in Kuwait in 2004, after her graduation, and currently works as a training administrator. Emilda Lobo, a resident of Jeppu, who went to Kuwait to make a living nine months before the crisis, had to return along with her employer. “I again returned and worked nearly for four years,” said Emilda. For Stephen B Machado, a resident of Karkala, a bank employee, who had just celebrated his daughter’s first birthday, he was in his car and going to work as usual, when the invasion took place. He landed in Kuwait after his graduation in 1981, and worked there for nearly 37 years as a banker, and is now settled in Bengaluru. Stephen says, “The journey started on August 28 to Baghdad in a car, with my wife and daughter. After reaching Baghdad, we had to travel to Jordan. It was 10 days of a life-changing journey with little savings in hand. We were finally evacuated to Mumbai on September 7,” says Stephen, who returned to Kuwait in April 1991, after the crisis was over.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/afghan-crisis-brings-back-memories-of-kuwait-invasion/articleshow/85746721.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Delhi||NGT issues notices over green nod to highrise in Delhi University area||NEW DELHI: National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued notices to the Centre and a private builder, seeking their response on a plea that challenges granting of an environmental clearance (EC) for a 38-floor group-housing project being built in the Delhi University area, near Vishwavidyalaya Metro station. The plea states that the project could seriously jeopardise the environment in the area, which includes the air quality, traffic management, water availability and waste disposal. A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel issued notices to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Young Builders Private Limited and other parties, seeking their responses within a month. “Since this tribunal has to conduct a merit review of the decision of granting EC, it is necessary to put the affected parties to notice and call for the record,” the bench said. The private builder of the housing society adjacent to Delhi University campus had earlier told the green bench that they will apply for a fresh environmental clearance for the project, adding that the EC they had obtained earlier would not be acted on. DU has also challenged the grant of EC in the past, stating that it was a violation of the Delhi Master Plan 2021 and will be destructive to the area. The group-housing project will have a built-up area of 1,37,879.64 sqm and involves construction of over 38 floors and 446 flats in the vicinity of the university. Last year in December, an NGT-appointed independent committee had given the green signal for the housing project, stating that while it does lead to a significant increase in the population density of the ward it falls in, it is not likely to impact the groundwater table or cause significant impact in terms of air pollution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ngt-issues-notices-over-green-nod-to-highrise-in-delhi-university-area/articleshow/85749248.cms||---
---||Madurai||Mother, paramour held for abandoning 2-yr-old at bus stand||Madurai: A 22-year-old woman was arrested along with her paramour by Dindigul police on Sunday for abandoning her two-year-old daughter at the Palani bus stand. According to police, CCTV footages played a big role in laying bare their crime. Palani all woman police said they were informed about a girl stranded at the bus stand close to midnight on August 24. The police led by inspector P Kavitha admitted her at a home for children in Dindigul. Assuming that the child could have strayed away from her parents, the police began efforts to trace her whereabouts. CCTV footage at the bus stand showed an unidentified man and a woman getting down from a bus from Rajapalayam, abandoning her there and returning on the same bus. The police managed to trace the bus in which they travelled. Inquiry with the bus conductor revealed that the duo got down at Thirumangalam bus stop in Madurai in the early hours of August 25. CCTV at Thirumangalam showed that the duo went to a lodge there, where they spent a day before going to his house in Periya Alangulam. On Sunday, the two were in disbelief when the police reached their doorstep at Periya Alangulam. Inspector Kavitha said they got their address and contact details at the lodge. The duo confessed to the crime as they considered the child a hindrance to their affair as the girl was born from her first marriage. Anandhakumari was married to Mohan Kumar of Tirupur in 2019 and bore the child. The couple got separated and she lived with her sister in Pollachi, Coimbatore. She developed a relationship with Maruthu who worked as a mason there and moved in with him. The duo was booked under the Juvenile Justice Act. The mother was booked under section 75 for abandoning her child and exposing her to harm, while the man was booked under section 87 for abetting the crime. They were arrested and sent to judicial custody. The inspector said that the child was troubled for one day after her recovery and is now active. But for the words amma (mother) and mama (uncle) she does not speak anything else.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/mother-paramour-held-for-abandoning-2-yr-old-at-bus-stand/articleshow/85751305.cms||---

Pune Municipal Corporation officials said they were not expecting any administrative delays as possession of required land and necessary permissions have been obtained from the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). “We were hoping to complete the project in the next two months, but pandemic-related restrictions led to a delay as the availability of material and gas was disrupted,” said civic administration official. The official further said that work on the crucial flyover has been fast-tracked. “More than 80% of the work on approach roads has been completed. The existing bridge is being dismantled and it will be a replaced by a new one with additional lanes for heavy traffic,” said the official. Residents in the area had given authorities some suggestions to incorporate in the project, such as a separate lane and U-turn for the vehicles of local residents, a facility for pedestrians to cross the road, ducts to lay water pipelines, and storm water channels to arrest the flow on the roads. Ganesh Kalamkar, a local activist, said, citizens are monitoring the progress of the flyover project and have told officials to ensure that the issues raised by commuters are addressed. The new flyover will provide a direct link to Sus, which has now been included under the PMC limits, and entry-exit for vehicles to the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. Two parallel flyovers are coming up at the junction where the Sus-Pashan Link Road crosses the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. Each flyover will be around 452m long and 9m wide. There will be two ramps on both sides of the bypass along with service roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-aims-for-march-22-speeds-up-pashan-sus-flyover-work/articleshow/85749155.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Kochi||ECI permits CEO Kaul to hold post in state cadre||Thiruvananthapuram: Heeding to the request of the state government to continue utilizing the services of chief electoral officer (CEO) Sanjay Kaul in the state, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has given approval for the officer to continue in state cadre as well while continuing as the CEO. It is reliably learnt that the commission has given the permission for the state government as there are no major elections expected immediately as the next major election is scheduled for 2024 only. The officer will continue to hold the charges of secretary (finance expenditure) as well as the chairman and managing director of Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC). After Teeka Ram Meena who was the predecessor of Kaul in the election commission was repatriated to the state cadre, the state government had forwarded the names of Kaul and Rajesh Kumar Sinha to the election commission. The ECI, considering the experience of Kaul in the commission as additional CEO during the last assembly election, had chosen him as the new CEO. In his appointment order, the ECI had also said that while functioning as CEO Kerala, he shall not hold any additional charge whatsoever under the state government except that he should be designated as the secretary to the election department of the state. This is usually done so as to ensure budgetary support from the state government. However, the state government had made an exceptional move to request the ECI to permit the officer to continue in the state cadre as well in the wake of an extreme shortage of senior officers in the ranks of secretaries and principal secretaries. The state is running short of officers, especially in the rank of secretary. The IAS officers from the batch 1997 to 2003 are presently in the secretary grade, in which there are only 10 officers now. While there are only 10 secretary-ranking officers, there are only 12 officers in the ranks of principal secretary, who together are holding charges of portfolios that are more than thrice their total number. On an average, every officer in the rank of principal secretary or secretary grade is holding two to three additional charges in the state. Meanwhile, officers continue to leave the cadre, the latest case being that of G R Gokul, a 2011-batch officer who was holding the charge of secretary (finance resources). Gokul has been relieved from the cadre to pursue higher studies for a period of three years. Two other officers, K Vasuki (2008 batch) and S Karthikeyan (2011 batch) are also learnt to be leaving on deputation. Another officer, Haaris Rasheed has also left the state permanently by changing his cadre to another state, it is learnt.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/eci-permits-ceo-kaul-to-hold-post-in-state-cadre/articleshow/85746769.cms||KP Saikiran

He told reporters after inspecting the spot on Sunday that only two labourers were carrying out the work and no engineers were present to supervise it when the accident occurred. Meanwhile, based on a complaint lodged by NHAI team leader A Anilkumar, Tallakulam police registered a case against the project in-charge of JMC Projects, Pradeepkumar Jain, project engineer Santiyenthar Varma, in-charge of hydraulic machines contractor Shellmech, Baskaran and other unnamed people who are in-charge of the project. They were booked under sections 304(A) (causing death by negligence) and 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery) of the IPC. Minister Velu said the state government has constituted an expert team from National Institute of Technology at Trichy headed by professor Baskar to study the incident and the safety aspects of the flyover project. He also urged the NHAI authorities to take appropriate action based on the report submitted by the experts. The minister said that such flyover works are done using modern technologies wherein the pillar alone would be erected at the construction site while precast concrete girders are made and erected atop the pillars using a hydraulic jack. A jack with a capacity of 150 tonnes was used here whereas the portion that crash-landed weighed about 120 tonnes. On the technical snag in the jack that caused the mishap, he said the oil thread connecting it could have been cut off “due to the jack’s inability to withstand the pressure of the girder. Or the oil thread which was used could have cracked as it may have been used several times and got blunted.” He said that such safety aspects could be ensured only by people at the level of engineers as labourers would have not known these details. The contractor of the project has entered into an agreement with a Jaipur-based company to look into the safety aspects. The representatives of the company were also not present at the site. “The accident could have been averted had the engineers been present at the spot,” he said. Though NHAI projects are executed by the Union government, the state government will work with the Centre in ensuring safety of the people, he added. The 7.5-km-long flyover project undertaken by NHAI at a cost of Rs 545 crore began in November 2018 and was to be completed in 24 months. So far construction of 5.9 kms has been completed and the deadline was revised to April 2022. Finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, commercial taxes and registration minister P Moorthy and district collector S Aneesh Sekhar also inspected the accident scene and supervised the removal of debris.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/contractors-negligence-caused-accident-min/articleshow/85751334.cms||---

The party, which is in power in Delhi, will hold similar 'Tiranga Yatra' in Lucknow, Noida and in Ayodhya, where its march is likely to take a halt at the under-construction Ram temple. Hard selling its Delhi model of free power, quality health and education to people of the UP, the party expects a good showing in the upcoming polls in the country’s largest state. Criticizing the UP government, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “The Yogi government is only present on advertisements. Children here are not getting good education and health facilities. Law and order is in the shambles, no one in the state is safe” He claimed, “If voted to power, I guarantee quality education, health facilities and employment to people of UP irrespective of their caste and religion.” Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, who led the yatra, said it has been organised to show people the difference between AAP and BJP’s brand of nationalism. “BJP’s nationalism is providing chapati and salt in mid-day meals. In its regime, bodies float in rivers during pandemic due to absence of treatment. In contrast, AAP’s nationalism is to provide 300 units free electricity, focus on quality education, opening of mohalla clinics for people to provide better health facilities,” Singh said. At least 4,000 people holding the Indian flag participated in the yatra which started from GIC ground and ended at Shahid Smarak in the city. After Noida, Lucknow and Ayodhya, the party will take out such marches in all the 403 assembly constituencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/aap-starts-tiranga-yatra-in-up-with-it-its-campaign-for-upcoming-assembly-polls/articleshow/85746779.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The victim, Rajesh Gaikwad of Pimprigaon, was standing near the wall while overseeing work on the drainage line and paving blocks carried out by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. The Pimpri police have registered a case under Section 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code against the builder and contractor. Ranjeet Gaikwad, the victim’s younger brother, said, “We live near the housing society in Pimprigaon. The PCMC has started the work in the lane that is adjacent to the compound wall of the society. The wall is almost 20ft and its height is about 10ft.” He said that on Friday, around 2pm, his brother had gone to see the ongoing work in the lane with a neighbour. “While they were returning home, the compound wall collapsed suddenly. Our neighbour escaped unhurt but my brother got stuck under the debris,” he added. He said, “All of us tried to rescue my brother. We had to break the wall on the opposite side of the lane to get my brother out. We rushed him to a hospital, but he was pronounced dead by the doctors.” Ranjeet said, “The accident happened due to the negligence of the PCMC contractor and the builder of the society. I have filed a complaint against them.” Assistant inspector SS Kadam of the Pimpri police station said that the width of the lane, where the accident happened, is hardly four feet. “We suspect that after the wall collapsed, Gaikwad may have been stuck between the debris and the wall on the opposite side of the lane. We have registered a case. We are yet to make any arrests,” Kadam said. Two years ago, in June, as many as fifteen persons, including four children and two women, were killed and three were seriously injured when a section of a compound wall of an apartment complex crashed on the labourers’ makeshift hutments located closeby. The complex was located in Bada Talab Masjid area in Kondhwa. The incident occurred between 1.30 am and 2 am. The labourers were on construction work right next to the apartment complex. All the deceased hailed from Katihar district of Bihar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/man-crushed-to-death-in-compound-wall-collapse/articleshow/85749178.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||50% senior citizens fully immunized in Pune Metropolitan Region: Report||PUNE: As much as 50% of the senior population aged 60 years and above has received both shots of the Covid vaccine in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) so far, the latest district administration report has revealed. However, only 4% beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group have received both shots. Earlier inclusion of senior citizens in priority groups along with healthcare and frontline workers has helped push the vaccination numbers. Considering the high level of mobility among those in the 18-44 age group, it is essential to vaccinate them along with the rest of the population at the earliest, experts have said. The total population in PMR is 1.17 crore. Of this, 85.39 lakh residents aged above 18 years are eligible to get the Covid vaccine. In this group, 63% of the population has received the first dose of the vaccine. However, only 23% of the population in this age group from the region has received both doses of the vaccine . “Going by the robust numbers of fully immunized senior citizens, we will have to change the definition of the vulnerable population in PMR. Those below 60 years of age, who have not even received the first dose, should be considered vulnerable groups now,” said Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services. Health officials have prioritized vaccination of the population awaiting the second dose. “About 70% doses are meant for vaccination for those due for the second dose while the remaining 30% allocation is for first dose recipients. Having said that, it is also true that we cannot deny vaccination to anyone visiting the centers,” Deshmukh said. Late inclusion, poor vaccine allocation (especially in May), long gaps between the two doses are primary reasons for the number of fully vaccinated 18-44-year-olds is low. Besides, many beneficiaries in this age group are still hesitant to get paid jabs from private vaccination sites. Although, experts have said that those who can afford paid shots must get their second doses at the earliest. A sizable number of vaccine doses are currently lying unused with private hospitals as the demand for paid jabs has plummeted. “As the virus continues to spread and mutate, large unvaccinated populations may serve as incubators to newer variants,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India. On March 1, India commenced the second phase of its vaccination strategy by starting inoculation of those aged over 60 years or for people aged 45 and above with co-morbid conditions. The government introduced liberalized and accelerated phase 3 strategy of Covid-19 vaccination from May 1. The move made everyone above the age of 18 eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine. “As we have the indication of high seropositivity (80% in Pimpri Chinchwad area according to the last serosurvey), even 63% of PMR’s one dose vaccinated population should suffice to avert the third wave,” said senior clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee. Banerjee has conducted extensive seroprevalence studies in PMR ever since the first wave of the pandemic. Experts, however, have underlined the importance of fully vaccinating 60% of the region’s population to achieve the herd immunity stage. “The World Health Organisation (WHO) supports achieving ‘herd immunity’ through vaccination. This is because the immunity acquired through natural Covid infection may taper down faster than vaccine-induced immunity,” Deshmukh said. Prioritizing vaccination of those who have not suffered the Covid infection previously will enable achievement of herd immunity faster in view of the shortages of vaccine doses, experts said. “We are facing a crisis of vaccine supply. Natural infection gives robust immunity, whatever some experts (without evidence) may say. Excluding those who have antibodies to Covid-19 or have had a positive RT-PCR test in the past, from the first round of vaccination will save a lot of resources and enable vaccination of the vulnerable,” Banerjee said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/50-senior-citizens-fully-immunized-in-pmr-report/articleshow/85749242.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The Union government which instructed Maharashtra to take measures ahead of the festival season is not practising what it was preaching, Pawar said. “The state will do its duty. But four Union ministers will conduct rallies and people are bound to gather for these events,” he said. Calls by BJP leaders to hold Dahi Handi programmes was wrong, he added. On Union minister Narayan Rane’s “Pawar hardly understands anything” jibe, the deputy chief minister said he did not want to reply to “personal comments”. Rane has been conducting rallies in Konkan region. He said he would not believe social media reports on a CBI clean chit to former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. Higher education minister Uday Samant who was in Pune on Sunday said that the Centre must take action against ministers like Rane for violating Covid-19 safety norms during his Jan Ashirwad Yatra in Konkan region. “As guardian minister of Sindhudurg district, I spoke to the police who said that action was taken against people shouting slogans and crowding in the area. The chief minister had instructed that the yatra should not lead to crowding and Covid-19 safety norms must be followed, but some people don’t listen,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/jan-ashirwad-yatra-may-spread-virus-says-dy-cm/articleshow/85749254.cms||---

Also, the inclusion of the airport among the airports identified for monetisation is likely to intensify opposition from the public against land acquisition as it would be viewed as a move to help the private players. In a reply to a question by Kozhikode MP, M K Raghavan in Lok Sabha last month, the minister of state for civil aviation had said that Airport Authority of India has projected a revised land requirement of around 152 acres for ‘the development/construction of terminal building, apron, car parking and associated infrastructure’. According to sources, the new proposal submitted by the civil aviation department has proposed acquisition of 137 acres for new terminal, apron and cargo complex and 15.5 acres for car parking. Raghavan had submitted a an alternative master plan for land acquisition earlier this year which had proposed acquisition of 94.6 acres for airport development, including runway expansion. As per the plan, the runway length was to be increased from the existing 2,700m to 3,400m by using 19 acres already in the possession of AAI along with 41 acres to be acquired for the purpose. Raghavan said that any proposal for land acquisition should first address the issue of runway expansion as it is crucial for future development of the airport. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan will convene a meeting to discuss the land acquisition for airport development next week. Though the state government had set up a special revenue office comprising a deputy collector and 12 staff, including a tahsildar and surveyors in 2011, not a single inch of land has been acquired so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/revised-land-takeover-proposal-raises-concerns/articleshow/85746839.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The boating service was inaugurated by finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan in the presence of Madurai district collector S Aneesh Sekhar. The minister along with the collector took a boat ride. Speaking to the media, the minister said that efforts are being made to develop Teppakulam for tourism. “Previously, the tank was being used by youths as a playground since there was no water. But the Madurai Corporation has ensured that it is filled with water without disruption. There is a lot of scope for development here and I believe more can be done,” he said. The boating facility was inaugurated in December, 2020. The Hindu religious and charitable endowment department, which is in charge of Teppakulam, is managing the facility. Though the boating facility is not available on Sunday, officials said that they are expecting good patronage as it was a hit among residents before the lockdown that came to effect in April. Boating facility will be open to the public from 9am to 6pm. The ticket price is fixed at Rs 20 per person and all those aged above five years of age can avail of the service. N Sharmila Devi, a resident of Kamarajar Salai, said that the resumption of the boating will be sought-after by children and adults alike. “I went with my family in March and it was a pleasurable experience.

Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh said the government is ready to rehabilitate the residents whose houses were inundated by floodwaters at Budameru. People residing at Ajith Singhnagar, Bhavanipuram, Devinagar, and Madhuranagar areas used to face problems with flash floods at Budameru rivulet till 2008. The water level at Budameru reduced after the bunds were strengthened and the Budameru diversion channel was constructed at Kondapalli. With incessant rains at the catchment area, Budameru rivulet witnessed floods and a total of 117 houses near the bund got inundated by floodwaters. Locals feared flooding in colonies. Irrigation authorities and VMC responded quickly and assured that the affected families would be rehabilitated. The Vijayawada central legislator Malladi Vishnuvardhan (Vishnu) said Budameru strengthening works will be given top priority and necessary measures will be taken to prevent floods. Meanwhile, irrigation authorities have noticed illegal constructions on the banks of Budameru. Officials had recently taken up a study and found that most of the rivulet is encroached on at Ramakrishnapuram and Ayodhyanagar areas.

There are four dengue virus serotypes – DenV-1, DenV-2, DenV-3 and DenV-4. The NIV had analysed 4,963 samples to reveal dominant dengue viral serotype for each of the states. The study also revealed Gujarat also had the second highest infection instances of multiple dengue virus serotype infection in a single individual in 29% of the total samples tested. The study was published in the August 21 in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. “We have seen that DenV-2 and Den V-3 are serotypes that generally prove to be troublesome if neglected. Most of the times complications are seen in DenV-2 infections especially if the persons immunity is low,” says a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation(AMC) health official. The NIV study noted that DENV-2 was the most prevalent serotype in the states of Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. “Close to 56% of the samples tested from Gujarat showed prevalence of the DenV 2 virus,” claimed the study. DENV-3 was dominant in Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh. Dominance of DENV-4 was observed in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The study also revealed that both DenV-1 and DenV-2 were co-dominant in Punjab while DenV-1 and DenV-3 were co-dominant in Maharashtra. “Multiple serotype infections were more prominent in the samples tested from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal,” added the study. In the observational note the NIV study claimed that DenV-1 was dominant in Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, and Nagaland, while in Gujarat there were only 9% cases that reported of the serotype infection. Officials add that the survey had begun in 2018 and that 118 medical college level laboratories, 86 state level and 22 regional level laboratories were involved in the sample collection. “The study is vital ahead of development of vaccine for dengue. The study had taken a break owing to Covid,” says a senior AMC official aware of NIV’s dengue study.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/den-v2-dengue-dominant-in-state/articleshow/85751446.cms||---

The girl’s uncle has filed a complaint against the four under provisions of POCSO on August 26. The incident had taken place on June 28, said investigators. According to Abhayam 181 helpline, the girl called up the helpline after reading about similar cases reported from the district. She told the counsellor that she had to muster courage to come out as she was not sure whether the perpetrators would be punished. “According to her narrative, she had enrolled for pre-school coaching classes at an international school in the town for Class XI (science). On the said day, the mathematics teacher was in the class, and four boys and the girl. The teacher allegedly used her dupatta to cover her mouth while a fellow student tore her dress’ collar. Another student shot the video of the incident,” said an Abhayam counsellor. Shocked, the girl could not say anything at that moment and tried to forget about it, but the teacher reportedly told her after a few days that they have her video and they can make it viral. The girl then left home and reached Ahmedabad. “The girl’s father had passed away a few years ago and her mother got married to another man. The girl and her younger sister live with their uncle. The uncle had also reported her disappearance to police after which she was tracked to Ahmedabad and brought back. Even then she did not mention the incident,” said the counsellor. The incident however did not end here, as she reportedly got missed calls from unidentified numbers. Seeing her in distress, her aunt took her in confidence when she broke down and narrated the incident. Afterwards, with help of the helpline officials, her uncle lodged an FIR. Bhabhar police station officials said that D D Gohil, DSP (SC/ST cell), is further probing the case. “The questioning of the accused would take place soon. We have not found CCTV footage of that day from the school. As the girl belongs to scheduled caste, the atrocities act sections have also been added,” said an investigator.

---||Agra||Dosa-sellers harassed over Hindu name, stall vandalised; 1 held||Agra: Two Muslim brothers, who run a roadside food stall in Mathura — named Srinath Dosa Corner — were allegedly harassed and their eatery vandalised by members of a local right-wing outfit who objected to its Hindu name. The incident has forced the duo to rename the eatery ‘American Dosa Corner’. On Saturday, one person was arrested in connection with the incident, said superintendent of police (city) M P Singh. The accused was identified as Srikant Sharma, a member of International Hindu Parishad, a hitherto unknown organisation. “The matter is being investigated and strict action will be taken against the accused,” the SP said. Mathura police has registered an FIR against unidentified people under section 506 (criminal intimidation) and 427 (mischief) of the IPC at Kotwali police station. The brothers, Irfan and Aabid (who have only been identified with their first names), said they have been running the stall for the past five years under the same name without incident. “We recently sold it off to a person called Rahul Thakur, but we manage it,” said Aabid, adding that the stall’s name has now been changed to ‘American Dosa Corner’. The incident took place on August 18 and soon after, a video of it went viral on social media. In the two-minute video, a person can be seen asking Aabid, who was attending to customers at the time, why his stall carried a Hindu name. The man can be heard threatening, “Remove the name now. Hindus will not eat at the stall if they know your true identity.” The banner of the stall was also torn away later. City president of International Hindu Parishad, Dev Sharma, said the organisation objected to the stall as “sentiments of Hindus were hurt by misuse of Lord Krishna’s name, Srinath.” “They (Muslims) should not be using a Hindu name to earn money. Mathura is a religious town and such things can hurt sentiments of the community.” Last week, a bangle seller from UP, Tasleem Ali, was beaten up in Indore for using a “fake name” to sell his goods in a Hindu-dominated area. He was also slapped with the Pocso Act for allegedly making advances on a 13-year-old girl and arrested by police.

The jewellers say the ministry has agreed to remove tracking mechanism from hallmarking. Although, there has been no official notification so far. After HUID was brought in recently, jewellers had gone on one-day strike against it last week and also threatened to intensify the agitation if their demand was not met. A meeting was held between the trade leaders and Union minister for consumer affairs Piyush Goyal on Saturday. “The ministry has agreed to do away with the tracking mechanism in HUID,” said Nitin Khandelwal, a member of government-appointment expert committee on HUID. He was also part of the negotiations with the ministry. After the meeting, Gems and Jewellery Council (GJC), a trade association, also released a note spelling out the points discussed and agreed upon. One of the points reads, “The transfer of data on jewellers account on Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) portal will be deactivated soon.” Khandelwal said this means that the data uploaded on the BIS portal at the time of hallmarking will not be transferable anywhere else. “HUID calls for giving a unique number to each gold ornament, based on which, the entire transaction can be tracked. The number generated at the time of hallmarking can trace the ornament till the customer’s end. Details of the buyer are also available,” said Khandelwal. He said the jewellers have been able to convince the ministry that tracking would lead to unnecessary policing. Even buyers would not like to have their details mentioned on the portal. It has been assured that the feature would be removed, claimed Khandelwal. Sources said the jewellers were also concerned that tracking could have given a chance to tax agencies for raising queries leading to inspector raj. “Sometimes, there is a mismatch due to genuine business reasons. For example, a customer eventually alters the design which reduces the weight. Under the HUID system, even the taxmen could have raised a question about the difference in weight and sought details about where the remaining gold was sold,” said sources. Hallmarking is a system of certifying that a particular gold ornament has the same weight and purity as claimed by the jeweller. Prior to HUID, gold in terms of weight could be hallmarked in batches. Under HUID, every individual ornament has to be hallmarked with a unique ID generated for it. Rajesh Rokde from Nagpur Sarafa Association said, “The association members would continue to press the demands for further easing the law. Provisions of imprisonment and cancellation of licence should also be removed.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/convinced-ministry-to-remove-tracking-from-huid-jewellers/articleshow/85746848.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Pune||Third wave likely to be less severe, says ICMR||PUNE: With recent projections that the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic could hit anytime between September and October, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) projects that it could be less severe than the recent second wave. Dr Samiran Panda, head of ICMR’s Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases (ECD) division, said that nobody can predict the third wave for the whole country. “It will now make sense only if district or state-specific data are used for specific projections. The wave may rear its head only if states remove restrictions prematurely and there is a new transmission-efficient variant that could in turn cause a huge increase in caseload, or there is clear violation of Covid protocols at the population level,” Dr Panda said. He further said the factors important for a wave are decline in natural or vaccine-induced immunity, emergence of a new, more virulent variant such as Delta, relaxations without Covid-appropriate behaviour or inadequate vaccine coverage. “Districts where the spread was low during the second wave might register an increase of cases this time, whereas districts that reported high infection rate may not witness high cases,” he said. He further said this theory was backed by the ICMR and Imperial College of London’s CHROMIC model. “Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh should ideally see a dip in cases, or at least not be hit as badly,” he said. He strongly urged states against allowing mass gatherings. “Intensified vaccination and following Covid protocols is the only way ahead,” he said. “We have already reiterated that vaccines will not prevent infection, only mitigate the severity. Vaccination also prevents death. This in turn will help reduce the burden on the healthcare system,” he said The reason that the third wave will be less severe is because of immunity acquired from natural infections and/or post-vaccination, which will ensure that the number of symptomatic cases will be fewer, he said. In the wake of the Kumbh testing scam, Panda said states must monitor laboratories carrying out the tests. “If they report to us with adequate proof to remove a facility from the list of approved laboratories, we will act accordingly,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/third-wave-likely-to-be-less-severe-says-icmr/articleshow/85749273.cms||Nisha Nambiar

They are developing an addiction.  Lack of physical activity is leading to obesity and mental health issues,” said K Saravanan, a primary school headmaster and zonal president, Child-Friendly Schools (CSF). The headmaster said that their school teachers, who have been teaching students at their localities, are making efforts to let children play traditional outdoor activities like running and playing kho-kho etc. Many private schools are trying to include online physical education classes for around 30 minutes and are having children do exercises or yoga at home. “But, children are not able to play outdoors freely. At least in school grounds, children hang around and play after school hours. Also, for the sake of winning school sports events, children are keen to play and compete. But, generally as schools prioritise academics over sports, with students not even playing the little they did in school, they may lose their interest further,” said the principal of a private school. Physical educators said that development of crucial social skills and team spirit in children are also affected. “My son was keen to take part in some athletic events in his school. But, after the Covid-19 pandemic, he couldn’t practice. He will now go to Class X next year and he has to focus on board exams,” said N Gayathri, a parent of a Class IX student from a private school. For the past academic year, school students have also been unable to take part and compete in sports competitions at zonal, district, and state level. “Students and teachers very much want to just get back to the grounds but unfortunately we have to wait. We are worried that we will miss out on young talents and it may take some time for children to be motivated to take up sports again. We hold several selection competitions to identify and groom talented athletes among school students, which we were unable to conduct for the past year,” said P Senkathir, district inspector of physical education, Madurai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/lack-of-physical-activity-among-school-students-a-big-worry-for-parents-teachers/articleshow/85751403.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The NSS camps in question were held in 2016 and 2017 and the accused had allegedly also shown a dummy principal. Acting on the complaint by a treasurer of the trust that runs the college, the Begampura police have booked an offence against five people, including a former trustee of the institution and the then bank manager of a cooperative bank who was acting hand-in-glove with the accused. Assistant police inspector Shaikh Ahmed, who is the investigation officer in the case, on Sunday, said a letter has been issued to Bamu and the cooperative bank concerned for sharing more details as a part of the inquiry. “Acting on the directives of the judiciary, we have registered an offence in connection with the usurping NSS funds among other charges. The role of all the stakeholders will be questioned during the inquiry,” he said. While the amount of funds allegedly drawn by the college could not be ascertained by the police, institutions receive Rs 220 per head and Rs 440 per head towards regular and session activities under NSS, respectively. Run by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, NSS has an active network in colleges across the country. Bamu’s NSS in-charge Tryambak Patil said he would need to get more details on the whole matter before commenting on it. To a query on whether the university failed to carry out proper scrutiny of proposals seeking the release of NSS funds, Bamu Vice-Chancellor Pramod Yeole said necessary fact-finding would be carried out to know whether funds were released even if camps were not held. “I don’t have information on the matter off-hand as it dates back to the tenure of my predecessor,” he said. Police have registered an offence under sections 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 463 (forgery), 464 (making a false document) and 120 B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code among other charges against the accused.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/college-allegedly-showed-bogus-camps-for-nss-funds/articleshow/85744857.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat swirls to Bhavina Patel’s divya success||AHMEDABAD: Sunday rose early for Sundhiya village in Mehsana as a giant screen was set up right outside the residence of Hasmukh Patel, father of Bhavina Patel. The crowd that gathered was unfazed when Patel went down in straight sets against her opponent – she had already made a history at Tokyo Paralympics by becoming the first medal winner in para table tennis for India. Hasmukh Patel, owning a small utensils shop in the village, was a proud father. Between the congratulatory calls, he told media that she is not divyang (differently-abled), but divya (divine). “We were glued to the screen not to miss the chance to see her play. We have planned a grand welcome for her. She told us that she has already started planning for the doubles event starting soon,” Patel told TOI. The village residents performed garba and smeared each other with colours in a celebration that continued till late afternoon. At the Blind People’s Association (BPA), Patel’s alma mater and training ground for a decade, the residents were getting update through internet. Officials told TOI that due to the pandemic and two-day holiday, there was no gathering, but there will be a grand welcome to the champion once she’s back from Tokyo in September. A huge hoarding outside the institute cheered both Bhavina and Sonal, another TT player, for their games. Meanwhile, the state government announced Rs 3 crore cash reward for Patel under Divyang Khel Pratibha Protsahan Puraskar scheme. CM Vijay Rupani called up Patel, her husband and her parents in a video call and congratulated her on her achievement. Patel had also received a call from PM Narendra Modi after her win. Diagnosed with polio at a very early age, Patel took to table tennis as one of the cocurricular activities during her computer training at ITI at BPA. Her initial success in the game motivated her to take it up seriously even as she continued her studies and later her jobs. Experts said that she overcame all obstacles — physical and material — in her journey to success. Tejal Lakhia, principal of ITI at BPA and Patel’s mentor in formative years, said that Bhavina and Sonal are the trailblazers that paved the way for the other para-athletes at the campus and elsewhere. “Special table for TT was brought in for the two to practice. In the past 10 years, many have got inspired by their success,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarat-swirls-to-bhavinas-divya-success/articleshow/85751448.cms||---

Collector J Nivas directed the irrigation and R&B authorities to take necessary steps to start construction of seven bridges on Eluru canal, Ryves canal and Budameru rivulet within a fortnight. The YSRCP during its election campaign had promised to complete the Gunadala flyover works which were pending since 2009. They also promised to construct seven bridges to ease traffic at Madhuranagar, Devi Nagar, Ramakrishna Puram, Gaddevari Chelu, Nadala Madhyakatta, Karmel Nagar and other prime areas in Vijayawada central limits. Bridges at Alluri Seetharama Raju statue, adjacent to Singh Nagar flyover, are much needed as huge traffic jams are taking place in that area every day. The then Krishna district collector A Md Imtiaz had conducted a review in January and also laid the foundation stone but Covid-19 second wave halted the plan. Meanwhile, Left parties, TDP and Janasena alleged that YSRCP failed to keep its promise on construction of bridges and ignored the city development. Vijayawada central legislator Malladi Vishnuvardhan,in a recent review meeting with collector, had asked the officials to start construction work of bridges at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/construction-of-7-bridges-to-start-soon/articleshow/85749303.cms||Venu Lanka

Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) chairman Ganesh Shetgaonkar said on Sunday that the preparation of the report is in the final stage. The study is being conducted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. Due to health issues, the IIT director who was in charge of the study was unable to submit it, he said. IIT-Bombay had asked GSPCB for the continuous ambient air quality monitoring system (CAAQMS) and the national ambient air quality monitoring programme (NAMP) data of six locations from the port town to assess the air pollution at Vasco during the lockdown. The IIT had been tasked with conducting a source appropriation study following allegations of coal pollution in the town. The institute has completed data collection for the second phase of the study, and chemical analysis is in progress. The first phase report stated that coal is not the only mineral behind air pollution in the town. A senior GSPCB officer said that the interim report didn’t pinpoint the reason for pollution in Vasco, but the second phase study will give details about the source of pollution. The first phase began in April 2017 and was completed in May 2018. Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) will bear the cost of the entire study, which has been pegged at over Rs 94 lakh, a senior GSPCB officer had said. Identification of sampling locations, monitoring ambient air quality, and locating pollution sources are part of the study’s scope, and will be carried out as per guidelines of the central pollution control board. There have been allegations from the people of Vasco and NGOs that the port town is suffering because of coal handling at the port.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/report-on-source-of-vasco-pollution-after-chaturthi-gspcb/articleshow/85751532.cms||---

The accused took the ghastly action after being constantly provoked by his second wife, who wanted to get rid of the deceased. He killed his daughter after taking ideas from a Bollywood movie ‘Drishyam’ in order to create an alibi and mislead the police investigation. Khushi Shukla (13) was found murdered at her house in Katra area of Gursarai tehsil in Jhansi district on Wednesday. At the time of the incident, Khushi was alone at her house and her father Amit Shukla (50), a bidi trader, had gone to Mauranipur for some business work while her step-mother had gone to her maternal home in Kalpi. He told the police that after returning from Mauranipur, he found Khushi lying under the bed. He took her to the community health centre (CHC) where doctors declared her dead. Senior police officials while conducting the investigation suspected the involvement of some close family member in committing the murder of the teenaged girl. Disclosing the details, SSP Jhansi, Shivhari Meena said that as per the post-mortem report Khushi had been strangulated and her ribs were also found broken. When inquired from her neighbours, they told the police that Khushi had strained relations with her step-mother Akansha (42), who too had a daughter of similar age from her first husband, the SSP said. “Further investigations zeroed on her father Amit. On sustained interrogation, he broke down and admitted to have killed his own daughter because of the mounting pressure of his second wife who did not want to live with Khushi. Amit had planned the murder with his wife Akansha and sent her to Kalpi purposefully”, the SSP said. On Wednesday, Amit first thrashed Khushi, broke her ribs by sitting on her chest and then strangled her to death. Then he went to Mauranipur and met several people to create an alibi that he had been in Mauranipur the whole day. He told the police that after the death of his first wife from whom he had Khushi, he married a widow. “Both the accused Amit and his second wife Akansha have been arrested. We Have added section 120B in addition to section 302 of IPC”, the SSP added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/instigated-by-step-mother-father-turns-out-to-be-the-killer-of-his-minor-daughter/articleshow/85751441.cms||---

Funded by Shell Foundation, the independent charity arm of British-Dutch petroleum company, five boats are in various stages of development and the works are done by a startup named NavAlt Solar and Electric Boats. CEO of NavAlt, Sandith Thandasherry said there are over 2.5 lakh small fishing boats in India and 1.13 tonnes of CO2 are released/tonne of live weight of marine fish netted. Shell Foundation is supporting the project initially with Rs 1.5 crore, which includes the cost of developing the boats as well as financing the buyers to cover the extra cost compared to a traditional boat. NavAlt made headlines when it launched a solar water taxi and the country’s first solar ferry in Kerala. “As per estimates, a conventional small boat will consume 2,500 litres of fuel/year, which results in 5-6 tonnes of carbon emissions/year. Multiplied by 2.5 lakh boats in India, it gives the size of carbon emission, which is massive in terms of environmental impact,” he said. CEO of NavAlt, Sandith Thandasherry said there are over 2.5 lakh small fishing boats in India and 1.13 tonnes of CO2 are released/tonne of live weight of marine fish netted.Convincing fisher folk to switch to a new technology with which they are unfamiliar is a hurdle, he said. To understand the needs of the fishermen, Thandasherry went to Gujarat in 2013. “Right from there till West Bengal, traditional fishing boats are almost the same, with only minor design changes,” he said. There, he converted a conventional 32-ft wooden boat by retrofitting solar panels and motor. “Functionally it worked, but economically it struggled because the drag of the conventional boat was too high,” he added. Hence, NavAlt went on to design a lighter boat. “We had two designs – a single-hull one which could land on the beach and a double-hull one that could enter the sea from the lake where it is moored,” he said. On these boats, he fitted a modular energy box that could easily be unmounted and taken home to use as a power source. While a conventional boat costs around Rs 2.5 lakh, NavAlt is planning to sell their solar ones at Rs 10 lakh. “We told Shell Foundation that if they could help find the financing to pay the difference of 7.5 lakh, the fisherman could pay back the sum as EMI, instead of the fuel bills. So, from day one onwards, they will have a better livelihood,” Thandasherry said, adding that net income of a typical boat owner is low because of fuel bills that come to Rs 2.5 lakh a year. NavAlt also wanted funds from Shell Foundation to scale up the project so that the boat’s cost could be brought down to Rs 10 lakh, from the manufacturing cost of Rs 25 lakh. “We will reach the Rs 10-lakh price level by the 100th boat. Till then we will be losing money on each boat we sell. So, we needed a gap funding of Rs 3.5 crore from Shell Foundation, which is under discussion,” he said, adding that Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are interested in the project. Meanwhile, NavAlt is also engaged in the development of electric motors for boats. “They cost Rs 4 lakh each, which we are trying to bring down to Rs 1.5 lakh,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/state-to-get-indias-1st-solar-fishing-boats/articleshow/85746927.cms||Shenoy Karun

Of these, 25 cases were registered just last week. Doctors treating these patients said that most of them were being referred to hospitals in Pune from neighbouring districts. “Of the 25 cases recorded last week, 17 were from state-run Sassoon hospital. Hospitals in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and rural parts of the district reported four cases each during the same period,” stated the latest report of the district administration. Sassoon hospital’s doctors have confirmed that 95% of fresh cases being treated at the facility were referred from various adjoining districts — Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Ahmednagar, and even Beed and Osmanabad. “Only 5% of fresh CAM cases are from Pune now. A total of 95% are referred cases,” said ENT surgeon Samir Joshi. Joshi is the head of department and professor of ENT at Sassoon. In addition to the fresh cases, a sizable number of old patients are confronting disease recurrence days or months after recovery. A substantial number of these patients need repeat surgical clearance (debridement) even in areas like frontal sinuses, where recurrences should not occur. This indicates incomplete clearance of the damaged tissues during the first surgery, experts have said. “The recurrence is a rule rather than an exception in mucormycosis. Currently, the incidence of recovered patients requiring a revision operation is quite high,” Joshi said. Regular follow-up of the patient after surgical management is key. The rampant presence of diabetes among the affected individuals adds to the chances of recurrence. Zero recurrences for six months can be safely termed as full recovery from mucormycosis, experts have said. “The fresh cases of CAM have significantly gone down at private hospitals over the past two months,” said ENT surgeon Rajeev Yande.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmr-records-69-fresh-mucormycosis-cases-this-month/articleshow/85749346.cms||Umesh Isalkar

R Chandrasekaran, a pharmacy owner in Manapparai, said that in 1994 he lost his mentor and friend Lakshminarayanan, a medical practitioner known for treating the poor villagers for free. To continue his mentor’s service who used to organise free health camps in rural blocks, Chandrasekaran, under the banner of his mentor Dr VNL trust, has been organising eye screening camps in Manapparai and surrounding villages since 1996. Having covered around 700 hamlets, the pharmacy owner has helped people to undergo cataract surgery free of cost with the support of Aravind Eye Hospitals. He spends around Rs 25,000 to organise each camp, including food arrangements for doctors and medical staff arriving from Madurai as well as for the villagers. In the last 25 years, he has organised around 60 camps which has benefited 10,000 people in Manapparai. “We publicise the eye screening camps in villages through public announcement in areas where people have limited health awareness. To help such people have better eye vision and continue the service left by my mentor, I am still organising the eye camps,” Chandrasekaran said. Previously the camps were held only on May 25, commemorating the death anniversary of the doctor, however, owing to overwhelming public reception the trust has decided to make it a monthly drive. “Our hospital will bear the surgery, diagnosis, medicine and food, inpatient stay cost. The trust will help us identify the right set of people and sponsor the cost of screening camps organised in villages,” said S Kumar, camp organiser, Aravind Eye hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/pharmacist-helps-more-than-10k-get-their-vision-back/articleshow/85751502.cms||Deepak Karthik

The “intense” viral fever has swept parts of western Uttar Pradesh claiming 68 lives, including 40 children, over the past week. Most of them reported high fever, dehydration and a sudden drop in platelet count. Others had dengue symptoms and passed away during treatment. Now, with recovery time stretching to over 10 days, government hospitals are scrounging for beds and blood banks are stretched. A high number of cases have been reported from Agra, Mathura, Mainpuri, Etah and Kasganj districts, with Firozabad district said to be the worst affected. Health officials told TOI that a few viral fever cases have been reported from eastern UP as well. Situation is dire at the Firozabad medical college where 72 children out of 135 are battling for life. Over 50% of them have dengue symptoms, officials added. Vinod Kumar, an inconsolable father and resident of Firozabad's Sekhpur village, said, “My four-year-old daughter was suffering high viral fever for four days. We had admitted her to a private hospital as no vacant bed was available elsewhere. After low platelets and high fever, she died on Saturday.” With rural areas badly hit, some of these patients are being shifted to Agra and other cities. Teams from the health department are reaching out to villagers with medicines as well. But, there is no record of those dying in private hospitals and at home in rural areas. “The situation in the districts is alarming," Firozabad MLA Manish Asija said, adding that "waterlogging, lack of sanitation and hygiene are the reasons behind the disease spread." Chief medical officer (CMO) of Firozabad district, Dr Neeta Kulshrestha said, “Twelve children have died of the viral fever in the last 24 hours. The exact cause is being studied." The CMO added that all the patients at the government hospitals are tested for Covid-19 and so far none of the viral infection cases can be linked. While the chief medical superintendent (CMS) of Firozabad medical college, Dr Hansraj Singh, said that they are increasing the number of beds. "Viral fever patients are being admitted in Covid-19 wards. Doctors and paramedics are on alert,” the CMS added. "The intensity of the fever is worrying. Children are taking two weeks to recover." On Sunday, additional director of health department, AK Singh, said, “With high humidity, the temperature in Agra region is staying above normal, which is ideal for the spread of such vector-borne diseases. However, the cases of deaths are being investigated. In certain cases, patients had co-morbidities."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/another-12-all-kids-succumb-to-mystery-fever-in-west-up/articleshow/85746947.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Pune||Maharashtra: 3 techies, 2 murder suspects among 9 held in Rs 33 lakh robbery||PUNE: Three software engineers working with a prominent UPI app company, and two suspects wanted in a murder case at Mazalgaon in Beed district near Aurangabad, were among the nine people arrested by the Pune police in connection with Thursday afternoon’s robbery of cash and ornaments totally worth Rs33 lakh from a goldsmith at Jambhulwadi in Katraj in Pune. The police have also recovered the stolen booty. Investigations revealed that the victim Nandkishor Kantilal Verma’s (41) friend, Vyas Gulab Yadav (34), also a goldsmith who owns a cellphone repairs shop, was the ringleader of the nine-member group which plotted the crime over 25 days. Yadav is a native of Sivan district in Bihar and lives in Jambhulwadi in Pune. “Yadav was well aware of Verma’s business, his family members and his financial condition. In the past, he had asked Verma to loan him Rs6 lakh for business expansion but was refused. Yadav was helping Verma look for a shop to buy. He knew that Verma had stored a considerable amount of cash at home for this purpose,” deputy commissioner of police (zone II) Sagar Patil said. He added, “Yadav got in touch with Maruti Ashok Solanke (30) and Ashok Jagannath Sawant (31), both residents of Mazalgaon, through a common acquaintance and started plotting the crime. He roped in the techies, Bhaiyyasaheb Vitthal More (32) and Shyam Achyut Tormal (31), both residents of Dhankawdi, and Kiran Kumar Nair (31) of Bhosari through common contacts. Solanke and Sawant are wanted in a murder at Mazalgaon. The duo along with the three techies wanted to make some quick money. More’s car was used the crime.” Rohit Sambhaji Patil (35), Umesh Arun Ubale (24) and Suhas Suresh Thorat (32) are the remaining three arrested suspects. Police recovered the robbed cash and ornaments from Rohit’s house at Charholi. Ubale, who was driving the car used in the crime, is a resident of Bhosari in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Thorat is from Dattawadi in Pune. On Friday, Verma lodged a complaint with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police after making inquiries and realising that the five men were not from the I-T department. Yadav had accompanied Verma to the police station for lodging the complaint. While the police were seeking details and description of the incident and the suspects, they got suspicious about some of the replies Yadav gave. The police also realized that the `I-T officials’ had reached Verma’s house moments after Yadav arrived. The police then examined Yadav’s cellphone call data records and detained him and two others for questioning during which they revealed the plot. The police traced the remaining six associates, who were travelling along the Devgad-Nipani highway and nabbed them in a dramatic chase.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/3-techies-2-murder-suspects-among-9-held-in-rs-33l-robbery/articleshow/85749449.cms||---

The government does not intend to take any concrete action and is misleading the OBCs when answers are from them,” he said. Save, in a statement issued on Sunday, said that the ruling MVA government did not respond to the demand for deferring ensuing polls of local self-governing bodies in the state. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was not at all vocal when the Opposition asked for postponing elections till the issue of OBC reservation gets resolved. He only heard the views of different leaders without responding to the demand,” he said. Highlighting that compiling empirical data of OBCs in Maharashtra could mark the beginning of the process for restoring reservation in question, Save has also pressed for empowering the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission for carrying out a task in a time-bound manner. “The state government should take decisive steps to restore OBC reservation, failing which OBC community will step-up the agitation,” Save said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/save-empirical-data-must-for-restoring-obc-reservation/articleshow/85744997.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Contractors deliberately hid risk: Cops||AHMEDABAD: Three brothers who were asphyxiated while operationalizing a sewer line that’s critical for the whole of Bopal were never told about the serious risk they were being sent into. They, therefore, did not know their lives would be in grave danger if they entered the sewer line without proper safety gear, police investigation has now revealed. The brothers, who had never entered a civic pipeline in their lives, were allegedly told by the contractors that it was a sealed stormwater drain, a civic line that carries run-off rain water. TimesViewIt is high time that the system of installing tall sewer gas escape vents along each drainage line in the city is made part of the design. Repeatedly, contractors have failed to provide protective equipment to sanitation workers. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) should now mandatorily make provision for escape vents or else we will continue to lose precious lives.Police officers probing the deaths of three tribal men Raju Meda, 25, Bharat Meda, 53, and Sandip Meda, 33, said that they were casual labourers who worked in the construction field. The victims lived with their families in the shanties of Shela, the cops said. The men belong to Dahod district. “The brothers were asked to come with hammers and were told that they had to break a wall of the stormwater line,” said an officer of Ahmedabad rural police. “They did not know it was a sewer line that was sealed and had raw sewage from the nearby dwellings. But the civic officers and their contractors knew the potential threat of this underground sewer pipeline.” The line linked the Bopal sewage pumping station to the Shantipura trunk line. “The pumping station was built four years ago, but due to Covid, the work of pushing a line across Bopal railway was completed only last month,” the officer added. The officer said that the labour supervisor, Himmat Patel, and the labour contractor, Sanket Patel, first asked Sandip to enter the manhole and ‘break the seal’. “As soon as Sandip broke the wall partially, he began to choke because of the trapped toxic sewer gas. He called for help,” said the officer. “Bharat, his eldest brother, jumped in to save him and then his third brother Raju also joined the rescue effort. When the trio did not surface, police and the fire department were called.” Police had booked Himmat and Sanket for culpable homicide . Sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have also been invoked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cops-contractors-deliberately-hid-risk/articleshow/85749799.cms||Ashish Chauhan

However, like previous years, the temple inside the jail premises will be decorated and prayer will be offered at midnight on Monday. Special food will be provided to the inmates. The jail was not opened to visitors last year either, following Covid-19 outbreak. For years, the gates of Agra Central Jail were opened for common people to commemorate the birth of Lord Krishna. The temple inside the jail was elaborately decorated and tableaux prepared by prisoners were showcased. “Janmashtami celebrations are a must in all prisons across Uttar Pradesh. Agra Jail has been observing Krishna Janmashtami with elaborate celebrations for decades. But in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the gates of the jail will not be opened to outsiders. Staffers and inmates will celebrate while maintaining social distancing. The temple inside the jail premises has already been decked up by the inmates,” said a senior prison department officer. The preparations for the festival starts a week in advance. The inmates make all the decorations from scratch, including the tableaux and art installations. According to data available with the Agra Central Jail, around 1,900 inmates are presently lodged there. An internal estimate of the jail says nearly 1,500 devotees from different parts of the city, mostly residents living in the vicinity, visit the jail to participate in the Janmashtami celebrations every year. V K Singh, deputy inspector general (prisons), said, “Prisoners are very excited for the celebrations. The fact that outsiders will not be allowed to witness their creations has dampened the spirits a little. However, the ‘kirtan’ (devotional chants) will be organized as usual on Monday. Prisoners will sing bhajans (devotional songs) dedicated to Lord Krishna.” Apart from the decorations, the inmates also enact the story of Lord Krishna to mark the occasion, donning colourful costumes. According to mythology, Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in a prison cell in Mathura. Krishna was prophesied to kill Kansa, the ruler of Mathura and brother of Devaki. “We also have a special menu planned for the prisoners,” said Singh. “Apart from the usual dal and roti, we will be serving the halwa and puri,” said Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-jail-janmashtami-festival-will-not-be-open-to-public/articleshow/85747075.cms||Deepak Lavania

Thorat, who was in Nashik to address a conference of Nashik district farmers associations’ coordination committee, said the farmers have been protesting against Centre’s three farm bills, but during the last one year, the PM did not even approach the agitating farmers or interact with them to understand what they actually want, and it is really unfortunate. “The Modi-led BJP government is taking decisions in the interests of capitalists. Modi has adopted a disinvestment policy on some public sector undertakings in order to benefit some specific capitalists,” he said. Thorat alleged the BJP government passed three farm laws without any discussion in Parliament and those MPs who protested the farm bills were suspended. The minister said the APMC Act is stringent and it is mandatory to make payment to the farmers within 24 hours. Nevertheless, there have been incidents of farmers being cheated by some traders. “APMCs will not exist anymore due to the new farm laws. Therefore, cases of farmers being cheated by the traders will increase if the new laws are implemented,” said Thorat. Thorat also criticized the central government for its failure in tackling the pandemic that led to more fatalities. He also blamed the Centre for hiding the correct figure of Covid deaths. Earlier, the co-ordination committee of farmers associations had decided to take out a tractor rally in the city to protest against the three farm laws, but it was cancelled due to Covid pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/centres-decisions-anti-farmer-in-interest-of-capitalists-thorat/articleshow/85745043.cms||Tushar Pawar

The price of wholesale tomatoes has crashed from Rs 400 per crate to Rs 50-60/crate over the last three-four weeks in all wholesale markets across Ahmednagar district. There are around 20kg tomatoes in every crate. Due to this, a section of angry farmers resorted to dumping their produce on the premises of the Samsherpur wholesale market in Akole. According to farmers, they have incurred heavy losses due to crash in wholesale price tomatoes and could not even recover transportation cost that forced them to throw away their produce. Ajit Navale, general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha (AIMS), said the sudden crash in wholesale price of tomatoes is leading to huge losses to the farmers.“We want the government to provide a grant of Rs 50,000 per acre to tomato farmers as relief,” he said. “Several tomato processing units have shut down during the last one-and-a-half years due to the Covid pandemic. Hence, the government needs to give some incentives to such units for revival as this will directly benefit the farmers. Moreover, efforts are also required from the central government to increase the export of tomatoes to neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal by removing the hurdles in export,” he added. According to traders, the arrival of tomatoes in the market has increased which has directly affected the wholesale price.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/ahmednagar-farmers-dump-tomatoes-at-akole-apmc/articleshow/85745072.cms||Tushar Pawar

GITP has urged schools and other stakeholders to assist the government in the initiative so that students can gain skills in information and technology. State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) Goa has developed a new curriculum for computer education under the CARES (Coding and Robotics Education in Schools) scheme and has decided to involve teachers in preparing the content.  GITP said that Goa lags behind in computer and information technology because of which Goan students are unable to enhance their capabilities and skills. “A constantly evolving subject, demands continuous training of teachers. In National Education Policy 2020, the computer and technology sector has been given an important place in school education.

Among other things, the sessions court has directed Shah to surrender his passport and ensure that he is present before the court at every date relating to the case. Shah has restrained from contacting either the complainant or any witnesses and he shall not tamper with witness or evidence, the court said. Agarwal said, “The court primarily relied on facts, such as a report by electrical experts stating that high voltage led to the overheating of a bend sealer machine. At the same, sodium chloride power fell on the machine setting off the fire. We brought to the court’s notice that sodium chloride is highly oxidant because of which the fire spread quickly.” “The court further relied on another report by the deputy director of industrial safety and health which pointed out that there were two exits available for the workers to come out, but the intensity of the fire was such that they could not. We pointed out that four workers who were working on the machine did manage to come out but others working some distance away from the machine could not owing to the intensity of the fire,” said Agarwal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/another-firm-partner-gets-bail-in-fire-tragedy/articleshow/85749519.cms||Vishwas Kothari

They were protesting lathicharge on farmers in Karnal on Saturday.General secretary of Inqualabi Kendra, Punjab, Kanwaljit Khanna, whose group has been supporting farmers’ agitation, said the protests were held at many places in Ludhiana, Khanna, Samrala, Kohara, toll plazas of Lehal, Rakba and Ladowal, Chowkiman, Bassiyan, Kamalpura, Bondri and Raikot. He claimed that in about a dozen villages, farmers burnt the effigies of Haryana CM ML Khattar.Khanna said they want the services of Karnal SDM to be terminated, a judicial inquiry ordered into the “brutal lathicharge by the police” and a case registered against the culprits. He added that in Jagraon, they blocked the Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road for two hours and women and children had also joined the agitation. Addressing the protesters in Jagraon, Manjit Singh Dhanes, senior vice-president of Bharatiya Kisan Union Ekta Dakonda, said the lathicharge and repression on the orders of Karnal SDM would cost the Modi and the Khattar government dear. Chamkaur Singh from a village in Jagraon said there were long queues of vehicles on the road near Jagraon, but protesters allowed ambulances to pass through the blockade. In Ludhiana, members of BKU Ekta Ugrahan staged a sit-in in front of a mall on Ferozepur Road and raised slogans against the BJP government. Union’s member Gurpreet Singh said they blocked the Ludhiana-Jagraon Road in protest against the Khattar government’s action against farmers in Karnal and “our struggle will continue till the government scraps the black farm laws.” BKU Ekta Sidhupur members also blocked the Ludhiana to Chandigarh and Ropar roads near Neelon. Its acting block president asked the farmers to intensify the struggle. Police officials said they had to divert traffic so that commuters did not face problems. It took some time for the traffic to normalise after the farmers lifted the blockade. A commuter said, “I had to go to Chandigarh, but since farmers had blocked the road near Neelon, I got stuck in a jam and then had to take a longer route to reach my destination.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/karnal-canecharge-farmers-block-roads-want-sdm-out/articleshow/85747087.cms||---
---||Goa||12 teams fulfil criteria, 10 get nod for I-League Qualifiers||Panaji: Vasco Sports Club failed to make it to the I-League Qualifiers after the club did not submit documents for the club licensing criteria. The Goa Football Association had recommended Vasco as the state representative for the Qualifiers. When the AIFF started the process of shortlisting teams from the 29 who were recommended, Vasco were left out in the first round itself. “The time was very short for us to submit all the documents and submit the bank guarantee of Rs 25 lakh,” said the club’s director of football, Ravish Narvekar. “We were speaking with investors and requested AIFF for some time. We had no issues with the entry fee but bank guarantee, without a nod from investors, would have been difficult. “Vasco’s intention was never to participate just for the sake of it. We wanted to have a competitive team, and for that, it was a must to have investors on board. We did have meetings, but things did not work out,” said Narvekar. A total of 10 teams will take part in the I-League Qualifiers 2021 which will take place at the Bangalore Football Stadium in Bengaluru, Karnataka, in October. According to AIFF sources, most teams failed to qualify due to their failure to meet the club licensing requirements. “We had 12 teams who ticked all the boxes and fulfilled the criteria,” said one official. From among the 12, two teams -- Garhwal FC (Delhi) and PIFA Sports (Maharashtra) – were left out. “The two teams missed out because the (AIFF executive committee) decision is to take only one team from each state. The top team from the state on sporting merit was considered. We couldn’t take more than 10 teams,” said the official. Questions were raised in some quarters about a ‘new’ team Corbett FC being accommodated out of turn. The AIFF however said Corbett is the new name for Amenity Sports Academy, recommended by the Uttarakhand FA. AIFF said the 10 selected clubs have gone through the process of nomination by their respective state FAs, and have successfully submitted the required documents for the league and club licensing on time. Selected teams: Hyderya Sports FC (J&K), Corbett FC (Uttarakhand), Delhi FC (Delhi), Madan Maharaj FC (Madhya Pradesh), Rajasthan United FC (Rajasthan), ARA FC (Gujarat), Kenkre FC (Maharashtra), FC Bengaluru United (Karnataka), Kerala United FC (Kerala), Ryntih SC (Meghalaya)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/12-teams-fulfil-criteria-10-get-nod-for-i-league-qualifiers/articleshow/85779530.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Crime web series inspired Gomtinagar heist||LUCKNOW: Hooked to a crime web series, Money Heist, streaming on a popular OTT platform, three youths in their twenties were inspired by the daring exploits on screen and decided to rob a jewellery store in Gomtinagar Extension. Twenty-four hours after the heist, police cracked the case and tracked down the kingpin, who was none other than the salesman at the counter, Pradeep, who feigned victim after his aide thrust a gun on his head and tied up his hands. The whole crime scene was set up by Pradeep, whose burqa-clad accomplice, Imran, spoke in a soft dulcet tone before enacting the heist and slipping away into the bylanes. The third accomplice, Sandeep Gupta, who provided the getaway car was also nabbed with Imran and Pradeep. Assistant commissioner of police, Gomtinagar, Shweta Srivastava, who led the operation, said, the trio was arrested after interrogation, non-stop surveillance and CCTV footage provided clinching evidence. Police also recovered ornaments worth Rs 15lakh, the gateway car and burqa and snickers worn by Imran. They were arrested from neighbouring Gangotri Vihar. “We waited for the heat to die down and interrogated Pradeep after conducting a thorough investigation. Sustained grilling forced Pradeep to own up crime and his aides were subsequently nabbed,” said Srivastava. Another officer privy to the probe disclosed the youths were school dropouts and wanted to make fast buck for luxury living. “A day before the robbery, the accused hammed out the plan, but in haste, Imran forgot to change his shoes while stepping out of the car. The accused also failed to notice a functional CCTV just next to the jewellery shop,” said a police officer. They were all in their early twenties and while Imram was employed in a nursery, Sandeep worked in a homoeopathy clinic and the car was registered in the name of his father. They wanted to earn quick money and would watch web series like ‘Money Heist’ on OTT platforms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/crime-web-series-inspired-city-heist/articleshow/85751603.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Youth, students pick up mantle to win ‘cleanest mosque’ tag||HYDERABAD: City mosques are now vying for a new honour of being the cleanest Muslim place of worship. The pandemic has helped trigger the campaign – ‘My mosque is the cleanest’. About a dozen mosques have pioneered the campaign involving the local youth and students to clean the premises. Most of the mosques had gathered dust due to prolonged shutdown during pandemic. The campaign was launched to clear the mess and keep the mosques clean and tidy ahead of any third wave of Covid-19. The team that keeps the local mosque cleanest will get financial incentives in the form of school and college tuition fee payment and scholarships. Educationist Syed Zakir Hussain, the brain behind the campaign, told TOI that he had persuaded the youth and students to keep their mosques clean after he noticed the imam of a mosque cleaning the premises alone. “The imam is the leader of the congregational prayers. It is not his duty to clean the premises. I then mobilised a group of youngsters to clean the mosque,” he said. Zakir said he was moved after a Hindu couple, who runs a sanitaryware shop, gave a huge discount when they came to know that the cleaning material was for a mosque. “When I asked for the price, the young couple refused to quote the price. Instead they told me to pay whatever I can as the material was for the house of God,” Zakir said. At 100-years-old Masjid Amjadi, Sultan and his friends have been keeping the mosque clean. Prominent businessman Abdul Rasheed and his team has been taking care of the Qutub Shahi mosque at Shaikpet. Mohammad Moazzam Hussain, founding member of MS Schools group, told TOI that the response has been very encouraging and many mosques are now cleaner than ever.Syed Asim Ahmed, IT expert and member of Chowk Masjid committee, said the idea behind the campaign was to inculcate the habit of cleanliness in youngsters. Imams and khateebs of a few mosques during Friday sermons (khutbah) said that it was the duty of everyone who offers prayers in mosques to keep the premises clean. Moulana Mohammad Haneef Quadri told the devout that cleanliness was half the faith and youngsters should not wait for the mosque committee to keep the premises clean.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/youth-students-pick-up-mantle-to-win-cleanest-mosque-tag/articleshow/85749565.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Delhi||HC refuses bail in fake currency case||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has refused bail to a person allegedly part of a syndicate that prints and circulates fake Indian currency notes, saying that it not only cripples the economy but also breeds drug smuggling and funds undesirable terrorist outfits. Justice Subramonium Prasad stated that circulation of fake currency notes adversely affected the financial health of the nation and that fake production has reached such a “level of immaculate sophistication” that they have become “indistinguishable from real currency notes and have become a high profiteering business.” “Circulation of fake currency notes is severely detrimental to the economy and hampers the financial regulation of the country. The production of counterfeit currency notes often stems from dissatisfaction with a country’s growth, and is therefore aimed at financially disintegrating and destabilising the steady equilibrium of liquidity in the economy. “Counterfeiting of currency notes breeds drug smuggling, purchase of illegal arms and ammunition, funding of undesirable terrorist outfits, cross-border money laundering, human trafficking and various other phenomena. It has a disastrous effect on the economy,” the judge said in his order dated August 23. He added that Sections 489A, 489B, 489C, 489D and 489E of the Indian Penal Code, which deal with offences pertaining to fake currency, were specially inserted by the legislature to protect the economy of the country. In the present case, the court noted, the petitioner-accused was apprehended by police following a “secret information” that a Dubai-based Pakistani national was trying to bring fake Indian currency notes in the country. pti||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-refuses-bail-in-fake-currency-case/articleshow/85749545.cms||---

---||Lucknow||A year on, Lucknow University hiring for vacancies still in limbo||LUCKNOW: Lucknow University had initiated the process to fill around 200 teaching posts in September last year. But even after a year, the exercise is far from over. Teachers and students say that further delay would not only scuttle the university’s attempt of scoring a good grade from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) but also impact the quality of teaching as laid down in the National Education Policy (NEP). Faculty positions in various LU departments have been vacant for long. The process of filling these posts was expedited after vice-chancellor Prof AK Rai assumed office in January 2020 and announced plans to finalise the appointment at the earliest. LU issued the advertisement on September 16 last year, inviting applications for the posts. The process was first halted when the LU roster system for appointments was challenged in the high court. Thereafter, rules of the selection process were revised. Subsequently, the advertisement was withdrawn in June this year. The university then announced that it would issue re-advertisement by July and complete the appointment process at the earliest because adequate teaching strength would be the key to a good NAAC grade. However, re-advertisement for the posts has not been issued yet, though LU has taken the first step of submitting Institutional Information for Quality Assessment (IIQA) for NAAC accreditation. Teachers say NAAC would take three-four months to verify the IIQA and conduct an inspection before allotting the grade. In the previous NAAC assessment done in 2014, LU had secured grade B mainly because many teaching posts were vacant at that time. “The same may happen again if we do not expedite the recruitment process,” said a senior professor, while pointing out that the number of vacancies on permanent posts are 200, which is around 39% of the total strength of 516. “The number of students enrolled is over 17,000 and teacher-taught ratio is about 1:39, whereas the ideal ratio prescribed by UGC is 1:20,” he added.  LU Teachers Association general secretary Prof Vineet Kumar Verma said, “Recruitment and promotions should be done at the earliest as it is one the main parameters for NAAC.” LU VC said, “We are in the last leg of rostering and the process will be completed at the earliest." Other LU officials said that all efforts are being made to complete recruitment before the NAAC inspection. “We are confident of getting a good grade this time. The LU is among the first universities in the country to adopt NEP and has vowed to implement it in the letter and spirit,” said a senior officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/a-year-on-lu-hiring-for-vacancies-still-in-limbo/articleshow/85751650.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: 2 boys, 14 & 13, hacked to death near Meerut||MEERUT: Blood-soaked bodies of two minors — Mohd Sadiq (14) and his friend Mohd Aman (13) — were found dumped in forests some 25 away from Meerut on Sunday. Both in school, one a student of class 9 and the other in 7, there were multiple cuts and bruises on them, indicating that they were “surrounded, thrashed and brutally hacked with sharp weapons”. An e-rickshaw that the two were driving -- with their school closed due to the pandemic, they ferried passengers in their spare time to supplement the family income -- is missing, along with Sadiq’s phone. This had led some to suspect that it may have been a case of robbery which turned violent. Police, however, have debunked this theory, claiming that the gruesome nature of the crime did not seem motivated by theft. Circle officer (Kithore) Brajesh Singh told TOI that there were no leads in the case as yet. Singh said though the e-rickshaw and phone are missing, “robbery does not seem to be the motive behind the murder”. “The perpetrators dragged them over a kilometre from the road, deep into the woods. Why? Prima facie, there were no signs of sexual abuse as well. We will look at all angles, including a love affair, but we cannot say anything with certainty,” he said. An FIR has been filed under various sections of the IPC, including murder, against unknown people. The kids were residents of Shahjahanpur town near Meerut and were found 20 metres apart in the forests of Fatehpur Narayan, a day after their families reported them missing. Police said there were signs that the two put up a struggle before being killed. “Cuts and bruises suggested they were surrounded, thrashed and brutally hacked with sharp weapons,” said a senior officer involved in the investigations. Jaane Alam, Sadiq’s father, who repairs motor pumps for a living, told TOI that he last spoke to his son on Saturday evening when he and Aman had taken an e-rickshaw owned by Sadiq’s elder brother to drop a passenger to a nearby stop. “It didn’t seem like anything was wrong. We spoke normally, but after that his phone was switched off. We tried to locate the kids and later approached police. A missing person report was filed. On Sunday, we discovered this cruel crime. We don't know who would harm small children. We have no enmity with anyone,” said Alam. Alam said Sadiq was a good student and the pride of their family. "He wanted to become an engineer when he grew up. Now he will never be one," he said. Neighbours said the two were “good kids” who were never seen in “bad company”. “Even at such a young age, they did odd jobs to supplement their family’s income. It’s shocking that someone bore them ill-will,” said a neighbour, Zakrya Khan. Another neighbour, Mannan Khan, who had searched for the boys along with their families on Saturday, told TOI that when they found Sadiq’s body, “his face had turned blue, as if he was strangled.” “Both boys had injury marks on their stomach and elsewhere that were made with sharp-edged weapons. The missing e-rickshaw and phone could mean they were killed by those who stole the items,” said Khan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/school-boys-14-13-hacked-to-death-near-meerut/articleshow/85747212.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||India||Did Deshmukh get CBI clean chit? Congress, NCP seek probe||MUMBAI: NCP and Congress on Sunday claimed that a “report” circulating on social media has revealed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) gave former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh a clean chit, much before cases were filed against him for corruption and money laundering. The spokesmen of the two parties cited an unsigned, 65-page report purportedly compiled by a CBI officer. “The inquiry conducted has revealed that no cognizable offence has been committed by Anil Deshmukh. In view of the above, it is recommended that this PE be closed,” says the unattested report. However, a senior CBI official denied that Deshmukh had been given a clean chit. He said Bombay high court ordered registration of a preliminary enquiry (PE) in the matter based on public interest litigations. On completion of the PE, the competent authority directed registration of a regular case based on evidence collected during the PE and legal opinion. Accordingly, an FIR was registered on March 24. A copy of the FIR filed by CBI against Deshmukh, which TOI has perused, includes the PE’s findings. It says the PE “revealed that a cognisable offence is made out” against Deshmukh for attempting to “obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty.” However, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said, “As per the reports, Deshmukh has been given a clean chit… CBI must clarify if the document in circulation is part of the PE report,” Malik said. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant demanded an SC-monitored probe into the case. “CBI has become an agency to target opponents of the Narendra Modi-led government, offences are registered, politicians are booked, but there is absolutely no progress in the probe,” Sawant said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-deshmukh-get-cbi-clean-chit-congress-ncp-seek-probe/articleshow/85753855.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The track is being built under the Smart City mission and the government of India’s “cycle for change challenge.” Under the Centre’s initiative, the MC had organised a cycle rally in October last and did nothing else. Officials said during the pandemic, more people purchased cycles and started pedalling. Sarabjit Singh, a resident of Model Town, said, “Cycle tracks are required in every area so that everybody can enjoy cycling.”Kamal Sharma, a resident of Sarabha Nagar, said, “Several residents like cycling, but cannot in the absence of designated tracks. There are many national and international cycle brands from the city, but nothing is being done to encourage the green mode here.” Bridges and road department superintending engineer Rahul Gagneja said, “As it is difficult to cycle in traffic, we are looking for sites to build cycle tracks. There are, however, not many roads where there is a possibility of making these. There is a track at Malhar Road, too. In metro cities, dedicated tracks are being developed and cycle rallies are being organised.” Public bike sharing project dropped While the MC claims to be working on developing cycle tracks in the city, the public bike sharing project announced under the Smart City mission has been dropped. The project planned to provide cycles to people on rent for travel within the city. The officials dropped the project, saying it was not feasible and companies refused to realise it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/city-will-soon-get-another-cycle-track/articleshow/85747216.cms||---

The accused, Mushtaq, was detained by the Tapukara police after his elder son spotted blood marks in the house on Sunday. Police said the accused suspected his wife Sahina (31) of infidelity and attacked her with an axe, resulting in her immediate death. The two have five children. The accused fled from the house soon after the incident but was nabbed by a police team before he could get away. The alarm was sounded by his elder son who discovered blood on the floor of the house. Preliminary investigation hinted that the crime took place sometime after Saturday midnight. Deep wounds on the victim’s body indicated the brutality of the crime. There were injury marks all over her face. She died on the spot after the attack. SHO Ramesh Chandra said family members had informed them about the incident. The Alwar police said a team was sent to the house and Sahina’s body was shifted to the mortuary for post-mortem. The couple had got married about 15 years ago and had frequent quarrels. “We are examining all angles related to the case. Interrogation is underway and more details will be known only after we complete it. But from what we have learnt so far, the couple fought regularly. On Saturday, the husband took an axe and killed his wife,” an officer said. “Prima facie it appears the accused had doubted his wife’s character and killed her with a sharp object,” the officer said. Police said they were waiting for the post-mortem report and an FIR would be filed soon in the case. Relatives of Mushtaq and his wife gathered outside the local hospital where the victim’s body was kept.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/man-hacks-wife-to-death-over-suspected-infidelity-in-alwar-dist/articleshow/85751670.cms||---

---||Kolkata||UAE travel visa for jabbed tourists||KOLKATA: An international holiday destination is set to reopen with the United Arab Emirates announcing that it would issue visas to all fully vaccinated tourists from Monday. While Emirates is set to increase the frequency of flights between Dubai and Kolkata once travel demand shoots up, FlyDubai is also going to re-introduce its flights from September. Etihad may also resume flights between Abu Dhabi and Kolkata. Indian carriers IndiGo, SpiceJet and Air India that operated flights between Kolkata and Dubai are also expected to announce their plans sometime during the week. According to the travel trade community, visas will be issued to all those who are fully inoculated with one of the Covid-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization at least 14 days before travel. The vaccines that are recognised include AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm and Sinovac. Covishield, which is the Indian brand of AstraZeneca vaccine produced under licence in the country, will be accepted, travel agents said. However, those who have taken Covaxin or Sputnik V are not eligible for travel to the UAE. The news has brought cheer to the travel trade industry that has had very little outbound business in the past year-and-a-half. “Dubai was the second biggest destination for travellers from Kolkata after Bangkok. With Thailand still shut to tourists, there will be a surge in traffic to Dubai. Though the UK and a few other destinations in Europe are also issuing tourist visas, travelling to Dubai will be less complicated as it is nearer and there is no mandatory quarantine requirement,” pointed out Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. With the UAE also hosting multiple events over the next few months, including the Dubai Expo 2020 trade fair, the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021 in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Muscat and the unfinished IPL 2021 in Dubai. “The reopening of Dubai has come at the right time. The Dubai Expo 2020 that will be held from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022, is a global event that is held once in four years. Last year, it got cancelled due to the pandemic. Thousands of Indians will be eager to attend this event that is an experience in itself,” said Travel Agents Association of India (chairman) Manav Soni. The UAE had put India on the red list when the country was passing through the difficult second wave and banned travel to the Emirates to curb the spread of the more virulent delta strain of the virus. Earlier this month, it first opened the doors to those with residency permits and then to transit travellers. The travel trade community hopes that countries in South East Asia will also display a similar measured approach to opening up their economies. The news about the UAE comes within hours of the Indian civil aviation ministry announcing its decision to resume air bubble flights between India and Bangladesh. That news has already triggered excitement in various sectors in Kolkata, including healthcare and hospitality that is substantially dependent on Bangladeshi patients and tourists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/uae-travel-visa-for-jabbed-tourists/articleshow/85749630.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had called special meetings with various sports associations for improving the sports infrastructure in the city and the officials were told to involve their members in planning.One of the officials said the work would take at least six months to complete. He said they would install sports equipment, concrete structure for seating and appropriate lights.Ashu said, “The sports infrastructure in the city needed changes. Some facilities are being repaired and some new ones are being constructed. This structure is the need of the hour as there is no government table tennis complex and many budding players can practise here.”Manpreet Singh, a resident of Civil Lines, said, “My daughter is interested in table tennis and she goes to a private academy.

Manoj Vihan, 48, was shot, chased and shot again allegedly by Atul Kumar and his two friends on Saturday, police said. Sources in the department claimed that Atul’s father, Amit Singh, was killed in the same way about 13 years ago. But Vihan was let off for lack of evidence. Atul was a child then. An FIR against Atul and two unidentified persons has been registered, a police officer said, adding that Atul was on the run. Atul’s father, Amit, was a resident of Fahimpur village in Muzaffarnagar. Due to a village rivalry, which saw two back-to-back killings, Amit sold all his properties and moved with his family to Meerut’s Chindori village -- his wife’s ancestral village. But, in 2008, Amit was shot dead. His family suspected that Vihan was a “conspirator” and had informed the killers about his presence in the Meerut village. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Prabhakar Chaudhary said, “Atul has emerged as the prime suspect in the murder. CCTV footage is being scanned as part of the investigation. At present, Atul is on the run and efforts are on to arrest him.” Atul had been threatening Vihan for quite some time, sources said. “Atul used to frequent the vicinity of our house and would often threaten to kill my uncle. He had even fired in the air a couple of times in the past. On Saturday, he along with two other friends, barged into the house of Manoj’s friend Harender and fired at him,” said Rinku Singh, Vihan’s nephew. Vihan had fought the recently-held village panchayat elections, but he had lost. As a BSP worker, he was aspiring to contest 2022 Assembly elections in UP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/to-avenge-fathers-killing-youth-shoots-dead-man-45-in-meerut/articleshow/85747245.cms||Sandeep Rai

Two groups—one led by Avtar Singh Bhogal and the other by DS Chawla—have decided to contest elections on all eight posts. They are busy chalking out strategies and organising parties to woo the voters, who will decide which group will rule UCPMA for the next two years. Social media and WhatsApp groups are being flooded with messages of support and vote.To strike a chord with the voters who have factories in congested areas, the United Alliance Group (UAG), which is being supported by KK Seth, Charanjit Vishiwkarma and Jaswinder Thukral, conducted a two-wheeler rally. During the rally, contestants, led by their presidential candidate Avtar Singh Bhogal, visited units of members and appealed for votes. UAG is fighting the elections on the agenda of development. Chief spokesperson of the group Charanjit Singh Vishiwkarma said, “We aim at upgrading the local bicycle industry by ending imports of cheap Chinese goods. Candidates of our group are known for their clean image and dedication towards uplift and welfare of the cycle industry and the UCPMA as well.”The rival group, which is led by DS Chawla who is also its candidate for president’s post, has the support of bicycle industry veterans Joginder Kumar and Joga Singh. This group’s is highlighting the attack on Chawla in the August 18 annual general meeting (AGM) of the association. Chawla had alleged that the attack was orchestrated by the members of UAG and he even got an FIR registered against the group’s members, including Gurmeet Singh Kular, the presiding officer for the elections. Chawla said, “Our fight is against the wrongdoings that took place in the UCPMA and we will expose the persons involved. I tried to raise my voice against these people during the AGM, but there was a cowardly attack on me, but nothing can deter me from speaking the truth. Everyone knows that our group and I have stood up for the industry and fought with different departments and governments for the betterment of the bicycle industry.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/units-become-war-rooms-social-media-is-abuzz-with-canvassing/articleshow/85747280.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Kochi||Kerala: Teachers’ associations raise concerns over Plus One exams||KOCHI: Conducting Plus-One model examinations online just for the sake before the public examination will do no good to students but will only put them under more pressure, said higher secondary teachers. Various associations of higher secondary teachers raise concerns about the decision to conduct the Plus One public exam, scheduled from September 6, without proper revision classes or model exam. They demand the government to postpone the public exams, conduct offline model exams and give enough time to conduct at least a few offline classes. The plan to conduct online model exams from August 31 to September 4 online faced much criticism as many students will not be able to take it online due to digital divide. Those who take it will have no time to review their preparations based on their performance in model exams. Teachers said that many students and their parents have been calling them expressing concern over taking Plus-One public exam based on their online class learning. Anil M George, state general secretary, Departmental Higher Secondary School Teachers Association (HSSTA), said that the general education department has decided to conduct two online model exams a day and plans to complete them in a hurried manner. Conducting the model exams, which are supposed to help students rectify their mistakes and perform better in the board exam, like this is mere farce. They have ignored the teachers’ request to conduct offline model exams, evaluate the papers and give at least three weeks’ time for students to clear their doubts, he said. “Poor internet connectivity and unavailability of digital gadgets still affect thousands of students, forcing them to be out of the digital education world. Many students in tribal and other backward areas have not attended even a single online class. They cannot attend the online model exam, and the public exam will be a farce for them,” George said. Many among the total 53 subjects in various Plus-One course combinations are tough and students have no way to learn them without proper classes. Teachers said that online classes are not enough, and students who opted subjects like Psychology, Journalism, Communicative English, Anthropology, Arabic, Urdu, Sanskrit, etc, have not received even proper online classes. “Why cannot the government postpone the exams? Most Plus One students will be seeing their schools for the first time during the board exam. The students suffer from mental pressure as they got to know of the question pattern just a few days ago. The marks of Plus One are calculated for the final Plus Two results and poor performance in the exam will affect the students,” said S Manoj, general secretary of Aided Higher Secondary Teachers Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/teachers-associations-raise-concerns-over-plus-one-exams/articleshow/85747338.cms||---

In her growing years, Cheryl faced difficulty in coming to terms with her father's death. She didn't know whether he was killed in action or went missing until 2019 when she received a call from her schoolmate and found the closure she was looking for 57 years. “My family stopped talking about my father after his death. I never knew how to even remember or connect with him when suddenly in 2019, I received a call from my friend Rita Joseph. She said her brother George Olapally, a part of St. Joseph’s Boys High School’s Old Boys’ Association (OBA), had found my father’s memorial in remote Jaswanthgarh (Arunachal Pradesh),” she said. “He found the OBA hadn't honoured him and began looking for us. I came from Perth and visited his memorial and felt connected with him after so many years,” she added.

We reached there in an SUV around 9.30pm. The accused were consuming liquor in a car there. In an inebriated condition, they started abusing me. When I objected to it, they manhandled me. Taranpreet took out a weapon to threaten me. Deep, Deesha and Ravi asked Taranpreet to hand over the weapon to them so that they could shoot me. Taranpreet, however, did not give them the weapon.”Sarabpreet’s friends intervened and they left from the spot. “Thereafter, we called up Sukha, informed him about the incident and asked him to postpone the birthday party. On the way back home, we met our friends Lakhwinder Singh Gill of Jhugiyan village and Maninderpal Singh of Ghumet village. Both were in a car. They asked us to have dinner with them and we agreed. Near Kedar Dhaba of Kohara around 11.30pm, some people waved at us to stop. When we slowed down our cars, we saw Taranpreet, along with at least 20 people in four cars. They opened two shots at Lakhwinder’s car and vandalized my car. One of the accused attacked me with a sharp-edged weapon. They then fired at least four shots at my car. They chased us in their cars, but we managed to flee. Thereafter, my friends took me to a hospital,” Sarabpreet added.Accused Deep had a land dispute with Sarabpreet’s friend two years ago. “Deep, Taranpreet and others suspected me of helping their rivals and that’s why they attacked me,” he said.Koomkalan sub-inspector Harmeet Singh said the victim recorded his statement on Saturday after which an FIR was lodged under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons and means), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) of the IPC and the Arms Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/shots-fired-vehicles-damaged-group-booked-for-murder-bid/articleshow/85747260.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: With 44 big cats, the leopard population booms in Jhalana||JAIPUR: The female leopards at Jhalana reserve are giving stiff competition to each other in giving birth to cubs. Recently, leopardess Flora equalled the record of another big cat, LK, of giving birth to 12 cubs in five litters. Flora, which bore her fifth litter, was captured by tourists on camera on Sunday. Forest ranger Janeshwar Chaudhary said, “The leopardess has given birth to two cubs. The highest number of cubs have been produced by wild cats Flora and LK. The famous Mrs Khan too has, so far, delivered seven litters.” Wildlife enthusiasts claim that in leopard fraternity, Flora’s popularity is akin to India’s most famous feline ‘Machhli’ of Ranthambore. State wildlife board member Dhirendra said, “A majority of Jhalana’s population consists of Flora's offspring. All its cubs survived and have become major tourists attractions.” This year, female leopards have given birth to 12 cubs in Jhalana, taking the big cat population to 44. Though, the birth has elated wildlife lovers, it has worried the managers as the area is bursting at its seams. A recent study revealed that the density of leopards is too high for an urban jungle. With new cubs being regularly born, sub-adults are getting pushed out. In search of territory, these wild cats venture out and go missing or get killed in territorial fights. With the leopard population on an upward trajectory, there is an expected spillover to adjoining areas of the reserve. Ideally, one male leopard requires at least 5 sqkm area. “The department should soon develop the surrounding forest areas, including Galta, which is over 700 hectares. The Jhalana forest area is spread over an area of 20 sqkm and the carrying capacity is far too less,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/with-44-big-cats-the-leopard-population-booms-in-jhalana/articleshow/85751733.cms||---

---||Goa||FC Goa pay NorthEast transfer fee for release of Dylan Fox||Panaji: FC Goa have completed the signing of Dylan Fox after paying the stipulated transfer fee to NorthEast United FC. Goa had agreed personal terms with the Australian defender but the transfer was stalled due to a clause in the player’s contract. According to the contract, there was an automatic renewal if the defender played 16 league games and the team lost less than seven matches. Fox played 21 of the team’s 22 matches and NorthEast lost just three games in the league stage. Among the more impressive performers for the team in their run to the semifinals, Fox was free to join any club outside India but if he chose India “then he shall be liable to pay the club a transfer fee of 40,000 US dollars,” according to clause 3.2 in his contract. Goa have now paid the transfer fee and secured his release. “Fox works well for FC Goa. At 27, he’s relatively young and knows the league well. He’s comfortable with the ball, strong in the air, just the type of player that we were looking out for,” said one source who has tracked this transfer. The signing of Fox means Goa have signed their full quota of foreign players for the first time in three years. While Edu Bedia, Ivan Gonzalez, Jorge Ortiz and Alberto Noguera all had existing two-year contracts, Spanish striker Airam Cabrera replaces Golden Boot winner Igor Angulo. Even though the foreign players are all signed, Goa are not yet done with their transfer business during this window. According to sources, the club is still looking out for a domestic defender and will keep trying till the last minute. “There are not many options available. Those who Goa are keen on are contracted with their clubs and they wouldn’t release them even for a fee,” said one source. The need to sign a quality domestic defender springs from a new rule that allows just four foreign players on the field. Having two foreign defenders among the four may curtail Goa’s attacking threat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fc-goa-pay-northeast-transfer-fee-for-release-of-dylan-fox/articleshow/85779776.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Stating that most of its members live in such hamlets, the community has accused local government authorities of not paying attention to the basic needs of the rural population despite making repeated pleas. “The hamlets in Adagaon Sarak and Ladsawangi circles of Aurangabad taluka are the worst hit due to road-connectivity issues. The problem gets compounded during monsoon when temporary roads become inaccessible. Many other such hamlets in Aurangabad and region still do not have proper schools and crematoriums,” Ravikant Rathod, leader of the Gor Banjara Brigade, said. Getting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the community and naming Navi Mumbai international airport after former chief minister late Vasantrao Naik are some of the other demands that were raised by the community members.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/provide-basic-amenities-to-hamlets-in-aurangabad-gor-banjara-community/articleshow/85745179.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid dip likely due to weekend effect on tests||MUMBAI: After two consecutive days of an increase in new Covid-19 cases, the state and city saw a marginal drop in new detections. The decline in cases is likely due to fewer tests performed during the weekend. The state on Sunday reported 4,666 new cases, taking the overall tally to 64,56,939. Maharashtra has been reporting less than 5,000 cases for the past three days. Mumbai reported 345 cases. The city’s case tally now stands at 7,43,499. Deaths have remained stagnant in the state, but dropped in the city. Maharashtra reported 131 deaths taking the toll to 1,37,157. Mumbai reported two Covid fatalities on Sunday. The city has been reporting Covid deaths in single digit for nearly a month now. Mumbai’s cumulative Covid toll has reached 15,974. Both the deceased on Sunday were senior citizens and had comorbidities. Cautioning that Maharashtra could see a spurt in cases post festivities like Kerala has done, public health Rajesh Tope said called on districts to exercise caution, especially after the Centre advised a night curfew ahead of the festive season such as Gauri-Ganpati, Dussehra and Diwali. “In light of the Covid surge seen in Kerala after Onam, the Centre has recommended night curfew for Maharashtra too. However, a final decision on the issue will be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray soon,” Tope said, while speaking to the media in Jalna, his hometown. He also said that a special vaccination drive will be started for teachers and non-teaching staff by September 5 on Teachers’ Day. Active coronavirus cases increased in the state on Sunday, while Mumbai noted a fall. The state had 52,844 active cases, up from 51,821. Mumbai’s active cases dropped to 3,378 from 3,406.

---||Kolkata||Drink driving on the rise; 500 booked for night curb violation in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Over 18 motorists were sent to hospitals for medical check-ups after some cops, who were part of a drive to enforce night restrictions in the city from 11pm to 5am, found that they were reeking of alcohol. Around 500 people were prosecuted for violating the night restrictions during this drive. Of them, 436 were prosecuted in the one-hour window from 11 pm to midnight while rest of the prosecutions took place after midnight. Around 796 vehicles were stopped and checked for papers from 11pm to midnight while 338 vehicles were checked till the early hours of Sunday. TimesViewMixing drinking with driving, even during normal times, is an act of gross irresponsibility. Cops are now facing an added issue over the use of breathalysers when a transmissible disease is on the prowl. Should we be adding to the problems?The special drive has left several traffic guards worried after they found that drink driving is on the rise at night. What has made their job more difficult is the present restriction on the use of breathalysers due to the fears of contracting Covid-19. Cops said that at least six of the 25 traffic guards had sent around three motorists each for alcohol tests to various hospitals after they got the smell of alcohol. According to police sources, strict prosecutions have taken place for drink driving this month. In around half a dozen instances, the ACPs concerned have recommended the suspension of driving licence for a certain period. The biggest incident at night was reported near South City Mall on Anwar Shah Road as a youth and a woman were allegedly involved in a nuisance under the influence of alcohol at midnight. “We have planned some interventions at specific points in the coming days to curb night violations, breaking of traffic rules, over speeding and drink driving. Our experiences from July and August have been used to select these points,” said an assistant commissioner of police. “Earlier, anyone could be asked to blow through the breathalyser on the basis of a suspicion. But now it has been verbally communicated across the traffic guards that only those with visible signs of intoxication should be subjected to the test to reduce the number of people using the machine,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/drink-driving-on-the-rise-500-booked-for-night-curb-violation/articleshow/85749712.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Retro show recalls artist who straddled rural-urban landscape||Some people are like fleeting angels that capture a particular time, then they vanish and so does that time. Mehlli Gobhai was cosmopolitan, compassionate, understated — in life and in his art. A retrospective of his work, currently on view, spans six glorious decades and tells the story of a man and a fading ethos. Meherwan Minocher Gobhai (1931-2018) was educated at St Xavier’s College and Government College of Law in Mumbai, Royal College of Art in London and the Pratt Graphics Center in New York. He worked in advertising, as art director with J. Walter Thompson for many years. He lived in Manhattan for two decades before returning to Mumbai, where he delighted in its myriad charms — from the Koli fisherfolk to a street puppy — and transcribed this love into his sketches. Gobhai’s studio had 68 such “notebooks”, pages and pages of mostly figure studies done with a fountain pen. The exhibition titled ‘Epiphanies’ focuses on “the key moments of breakthrough in Gobhai’s art” write curators Ranjit Hoskote and Nancy Adajania. The collection includes his celebration of colour (which might surprise those who saw him as a monochromatic brooding abstractionist); the many children’s books which he wrote and illustrated; and his later ‘constructed canvas’ in which he blurred the lines between painting and sculpture. His art is a palimpsest — layer upon meticulous layer of memory, experience and imagination that drew from his multiple loves, including classical music, theatre, animals, mythology, people. As the curators write, “MG was a passionate collector of objects, approaching them, not in the spirit of a fussy connoisseur, but as a rasika whose imagination was open to the energies of rural and everyday art, to the curve of a bronze, the weave of a dhurrie…” An artist’s legacy comprises so much more than a portfolio of canvases. The handsome, eternally chuckling, Gauloise smoking gentleman would engage with young and unknown painters with a rare generosity of spirit. Artist Sheetal Gattani recalls how, when she was 21, veteran artist Prabhakar Barwe suggested she show her work to Gobhai. “He gave me time, he never made me feel like a junior, and the next day he called me and said ‘now when are you are going to come and see my work?’” Gobhai’s gallerist Shireen Gandhy says he made time for everyone. She recounts when he exhibited his collection done on thick Ahmedabad hand-made paper. “This man wandered into Jehangir Art Gallery and said, “why has the packaging not been removed from the paintings?” Says Gandhy. “When I told Mehlli he guffawed…it’s almost as if he really wanted the work to not be high art, to retain a certain rawness. He never brushed off people, and even if they asked silly questions, he didn’t belittle them. You don’t see many artists do that anymore,” she adds. Mehlli Gobhai used a part of his estate to settle his helpers and their families; he supported young painters as well as artisans whom he believed were uncelebrated artists; an annual sum helps children’s causes; and a substantial chunk will go towards an animal welfare hospital in Parel. His dogs Kudi and Ari were cremated there.

---||Lucknow||SP trying to usurp power with mafia muscle: BJP||Lucknow: The induction of former MLA Sibgatullah Ansari, brother of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, into Samajwadi Party has prompted BJP to come up with an assailing video, accusing the Akhilesh Yadav-led political outfit of seeking to “usurp” power in UP by “instilling fear of the mafia among people” in the run-up to assembly polls. The 1.5-minute video also tweeted by UP BJP handle, starts with gunshots reverberating in the background and a photograph of Akhilesh with a message — “Chunav se pehle hi dikhne laga hai Samajwadi Party ka asli khel (The real game of SP is showing even before UP assembly elections)”. The BJP also tweeted: “Satta ki bhookh kya hoti hai ye Akhilesh ji ne dikha diya… jis mafia Mukhtar Ansari ko SP mein shaamil na karane ka naatak kiya tha, aaj satta paane ke lie usi mafia ke parivaar ka haath pakadakar madad maang rahe hain… (Akhilesh has displayed his hunger for power…After the pretence of not embracing Mukhtar Ansari, he’s now holding the hand of the same gangster’s family to return to power). The video profiles Mukhtar Ansari, BSP MLA from Mau, as a don with multiple cases of murder, extortion and land grab against him in the entire Purvanchal region. “Ansari also faces charges under TADA, NSA and MCOCA,” it says, adding SP seems to project itself as a ‘mafia gadh’ (mafia stronghold) by instilling fear among people. Mukhtar is currently lodged in Banda jail. BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said, after Ansari’s brother, one may not be surprised to see SP inching closer to criminals like DP Yadav and Atiq Ahmad. The stinging attack by BJP, not surprisingly rankled SP ranks, who termed it as saffron party’s mendacious attempt to misguide people. “If BJP is pointing at criminal cases against our leaders, what about chief minister Yogi Aditynath and deputy CM Keshav Maurya,” countered Akhilesh aide Udai Bir Singh, while speaking to TOI. He maintained that there were no criminal charges against Sibgatullah Ansari and questioning his credentials was unwarranted. SP spokesperson Juhie Singh tweeted how Ansaris had an illustrious background with their paternal grandfather Dr Mukhtar Ansari being a founding member of Jamia Millia Islamia University and maternal grandfather Usman Ansari had retired from the army as brigadier. The BJP video also highlights the recent controversy stirred by Sambhal MP Shafiq-ur-Rehman Barq, who allegedly drew a parallel between India’s freedom struggle and the takeover of Afghanistan by Taliban. Barq, who faces sedition charge is also accused of deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings and promote enmity between different groups. The incidence of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans being raised during a SP protest at Agra a month ago also finds mention in the video.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sp-trying-to-usurp-power-with-mafia-muscle-bjp/articleshow/85751797.cms||Pankaj Shah

The travels that he kickstarted from Delhi on October 2, 2018, concluded in Goa on August 15. During the ride, he campaigned for road safety by visiting various schools and colleges and educating students to wear helmets. “The approach of most riders towards wearing a helmet is to avoid the challan. This needs to change and during the ride I ensured that I spread the message of road safety by encouraging people to wear a helmet,” he told TOI. “My message to them (in Hindi) was wear your helmet not your luck and we shall cross paths again, either in life or on the road,” he added. Panda claimed to have traversed the expanse of India’s hills and mountains, beaches and deserts, rural and urban areas crossing 200 National Highways and riding through 480 districts. He has also visited over 1,000 academic institutions and connected with nearly 600 biking clubs across the country to spread the message of road safety, he said. After a three-year-long journey across the country, Panda is unwinding in Goa — his last destination — with a month-long break. He is using this time to document his experiences in a series of articles on his upcoming blog. Prior to his journey, the rider had sworn to himself that he would give away his bike to an aspiring motorcyclist after completing the ride.

The morning surveillance is part of a slew of measures taken by cops, including formation of a resistance group with equal participation of residents and policemen, and organising self-defence workshops for women in the township. The extensive security was arranged after there were multiple instances of early morning snatching reported last month. It was followed by complaints from New Town residents about compromised safety after dusk with women raising voice about several incidents of eve teasing, molestation and harassment. “We are glad that the cops have been taking issues raised by us very seriously and have provided us with the much needed safety cover. The presence of the men in uniform on some of the key arteries and lanes used by morning walkers will certainly deter criminals and allow us a peaceful start to the day,” said Samaresh Das, a New Town resident and senior member of New Town residents’ quick response team formed to help women in township during emergency. A similar move has also been initiated by Kolkata Police where officers in uniform have been patrolling morning walk zones like Maidan, Rabindra Sarobar, Alipore Agri-Horticultural Society, Parnasree Lake and Subhas Sarobar along with lanes and stretches in Golf Green and Southern Avenue. “Safety for the residents in the township has always remained our priority. Hence, we have enhanced security along areas where residents come out for their walks,” said a senior official of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. “The cops had given us a patient hearing in the last few meetings and have taken action. They arrested the man who had tormented my daughter at a desolate stretch in New Town two weeks back, have arrested a person who snatched a gold chain from a woman, and agreed to offer self-defence classes to women,” said a woman whose daughter was harassed by a middle aged biker.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-snatching-teasing-cases-cops-to-guard-new-town-walking-zones/articleshow/85749772.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Residents are now urging the government to ensure that the localities are brought under the jurisdiction of the Mysuru city police commissionerate. Taking into view the residents’ demands, police have decided to write to the government seeking extension of Mysuru city police commissioner’s jurisdiction. Mysuru city police commissioner Chandragupta confirmed that a proposal recommending extension of the commissionerate to the newly-developed layouts had been on the anvil for the past five to six years. “We will write to the government about bringing these layouts under the commissionerate,” he said. People had been expecting the government, which recently brought the layouts on the city’s outskirts under the newly formed urban local bodies by merging gram panchayats, to follow suit with the extension of the commissionerate’s jurisdiction, but the latter is yet to happen. Chandragupta said that the cops would step up surveillance and vigilance on the outskirts of the city. “We will ensure maximum security for the people,” he said. Karnataka director general and inspector general of police (DG&IGP) Praveen Sood, meanwhile, held a meeting with senior police officials at breakfast on Sunday. He called on both the city and district police personnel to rid Mysuru of crime by launching new initiatives. Sources said that Sood instructed the senior cops to ensure there were no complaints from the public about inadequate patrolling at night, besides directing them to keep a close watch on the activities of anti-social elements, and police secluded localities more thoroughly. “I have given various tips on improving the system to Mysuru police,” Sood told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/demand-for-extending-city-commissionerates-jurisdiction-grows-louder/articleshow/85747415.cms||---

Seven shops were constructed there and they have been rented out. Eateries are functioning on the land,” an official said. “We plan to send notices to the encroachers and retrieve the land.”Activist S P Thiyagarajan had informed corporation authorities about the encroachment at Vimal Nagar. He urged town planning officials in all the five zones to identify such lands and retrieve them. “Otherwise, there is a high chance that the lands will be sold to innocent people.

Still, many people continue to buy idols made of plaster of paris as they find them more appealing.Non-profit organization So Aware aims to bring back the forgotten tradition of making idols at home by launching Make Your Own Ganesha drive, founder Swarajit Alakananda told TOI. “Making idols at home will bring family members together. It would be a fun-filled activity, where people can realize the joy of doing things together,” he said.The group is planning to distribute clay and a kit required to make idols at a nominal cost. “We plan to distribute 2,500 kits. We can supply more depending on the demand. It would be in addition to activities such as promoting idols made of mud and clay embedded with seeds of plants and trees. We will also promote idols made of fish and bird feed that will be useful for other beings,” Swarajit added.NGO Kovai Kulangal Pathukappu Amaippu is planning to distribute 2,500 idols containing navadhanya (nine auspicious grains), organiser R Manikandan said. “We have urged the district administration to act against use of idols made of plaster of paris.

---||Goa||Romeo Fernandes seals move to SC East Bengal||Panaji: Romeo Fernandes has returned to the top-tier of Indian football, this time with SC East Bengal. The Kolkata giants are building their squad for the Indian Super League (ISL) and have managed to sign several domestic players on the penultimate day of the transfer window. Among their signings is Romeo, the former FC Goa winger who made heads turn during the first three editions of ISL, became the first Indian footballer to play professionally in Brazil and then somehow lost his way. Romeo, 29, donned East Bengal colours in 2016-17, on loan from FC Goa. “This is Romeo’s chance to prove what he can do,” said a source close to the player. “There was always interest from East Bengal and the formalities were completed once his medical reports were clear. He is eager to work his way to the top again.” Romeo was at his best in 2015 when Goa made it to the final and lost against Chennaiyin FC in a nail-biting contest. His performances won him a national call but the winger, citing injury, stayed in Goa after the final. Since then he has not been considered for the national team. For three years now, Romeo has been unable to show the form that made him a household name between 2014 and 2016. In 2017, he was allowed to leave the club by Goa who instead retained Mandar Rao Desai and goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani. Romeo instead joined Delhi Dynamos and later Odisha FC. He got 12 matches and 839 minutes on the field in his first season at the club, but over the next two years, his game-time kept reducing. At the end of his three-year contract in 2020, he found himself without a club and missed out on the last edition of ISL. After a short spell with the developmental side in the Goa Professional League, FC Goa considered him for the AFC Champions League. The Assolna-born winger made his debut against Al Rayyan as a second-half substitute, but with several other players ahead of him on the wings, he was found surplus to requirements this season.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/romeo-fernandes-seals-move-to-sc-east-bengal/articleshow/85779885.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Congress, NCP ask whether Anil Deshmukh got clean chit||MUMBAI: NCP and Congress on Sunday claimed that a “report” circulating on social media has revealed that the Central Bureau of Investigation gave former home minister Anil Deshmukh a clean chit, much before cases were filed against him for corruption and money laundering. The spokesmen of the two parties cited an unsigned, 65-page report purportedly compiled by a CBI officer. “The inquiry conducted has revealed that no cognizable offence has been committed by Anil Deshmukh. In view of the above, it is recommended that this PE be closed,” says the unattested report. However, a senior CBI official denied that Deshmukh had been given a clean chit. He said Bombay High Court ordered registration of a preliminary enquiry (PE) in the matter based on public interest litigations. On completion of the PE, the competent authority directed registration of a regular case based on evidence collected during the PE and legal opinion. Accordingly, a first information report (FIR) was registered by CBI on March 24, 2021. A copy of the FIR filed by CBI against Deshmukh, which TOI has perused, includes the PE’s findings. It says the PE “revealed that a cognisable offence is made out” against Deshmukh for attempting to “obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty.” The FIR and the attached extract from the PE are attested by CBI officials including deputy superintendent R S Gunjiyal. However, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said, “As per the reports, Deshmukh has been given a clean chit…CBI must clarify if the document in circulation is part of the PE report,” Malik said. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant demanded an SC-monitored probe into the case. “CBI has become an agency to target opponents of the Modi-led government. Offences are registered, politicians are booked, but there is absolutely no progress in the probe,” Sawant said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-ncp-ask-whether-deshmukh-got-clean-chit/articleshow/85752703.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Tyagi said such a committee would help maintain coordination among NDA allies and put a brake on unnecessary statements issued by different alliance partners. “When Vajpayee was NDA chairman, George Fernandes used to be its national convener. Fernandes served as NDA convener till 2008. He was replaced by Sharad Yadav, who resigned after JD(U) left the alliance,” a senior JD(U) politician told TOI.

City MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari has also suggested three-level floating restaurant in the water body. Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday performed bhoomipuja of the Rs31.5 crore Gandhisagar Lake Beautification Project. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, MLA Vikas Kumbhare, MLC Pravin Datke and others were present. As per project finalized by the civic body, the auditorium will come up after demolishing Bal Bhavan located near the lake’s bank. The first floor will house a museum, second floor to have a 3D centre and third floor will be for recreational activities. The NMC has proposed to construct a new bridge connecting road with the island-like Pagey garden which will also be renovated. The retaining wall strengthening will be followed by erection of new tall railing to prevent people from committing suicide in the water body. A mini-sewage treatment plant will be set up to release treated sewage water in the lake. A new pavement will be constructed around the lake and other types of beautification works will be done. The project was sanctioned by Fadnavis during his tenure as CM. But the government released only Rs12 crore. NMC will contribute Rs2.9 crore. Tiwari requested Gadkari and Fadnavis to ensure release of funds. Fadnavis said, “Gadkari and me will ensure release of remaining funds,” he said. The leader of opposition in assembly further said that groundwater table of many areas will improve with conservation of Gandhisagar. “During my tenure as mayor and Gadkari as guardian minister, we had planned an excellent project but Heritage Conservation Committee rejected 60% works. Talking about lake’s history, Fadnavis said that Bhonsales used to take boat from Gandhisagar to reach Tekdi Ganesh Mandir. “Unfortunately, the lake area later shrunk,” he said. Stressing desilting of the lake, Gadkari said that NMC must ensure sewage treatment before its release into the water body. He assured help in executing aeration works through an agency in Bengaluru. “If there is no stink, we can plan three-layer floating restaurant on the lake,” he said. The city MP also suggested development of space for landing amphibious seaplane in the lake. “Work for Nag River Pollution Abatement Project, for which Rs2,400 crore has been sanctioned, will start within next two-three months. It will facilitate travel through 4-6 seater water taxi from Ambazari lake to Pardi and Gosikhurd dam,” he said. Tiwari requested Gadkari to link Chitnis Park with flyover planned from Indora Chowk to Sakkardara. Gadkari said that he will sanction Rs150-200 crore for Chitnis Park’s development and NMC should plan a project on the lines of Palika Bazaar of Delhi. “We can plan four-layer basement parking and stadium over it. The revenue earned will help in operation and maintenance of stadium,” he said. The Union minister also suggested development of maintenance and transport hubs outside city limit connecting Outer Ring Road. “This will prevent pollution in city and bring it at par with international benchmarks,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/gandhisagar-to-get-3-storey-auditorium-renovated-garden/articleshow/85749854.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The BJP government would hold its first public meeting in Charminar area near Bhagyalakshmi temple, he claimed. “We are not frightened of anyone. I will once again come to the Old City during the padayatra. We will expose the misrule of TRS and win the next assembly elections,” Bandi told a public gathering at Golconda fort. He claimed AIMIM was opposed to formation of Telangana but TRS was still in partnership with it. “We want Old City to be like Hi-Tec City but TRS works hand-in-hand with MIM,” he said. The state BJP president targeted AIMIM earlier in a speech at Shaikpet too, blaming it for Old City missing out on Metro. While BJP MLA T Raja Singh, who also participated in the padayatra, dubbed AIMIM as anti-Muslim and said, “It never wanted them to develop. But BJP government in Centre is for the growth of all.” Claiming that all funds came from the Centre, Sanjay said the TRS administration was hiding this and bragging about state spending on schemes. “They don’t spend funds for any schemes,” he said. On Huzurabad bypoll, he said that BJP’s Eatala Rajender would win no matter what the TRS did.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bjp-will-win-next-poll-saffron-flag-will-fly-on-golconda-bandi/articleshow/85751283.cms||---

Ravi Patel, the cell president of the farmers’ wing, said that an unidentified group of miscreants approached him when AAP’s Jan Samvedna programme was going on at a party plot in Chikodhra village of Anand district on Saturday afternoon. Patel said that he was asked to come outside the venue of the programme on the pretext that the personal assistant (PA) of a state AAP leader wanted to meet him. He has alleged that the miscreants kept on insisting that Patel should come alone to meet the PA and attempts were made to take him to an isolated area, away from other members of the party and his supporters. The miscreants allegedly issued indirect threats. “The miscreants first identified themselves as those coming from Ahmedabad’s Maninagar area then tried to give reference of some local leaders in Anand. But since my supporters were also present, though at a distance, they could not harm me,” said Patel, adding that the entire group’s behaviour and movement was suspicious.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/miscreants-tried-to-kidnap-me/articleshow/85746810.cms||---

The locations where these rallies have been held can lead to the spread of the virus. Who will be responsible for this outbreak after these rallies?” Pawar said.

---||Nagpur||Unhappy with ‘newcomers’, Shiv Sainik Shekhar Sawarbandhe joins NCP||NAGPUR: Just hours after resigning from Shiv Sena, former deputy mayor and party ex-district president Shekhar Sawarbandhe on Sunday formally entered Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the presence of senior leader Praful Patel. Feeling sidelined in the party due to ‘newcomers’, Sawarbandhe decided to bid goodbye to the party which he had joined in 2002. Speaking to TOI, Sawarbandhe said, “It’s always a tough decision but I am convinced that newcomers, from different parties or those with zero electoral experience, are now calling the shots. This makes the old guard and ground level cadres wonder how much their contribution is valued.” The last 18 months have seen major changes in Nagpur unit of Shiv Sena, with many new appointments to important posts which naturally led to discontent among those who ‘lost out’. Declining influence of Sawarbandhe within the party, led to speculation in political circles about him rebelling. In June, Sawarbandhe made a last ditch attempt by reaching out to senior Sena leaders in Mumbai and apprised them about the situation. Sawarbandhe said, “I met cabinet ministers from our party along with those in the party think-tank. But from their body language I could understand their helplessness and inability to rectify the situation. So rather than create a big scene, I took the decision to quit and join NCP.” Though Sawarbandhe opposed the ‘newcomers’ in Sena, he too will be a newbie in NCP and is likely to face the old guard’s ire. Sawarbandhe said “That’s highly unlikely as I have worked with many of these NCP leaders in the past, so they are my friends.” So has NCP promised him a plum party post ? “I will only play a role in strategizing for local body polls, but I won’t contest myself,” he said. Starting his political career with the Congress in 1992, Sawarbandhe had entered Shiv Sena exactly 10 years later. In 2014 he rebelled after being denied a poll ticket but was back in the party fold soon. This time however, the break-up is final, feels Sawarbandhe. “It reached a point of no return, but I bear no ill-will with any person,” said Sawarbandhe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/unhappy-with-newcomers-shiv-sainik-sawarbandhe-joins-ncp/articleshow/85749932.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Lucknow||Ram Nath Kovind 1st President to offer prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi||AYODHYA: President Ram Nath Kovind kept his tryst with Ayodhya on Sunday, becoming the first President in office to offer prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi, where he said, “while Ayodhya means the land that can’t be conquered, we cannot think of the city without Ram.” Lord Ram permanently resides here and hence in the true sense, this place is Ayodhya, he said. After special prayers at Ram Lalla amidst Vedic chants, a shawl and a miniature replica of the temple were presented to the President, who briefly interacted with priests and planted a sapling in Ramjanmabhoomi. Before visiting the makeshift shrine, he went to Hanumangarhi, where he was presented a pink turban by the chief priest. Earlier, Kovind reached Ayodhya by a special presidential train in the morning. President also inaugurated a Ramayana conclave at Ram Katha Park on the Saryu banks in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Governor Anandiben Patel. Deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya, Dinesh Sharma and Union minister of state for railways Darshana Vikram Jardosh were also present. Referring to his name, the President said, “When my family named me, they possibly had affection towards Ram Katha and Lord Ram, which is seen among the people.” Minister of state for railways, Darshana Jardosh, presenting a model of the upcoming railway station at Ayodhya to President Ram Nath Kovind at Charbagh station in Lucknow on SundayElaborating further on Ayodhya, he said, “The meaning of Ayodhya is one with whome it’s impossible to wage war. Owing to the courage of Raghuvanshi kings Raghu, Dileep, Dashrath and Ram, their capital was considered unconquerable. Therefore, Ayodhya will always remain relevant.”Highlighting the Ram’s love for tribals, the President said, “During his exile, Lord Ram did not summon armies from Ayodhya and Mithila, rather he gathered Kols, Bheels, Vaanars and formed his army. Promotion of values of Ramayana is necessary as these are always relevant. Ramayana contains the model code of conduct which guides us in every aspect of life and it’s a unique epic which presents highest ideals and morals of human life.” He was speaking during the inauguration of Ramayana Conclave and later while laying the foundation of projects of the department of culture and tourism. “I want to quote a chaupai from Ramcharitmanas. Siya Ram-mein sab jag jaani, karau param jor jug paani, which means we should accept the whole world with respect considering it divine. We should see Sita and Ram in every persons. Ram is of everyone & Ram is in everyone,” said Kovind. Referring to projects of the Ramayana circuit developed under the Centre’s ‘Swadesh Darshan Scheme’, he said, these would provide facilities to tourists and pilgrims. The foundation for expansion and renovation of the Tulsi Smarak Bhawan is also an important initiative, which will help in ongoing global research on Ramayana, he said. He also noted that an encyclopedia on Ramayana was being prepared under the aegis of Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan which would be available globally. The President appreciated UP government’s efforts to take Ramayana to the masses through art and culture and Ramayana conclaves.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ram-permanently-resides-in-unconquerable-ayodhya/articleshow/85751958.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Superintendent of police, Barabanki Yamuna Prasad said an FIR had been registered in connection with the case. Chief medical officer, Barabanki, Dr Ramji Verma, told TOI that an unauthorised drive was being carried out in Jaitpur and the district magistrate has ordered a probe. “A four-member team comprising Additional CMO (administration) Dr KNN Tripathi, district immunisation officers Dr Rajiv Kumar Singh and Chatrik Singh and superintendent of CHC Dr Sunil Jaiswal has been formed to probe the incident,” the CMO said.

According to the FIR, the above named journalists got the news that some health workers were carrying out 'unauthorised' vaccination drive in Manpur village around 9 pm on Saturday. When they reached the scene, the group of people who had assembled outside the house of one Anant Kumar Verma attacked the mediapersons for recording the event and asking questions about the legality of the vaccination drive at that point of time. The complainants alleged that the health workers and the villagers snatched their mobile phones, damaged their cameras and looted cash/gold ornaments from some of the mediapersons. “We were locked in a room where the attackers brought kerosene oil to burn all of us.

---||Ludhiana||Farmers make villages out of bounds for politicians||Hathur (Jagraon): In a show of anger against three contentious farm laws, villagers have put up posters in several villagers, asking politicians of various political parties not to carry out any political activity in the villages. This comes at a time when elections in the state are just a few months away. TOI found many such posters in two villages of Jagraon area. The posters have symbols of all major political parties in Punjab with cross on those and text that loosely translates as ‘boycott political parties’. The message said for the past 74 years, those sucking the blood of people and making Punjab debt ridden, who have got five pensions, such politicians and “stray cattle” are strictly banned from entering the village.“Till the black laws are not scrapped, we will not let politician enter the village. If any political leader or his sidekick is found in the village, he will be responsible for his service (sewa),” read the message. The message is issued by Bhartiya Kisan Union and entire villagers of a particular village. General secretary of Inqualabi Kendra Punjab, Kanwaljit Khanna, whose group has been supporting farm movement, said such posters have been put up by villagers in around 35 to 40 villages, including Hathur, Kaunke, Manuke, Deherka, Ghalib Kalan, Sherpura, Johlan, Jalaldiwal, Rattowal and Toose, of Ludhiana district. He said mostly the posters have a message that till the time “black farm laws” are not scrapped, no political party should disturb them in villages, not to deflect their attention as people are struggling to get these laws repealed.Meanwhile, many villagers said the message to everyone is clear.“Our farmer brothers are sitting on the Delhi borders for months now and villagers think that if they protest in such a way, they can also show their support to them. Those who cannot go to Delhi borders, they do it this way. Mostly, the posters have been put up in bigger villages and that too on prominent places, including near gurdwaras or bus stops,” said a villager from Acharwal, where such posters have come up. He said such posters are there in Johlan village as well. Inderjit Singh from Kaunke village said that posters have been put up to mount pressure on politicians so that their demand of scrapping the three “black” farm laws is addressed. Sardara Singh Johal, a renowned agro-economist who has views on political happenings in the state, said farmers are there on the front and they have decided to fight. He said putting up posters is a reaction, which indicates that they are not happy with political class in the state.“They feel that every party is opposed to them. So, they are putting up pressure on the political class to get their grievances addressed. However, things are expected to become clear after elections are announced in the state,” Johal said.Box: Farm Unions speak:Inderjit Dhaliwal, district secretary of BKU (Dakonda), said the farmer unions have already decided that they will not allow BJP leaders to enter villages and will question other party leaders what they did to oppose such “black laws”. He said such posters are being put up by common villagers as a mark of anger. Dhaliwal said political leaders should refrain from election campaign till farmers’ struggle is on as it weakens the agitation. He said they will show black flags to politicians in future as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/farmers-make-villages-out-of-bounds-for-politicians/articleshow/85747630.cms||Shariq Majeed

Jain said the Rohini facility costs around Rs 55 crore, but Delhi government is looking to reduce costs by innovating further. “We will review the project in a month’s time and based on our learnings from its operation, we will plan out the replication of the system for other parts of the city,” he said. “Power cuts have become a history in the national capital because of effective and efficient management by the Kejriwal-led government,” Jain said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-to-create-600mw-network-of-power-banks/articleshow/85750064.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Snakebite victim’s dad cries foul over clean chit to GMC doctors||Nagpur: The internal five-member inquiry panel set up following the death of 10-year-old snake bite victim Adarsh Mishra claimed that the boy’s parents had refused to admit him in a general ward and had demanded a PICU bed which was not available on July 29 night. The panel also found that over 2,500 vials of anti-venom injections were available with the hospital. Adarsh’s father Rakesh, who works as a cook, refuted the claims saying they never signed any consent form for discharge against medical advise, known as DAMA. Rakesh had alleged that IGGMCH, GMCH and four other private hospitals refused to admit Adarsh due to lack of ICU bed and anti-venom injection. This had forced him to travel 41kms from his home to Lata Mangeshkar Hospital (LMH) at Hingna, losing the golden hours. Rakesh said IGGMCH has shrugged off any liability claiming Adarsh was never brought there. “The DAMA papers shown to us don’t have our signatures. We challenged them to take handwriting test to match them. But they said go to court. We asked for CCTV footage, they said the system is shut for three months. Earlier, they claimed the kid was there was 24 minutes at the hospital as per CCTV footage. How is it possible,” he asked. Mishra countered the panel report that they were asked to bring anti-venom from the in-house pharmacy. “Relatives are not allowed to perform official work in GMC,” he said. Mishra demanded an FIR against the guilty for his child’s death and their suspension. Anup Muratakar, vice president, Sambhaji Brigade Nagpur which is supporting the Mishras, said none from the deceased family was called for the panel hearing. “We want a neutral inquiry,” he said. Pankaj Badule, president, wildlife welfare society which too is standing in solidarity with them, said they want two members from their NGO to be part of the probe. Nitesh Bhandakar, secretary of the NGO, said Adarsh was shown admitted till August 10 in GMCH records while he died on August 5 at private hospital. “How can one trust their inquiry and records,” he asked. GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta said they don’t have powers to set up panel of members from outside the medical college. “At a time, the ICUs are full and we can’t vacate bed instantly. Yet, the patient was given admission in Ward Number 6 and treatment was offered. We don’t know why the parents took discharge. Anti-venom vials were available and the relative were asked to only bring it from another department,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/snakebite-victims-dad-cries-foul-over-clean-chit-to-gmc-doctors/articleshow/85750049.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Rs 51 crore booze got to Maharashtra without tax since lockdown-2||MUMBAI: During and post lockdown 2 this year the amount of illegally traded (without taxes) branded liquor in the state, besides spurious and illicit liquor, has been huge, said the excise police. The value of such liquors seized between April and July this year is Rs 51.20 crore as compared to Rs33.05cr seized in same period last year and Rs35.07crore seized in 2019. According to state excise officials, such a rise in amount of seizure this year is mainly due to illegally traded branded liquor from Goa and Gujarat borders besides confiscation of illicit and spurious liquor. Last year, number of cases registered by excise police and that of those arrested for committing such crimes had dipped but this year it has bounced back to pre-Covid days (2019). The number of seizures claimed by illegal stock owners has risen too over last year. Admitting that during and post-lockdown, illegally traded (without paying taxes) branded liquor from across Goa and Gujarat borders was caught more, excise commissioner Kantilal Umap said the department has tightened its grip on all entry and exit points in the state. “For our staff, we issued circulars and guiding principles regarding intensifying traps, conducting seizure actions and tracking illegal trade and business. We also set targets for them. We got enough time to do this homework and groundwork during the long lockdown period last year,” he said. Sources said that the excise police demolished at least two manufacturing units of spurious liquor and seized vehicles carrying illicit and illegally traded liquor from across the borders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rs-51cr-booze-got-to-maharashtra-state-without-tax-since-lockdown-2/articleshow/85752730.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

But the new menace, say teachers, is early and primary learners being fed during online classes. A survey of parents and teachers revealed that the virtual screen is the new ‘idiot box’. Over 65% of parents said they feed their children during online class. Teachers surveyed said that over 55% students in the virtual class eat at the same time. At least 25% of surveyed parents were happy to feed hot meals to their children, who otherwise carried cold food in tiffin boxes. Also, 7% of teachers admitted to eating meals during class. “This year children and parents know the online drill. Now parents keep feeding children during school hours,” said a teacher of class 3. Around 20% teachers said they waste time admonishing kids eating during class. At least 22% teachers felt they fear children can choke on their food as the feeding happens when the child is involved in some school activity.  Dr Swati Vats, president, Early Childhood Association and Association for Primary Education and Research, that surveyed 1,500 parents and 700 teachers said, “Parents say virtual learning time clashes with the child’s eating time or the sessions are too long, leaving the child hungry.” Dr Samir Dalwai, member of the state’s Covidpediatrictask force, said, “Earlier, it was the television, now it has graduated to the virtual classroom as well. The real problem will arise when parents have to send children back to school.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/65-kids-fed-during-online-class-but-7-teachers-too-tuck-in-mumbai/articleshow/85752119.cms||Sandhya Nair

The murder is likely to have taken place over a romantic relationship, said police. The monk, identified as Dhammanand Therro alias Ramdas Meshram, 58, murdered a fellow Buddhist monk Shramniri Buddapriya alias Kusum Chavan, 45, following a heated argument after spotting some “objectionable” messages in her mobile phone. Therro later tried to hang himself to death from the ceiling fan but the rope snapped. After suffering a fall, he rushed out to take a plunge into a well to end his life after the murder. Police said he was spotted and fished out of the well by onlookers, who raised an alarm and alerted Khaparkheda police. It's learnt that Therro and Buddapriya had been in a live-in relationship for 12 years and were staying at the monastery where the incident took place. According to police sources, Buddapriya had left her family to join the monastery and Therro too had married children at home. Police said Therro confronted Buddapriya after he came across messages from some other men in her mobile phone. During the heated argument, Buddapriya is learnt to have questioned Ferro about his manhood, after which matters worsened. Senior inspector PM Bhatkar from Khaparkheda police station said the monk’s doubting the moral character of the victim aggravated the fight between them. "Meshram was taken into custody from the spot after he admitted to the murder," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/buddhist-monk-stabs-hammers-fellow-preacher-to-death/articleshow/85750108.cms||Soumitra Bose

The committee formed to raise money for the treatment of Mohammed Qasim said that they received Rs 17.3 crore in the bank accounts till Sunday afternoon, including the Rs 8.5 crore they will get from the excess amount collected for the treatment of the Mattool child. “The fund collection target of Rs 18 crore will be crossed if the amounts raised locally are deposited in the account,” said the committee’s chairperson Sunija Balakrishnan. The committee had asked people not to send money to the bank account which they will be closing on Monday following the winding up of the fund collection drive. She said that the committee had started the fund collection drive on July 17. Though the donations were slow at the beginning, after the Mattool Mohammed treatment committee announced their Rs 8.5 crore support, flow of donations picked up pace. Qasim will turn two on September 26. The earlier crowdfunding drive for SMA treatment of Mattool kid Mohammed had been a huge success with donations of Rs 46.7 crore flowing into the bank accounts instead of the Rs 18 crore they had hoped to collect. The committee had decided to hand over the excess fund to the treatment of other SMA-affected kids, including Rs 8.5 crore for treatment of Qasim. Mohammed was administered the imported gene therapy drug at Aster MIMS hospital on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/rs-18cr-raised-for-another-kannur-kids-treatment/articleshow/85747677.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Despite many Olympic medals, Haryana is yet to strengthen sporting facilities in villages||ROHTAK: Much has been said about lack of sporting facilities in Haryana, probably as much as its sporting talent. From Olympic gold medallist Neeraj Chopra to wrestlers Ravi Dahiya and Bajrang Poonia, who won Olympic silver and bronze medals respectively, all started their journey from the hinterland of Haryana, and worked their way up with sheer will despite lack of institutional help. For instance, Dahiya, a resident of Nahari village in Sonipat, and Poonia, a resident of Khudan village in Jhajjar, moved to Delhi because of a lack of infrastructure in their villages. Both practised at Chhatrasal stadium in Delhi, while their parents would travel in buses to bring them butter, ghee and milk from their villages. In Rajiv Gandhi sports stadium, there are no coaches, no sports equipment One would think things will change after Olympic glory, but forget countless other villages, when it comes to infrastructure, nothing has changed even in the villages of Dahiya and Poonia, despite the fact that Olympic wins have hundreds of budding wrestlers dreaming of international success and willing to work as hard as it takes to reach there. With the government waking up only when medals come, the onus of developing sports infra seems to have fallen on the shoulders of individuals – Dahiya recently announced he will donate Rs 15 lakh so that wrestlers in his village do not have to face hardships as he had in his initial days. Incomplete stadium at Sakshi malik nameRakesh Dahiya, his father, said there is no proper stadium or any sports facilities in their village, forcing career-oriented sportspersons to rush to Delhi. “Ravi’s medal may bring some respite to young players as the Haryana government has announced some sports facilities in our village,” he added. Khudan village’s Mintu Pehalwan, a family member of Olympic bronze medallist Poonia, said in his village there’s a stadium, but no real facilities. “Inside the stadium, there is no proper gymnasium or other facilities. It is not even maintained properly. Due to the pressure from budding sportspersons, the village panchayat arranged light, water and other facilities at their own level. The state government has no role in it,” he added. Thick bushes grown at Rajiv Gandhi sports stadium in Karontha village of Rohtak district.Joginder Sharma, panch from Khandra village in Panipat district, the native village of gold medallist Chopra, said there are no government facilities in their village too. “We do not have any facilities like a stadium as of now. Those who want to focus on sports, have to travel 15km to Panipat city,” he said. But now that Chopra has won a gold, the village hopes that the government will develop sporting facilities here, he added. Sakshi Malik Stadium incompleteThe seriousness of the Haryana government towards developing the state’s sporting infrastructure can be gauged from the half-completed Sakshi Malik Stadium. When Malik won a medal at Rio Olympic, Haryana government jumped into the celebration frenzy with a promise of a stadium in the name of Malik in her native village, Mokhra, in Rohtak district. The stadium hit a road block and now, even after more than four years, it remains incomplete and battles for funds. Ram Kishan Mokhra, a resident of the village who is overseeing the construction of the stadium, said it should have been built in 2016 but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government forgot about it after the announcement. “When we continuously brought it up, the BJP-Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) government started work on it at snail’s pace after coming to power in 2019. But now as the payment of the contractor is unpaid, work has again come to a standstill,” he added. Sports dept respondsHaryana sports department deputy director Sunita Khatri told TOI that the department had plans to ramp up facilities at the grassroots, but it was delayed due to Covid-19. “Sports minister Sandeep Singh has promised 400 sports nurseries in the state to catch talent at young stage,” she said. On the delay in Olympic bronze medalist Sakshi Malik stadium at Mokhra village, she said the department had already issued Rs 5 crore to the PWD department but they had not spent it yet. They had been sent reminder to spend the amount and construct the stadium as early as possible, she added. As for the sports stadiums in villages, she said the department was in the process of taking control of all stadiums from the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran and provide coaches and other facilities there.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/despite-many-oly-medals-hry-is-yet-to-strengthen-sporting-facilities-in-villages/articleshow/85752189.cms||Sat Singh
---||Delhi||East Delhi civic body rolls back proposal to increase property tax for shops||NEW DELHI: Giving relief to hundreds of shopkeepers in local and commercial shopping complexes, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to roll back the recommendation of the third Municipal Valuation Committee regarding an increase in property tax. The committee in its report had suggested changing the category of such markets from D to A, which meant the unit area value would have increased from Rs 320 per square metre to 630 per sqm. It had also suggested a change in the commercial factor use from 4 to 6, which would have increased the property tax by almost five times. “We opposed the increase because neither had there been any change in the status of these shops, nor had any major development work been done in and around them. Also, these are small shops located in open spaces and not in airconditioned malls. Their revenue had also decreased during the pandemic,” the proposal presented in the House meeting by councillors stated. Bir Singh Panwar, EDMC standing committee chairman, said, “Since properties in other categories supposed to be affected by the implementation of the MVC-III report were given rebates a long time ago and there was almost a 100% decrease in property tax, in this case also we suggested giving relief. The increase in taxes for local and commercial shopping complexes was rolled back. We will continue to charge property tax at the existing rates.” However, an official said while the deliberative wing had approved the private proposal in the House meeting, the commissioner’s approval was mandatory before its implementation. “The decision for giving relief will be implemented only after the commissioner gives the nod. A notification will be issued in this regard,” added the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/east-corpn-rolls-back-proposal-to-increase-property-tax-for-shops/articleshow/85750213.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Kochi||Kerala: Get ready to pay more toll at Paliyekkara||THRISSUR: Notwithstanding the Covid-induced slowdown in transport sector, authorities at Paliyekkara toll plaza announced that the fee being collected on the Mannuthy-Angamaly stretch of the national highway will be hiked by a sum of Rs 5 to Rs 50 and the new toll will come into effect on Wednesday. According to official sources, the toll for van, car and jeep will go up from Rs 75 to Rs 80 for a one-way trip. For multiple trips, the toll will go up from Rs 110 to Rs 120. The monthly toll will see a hike from Rs 10 to Rs 50. The decision also evoked criticisms from various quarters. Congress district vice-president Joseph Tajet termed it illegal and unjust. He said that National Highways (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules stated that a hike of 3% over the current rate is permitted. “But, the toll collection company has been enforcing a higher sum, violating rules. The increase now is around 6.6%,” said Tajet, who has been running a series of campaigns against the alleged violations in toll collection. According to studies conducted by National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac), the transport sector in Kerala faced a loss of Rs 228 crore/day in April 2021. Natpac director Samson Mathew said the loss figure is inclusive of the loss in goods and transport sectors together, and it was calculated after taking into account the total number of vehicles and their average revenue. The loss went up to Rs 263 crore/day in May and June, he added. The statement of All India Motor Transport Congress leader Bal Malkit Singh says the sector is facing a loss of Rs 315 crore/day due to Covid restrictions in India. He was probably talking about the goods vehicle sector alone, Tajet said. He said enforcing another hike in toll will further crush the sector which is already facing a crisis. Government which claimed the credit for the recent opening of Kuthiran tunnel should use its powers (envisaged in highway construction agreement) to block this illegal hike in toll, instead of passing this responsibility to the Centre alone. State president of Lorry Owners’ Confederation advocate PK John said lorry owners have already given representations to central leaders, including Nitin Gadkari, against the toll hike.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/get-ready-to-pay-more-toll-at-paliyekkara/articleshow/85747771.cms||T Ramavarman

He was initially treated at the District Combined Hospital in Ghaziabad, but was referred to AIIMS in Delhi when doctors could not find any major issue with his eyes. They have said his is more of a “psychological” problem. Sunny, a resident of Shahpur Morta, took his first dose of Covishield at a vaccination centre in the locality itself. In the evening, he started complaining of partial loss of vision. At night, he told his family he could not see anything. He was taken to the District Combined Hospital, but doctors in the emergency ward referred him to GTB Hospital in Delhi. Sunny’s cousin Sonu Kashyap said they did not go to the Delhi hospital and instead got him home. “On Saturday morning, we took him again to the Combined Hospital, where a doctor conducted some initial tests, but could not say what the problem was. This time, he was referred to AIIMS,” Sonu said. At AIIMS, doctors advised an MRI and a few blood tests and asked them to come back on Sunday. However, they did not go to the hospital on Sunday, though he continued to complain of blindness. Sonu said they would now go to Delhi on Tuesday as it was Janmashtami on Monday. Dr Sanjay Teotia, the chief medical superintendent of the Combined Hospital, said, “No major issue was found with his eyes. But as he continued to complain about the problem, he was referred to a higher centre and sent in an ambulance. His problem looks more of a psychological one than physiological.” Dr GP Mathuria, the nodal officer for the vaccination drive in Ghaziabad who is monitoring the case, said, “It is quite unlikely that the problem is because of the vaccine. We are waiting for the final report. Only then we can comment.” Dr Mathuria pointed out there has hardly been any case of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) in Ghaziabad. The AEFI percentage in the district, which has administered 19.6 lakh doses so far, is 0.001%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/man-takes-first-shot-complains-of-loss-of-vision-hours-later/articleshow/85752147.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Ghaziabad||Over 100 oxygen cylinders went missing in 2nd wave: Ghaziabad hospital||GHAZIABAD: More than 100 oxygen cylinders went missing from the District Combined Hospital, an L2 facility, during the second Covid wave in April-May. The matter came to light after an internal investigation conducted last month. A report was prepared and the hospital management approached the local police station with a list of 535 patients who were admitted to the hospital during that period. Recently, an FIR has been lodged in the case. It is feared that many patients’ attendants took away oxygen cylinders from the 100-bed Covid facility. The chief medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr Sanjay Teotia, told TOI that half of the missing cylinders have been traced to a private vendor who supplied oxygen to the facility during that period. In April-May, there was a widespread crisis of hospital beds and oxygen supply and attendants of several Covid patients had to arrange for cylinders on their own. There have been instances when agitated relatives of patients have clashed with hospital staff during arguments over lack of critical care. On a few occasions, Dr Teotia was also manhandled at the hospital. CCTV footage has revealed that while no attendants were allowed in the Covid wards, several relatives of Covid patients admitted to the hospital had been staying on the premises, sometimes for days together. “During the second Covid wave, there were more patients in the hospital than the 100 beds and the number of attendants was even more. They did not listen to the staff on duty and stayed inside despite being asked not to. No police force was present in the hospital,” the investigation team report has stated. According to officials, although the issue had been taken up with the then senior superintendent of police, no force was provided. A police team was deployed around the second week of May, they added. Kusum Chopra, an assistant nursing superintendent at the hospital, informed officials on July 8 that 82 D-type oxygen cylinders and 22 B-type cylinders were missing from the facility. On the basis of a written complaint from Chopra, a team of five members, including the hospital’s senior doctors and the matron, was formed by Dr Teotia to conduct an enquiry and submit a report. The investigation team submitted its report on August 12 and its findings said the hospital’s oxygen supplier and patients’ attendants were responsible for the missing cylinders. It has also questioned the role of the hospital staff managing the wards during that time and alleged negligence on their part. “While an FIR has been lodged in the matter, departmental action has been recommended against the hospital staff,” Dr Teotia said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/over-100-o2-cylinders-went-missing-in-2nd-wave-hosp/articleshow/85752126.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Schools’ consent form irks parents||HYDERABAD: As managements gear up for physical classes from September 1, consent forms being circulated by some schools, absolving themselves from taking any responsibility for the students’ health, has irked parents. Following the Telangana government’s orders, many schools have started sending consent forms to parents to know what percentage of them were ready to send their children back to school. In few such forms accessed by TOI, schools have clearly refused to take any responsibility for the health of the students. In one such form, circulated by a school based in Begumpet, the management has not only asked parents to take responsibility for Covid-19 but also for other diseases such as dengue and malaria. Not just that, it binds parents with legal responsibility if students or staff, knowingly or unknowingly, get infected. “Parent voluntarily agrees to assume all of the foregoing risks and accept sole responsibility for any infection or injury from any communicable disease such as Covid-19, dengue, malaria etc. to the student, or student’s family or friends, or anyone who has contact with such persons,” it reads. Schools admit that almost 70% parents have not consented to send their children to school for physical classes. “We also are yet to receive detailed instruction by the education department, on whether it is essential to discontinue the online classes if the physical school starts or to continue with them simultaneously along with physical classes,” stated authorities from the Jubilee Hills Public School in a letter to all the parents. Upset parents say that the consent form does not instil any confidence in them as far as the safety of students is concerned. “Why would I want to send my child to school if the management is holding me and the child responsible for all the actions? Students’ safety is an equal partnership between the parents and the school management. None of us can solely hold the other responsible for it,” said Dinesh Sharma (name changed), a parent. In another case, an Abids-based school has sought a declaration from parents stating that they are sending their child to school at their “own risk and responsibility” and “will not hold the school responsible” for their child’s health. School managements argue that the consent form has been drafted following government orders. “We have had past experiences where the parents blamed the school managements for infecting their child. While we are taking all necessary precautions, parents also need to keep a close watch on the child’s activities,” said a city-school principal. Meanwhile, a PIL has been filed in the Telangana High Court challenging the government’s decision to reopen schools from September 1.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/schools-consent-form-irks-parents/articleshow/85752748.cms||Preeti Biswas

Driven by dry fruits supplies from Afghanistan, the market is left bleeding with the political turmoil putting a stop on shipments. Result: A steep 40% to 50% escalation in cost of these products. In some cases, the prices have even doubled. Prior to the crisis, about 500 to 700 tonnes of various dry fruits and spices including pistachio, fig (anjeer), green raisins, black raisins, apricots, almonds and shah jeera (caraway seeds) was offloaded in Hyderabad’s local market every month. It travelled here from Afghanistan via Pakistan and Delhi. But while a kg of fig, for instance, was available for Rs 650 until July, its now costs anywhere between Rs 900 and Rs 1,400 a kg. Apricots (black) too have seen a jump in rates — from Rs 300 a kg to Rs 500 to 700 a kg. “This is because the dry fruit business has been ailing for the past one month. With the supply chain broken, price of nuts has shot through the roof,” said Mukesh Sankla, a leading dry fruit trader at Begum Bazar. An another wholesaler, Raj Kumar, of ‘Kashmir House’, who has been in the business since pre-Independence admitted to a “disruption in supply”, especially over the last 10-15 days Claiming that the over 85% of the city’s dry fruit supply comes from Afghanistan, another trader from Banjara Hills said how the stalling of cargo movement through transit routes in Pakistan has severely impacted the business that already suffered the Covid-19 blow and was slowly recuperating following a one-and-half-year long slowdown. The price rise has come to haunt consumers who feel that dry fruits are fast becoming unaffordable.The price rise has come to haunt consumers who feel that dry fruits are fast becoming unaffordable. “Several health experts, post the pandemic, have been suggested that patients consume nuts like almonds and pistachio to boost their immunity. But if the prices continue to soar like this, it will be impossible to afford them,” said G Rajendra Kumar, a Covid-19 recovered patient. To increase their sales many vendors have started selling dry fruits through mobile vans now. They can are found driving through residential colonies like Kukatpally, Ameerpet, S R Nagar, Secunderabad, L B Nagar among others.

The Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTC) is in the process of signing an MoU with the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) to bring 40 EVs that will operate in Panaji and a few peripheral areas. “The buses will be purchased by the CCP through Smart City while the maintenance and operations will be managed by the KTC. We are planning to set up charging stations either in Dona Paula or near the Goa University,” KTC general manager, Sanjay Ghate told TOI. The EVs will be low-floored buses that can be easily accessed by members of the disabled community. The KTC is likely to float a tender for the vehicles. Smart bus shelters are also going to be put up for commuters where tickets will be also generated. So far, the KTC has identified 36 locations across Panaji where these bus stops will be set up. “Throughout India many are now opting for EVs to bring down carbon emissions in view of which we are also adopting this initiative. We need a partner to run the buses, so talks are on with the KTC to operate them for us,” said deputy mayor, Vasant Agshikar He further said that the route has been planned through prominent parts of the city “so that people do not have to walk much to get a bus”. The modalities like bus timings, fares, etc, are currently being worked out. The buses are most likely to follow a ring route wherein they will start from the Kadamba bus terminus in Panaji and travel till Dona Paula. Instead of turning back, like the private buses on this route, the EVs will move forward to the Goa University and take the route from Bambolim to return to the Kadamba bus terminus in Panaji.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ktc-to-partner-with-ccp-to-operate-e-buses-in-panaji/articleshow/85750371.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Patna||Caste census beneficial for all sections of people: Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Reiterating the demand of caste-based census, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday said a countrywide caste data of population would give an impetus to development of all. Addressing the JD(U) national council meeting here, Nitish said, “The caste-wise enumeration of population during census-2021 is very necessary. The caste-wise data will be beneficial for all people. If we get a caste-wise break-up of population, it will give an impetus to development of all castes.” He also said some people were spreading rumours about the caste-based census. “It is not against anyone. It is in the interest of all,” Nitish said amid supportive applause from the party leaders and workers. Speaking on the controversial issue of population control law, Nitish said, “If other states want to bring a legislation, they can do so. We in Bihar are educating our girls to control the birth rate. Educating our girls is very necessary to put a check on the child birth rate. Right from providing cycles to the schoolgoing girls to the provisions of 35% reservation for women in the government jobs and 50% quota for women in panchayat bodies, I have done several things for empowerment of women in Bihar.” Nitish further called upon the party leaders to work unitedly to make the JD(U) a national party. He said, “To achieve this goal, the party would have to get the status of a ‘state party’ in at least four states. Currently, we have the status of a ‘state party’ in two states. We have to take a pledge to make the JD(U) a national party.” He also said all senior party leaders should visit other states for the expansion and strengthening of the organization. “If required, I too will visit other states,” Nitish said. Around 250 delegates from 23 states and all senior leaders of JD(U) attended the national council meeting which ratified all the eight resolutions which were passed by the party’s national executive committee in Delhi on July 31. “Besides ratifying the nomination of Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh as the party’s national president, the national council meeting also approved the party’s resolution demanding a caste-wise census across the country,” JD(U) national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan told TOI on Sunday. Speaking on the occasion, JD(U) chief Lalan Singh said no people or political party should have problem if any political workers say that CM Nitish Kumar has all the qualities of becoming the prime minister and our CM is a PM material. Lalan said Nitish has all the qualities of becoming a prime minister, but he is not a candidate for the PM’s post. “There is a difference between ‘having all qualities of PM’ and ‘being a candidate for the post of PM’,” he said, apparently responding to a recent statement from a BJP leader who said there was no vacancy for the PM’s post in the country. Lalan also called for making the JD(U) number one party in Bihar by surpassing the electoral data of 2010 assembly polls. He also asked the party workers to work for achieving the status of a national party for the JD(U). Union steel minister RCP Singh, party’s parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha and many other leaders also addressed the national council meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/caste-census-beneficial-for-all-sections-of-people-nitish/articleshow/85747826.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: 3.5kg more tiger bones seized, fifth poaching accused surrenders||NAGPUR: Deolapar tiger poaching case has turned murkier after Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Maharashtra, officials seized another 3.5kg bones on Sunday. The seizure not only exposes wider links to the poaching racket, but also raises a question mark over tiger protection in territorial forest areas in the region. On August 25, in a joint operation by officials from Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Central Region, Jabalpur, Nagpur forest division, and Seoni circle, MP, had arrested Balchand Warkhade of Sitapur in Ramtek, and seized 8.5kg tiger bones from him near Khawasa border when he was trying to strike a deal. Based on Warkhade’s statement, two more accused Roshan Uikey and Narpat Kodwate of Pindkapar were arrested on August 26 and two rifles used to kill tigers and other wild animals were seized. The teams also seized deer horns and body parts of other animals. On August 27, one more accused Kailash Bhalavi from Banera was arrested. “We were tracking Bhalavi’s nephew Rahul for the past three days. Finally, he surrendered on Sunday. Rahul used to assist Kailash in the crime. The seized bones seem to be from the tiger that must have been killed in Pindkapar area,” said Pench ACF Atul Deokar. With this, the total number of accused in the case has gone up to 5. Talking to TOI, Seoni sub-divisional forest officer SK Johari said, “The seizure seems to be part of a major local poaching gang involved in killing tigers and selling body parts. Every arrested person is a link to other gang members. They have confessed to have killed tigers and wild animals in the forest on Maharashtra side. The gang seems to be big one.” Even as the accused have been handed over to Madhya Pradesh counterparts, Maharashtra forest officials should take custody of the accused to expose the bigger racket and links, say experts. In the last month alone, three cases of tiger poaching have been exposed. On August 28, four persons were arrested by ACF Narendra Chandewar and his team, and seized one tiger nail and canine. The accused have been remanded in forest custody (FCR) till September 3. The poached tiger may be from Tadoba buffer. On July 30, a man from MP was arrested by Nagpur forest officials and recovered tiger skin and four paws from him. In 2013, forest department had exposed major organized gangs of Bahelia poachers involved in killing of at least 25 tigers in the region. Later, in June-July 2017, Pench officials had arrested 17 people and seized 12kg bones and 13 nails from 17 accused. The case died a natural death. Nitin Desai, central India director, Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), said, “Presently, organized gangs are not active. These are local poachers looking for prospective customers.” Senior forest officers say, “The gang must be active for long and maybe in possession of more body parts. Due to financial crisis owing to Covid lockdown, the gang must be looking for buyers through middlemen.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/3-5kg-more-tiger-bones-seized-5th-poaching-accused-surrenders/articleshow/85750316.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Nearly 8.4 hectare of the total 250 hectares of the scheme falls in the flood line. The scheme which has been stuck for the last four years may gain momentum once the government approves the proposal, PMRDA officials said. The PMRDA which has been declared as the Special Planning Authority (SPA) for the scheme, sent the changes in the earlier plan on July 1 under section 92 of the MRTP Act. The proposed scheme has nearly 5,800 beneficiaries and was launched in 2018. The scheme enables the landowners to get back 50% of developed land in the same area. Officials said they had to make variations in the scheme as nearly around 26 plots were falling in the flood line and this had to be re-adjusted. “Seventeen plots in Mann and nine in Mhalunge were in the flood line area as per the earlier proposal which was objected to. The corrections were made and sent to the state government for approval. The CM is the chairman of the PMRDA and his approval will be required,” the officials said. The scheme was launched in 2018 as ideal for town planning. Authorities feel that if the state government speeds up the clearances then the scheme which has been pending for the last three years will gather momentum. “The last 16 months have gone by in the pandemic. Now, there is variation. Once the government clears it, then the process of intention followed by suggestions and objections and other clearances can be received,“ the official shared. The execution of the project will pave the way for more proposed townships. Avtade Handewadi, Wadachiwadi, Holkarwadi and Manjari and 26 more town planning schemes have been proposed in the PMRDA’s draft DP. The projects are based on the Ahmedabad town planning scheme under which 78 townships have been developed over 10 years. The present ring road can cater to 50 townships, the official said. Challenges include maintaining communication with the villagers. The schemes have been proposed in an effort to make the 128-km ring road project self-sustainable with planned development in the area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/state-may-clear-changes-in-mann-mhalunge-tp-scheme/articleshow/85747943.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Frequent commuters on the stretch and locals have said that despite several complaints being lodged, not much has been done to rectify the overflowing drain in the locality. “Moderate to heavy rain just makes the problem worse on the busy stretch and causes a lot of inconvenience for the public. Despite this, no initiative has been taken to address the problem,” said Mohammed Munawwar, a resident of Mustaidpura, adding that the filth and stench makes passing through the road a bitter experience. “The overflowing drain has been a matter of concern for several months now and multiple complaints have been made but nothing has been done so far. In view of the rainy weather and the unsanitary conditions, we residents have come forward to resolve the issue using our own money,” said Munawwar said. Meanwhile, some locals said that they had been assured that the problem would be rectified within two months but no action was taken. With cases of dengue and malaria also rearing their heads, locals are also concerned about the spread of such vector-borne disease in the area as a result of the sanitation problems. “A likelihood of viral diseases makes the matter worse here. Many fall ill and have to be moved to hospitals frequently. The matter should be taken seriously by GHMC and health department,’’ said Samad, another resident of the locality.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/as-muck-rises-in-mustaidpura-locals-raise-a-stink/articleshow/85750404.cms||---

---||Chennai||Up close and personal with Rivaldo||By Priya DavidarGrowing up in the Nilgiris in the 1960s in our jungle home called Cheetal Walk located in the Sigur plateau, we came across many elephants, predominantly adult males, huge and formidable, with differing personalities from mild to aggressive. We got to know some of them well, and one among them was Bumpty, an amiable elephant who became sort of a friend. We became like the tribals, who would know their elephants well -- whom to avoid and who was friendly. Sadly, almost all these elephants fell victim to ivory poaching between the 1970s and 1990s.When my brother Mark decided to set up his home in Cheetal Walk in the mid-1980s, elephants were scarce. Sometime in the late 1990s and 2000s, he was often visited by curious young males, some of whom started sniffing him through the open windows. Young elephants, being curious, would come around the house often to explore. Mark observed that they liked to play with strange objects and kept a few car tyres for them to kick. They seemed to enjoy it so much that Mark began naming them after his favourite Brazilian football icons -— Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos and Kaka.When we moved into the house after Mark’s illness, we became familiar with those elephants. Mark passed away in 2013. We continued to get visits from the elephants, but we have a policy not to interact with them, not even to feed, as it makes elephants addicted to refined food, which can spell trouble.We know Rivaldo from the mid-2000s. He has always been a gentle being, a bit like the Bumpty of our youth. Rivaldo had lost a part of his trunk early in 2013 and he was treated on our premises by a veterinary team of the Tamil Nadu forest department. He was fed fruits embedded with medications. After his trunk healed he was still around looking for handouts. The veterinary team started him on rough forage far from the house and eventually stopped the provisioning, after which he gradually reduced his visits to the house.After three months his visits became sporadic and he foraged in the wild. He was wounded again by a wild tusker in 2015, and the same pattern followed. Based on these observations we wrote an article in Gajah, a newsletter of the IUCN Asian Elephant Specialist Group. In general, public and specialists are of the opinion that elephants cannot be rehabilitated if they taste human food. African elephants were shot if they started depending on human provisions. We showed otherwise. Elephants, with their intelligence and complex behaviour, are able to learn. This capacity for behavioural flexibility also helps them change their behaviour. In which case, shooting and translocating them are unnecessary and cruel.To de-habituate elephants it’s important not to feed them. Of course, it’s a different story when elephants live near farmlands. But there again, solutions need to be found to promote coexistence. Unfortunately, this pattern was reversed as Rivaldo was majestic, docile and amiable, he attained a celebrity status. Feeding Rivaldo became part of the tourist circuit in the region, and a great money spinner. He knew he could get fruits easily from people and so he went into villages and started begging for fruits. He was mostly tolerated, although local youth would sometimes stone him, which once caused him to lose an eye.His real problems began when he entered a gated community outside a village. One of the residents began campaigning for his captivity based on the premise that he was disabled and unable to survive in the wild, even though he had survived in the wild with his disability for eight years. This plan was hurriedly taken up by the former field director and a kraal was built outside a village, and through inducements of fruit and sugarcane, Rivaldo was captured on May 5, 2021.A fierce campaign resulted, with the intervention of celebrities such as Maneka Gandhi. Meanwhile the government had changed and the newly appointed forest secretary and chief wildlife warden ordered the elephant’s release. The field director organised a translocation and released him in Mudumalai. As he belonged to the Sigur range, adjacent to Mudumalai, he returned home within a few days and started looking for fruits in the sites where he had been fed. Elephants have a home range, and tend to stay within it, where the resources are available and other elephants are familiar. So, Rivaldo not only returned home but also went to the place where he had been fed by people for almost a year. This behaviour is like a child’s looking for sweets where he/she knows it’s available.Fortunately, the locals were warned not to feed him. Two kumkis were employed to prevent him from entering villages. This worked well and Rivaldo was next seen happily foraging in the wild and meeting with other elephants. He seemed to have found his place again.As we have been working on elephant biology, and had used DNA fingerprinting to assess relationships, we understood that most of the elephants that hung around our premises, both males and families, were related. Adult males are usually solitary and also sporadically associated with herds and other males. Recent studies have shed new light on their complex social networks.In the Anthropocene, many wild species are likely to go extinct, which has caused a growing global acknowledgment of the moral value of species and ecosystems, and support for animal justice and understanding of our responsibility towards other forms of life.Maybe Rivaldo the elephant has become another symbol, that of a new era where we humans finally recognise the right of elephants and other wildlife to live safely in their environment, free from human interference.(The writer is a conservation biologist)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/up-close-and-personal-with-rivaldo/articleshow/85750380.cms||---

Of the injured, the condition of five, including 4 minors, is critical. The minors have been identified as Alina Ansari (5), Faiyaz Ansari (16), Attazam Ansari (4) and Sonu Jaiswal (8). “Five patients are critical and have been put on ventilator. Of them, two have suffered more than 70% burns,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion Hospital. A few have sustained fractures and may require surgeries, which would be carried out in a few days. The remaining patients have sustained 25%-30% burns, but most are stable. All have been admitted to ward 15, said hospital authorities. Two fire engines, one jumbo water tanker and a team of civic and police officials reached the site immediately. All the injured were rescued and rushed to Sion Hospital. Officials said the leaking cylinder was left unattended outside on the road and suddenly caught fire. It was finally extinguished by 12.50pm. “Someone may have dropped a lit cigarette beside the cylinder which led to the blast, and people walking past the narrow lane got caught in the flames,” said a civic official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-17-hurt-in-dharavis-cylinder-blast-five-critical-on-ventilator/articleshow/85750472.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||Elusive car thief has Hyderabad police playing catch-up||HYDERABAD: An interstate car thief suspected to be involved in multiple thefts is being chased by cops from the three city commissionerates for a while. The suspect, Satyendra Singh Shekhawat from Jaipur, who has an MBA to boot, had been arrested earlier in Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Cops here are yet to lay hands on him. The elusive thief uses guile and has a sophisticated modus operandi, cops said. “Shekhawat gets access to car keys at valet parking or service stations and scans them using a device. He prepares duplicate keys using electronic key cutters, tracks car on GPS and lifts them,” a cop said. His work came to city police notice for the first time in January 2021 during a probe into the theft of a Toyota Fortuner from a star hotel in Road No. 2, Banjara Hills. The car belonged to Kannada film producer V Manjunath and was lifted on January 26 from hotel parking where the driver had left it. CCTV footage helped identify Shekhawat and a team of Banjara Hills police landed at his house in Jaipur and met his father, an ex-service man. “We camped in Jaipur for a week. He even contacted on phone and offered to surrender. But he didn’t turn up,” said a cop. While Banjara Hills cops were still looking for him, Shekhawat came to city and drove off an Isuzu pick-up truck from the house of a software engineer in Nacharam in April. Now, it was the turn of Nacharam cops to go Jaipur, but they came back empty-handed too. “We had proof against Shekhawat’s wife for assisting him and we arrested her. We sought a transit warrant, but she got bail from a local court,” said a Nacharam cop. While Hyderabad and Rachakonda cops are still searching for leads, an Isuzu V Cross was stolen in a similar fashion from a gated community at Bowrampet in Cyberabad on August 5. The vehicle belongs to a pharma company and used by its assistant vice president PB Ravindra Varma. Dundigal police of Cyberabad have now registered a theft case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/elusive-car-thief-has-city-police-playing-catch-up/articleshow/85752305.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The two firms are also violating norms and causing financial loss to the civic body and increasing pollution levels. Furthermore, the two operators are not even collecting and transporting segregated garbage which is mandatory. After numerous complaints, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B formed flying squads on August 24 for all the ten zones. Deputy commissioners, superintending engineers and executive engineers who are not engaged in garbage collection and transportation on a daily basis were made heads of the flying squads. They have to submit a report by August 31. “Citizens told the Dharampeth zone squad that AG Enviro collects garbage on alternate days. People are forced to dump garbage in public places. Roads too are not swept properly,” NMC officials told TOI. Complaints from Dhantoli and Nehru Nagar zones have been few. “Many are not giving garbage in a segregated manner,” they said. Project head of AG Enviro Samir Tonpe said, “We are yet to get 5-6 garbage transfer stations from the NMC. Due to non-compliance, we are compelled to engage more vehicles.” Only 20-25% houses in Mangalwari, Gandhibagh and Satranjipura zones have complained of no daily collection, said officials. Shiv Sena activist Nitin Tiwari alleged that BVG India is not collecting garbage on a daily basis from most areas. “Garbage is collected after three-four days from a few areas,” he said. Amol Mane of BVG India did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said action will be taken against operators on the basis of findings of the squads. “Steps have been taken to ensure daily collection, no garbage dumping, 100% segregation and sweeping of roads,” he said. The previous operator, Kanak Resources Management Limited (KRML), used to claim daily collection of 1,255 metric tonnes. He was also allowed to destroy the waste. The civic body engaged AG Enviro and BVG India in November 2019. NMC officials said the two operators are claiming 1,000-1,100 metric tonnes of garbage collection per day. These operators are not allowed to destroy waste which is roughly 150-200 metric tonnes per day. Tiwari said operators are collecting only 600 metric tonnes per day. “I had lodged complaints with the NMC,” he said. Even, West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre too had also exposed the illegal practice of mixing stones and mud with the garbage. IN A NUTSHELL * One flying squad for every zone * Squads to visit 250 houses * Check garbage dumping * Check if operators collecting garbage on daily basis * Whether operators collecting and transporting garbage in segregated manner * Check if staffers demanding money * Toll free number and Nagpur Live City App to lodge complaints * Squads to submit report by August 31||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nmc-flying-squads-find-no-daily-garbage-collection-in-few-areas/articleshow/85750421.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Pune||Extension to submit non-creamy layer certs||Pune: The Centralised Admission Process Committee has given 21 days extension to students for submitting their non-creamy layer certificate to confirm their admissions in the first year of junior college. However, the assistant education director Meena Shendkar said that the students, while confirming their admissions, needed to submit a copy of the certificate’s application form and receipt of the fees submitted. The non-creamy layer certificate is necessary for students applying for admission in reserved seats for OBC, SBC and VJNT categories. This certificate is given to students from the reserved categories whose annual family income is less than Rs8 lakh. Without this, they are not eligible to get benefits of the reservation such as admission, scholarship, among others. “If a student doesn’t have a non-creamy layer certificate at the time of confirming the admission, s/he can upload a copy of the certificate application form and the fee payment receipt to obtain the certificate. They will be given 21 days to submit the certificates, failing which their admissions would be cancelled. Parents and students must ensure the first round of admission process is completed within the time given — till 5pm on August 30. Since the entire admission process is online, it will continue even on holidays,” said Shendkar. The first merit list of Std XI admissions was announced on Friday. Students, who have been allotted their first choice of college, are required to get admission in the same college. In case they refuse to do so, they will be removed from the admission process for the next three rounds and will be able to come back in the special round only by registering their consent online. “All admission processes will be done online by the junior colleges. No student should be called to the campus citing the need for documents. The colleges have also been told to use online payment gateways for the admission fee,” Shendkar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/extension-to-submit-non-creamy-layer-certs/articleshow/85747966.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||‘Begin physical classes for undergrads after jabs’||Many responsible colleges and universities in Pune have plans for all teaching and support staff to be fully vaccinated; on campus jabs for students, visitors entry only after they are vaccinated, social distancing, and wearing of masks in the classrooms and laboratories. They are ready to resume lectures and practical sessions in their gated campuses. These caring educators are very concerned and conscious of the limitations of virtual classes and feel that another semester or a year of distance learning will leave some critical and possibly irreversible learning deficiencies in students if they don’t get the touch and feel of physical sessions. The situation can be as bizarre as a student doing ME or MBA, or a course in photography, where a student can get his or her degree without visiting the college, meeting the teacher or doing any laboratory or practical work. If you are an employer, concerns about the efficacy of such a candidate is natural and this has no reflection on the capability. So, by default, we may generate a cadre of paper tigers from our system who have simulated situations but were denied living it. The 2020-21 academic year’s dependence on virtual learning was understandable as the pandemic hit us hard. With the same risk of a possible third wave, the task force and the state government have permitted the opening of markets, shops, mandis, gyms, offices, restaurants, parks and coaching classes. Travel by multi-mode transport within the state is freely allowed. Economic activity cannot be paralyzed and will lead to other consequences. People frequent these public spots and there is life as usual for everybody, with the publicized caution and advice to do only what is essential. In these spots, nobody knows who is vaccinated, and strict compliance to social distancing / mask wearing is often flouted. Our students, who we are trying to protect by not permitting the opening of colleges, are freely walking into shops, restaurants, gyms, and parks without restrictions. Hence, the uneasy inference that the decision makers consider only the sanitized classrooms as risky. We need to correct this anomaly. The Proposal 1. While admissions to the first year of these colleges and universities are underway, a beginning of physical classes for the students of second year onwards, who will all be above 18 and hence eligible for vaccination, should be made immediately on campuses. 2. The online teaching for these students should not be initiated in these campuses. They should follow the same learning process that existed in the 2019-20 academic year. 3. When the admissions to the first year of colleges and universities conclude, and if the state authorities are still hesitant for under-18 students going to colleges, they can be offered online courses for the first semester. 4. But those joining the first year of graduate courses, and are above 18, should join physical classes . We owe this to the entire lot of students, their parents and the teaching fraternity which has also reached a level of fatigue and frustration administering a 100% online learning system. 5. Once physical classes restart with this segment, and depending on the risk assessment, progressive shifting from online mode to physical classes can be initiated for junior colleges and possibly schools as well. This is an earnest plea to the higher education institutions to plan and push the agenda and the authorities to be consistent and consent.

---||Delhi||Delhi cops seize 20 pistols, 50 live cartridges from arms smuggler||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested an interstate arms smuggler and seized 20 pistols and 50 live cartridges from him. The high-quality consignment was allegedly meant for a henchman of a Jharkhand-based gangster, Aman Sahu, and some criminals of northeast Delhi, police said. According to DCP Sanjeev Yadav, the accused gunrunner has been identified as Vikash Anand. “During interrogation, the suspect revealed that he procured the weapons from Madhya Pradesh-based manufacturers and communicated with them on Telegram and App-generated numbers,” Yadav said. Anand and Sahu were classmates and neighbours. After dropping out of school, Anand had begun a business of selling spare parts and the gangster had invested his ill-gotten money into it. During the Covid lockdown, the business took a huge hit and Anand allegedly took to supplying weapons. The alleged smuggler was arrested in the aftermath of the investigation of another module busted by the Cell recently, wherein two suspects named Rajender and Bablu were held. During their routine surveillance on gunrunners, the Special Cell learnt that illegal weapons were being pumped into the capital from various parts of the country but a majority of arms were from Dhar, Badwani, Bhuranpur in Madhya Pradesh. Several interstate firearm syndicates were bust, including a gang run by one Bablu and Rajender who were arrested with 18 pistols and 60 cartridges. The weapons were meant for a Bawana-based gangster. Rajender told police that he supplied illegal firearms to over a dozen gangs in connivance with his elder brother, Narender Singh. He also gave details of suspects located in Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra and Ranchi. During further interrogation in the case, cops stumbled upon more names, including Anand’s, said a police officer. The cops mounted surveillance on Anand and tracked his location to Jalgaon, Maharashtra. A raid was conducted and he was arrested by the team. The weapons and bullets were recovered from his luggage. An FIR under the Arms Act has been registered and the cops are looking for other members of the syndicate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/20-pistols-50-live-cartridges-seized-from-arms-smuggler/articleshow/85748025.cms||---

Accused duo — Khushnund alias Khush Malek and Juned alias Makkhi Sheikh — would pretend that their wallets were missing and start frisking people and forcibly decamp with the victims’ money. Police said that the two accused were always on the move by changing their addresses frequently. However, they were nabbed through surveillance of CCTV cameras installed at the SSG Hospital and elsewhere in the city. “The accused would target random people at crowded places like the canteen or the medical store and start levelling allegations on them that they stole the duo’s wallets. The duo would then frisk the victims and would forcibly take away money from their wallets,” said assistant commissioner of police Megha Tewar. “People should not let any unknown people frisk them, no matter whatever they allege. Instead, they should contact the police by dialling control room number,” Tewar added. Malek was even earlier booked in similar cases at various police station including Raopura, Gorwa, Wadi, JP Road and Nadiad Town. Police seized Rs 15,500 cash, a scooter and two mobile phones from the duo.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/thieves-targeting-patients-kin-at-ssg-hospital-nabbed/articleshow/85747120.cms||---

It has completed training for medical officers and paramedical staff in all districts. In Mysuru, officials said the drive is likely to begin from the second week of September after an awareness drive. In Shivamogga, deputy commissioner KB Sivakumar said the drive will start from the first week of September. He held a review meeting with officials over the implementation of the new vaccine as part of the Universal Immunisation Programme. According to authorities, this vaccine will be administered in the sixth week of birth, 14th week, and nine months. Officials said the vaccine will provide protection against pneumonia and other diseases. In Shivamogga, WHO consultant Dr Satishchandra said, “In our country every year 1.2 million children die before reaching the age of five. Among them, 16% deaths are caused due to Pneumonia. This vaccine is effective against this.” Shivamogga district health officer Dr Rajesh Suragihalli said the vaccine is expensive in private hospitals and henceforth it will be administered free of cost in government facilities for children. “A vaccine dose costs around Rs 1,500 in private hospitals. We are starting with the first dose from September first week,” he said. He added that medical and paramedical staff are already trained about the vaccination drive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/govt-set-to-launch-pneumonia-vax-drive-for-kids-in-sept/articleshow/85746542.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: 57% mixed garbage still being dumped at Bhandewadi yard||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has been spending over Rs500 more per metric tonne (MT) for door-to-door garbage collection, yet the two private agencies — AG Enviro Limited and BVG India — are not following many of the terms and conditions of the agreement. The major violation is that the agencies are still not collecting segregated garbage from the source point, ie individual homes. Even after passage of almost two years, NMC is still dumping nearly 57% mixed waste of the total approximately 1,202MT of garbage being generated in the city everyday at Bhandewadi yard. Both the agencies transport 39.2% wet and 4.1% dry waste to the yard. NMC is paying Rs1,950 per MT to AG and Rs1,800 per MT to BVG for door-to-door garbage collection. There is a provision in the agreement that NMC can impose a fine of Rs100 per vehicle from day one of the service for collecting and transporting mixed waste. Both firms had pressed around 472 vehicles into action, including 300 vehicles for door-to-door garbage collection and transportation. But NMC’s solid waste management (SWM) department and the zonal officers from the 10 zones ignored the blatant violations. Nodal officer (SWM) Dr G Mahalle admitted that mixed garbage was being transported to Bhandewadi yard. “Soon, it will be stopped and only segregated waste will be collected from every house,” he said, adding that the firms will be fined for not adhering to terms of the agreement. Residents from across the city are unhappy with the services of the garbage collection agencies. Kavita Singh, a resident of Surendragadh, which comes under Dharampeth zone, claimed that she segregates garbage diligently. “But the collector mixes them every morning,” she said. Many residents have stopped segregating the waste at source, she added. Environment activist and director of Centre for Sustainable Development Leena Budhe asked why segregation of waste was not happening when NMC spends taxpayers’ money. “Although some residents are aware of segregation and its importance, they choose not to do so because they see their efforts going waste, when they find the private contractor dumping the segregated garbage in the same container,” she pointed out. Green Vigil Foundation’s founder and green activist Kaustav Chatterjee said, “Segregation of household waste is the responsibility of the generator, but solid waste collection agencies have been instructed many times to educate citizens about segregation of waste and not to pick up unsegregated waste.” He added, “We have witnessed during the last three years that various awareness campaigns did not yield desired results and only a small fraction of population is handing over segregated waste, but citizens also get highly demotivated upon noticing garbage collectors mixing up segregated waste with non-segregated waste.” Chatterjee further said, “NMC needs to make strict rules of not lifting unsegregated waste. On a trial basis, the same can be implemented at a limited area.” According to Budhe and Chatterjee, even when contracts are awarded it is NMC’s sole responsibility to monitor and supervise the work of the contractor. “Enforcement is the key and this has to come from the civic body,” they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/57-mixed-garbage-still-being-dumped-at-bhandewadi-yard/articleshow/85750463.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The MP also wrote a letter to the ministry of defence (MoD) seeking an early resolution of the issue. The existing cargo hold area needs to be shifted to facilitate the construction of a new terminal building and also to ensure that the cargo transportation process gets even more seamless. The MoD has shown its willingness to give the 2.5-acre land for the shifting purpose, but has asked the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to pay an annual lease rent of Rs1.38 crore for the same. The AAI expressed its inability to pay such a ‘heavy’ rent on the grounds that it was already paying substantial money to the MoD for the use of the entire civil enclave facility, which was a part of the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) fighter base at Lohegaon. The runway and the air traffic control is controlled by the IAF. “Generally, it is seen that whenever the AAI needs land from the defence or vice versa, it happens via mutual understanding. However, here, the case is different with the defence asking for money for the same, which is concerning for us. The talks with the civil aviation minister have been fruitful and he assured to take up the matter. The minister informed me that they had already written a letter to the MoD pertaining to the issue and that a meeting between officials of both the ministries as well as the AAI would happen soon so that the issue could be resolved. I have been told by the Pune airport authorities that they are already paying the IAF a large amount of money for the civil enclave and that payment of more money for the plot was difficult,” Bapat added. In a letter, which Bapat gave to the civil aviation minister on August 25, he said, “I came to know that the MoD has accorded permission in the past at several airports such as Leh, Jammu, Srinagar, Pathankot, Bhatinda, Agra, Bikaner, Chandigarh, Gwalior, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bhuj, Goa, Jamnagar etc, without levy of any lease amount as no transfer of land is involved. Similarly, AAI has provided same facilities to MoD at airports of Amritsar, Nagpur, Porbandar, Vadodara, Belagavi, Chennai, Guwahati etc, without levy of any lease amount since the land would remain in control and ownership of MoD/AAI....”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/officials-to-meet-soon-to-discuss-cargo-hold-issue/articleshow/85748046.cms||Joy Sengupta

The ward issued a notice for demolition of structures within the road line that obstruct the widening of the Madh-Marve road. Assistant municipal commissioner Makarand Dagadkhair said he had earmarked over 1,200 structures in the ward for demolition for road-widening. “Only the church is a heritage structure, which we are not touching. We will take a few metres around the boundary wall,” he said. It is one of the oldest churches in Mumbai at about 400 years old. Parishioners said the Parochial House, rebuilt in 1872, serves as a residence for priests, and has church offices and is used for counselling and charitable work. The Parochial House touches the boundary wall. “As per BMC’s heritage rules, the entire precinct is a heritage site, and has been placed in Grade-IIA category. Any work, including repairs, requires permission from Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee. BMC officials must get permission from MHCC before issuing a notice,” said advocate Godfrey Pimenta, founder of Watchdog Foundation. Stanley Fernandes, a local, said the opposite side of the road had been a green zone, but when the BMC allowed buildings to come up it did not insist on setback land for the road, favouring builders. “Land must be taken equally from both sides, but BMC did not do that, and now insists the church give more land, which is unjust,” he said. Pimenta said after acquiring land and widening roads BMC allows it to be encroached upon by hawkers and to be used for illegal parking. A decade ago, a road-widening exercise in Bandra (W) was abandoned following protests as it affected a Parsi agiary and a school. In this case too, earlier land acquired for road-widening is now encroached upon by hawkers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-heritage-church-may-lose-out-to-road-widening/articleshow/85752395.cms||Clara Lewis

Environmentalists from the city have filed a complaint with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) regional officers in this connection. Similar plumes of black smoke were seen rising from the same chimney on Saturday. CSTPS has been under the scanner following criticism by guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar over high pollution, leading to various respiratory diseases among citizens in Chandrapur city and around. The minister had ordered an inquiry into the pollution caused by the mega power plant and accordingly, a three-day-long monitoring exercise of air quality was carried out by MPCB officials in the plant’s premises. The monitoring exercise — questioned by environmentalists for its “wrong timing” — done with the help of three ambient air quality monitoring machines ended on August 25. Two days after the exercise, the modern chimney of latest power generation unit numbers 8 and 9 started emitting black plumes of smoke. “How can a modern unit which has emission standards of just 30 mg/Nm3 emit such high quantity of black smoke,” questioned prof Yogeshwar Dudhpachare. He said he’d filed a complaint about this high emission from CSTPS with MPCB regional officer. MPCB regional officer Ashok Kare said he had received oral complaints from environmentalists regarding the high emission from units 8 and 9 of CSTPS. He added that the board had asked CSTPS officials about the emission and will serve show-cause notice to the plant management, seeking their explanation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/greens-cry-foul-over-high-emission-from-cstps/articleshow/85750496.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Ahmedabad||Monopoly issue surfaces at Navlakhi after company sells assets to competitor||AHMEDABAD: A cargo vessel MV Aquaenna that arrived at Navlakhi port on August 13 had to wait for over two weeks before it could discharge the 125,000 tonnes of coal it was carrying. The reason for this is that the company United Shippers Ltd (USL) that was to conduct the stevedoring activity for the vessel, has recently sold off its movable assets to Shreeji Shipping for about Rs 185 crore. This has sparked talks of monopoly with Shreeji Shipping becoming the sole stevedore at Navlakhi that can handle coal cargo. Some coal importers have already written to the state government in this regard. The state maritime regulator – Gujarat Maritime Board on Friday allowed Shreeji Shipping to handle MV Aquaenna as a special case. In a letter written to USL in this connection on August 27, GMB said that the company shall, either directly or indirectly, not sell the licence or the right to utilize the licence, to Shreeji Shipping or any other third party. “If any genuine complaints are received from the trading community, to the effect that USL, in consortium with Shreeji Shipping or any other third-party, has created an anti-competitive environment at and within Navlakhi Port and/or is guilty of misconduct or unfair or irregular practices in the performance of its stevedoring obligations, appropriate proceedings to terminate/suspend the license may be initiated in accordance with the 1969 rules,” GMB said in its letter. When contacted, Sujata Parekh, joint MD of USL declined to comment on the matter. While GMB is planning to come out with a dedicated policy for stevedores that will replace the age-old rules that are in place since 1968, it also plans to allow more stevedores to handle coal in the area by allotting plots to them. The term stevedore refers to the act of loading or offloading cargo to and/or from a ship. Navlakhi Port, which is an important revenue earning port of GMB, has only two active stevedores - Shreeji Shipping (Shreeji) & United Shippers Limited (USL). “Coal importers have raised the issue with GMB and claimed that the handling charges have been hiked at Navlakhi in the last two months. The deal to purchase USL assets of barges, floating cranes and shore machinery was completed by July end. USL as a company was not sold but it planned to discontinue its presence in the port business,” said an expert in the port sector. Shreeji and USL used to handle about 10 million tonnes of cargo between them. He said that GMB’s decision of allowing Shreeji to handle Aquaenna has not gone down well with the importers as it allows competitors to join hands. “A monopoly is being created at Navlakhi. The plots and jetties allotted to USL belong to GMB and the maritime regulator must initiate the process of bringing in more competition in the area,” said a state government official. Ashok Lal, one of the promoters of Shreeji Shipping said the company after buying the assets of USL has entered into an agreement to rent out the equipment to USL as and when they require. About five companies have applied to GMB for stevedoring license at Navlakhi. They have sought plots and jetty facility from GMB for stevedoring activities. The five companies include Rishi Shipping, Shri Sagar Stevedors LLP, Marine Bulk Cargo Movers, Shree Krishna Stevedores Ltd and Jaydeep Associates Pvt Ltd. In the last three months there has been a sharp decline in port tonnage. From about 18 lakh tonnes handled between June and August last year amid Covid-19, it has come down to 10 lakh tonnes in the three-month period this year. BOX: NAVLAKHI STATUS Five companies include Rishi Shipping, Shri Sagar Stevedors LLP, Marine Bulk Cargo Movers, Shree Krishna Stevedores Ltd and Jaydeep Associates Pvt Ltd have sought plots at Navlakhi for stevedoring Importers have written to GMB about monopoly being created at Navlakhi.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Actor Armaan Kohli arrested in drugs case day after search at home||MUMBAI: Actor Armaan Kohli was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Sunday for allegedly possessing 1.2gm of cocaine. The NCB had conducted a search at the actor’s Andheri residence on Saturday in a drug-related case after his name cropped up when they were questioning alleged peddler, Ajay Singh, who was arrested the same morning. A holiday court remanded Kohli and Singh, who have been charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act for procurement, possession, sale purchase transport and illicit trafficking and harbouring offenders, to NCB custody till Monday. While NCB officers claim that prima facie they have found Kohli’s links with peddlers, including some foreign nationals, sources said that the actor can seek bail as the quantity of cocaine seized from him is 1.2gm, which falls under the ‘personal consumption’ category. If the defence proves that the quantity seized is for consumption only, the court may relieve Kohli and ask him to undergo a three-month rehabilitation programme. But NCB officials pointed out that in the arrest of Siddharth Pithani, the flatmate of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, they did not find any drugs on him, but had found his links with suppliers. “In Kohli’s case too, we arrested peddler Singh from whom we recovered 25gm of mephedrone and his interrogation led us to the actor. When we carried out a search at Kohli’s residence, we found 1.2gm of cocaine there,” said an officer. Probe into the drugs case has found international links as the seized cocaine has South American origin. NCB Mumbai has also found WhatsApp chats and financial transactions. The agency is now probing the route and linkages used to bring drugs into Mumbai and the involvement of other traffickers. “Singh is a history-sheeter. In 2018, the anti-narcotics cell of Mumbai Police had recovered a huge quantity of ephedrine from him,” said Sameer Wankhede, IRS, Mumbai Zonal Director, NCB. Kohli, a former Bigg Boss contestant, has acted in Hindi movies like Jaani Dushman, Qahar, Juaari, Dushman Zamana and Prem Ratan Dhan Payo.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-actor-armaan-arrested-in-drugs-case-day-after-search-at-home/articleshow/85750526.cms||Ahmed Ali

The company said prices have been raised to cover the increase in input costs. The company has been forced to service CNG and PNG consumers with imported gas, which costs eight times more than domestic gas, because of rising demand. "While sales volumes have increased substantially, the domestic gas allocation has remained constant due to lower average volumes of previous months," the company said. After the revision, CNG costs Rs 50.90 per kg and PNG Rs 30.86 per unit in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. In Gurgaon, PNG costs Rs.29.10 per unit. In Kaithal, CNG costs Rs.52.30 per kg. In Karnal, CNG costs Rs 52.30 per kg and PNG Rs.29.71 per unit.

However, the PMPML’s expansion plans have not gone down well with its MSRTC counterparts. The PMPML official said with several people still unable to use local trains, the buses would help provide them transportation options. “At present, we are planning to start buses from Nigdi to Lonavla. The PMPML has started a survey in order to ascertain the possible passenger traffic based on which the number of buses would be decided,” Dattatray Zende, PMPML’s traffic manager, said. Another official said after Nigdi, they would study another route to Lonavla from Pune city. Around two months ago, PMPML had started a few rural routes and the MSRTC had objected to it. Talking about PMPML’s recent expansion plans, Dnyneshwar Ranavare, traffic manager of MSRTC’s Pune division, said, “According to the norms, PMPML can extend their service to 20km only outside the city limits. For that too, they need a consent letter and certification from MSRTC. They are not taking any permission from us and going on increasing routes to far off places.” Zende said, “The regulation which they are ya talking about is almost 20 years old and is related to taxation and not about increasing services beyond city limits.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmpml-plans-to-start-bus-service-to-lonavla-soon/articleshow/85748106.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Some districts in Delhi see 0 cases, but caution remains key||NEW DELHI: Four months ago, almost all districts in Delhi were reporting 2,000-3,000 Covid-19 cases daily. However, with a steady decline in the novel coronavirus infection in the capital, seven districts recently reported either zero or one new case each while none of the 11 districts recorded more than five cases. Shahdara and North districts reported not a single case on August 22, and Central, North East, North West, New Delhi and West districts one case each, stated a district-wise Covid report, accessed by TOI. According to the report, which details the situation between August 10 and 22, North district reported zero case on four days, North East and Shahdara on three days and West on two days. North district even saw zero case on three consecutive days. The report indicates that the districts have made great strides in checking the viral spread through containment measures like high daily tests and strict enforcement of safety norms. A health department official said one of the key factors behind the turnaround had been the continuous high number of daily Covid tests that led to early detection and prevented the spread. Despite a low positivity rate of 0.5% or less for a long time now, each district still conducts 3,000 to 5,700 Covid tests daily, a majority of them being RT-PCR. Delhi conducted 64,810 tests on Tuesday, out of which 42,085 were more effective RT-PCR. However, Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council and member of Delhi government’s panel on Covid-19, warned against any complacency. “Districts reporting zero case is a good sign, but it is too early to declare that a district is Covid-free if no case is reported for three consecutive days,” Dr Gupta said. “People need to be careful because most of the economic activities have been permitted and due to the beginning of the festive season, public places are getting crowded.” The doctor added, “Only over 35.5 lakh Delhiites are fully vaccinated, so many are still at risk. People must follow all Covid-appropriate norms.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/some-districts-see-0-cases-but-caution-remains-key/articleshow/85748097.cms||AlokKNMishra

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has made the provision of allowing transgender passengers access to separate toilets at its stations, which were hitherto meant for differently abled passengers only, Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, claimed. “In its efforts to provide safe space and prevent gender discrimination against transgenders, Delhi Metro on priority basis has designated its existing toilets meant only for Divynagjans so far, to be accessible for the transgenders too,” Dayal said. At present, Delhi Metro has 347 such separate dedicated toilets, which are in addition to the regular toilets for other passengers at Delhi Metro stations spread across the network in NCR. “To guide transgenders to these toilets, bilingual signages (in English and Hindi), along with symbols for both the ‘Persons with Disabilities’ and ‘Transgenders’ have been installed adjacent to these toilets,” Dayal said. “Besides this provision of separate toilet, any transgender who wishes to use gender based toilet as per self-identified gender will also continue to do so,” he added. The DMRC official said that the corporation is also in the process of contemplating ways to identify dedicated locations to provide separate public toilet facilities at its upcoming stations as part of the Phase-IV project. The capital got its first dedicated toilet complex for transgender people when New Delhi Municipal Council opened one opposite Shastri Bhawan in June this year under the Swachh Bharat Mission. The complex also has toilet facilities for differently abled persons and regular users.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/transgenders-to-get-access-to-separate-toilets-at-metro-stns/articleshow/85748117.cms||---

The government is gearing to launch a ‘Super’ app, which will provide “one stop” solution for all such needs across states, with vehicle owners just needing to sign in once to avail all the facilities. The ‘Super’ app is being developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). The services that the users can avail through this app include tax payment, duplicate RC/ fitness/ permit, transfer of ownership, change of address, hypothecation and issue of NOC. Similarly, the driver related services that can be availed will include online learner’s licence, new driving licence and renewal, duplicate licence, change of address and international driving permit. The users will also be able to make payment of challan online and verify the payment as well. Director general of NIC, Neeta Verma, told TOI that the focus of the new app is to provide all solutions related to a vehicle through this platform. “This will require one-time registration. We will have a provision for generating alerts for the users to update them about the renewal of documents and for payments that are due. The app will be available in different languages. To begin with we will have it in English and Hindi,” she said. A road transport ministry official said the ministry has given the go ahead for this service. TOI has learnt that the app will also have a provision to store all documents related to the vehicle and driver. A legal provision will be made to treat all such stored documents as valid by enforcement agencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/super-app-to-provide-all-vehicle-related-services/articleshow/85753987.cms||Dipak K Dash

The district administration’s Human Wildlife Conflict Management Committee, which met recently, identified the release of stray dogs in fringe areas like Bhukum, Hinjewadi, Dighi and Wagholi, among others, as a key factor behind leopard sightings in these areas. So far, there has been no leopard attack on people but at least 10 incidents of attacks on domestic or stray animals have been reported since January this year. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said on Sunday that incidents of leopards being sighted in the fringe areas of the Pune and Pimpric Chinchwad municipal limits has increased over the last two years. “Civic authorities need to take measures on priority to avoid human-animal conflicts in the future,” said Deshmukh. The district collector stressed on the need for various agencies and departments to work in tandem to better handle possible events of wildlife entering city limits. “We could not manage the situation effectively when an Indian bison was spotted in a residential area in Kothrud in December last year. We don’t want a similar case of mismanagement the next time this happens. Coordination among agencies is imperative,” Deshmukh added. Deshmukh said that the issue of releasing stray dogs in fringe areas was discussed during the meeting of the Human Wildlife Conflict Management Committee. “We told officials present at the meeting to take necessary measures to address this concern,” said Deshmukh. On forming a dedicated dog shelter facility in the city, the collector said no decision had been taken. “But we will definitely work on this in days to come,” he said. Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forest, Pune, said a meeting will be held with both civic bodies to work on finding a solution. “We haven’t reported any leopard or wild animal attack on people in city. However, we have come across sightings of leopards in fringe areas,” said Patil. Pune Muniicpal Corporation health chief Dr Ashish Bharti and PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil did not respond to phone calls or text messages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/stray-dogs-released-in-fringe-areas-attract-leopards-say-forest-officials/articleshow/85748130.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Delhi||Mobile companies to pay more for installing towers in east Delhi||NEW DELHI: Amid a sustained pressure to check call drops, the mobile tower companies will need to pay more for installing towers in east Delhi areas as the civic body has approved the proposal for revising the rates. Additional rates will be charged for installing antennas of multiple mobile companies at one pole and each application for setting up mobile towers will also attract an extra one-time levy of Rs 10,000 towards administrative expenses. The proposal was passed in the house meeting recently. In 2016, the high court asked the three civic bodies and the mobile tower operators to decide rates and in January 2017, a consensus was reached. Since 2017, the civic body has collected Rs 11 crore from mobile towers in its areas, said East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal. “After four years of implementing the rates, a decision was taken to increase them again. And in March 2021, it was agreed to increase the installation fee from Rs 2 lakh for five years to Rs 5 lakh for five years per tower. It was also decided that antennas of more than one company on mobile towers will increase the installation rate by 25%,” said Agarwal. However, as soon as the proposal floated, the mobile tower companies filed a plea in the Delhi high court against the increase imposed by all the three civic bodies. “The high court later asked all interested parties to sit together and find a solution. Later, meetings were called in June and July where a decision was taken to revise the rates. The finalised revised rates included charging a fee of Rs 3 lakh for five years and no additional charge from mobile tower operators for installing multiple antennas of other companies on one tower,” stated a proposal approved in house meeting on Friday. “For poles up to the height of 12 metres, a fee of Rs 25,000 for five years will be charged, (existing rate is Rs 20,000), and for installing antennas of multiple companies, Rs 25,000 per antenna will be charged. The mobile towers already operational will continue to operate at old rates, however, during the renewal of their contract, new rates will be levied automatically,” stated the proposal. “The rates have already been implemented in the south corporation. Though the decision will reduce the revenue expected by us initially, but now that consensus has been reached for the revised rates, it will eventually help in strengthening mobile networks in the area,” said Agarwal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/mobile-companies-to-pay-more-for-installing-towers-in-e-delhi/articleshow/85748136.cms||Vibha Sharma

Pushpendra has a job as a desktop engineer in Delhi,” says Khanna,70. The pride in Khanna’s voice underlines the importance of what Pragati Wheel has meant to the residents of the Yamuna floodplain. In 2007, Khanna and some concerned friends took to the river to protest against the construction of the Akshardham Mandir and the Commonwealth Games Village on the recharge area of the river. It was then that they noticed the children living in the area weren’t going to school. Realising there was no school around, Khanna’s group started informal classes to start the kids on education. Functioning from a cow shelter, the school attracted the children of farmers and labourers living in the vicinity. The response was phenomenal and the group decided to formalise the education centre. When almost 300 children enrolled, they rented a building and started classes for senior students too. Today, they provided mid-day meals and give the kids free uniforms and textbooks. There are 150 children at the moment, from nursery to Class X. “Because of the lockdown and the recent steps initiated to evict farmers from the sensitive floodplain, we have fewer children now,” explained Raman. The Class X students appear for the final examinations through the National Institute of Open Schooling. Select students are then helped to undertake three-year diploma courses offered by Delhi government. On Thursday, 60 nursery and upper kindergarten students were going through their lessons in open-air classrooms behind the Commonwealth Games Village. Harjeet Kaur, Veena Sharma and Santosh Singh are the teachers on duty. Singh, who has been attached to the primary section since 2010, revealed, “These kids are all the first generation in their families to attend school. Their parents, migrants from UP and Bihar, are all unlettered. We teachers work here not to earn a salary but to give these marginalised children a chance in life.” The school has 14 teachers and some volunteers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/word-ly-gains-along-yamuna-where-kids-get-the-wheels-to-ride-out-of-poverty/articleshow/85748164.cms||Anindya Chattopadhyay

Motkupalli had recently quit the BJP to join the TRS. Talking to the media, he expressed confidence in Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s commitment to the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ initiative. “I observed honesty in what the Chief Minister said. He pledged to implement it 100% and I trust him. If it is not done I would commit suicide in front of Yadadri temple,” he said, adding that he took the decision to quit BJP only to support the CM’s initiative. Earlier, he has held a one-day ‘Deeksha’ against opposition parties’ criticism of the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ initiative. Accusing the BJP and Congress for the attempts to nullify the scheme, he said, “Dalits are the poorest section of society and discrimination against them persists in many regions.” Targeting Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president Revanth Reddy, he said the TPCC chief was all about ‘blackmail’ and responsible for the demise of TTDP in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/will-kill-myself-if-dalit-bandhu-not-carried-out-across-t-motkupalli/articleshow/85750573.cms||---

He claimed that the North DMC’s standing committee’s agenda has been recently released and states that the corporation plan to sell 10 hospitals and medical colleges falling under its ambit to the central government.“They have brought the MCD to such a bad condition that it is not even capable of running these hospitals anymore.

Chhabria told TOI added that both of its agricultural, and non-agri segments — plumbing and sanitation solutions — have had varying performances, with demand often being seasonal in parts of the country. The company has significant interests in the agricultural and construction sectors, being key suppliers to both the segments. Chhabria did not agree that the rise in prices of PVC over the past year has been excessive, particularly as its prices have fluctuated drastically over the past few years. “Looking back over the past few years, PVC prices were fairly stable for some time, and then crashed. Over the past year, those prices have gone up once again. However, a straight line in prices would be good for everyone,” Chhabria said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/unfair-to-say-pvc-prices-are-too-high-says-finolex-boss/articleshow/85748215.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Delhi||An August ending: Rain likely through the week in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Drizzle was recorded in parts of the capital on Sunday. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), rain activity is expected to pick up in the last two days of the month. While light showers are forecast for Monday, moderate rainfall may occur at some places on Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials say rainfall is expected to continue till Friday, but Delhi is unlikely to receive a spell of ‘heavy’ rainfall during this period. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, had received 214.5mm of rainfall so far this month till 8.30am on Sunday, with the normal mark being at 241.9mm. However, the station recorded no rainfall during the day. This means the station is currently at a deficit of 11%, officials said. “The monsoon trough is still south of Delhi-NCR, but some light to moderate rainfall activity will still occur in the region. Unless decent rain is recorded on Tuesday, Safdarjung could end the month in a slight deficit,” said an official. While no rainfall was recorded at Safdarjung, Lodhi Road recorded ‘trace’ rainfall between 8.30 am on Saturday and 8.30 am on Sunday, Ridge recorded 22.2mm and Najafgarh received 0.5mm during this period. Between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Sunday, only Palam received rain, recording ‘trace’ rainfall. Delhi’s air quality remains in the ‘moderate’ category. It showed an improvement on Sunday, dropping from 147 (moderate) on Saturday to 119. Safar, a government air quality forecasting body, says AQI is likely to stay in the ‘moderate’ category in the next two days as well, with PM 10 remaining the lead pollutant. External dust from western part of Delhi and local resuspended dust within NCR are not able to get dispersed due to low wind speeds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/an-august-ending-expect-showers-through-the-week/articleshow/85748408.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ST driver suicide note blames salary delay; protest planned today||MUMBAI: An MSRTC bus driver committed suicide in Dhule on Friday and left behind a note blaming the corporation for “delays in disbursing salaries”. On Sunday, union workers said the issue was serious as over 97,000 employees had not been given salaries for July. “The suicide of the driver due to salaries not paid on time will be taken up in the form of a protest outside bus depots on Monday,” said union leader J M Kahar. A Mantralaya official said the decision to pay July salaries had been taken at a meeting held by state transport minister Anil Parab a day before the suicide happened,” he said. Parab was unavailable for comment. MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe appealed to employees not to take any drastic step. “The bus corporation has suffered huge losses, and we are making efforts to pay salaries every month,” he said. The MSRTC’s accumulated losses stand at over Rs 7,500 crore. The driver, Kamlesh Bedse, was attached to the Sakri depot in Dhule district. In November, there were two suicides in the MSRTC, by a driver in Ratnagiri and by a conductor in Jalgaon. At that time, sources said the deaths were attributed to non-payment of salaries. Kahar said salaries were usually disbursed by the seventh of the month. “The May salary was given on June 23 while the June salary was paid on July 15, and the July salary has not been paid so far. Workers, especially many drivers and conductors, who already have low salaries, are frustrated,” he said. Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress said: "Delay in salary payments had frustrated drivers last year as well. But the state later sanctioned three financial packages totalling Rs 2150 crore (Rs 550 crore, Rs 1000 crore and Rs 600 crore) to the MSRTC. Despite the financial aid, there are delays in salary payments till date." The bus corporation needs around Rs 300 crore for disbursing monthly salary to employees. Barge demanded merger of the MSRTC board with the state government -- so that the government takes over and ensures that the loss-making bus corporation is able to pay salaries on time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/st-driver-suicide-note-blames-salary-delay-protest-planned-today-in-mumbai/articleshow/85750743.cms||Somit Sen
---||Dehradun||Kumbh Covid test scam: Non-bailable warrants issued against owners of Max Corp and Nalwa Labs||Haridwar: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the alleged 1 lakh fake tests shown to have been done during the Haridwar Kumbh this year was issued non-bailable warrants (NBWs) against Mallika and Sharat Pant of Max Corporate Services and Dr Navtej Nalwa of Nalwa Path Labs by the Haridwar chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court on Saturday. The two firms and their owners were named in the FIR filed in the case, in which a host of people, who had never been to Haridwar Kumbh, received “negative” Covid-19 test results and were even shown as sample collectors. Two police teams have now been sent to conduct raids in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and New Delhi to arrest the three prime accused. Two days ago, the then-Kumbh mela health officer Dr RK Sengar and in-charge Dr NK Tyagi were suspended for their alleged involvement in the scam. The orders regarding their suspension were issued by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on August 26. Providing details about the move to arrest the main accused in the scam, Haridwar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S told TOI, “After getting the NBWs from the court, we are trying to arrest the three main accused. We are also examining evidence against the two government doctors who were suspended.” Noida-based Max Corporate Services, which had been entrusted with carrying out Covid tests during Kumbh, had outsourced the work to Delhi-based Lalchandani Labs and Hisar-based Nalwa Labs. Nalwa had in turn hired another lab, “Delphia”, to conduct tests on its behalf. In late June, Max, Lalchandani Labs and Nalwa Labs had approached the Uttarakhand high court, seeking to quash the FIR against them filed by the SIT. Earlier this month, Mallika and Sharat Pant had sought protection from arrest at the Uttarakhand high court, saying they had no active role in conducting the tests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/kumbh-covid-test-scam-non-bailable-warrants-issued-against-owners-of-max-corp-and-nalwa-labs/articleshow/85745952.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Thane||Thane: Resistance by locals & netas stalling crucial Kalwa-Airoli elevated rail link||THANE: Frequent opposition and interference from local residents and elected representatives have delayed execution of the crucial Kalwa-Airoli elevated rail link project, revealed the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) Ltd authorities in a written reply to local activist Siddhesh Desai. The MRVC, which is laying the 5th-6th additional tracks on the Thane-Diva segment here, has blamed resistance from locals and non-cooperation from netas over rehabilitation issue as hindrances in completion of the project. TimesViewIt is high time the authorities strategise a time-bound plan for executing crucial infra projects in the metropolis by involving all stake holders at the early stages itself. Flagging off projects only to let them lie idle is only adding to the cost escalation and the miseries of local residents. Planning a project considering all possible resettlement and rehabilitation and also ensuring the stretches remain encroachment free thereon has to be the responsibility of the local administrationThe agency claimed they have started work on the land made available to them from various agencies, but a crucial part on the Kalwa side has been held up. Agency officials said resettlement and rehabilitation was one of the major issues plaguing the project due to lack of cooperation from local netas and residents who have stonewalled all attempts to conduct mandatory surveys here. “We need verified details of those staying in the area and who will be affected by the project so we can take up the issue with the MMRDA that has agreed to help resettle them. But all efforts have proved futile due to opposition by locals for the survey. Unless the inhabitants are rehabilitated, there can be no progress and the work gets delayed,” said the MRVC in its reply. Desai, a railway commuter from Kalwa, said he was appalled by the manner in which the project was getting delayed. “It seems those opposing the project are not in favour of lakhs of passengers who are forced to commute in inhuman conditions on the suburban stretch. It is high time some action is taken on this front to reduce the volume of mishaps here. Holding such vital projects to ransom isn’t right,” he said. Cabinet minister and MLA Jitendra Awhad, who represents the area, said he was aware of the situation but maintained there was no opposition to the project as such but only concerns about the rehabilitation policy of the MRVC. “The authorities are planning to relocate residents to Mankhurd or Govandi, but a majority of the residents are locally employed. If they are relocated far away, who will ensure their livelihood. We need to have a humanitarian approach. There is ample vacant land in the vicinity where relocation can be planned,” he said. Shiv Sena MP Dr Shrikant Shinde, who also represents the area, said he will follow up on the project and ensure the work isn’t affected. “Part of the area where the link runs is in my constituency, and I will follow up with the authorities to ensure the project doesn’t get delayed,” he said. It may be recalled that the elevated railway link was sanctioned and executed as part of Mutp III. The project was planned to take the load off Thane station as a majority of Kalyan-Navi Mumbai-bound traffic would be diverted from Kalwa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/mumbai-resistance-by-locals-netas-stalling-crucial-kalwa-airoli-elevated-rail-link/articleshow/85752658.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Chennai||How a quick trial adds to the intrigue of the Kodanad case||Chennai: The ‘Kodanad case’ we casually mention is in fact a bouquet of serious offences waiting to be unravelled. The ‘case’ revolves around murder of a security guard, a burglary at a former chief minister’s retreat, three deaths due to road accidents in two days and the alleged suicide of a key estate employee in-charge of CCTV camera and computers. So, the Kodanad case essentially concerns five deaths and one burglary.The prosecution has dished out quite a vanilla narrative: There was a burglary during which one security guard was killed and another injured. Eleven people were involved and 10 of them were arrested. (Kanagaraj died in an accident). What was recovered from the gang which came in three vehicles, including two high-end SUVs? Five cheap-looking watches and a crystal rhinoceros figurine. Based on this, a chargesheet was filed and trial in a sessions court in the Nilgiris has reached the Section 313 questioning stage.When the AIADMK was in power, no one questioned glaring misses like why V K Sasikala, who is the sole owner of the estate after the demise of her friend and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, was not questioned by police. Post-burglary, shouldn’t the owner give the list of stolen valuables? Has Sasikala officially said she lost only those five exhibited watches and the rhino doll? Neither police prepared the missing-articles mahazar with details from Sasikala, nor has she questioned the attempt to leave her out of the probe. Conveniently, the trial court did not find it prudent to question this deliberate hole in the prosecution story.Also, no one is asking about the eyewitness to the burglary. There is no trace of security guard Kishan Bahadur, the sole eyewitness to the murder-burglary drama. Officials dish out an incredible theory for this too. Bahadur’s evidence was recorded, and he was allowed to return to his village in Nepal, but his current whereabouts is not known. There are many more intriguing loopholes such as discrepancy over the actual number of burglars — varying from eight to 11 — what was carted out from the bungalow and who hired the team of burglars.Some of the top bureaucrats in the districts were at the crime scene early morning on April 28, 2017, even before the investigating officer could reach the spot. Also, a forensic expert has gone on record to say when he reached the spot, he found evidence had been tampered with during the three-hour window between 4am — when the premises was burgled — and 7am, when he got there. With so many loose ends, the trial, nevertheless, has been hurtling towards completion without the owner being examined.Now, after the regime change in Tamil Nadu, each death and the burglary in the case has acquired a new meaning, and pertinent questions are being raised.To put this in perspective, a short timeline is crucial. Kodanad estate, originally spread across 900 acres and now said to be at least double the size, was co-owned by former chief minister Jayalalithaa and her friend Sasikala when it became one among the ill-gotten assets of the two in the disproportionate assets case initiated in 1996. Jayalalithaa died on December 5, 2016, whereas Sasikala stepped into the Parappana Agrahara jail in Bengaluru on April 15, 2017 to serve the four-year jail-term awarded in the case. And then the ‘Kodanad case’ happens.In the intervening night of April 23-24, 2017 — little more than a month after Sasikala went to jail — the bungalow was broken into. Security guard Om Bahadur was murdered while resisting the intruders, whereas another guard, Kishan Bahadur, was injured. Five days later, on April 28, a prime suspect among the burglars, Kanagaraj, was killed in a road accident in Salem district. A day later, on April 29, another key player K V Sayan’s car met with an accident in Palakkad district, killing his wife and daughter. Sayan survived the crash, and is now seeking further investigation into the Kodanad case saying he has ‘secret information’ that he wants to share with the trial court.On July 3, 2017, Dhinesh Kumar, a Kodanad estate employee handling the CCTV camera and computers, allegedly committed suicide in his home. These developments that happened after the murder-burglary incident beg for an answer about the erased evidence and deaths.Despite the ‘Kodanad case’ having so many unexplained events, was the prosecution right in pushing a one-dimensional storyline, and in showing urgency to complete the trial leaving out key stake-holders? A prosecution witness (pw35) even had the nerve to move the high court seeking day-to-day hearing of the case and quick completion of the trial, thereby indirectly seeking to stall further investigation request of the present team of prosecutors. How is a prosecution witness aggrieved by further investigation, and what is his locus standi in opposing the prosecution’s request for probe?Legally, Section 173(8) of CrPC empowers the prosecution to seek further investigation, which shall culminate in the filing of a supplementary chargesheet. Then, of course, it is the prerogative of the trial court to take cognizance or not of the chargesheet.When substantive justice is the bedrock of our judicial system, can further probe into an unfinished business be resisted? Further probe could dig out more evidence p brushed under the carpet, by design or by oversight, and get justice for the lives lost, and bring to book the culprits. It is for the higher judiciary to ensure that the nod for further probe is not used for political purposes or to prolong the trial endlessly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/how-a-quick-trial-adds-to-the-intrigue-of-the-kodanad-case/articleshow/85740602.cms||Shantha Thyagarajan

---||Hyderabad||Dengue cases rising, but Covid vax jab may cut complications, hosp load||Hyderabad: With dengue cases increasing substantially, experts insist that Covid vaccination is even more important now as it’s likely to cut down chances of complications due to multiple infections. Also, with many different infections and viruses being at play, cutting down the chances of a severe Covid will decrease the load on diagnostic and healthcare machinery. While Covid alone brought the entire healthcare machinery to its knees during the last one and half years, dengue has now started to play havoc. “Currently, entire emergency rooms are nearly full with dengue patients. We have even had to send back some patients in recent days. What we fear is if there is a surge in Covid cases again, it will be a double blow and we will not be able to accommodate patients,” said a staff at a corporate hospital in the city, adding that vaccination will help reduce the patient load. Hospitals are already feeling the burden of rising dengue and fever cases, with individual doctors each seeing up to 15 cases of dengue per day. “There is at least 40-50% rise in dengue cases in the last two to three weeks. It is highly recommended that people suffering from fever undergo test to ascertain potential risk,” said Dr Y Prashanth Chandra, consultant internal medicine, Gleneagles Global Hospitals. Experts have also stressed on the importance of vaccination in tribal and rural areas. “Covid-19 is the most common viral infection at present but once vaccinated the chances of getting symptoms is low. The infection would usually be mild in such cases. Therefore, apart from not requiring hospitalisation, it will be easier to rule out Covid in patients suffering from viral fevers. We should increase Covid vaccination now, particularly in the Agency areas where more dengue cases are recorded,” said Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dengue-cases-rising-but-covid-vax-jab-may-cut-complications-hosp-load/articleshow/85748370.cms||Amrita Didyala

GHMC issued certificates of complete vaccination to 379 colonies on Sunday, the seventh day of Covid-19 mass vaccination drive. With this, the cumulative number of colonies declared as cent per cent vaccinated stands at 2,510. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar said the special drive would cover 4,846 colonies, slums and other areas in GHMC limits and 360 localities in SCB limits. “The team deployed for mobile vaccination drive will be informing people to get vaccinated with date and time in advance. This special mop up drive has been arranged to ensure that all the eligible people in the city are administered with both doses of the vaccine. Adequate quantity vaccine has been made available to cover all households in GHMC and Cantonment areas,” Somesh Kumar said. Mass vaccination was taken up in 432 colonies on Sunday, which takes up the total number of colonies covered to 3,187. As part of the special drive, 28,278 persons have been given the first dose of the vaccine, while the number of those administered the second dose stands at 9964. In the last one week, 1.97 lakh persons have been vaccinated with the first dose, while 47,015 have been given the second dose, taking the total number to 2.44 lakh. In all, 580 mobile vaccination clinics were pressed into service at the allotted colonies by 8 am to carry out the drive.

Though there were announcements that Broadway, one of the streets with narrow roads and old buildings, would be renovated for addressing the issues like frequent fire outbreaks, the plan still remains on paper. Renovation of Broadway has been pending for more than a decade. After the plans failed to take off, the authorities had decided to include the renovation plan in the projects to be implemented by Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML). “When there were minor fire outbreaks, we had found it difficult to take firefighting vehicles into Broadway due to narrow roads,” an official with the fire and rescue services department said. “We had given suggestions in our proposal for providing permanent firefighting facilities like sumps for storing water and fire hydrants in different places on Broadway,” the official said. Even after more than three years, CSML is yet to start the work on the project. “Initially, there was some difference of opinion regarding CMSL carrying out the work. Anyway, we have now decided to implement the project soon. As of now, we are busy with certain road works. Once the road works are over, we will focus on Broadway renovation,” an official with CSML said. The situation is worse on the Market Road and many other roads connected to Ernakulam Market. “The fire engines wouldn’t move through Market Road, Jew Street and Gopalaprabhu Road where there are a lot of commercial units. Unless the authorities take proactive measures to improve the firefighting facilities and put in place regulations in the areas which are prone to fire outbreak, the outcome will be grave if a mishap occurs,” said Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi president K S Dileep Kumar. There are many roads in Fort Kochi and Mattancherry to which firefighting vehicles lack access. “In Fort Kochi and Mattancherry, there are certain colonies also which are not accessible for firefighting vehicles. The fire and rescue department would use small vehicles in case of fire mishaps in such areas. Unfortunately, the water carrying capacity and other firefighting facilities would be limited in small vehicles. This would pose the threat of more casualties once an accident occurs,” said Kochi corporation opposition leader Antony Kureethra. Similarly, there are many roads in Karukapally, Edappally and Vyttila areas to which firefighting vehicles lack access. According to the officials with fire and rescue services department, setting up permanent firefighting facilities in the areas with high density of population and narrow streets with more commercial buildings would help reduce the damage in the event of an accident. “The best example is the facilities arranged by the corporation at Brahmapuram. Following back to back incidents of fire outbreak, the corporation has provided sumps and hydrants at various points in the solid waste treatment plant premises. This helped us a lot when a fire broke out in the waste dumping yard last time,” an official with the fire and rescue services department in Kochi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/lack-of-proper-firefighting-facilities-a-cause-for-concern/articleshow/85748337.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

As they leave for home after the class, some of the students go through the books on the table and approach Vishnu, the ‘librarian’ for taking books home. After writing their names and the date to return it, Vishnu hands over the books to the students. Tucked four km away from Chalakudy – Valparai Road in Athirapally panchayat, the library was set up by Vana Samrakshana Samiti and Vishnu is in charge of it. The library named ‘Arivu,’ has been set up in a community hall, but it seeks the mercy of the outside world for books in order to inculcate reading habits among tribal students from 94 families living in the colony. Besides, the library is planning to provide coaching to tribal youths here for competitive exams as the state government is set to conduct exams to appoint beat officers from tribal communities. The library is used by 38 students, studying from class I to class XII, for attending online classes as there is no mobile range in the colony situated near Edamalayar reservoir. “We managed to get around 140 books, including novels, short stories and the ones on competitive exams. A team from Malappuram has offered to give 40 books. PSC is set to conduct an exam for posting 500 beat officers from the tribal communities, we want to prepare the youngsters here for competitive exams. We are looking to collect more books from well-wishers,” said Jaffar V I, beat forest officer. The officer himself donated PSC books he used to study for competitive exams. To ensure that the students do not miss classes due to power disruption, solar panels are installed in the community hall.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/tribal-library-seeks-publics-help-for-procuring-books/articleshow/85748464.cms||---

The two sub-lineages of Delta— AY.12 and AY.4 — were detected in 42 samples that were recently sent for genome sequencing from Uttarakhand to Delhi. These samples were sent to Delhi between July 14 and August 28. Genomic scientists say that AY.4 strain originated in the UK and sub-lineage AY.12 in Israel, where Covid-19 infections are increasing despite large vaccination coverage. So far, scientists have identified 13 sub-lineages of the Delta variant. Three have been detected in Uttarakhand. A TOI source in the Uttarakhand health department disclosed that AY.12 was found in 32 samples sent from the state while AY.4 was found in 10 samples. As many as nine samples sent from Dehradun were found to have the AY.12 strain, followed by seven samples from Haridwar, four from Chamoli, three from Nainital, two each from Pauri Garhwal, Rudraprayag, and Pithoragarh, and one from Tehri Garhwal. Similarly, the presence of the AY.4 strain — whose cases have been increasing in Karnataka — was found in three samples each from Dehradun and Pithoragarh, and two each from Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar. Uttarakhand's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme officer, Pankaj Singh, told TOI, “So far, these two sub-lineages haven’t been marked virulent.” Recently, the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) had stated that the cases of AY.12 sub-lineage of the Delta variant — which is believed to have caused the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Israel — is surfacing in many Indian states. “Delta is the major variant of concern in India at this time. AY.12, a reassigned sub-lineage of Delta, is being seen in many states, though the numbers need closer examination,” read the INSACOG bulletin. Medical experts in Uttarakhand feel there is a rising need to ensure that people, even if fully vaccinated, follow Covid-19 protocols of wearing a mask and maintaining social distance strictly. “Both the sub-lineages are currently Variants of Interests (VoI). There are chances that they might spread among a larger population and turn into Variants of Concern (VoC),” said Dr Sulekha Nautiyal, head of the Department of Microbiology at Dehradun-based Shri Guru Ram Rai Institute of Medical & Health Science. Meanwhile, social activists have asked the state government to increase Covid-19 testing. “This week (August 22-28), the state recorded a drop in Covid-19 testing by almost 62% in comparison to the previous week. Currently, the state is not recording a high number of cases but if the testing numbers continue to go down this drastically, it will become difficult to get the real picture of the pandemic in the state,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based Social Development for Communities Foundation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/two-delta-strains-with-origins-in-israel-and-uk-detected-in-ukhand-for-1st-time/articleshow/85746050.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Hyderabad||Bharat Biotech rolls out first batch of Covaxin from Ankleshwar in Gujarat||HYDERABAD: In a move that will augment the supply of indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, Bharat Biotech has announced the rollout of the first commercial batch of Covaxin from its Chiron Behring Vaccines facility at Ankleshwar in Gujarat. Supplies of Covaxin doses from the Ankleshwar facility will start from September 2021. The commercial Covaxin batches were launched by Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Sunday at the facility in the presence of Bharat Biotech promoters Dr Krishna Ella and Suchitra Ella. “A new filling facility, which was constructed during 2020 at Ankleshwar, is now being utilized for the production of Covaxin. Covaxin production had begun in early June, before which the team had executed engineering batches to study the equipment functionality at the facility,” Bharat Biotech said. The Ankleshwar facility was a BSL-2+ anti-rabies manufacturing facility that has been repurposed to produce 200 million doses of Covaxin per annum. Chiron Behring Vaccines is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bharat Biotech that was acquired in early 2019 from GlaxoSmithKline. Bharat Biotech said it has already deployed multiple production lines at its Hyderabad, Malur-Bengaluru and Pune campuses, and the addition of the Ankleshwar plant will further augment its Covaxin capacities. Commenting on the occasion, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said: “India is focused on slowing the spread of Covid-19 in the country and the key to achieving this lies in the swift and efficient administration of vaccines. We want to ensure equitable access of the vaccine to every Indian citizen, and the expansion of Covaxin production facilities will take us closer to this goal.” “We want to ensure that Bharat Biotech can ably meet the demand for Covaxin such that individuals across the country, and the globe, have access to the vaccine. Our goal to develop a vaccine with global safety and efficacy standards has now been achieved. We are now marching towards the goal of annualised capacity of around 1 billion doses,” said Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella. The company is also exploring manufacturing partnerships with its partners in other countries that have prior expertise with commercial scale manufacturing of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment for further augmentation, it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bb-rolls-out-first-batch-of-covaxin-from-ankleshwar/articleshow/85748432.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Many schools are reopening for physical classes in a phased manner wherein they would begin with classes for class 8 and above students from September 1. Not just that, many schools have also decided to reduce the school hours. “We propose to start physical classes in a phased manner initially from September 1, 2021 for classes 8th, 9th and 10th. Initially, the classes will be from 9 am to 1 pm. The starting date for the other classes will be informed shortly,” stated authorities from Kalpa School in a notice issued to all the parents along with the consent form. Similar efforts are being taken by schools such as Indus Universal School, Chirec International, Delhi Public School, Nacharam among others. Many schools have decided to continue online classes simultaneously until the end of the term. “As the children have suffered so many disruptions over the past year, we shall not be changing this examination session from the planned and time-tabled online mode as the children have already been preparing and will continue with their self-study, revision classes and examinations online until they conclude,” said Iffat Ibrahim, principal, Chirec International School in a letter to the parents. Since the reopening was declared at such a short notice, some schools have also decided not to offer transportation facility for the time being. “Students need to attend school by own transport. The school transport facility may be provided after September 15 depending on the number of students opting for school transport,” read a circular issued by Sentia -- the Global School.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/city-schools-chalk-out-own-plans-to-adjust-to-new-normal/articleshow/85748390.cms||---

The police say the noise of the heavy rain provides an ideal cover for thieves to break-in unnoticed. Ernakulam Rural SP K Karthick said the police patrolling has been strengthened as a preventive measure against the possibility of such crimes. “More manpower has been mobilised to conduct patrolling at night time during monsoon. Policemen have been directed to conduct inquiries about suspicious persons,” he said. Police officers say that the incessant rain would result in the residents not hearing the thief breaking open a window or another access point to the house. During monsoon, there have even been instances of families waking up in the morning, totally oblivious about their house getting burgled overnight, said police. “Make sure to lock all the doors properly at night. Check if the CCTV cameras in your neighbourhood are working properly. Placing utensils near the windows may also be useful in helping residents become alert in case an attempt is made by thieves to force their way into the house,” said an officer. Officials also urge residents to confirm the identity of visitors at odd hours before opening the door. Officers said it was advisable to leave the lights on at the front and back door of houses. “Never leave tools like axes or iron bars in the open as many burglars rely on tools they find from the premises of the targeted house to break in. If you are suspicious about something or need help, do not hesitate to call the police on 112,” said an officer. Police officers also advise residents to store a search light or a good torchlight at home. “Most burglars try to break into houses after conducting basic surveillance. Locked houses are often targeted, so alert the nearby police station if you plan to leave town after locking the house. It would be ideal to seek the help of a trustworthy neighbour to turn the lights of the house on in the evening, so as to avoid giving an impression that the house is locked. Avoid chances of newspapers getting piled near the gates as well,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/district-police-warn-citizens-of-monsoon-thieves/articleshow/85748374.cms||---

Minister of state for higher education Bhanwar Singh Bhati launched the app here on Saturday to make study materials easily available to college students. Bhati said the College Education Commissionerate was constantly innovating new technology, which is the need of the time. The app will prove to be the next big step in the field of higher education, he added. He said through this app, students will be able to prepare for competitive examinations along with getting study materials for graduation and postgraduation courses. Under this app, different categories of coaching will be given to students. Bhati said the innovation done by the college education department will prove to be helpful in giving a new direction to higher education. Commissioner of college education Sandesh Nayak said a MoU had been signed between the commissionerate college education and MyBookLo company to provide curriculum-wise digital study materials to students. Under this, there will be a digital library for college students where students can get video and PDF notes. Earlier, college education department had launched five online courses for students to enhance their skills.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/state-launches-mybooklo-app-for-college-students/articleshow/85750784.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Special vaccine drive likely to be extended in Old city||HYDERABAD: Health officials are likely to extend the door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination programme for a few more days because of the sluggish progress in Old City. GHMC and the health department have taken up a 15-day vaccination effort to ensure the city is fully vaccinated. Official sources said many people in the Old City were scared that the vaccine would cause negative effects and questioned its efficacy. “Despite efforts to explain the benefits of the vaccine, some families are unwilling to receive it. We cannot force them,” the sources said. When the door-to-door drive began, over 70% of the eligible people had been inoculated in the city. However, officials were facing difficulties convincing the remaining 30%. “Most people in Old City are hesitant to provide data and generally refuse to provide specifics about the vaccine they received. In some areas, they even locked their houses and became incommunicado,” a government employee, who is part of the vaccine drive, said. The officials have noted details of families who refuse to take the vaccine as “unwilling”. Leaving such houses, they have been declaring the area as completely vaccinated. Approximately 37 lakh people have received Covid- 19 vaccine in the city so far. But a few government vaccine centres in the Old City have not been able to administer more than 3,000 jabs since the first phase of the vaccine drive began in March. Another issue encountered was the 30-minute mandated time mobile trucks had to spend after administering the jab. “Spending 30 minutes in each area is challenging,” the sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/special-vaccine-drive-likely-to-be-extended/articleshow/85748421.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||India||Actor Armaan held in drugs case day after house search||MUMBAI: Actor Armaan Kohli was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Sunday for allegedly possessing 1.2gm of cocaine. The NCB had conducted a search at the actor’s Andheri residence on Saturday in a drug-related case after his name cropped up when they were questioning alleged peddler, Ajay Singh, who was arrested the same morning. A holiday court remanded Kohli and Singh, who have been charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act for procurement, possession, sale purchase transport and illicit trafficking and harbouring offenders, to NCB custody till Monday. While NCB officers claim that prima facie they have found Kohli’s links with peddlers, including some foreign nationals, sources said that the actor can seek bail as the quantity of cocaine seized from him is 1.2gm, which falls under the ‘personal consumption’ category. If the defence proves that the quantity seized is for consumption only, the court may relieve Kohli and ask him to undergo a three-month rehabilitation programme. But NCB officials pointed out that in the arrest of Siddharth Pithani, the flatmate of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, they did not find any drugs on him, but had found his links with suppliers. “In Kohli’s case too, we arrested peddler Singh from whom we recovered 25gm of mephedrone and his interrogation led us to the actor. When we carried out a search at Kohli’s residence, we found 1.2gm of cocaine there,” said an officer. Probe into the drugs case has found international links as the seized cocaine has South American origin. NCB Mumbai has also found WhatsApp chats and financial transactions. The agency is now probing the route and linkages used to bring drugs into Mumbai and the involvement of other traffickers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/actor-armaan-held-in-drugs-case-day-after-house-search/articleshow/85754012.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Civic body steps up drive to swat dengue risk in schools||HYDERABAD: In view of the increase in dengue cases and safety of children who are required to go to school starting September 1, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has intensified its anti-larval and fogging operations along with the special sanitation drive in the city. During the last three days, the entomology wing of the civic body has taken up anti-larval operations in 1,371 educational institutions, fogging in 1,039 and sanitisation in 1,328 institutions. This comes after the GHMC recently found that with the onset of monsoon, there is a gradual increase in the presence of ‘Aedes aegypti’ mosquitoes, the carrier of dengue virus, in the city. Locked houses, schools and construction sites where there is stagnant water in washrooms, containers, sumps and tanks are the biggest menace during this season. “Aedes mosquito requires just one teaspoon of water to lay its eggs and for the larvae to fully develop into an adult mosquito. Since all schools have been shut for months together, due to the pandemic, they can be a good spot for mosquito breeding,” said Dr A Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC. “To ensure that there is no stagnant water for these mosquitoes to breed in schools and its surrounding areas, we are taking up a slew of measures, including effective surveillance, which will continue up till this month-end and then there will be a follow-up once weekly,” said Rambabu. This apart, for effective implementation of the drive, the GHMC also identified breeding hotspots in the city and categorised them into construction sites, schools, function halls, cellars, open plots and locked houses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/civic-body-steps-up-drive-to-swat-dengue-risk-in-schools/articleshow/85748454.cms||---

---||Delhi||Two Delhi schools get RO plants that will dispense 500 litres water every hour||NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman and AAP MLA Raghav Chaddha inaugurated reverse osmosis (RO) plants at two schools, located in Inderpuri and Naraina, on Sunday. “These RO plants have a capacity to purify and dispense 500 litres of water every hour, which will bring new hope for the students, teachers and non-teaching staff in both the schools. There will be approximately 11,000 individuals, who will benefit from the plants in the schools every day,” Chadha said. “Ensuring the health and hygiene of young children will be of prime importance when the schools reopen post-pandemic. Implementation of RO water plants is a small but significant step in the same direction which aims to help students, teachers and other staff to get access to clean and safe drinking water,” he said. The RO plants are working in a model under which 60% is potable water and 40% wastewater, which is further utilised for rainwater harvesting pits. “I have always maintained that it is our duty to ensure that all residents of my constituency have access to clean drinking water and all other basic necessities,” the Rajinder Nagar MLA said. Chadha said the initiative is an example of public private partnership where corporate social responsibility kicks in for welfare of people with assistance from the state government. “Tata Power-DDL has installed 83 such RO plants till date at educational institutions, JJ clusters and Metro stations, catering to 3.78 lakh people daily,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/2-schools-get-ro-plants-that-will-dispense-500-litres-water-every-hr/articleshow/85748478.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Rope in vax volunteers for booster shot study’||MUMBAI: Even as a global debate rages on the need and timing for a booster dose, Indian experts recommend an easy solution – roping in last year’s vaccine trial volunteers for a follow-up study. With these volunteers soon completing a year of vaccination, testing them for antibodies could help the government gauge the level of protection and the need for a third shot. No follow-up tests have been done on these volunteers after the results of their six-month trial studies were unblinded in March-April. Dr Suresh Sundar, retired medical teacher, who had volunteered for the trial last September, said new variants of the virus have been detected ever since they had taken vaccines and there is a possibility of exposure, despite taking all safety precautions. “We are awaiting guidelines from the ICMR or the Serum Institute on the booster doses,” he said. Partha Majumder, distinguished professor from the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, said the study on trial volunteers could prove to be resourceful. He recommends a comprehensive assessment of antibodies, if at all such a study is considered. A series of immunoglobulin tests (including G, M and A) can help in determining the complete picture a year after vaccination, he said. In Mumbai, doctors, nurses and ancillary staffers, who have finished six months after vaccination, have started discussing booster shots. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state Covid taskforce said that some have got their neutralising antibodies checked recently and found depletion in levels. “Sooner or later we will need answers whether certain groups need a booster shot,” he added. Pune-based immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal said that it would make sense to rope in previous trial participants, and check their level of antibodies. “The currently available vaccines were all tested against the initial strain of the virus and not Delta. “So, such a study may help find some answers,” she added. Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of KEM Hospital, said that such studies can be taken up by the vaccine manufacturing companies on a section of trial volunteers, to avoid burden on government machinery. “Trial volunteers are the right candidates for the study as they were among the first to receive vaccines. If significant numbers show depleting antibodies, it could help government frame guidelines on booster doses,” he said. Currently, though, such a trial may give rise to questions about vaccine equity, say experts. “We have to be mindful of our own situation and that of the Global South, where several countries are grappling to provide even a single dose,” said Bal. In her opinion, instead of wanting to have a third shot with the present vaccine, it would be generous to spare the vaccine shots for those who haven’t got any. As on Friday, only half of India’s adult population eligible for Covid vaccines had received at least one dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rope-in-vax-volunteers-for-booster-shot-study/articleshow/85750801.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi: Posing as ED officers, crooks extort businessmen||NEW DELHI: With the arrest of four people, including a small-time film producer, Crime Branch of Delhi Police has busted a gang whose members posed as Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials to extort businessmen. The gang was led by Santosh Rai, a notorious cheat with a dozen cases lodged against him. The gang used to spoof official phone numbers and email IDs ending with “.nic” of agencies like ED and Delhi Police and send money laundering notices to businessmen. When contacted by targets, they would refer the targets to their aide, who would pose as an advocate and promise to get the case settled in lieu of a hefty amount. The investigation was started after ED informed police about having received several complaints about a person, who called himself Rajeev Singh, impersonating as an officer of the Directorate of Enforcement. He used to sent the targets fake notices and called them from landline numbers of government offices. “Preliminary inquiry by ED revealed that the notices sent by Rajeev Singh, special regional officer, central region office, were fake as no such officer with this name and designation existed. The forged summons under Section 50 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act and notices under Section 41 of CrPC were issued to terrorise the victims,” said a senior police officer. ED also forwarded a complaint from a person who had been approached by the crooks. An FIR was filed under IPC sections of extortion, cheating, fraud, criminal conspiracy and impersonation. A team comprising inspector Vivekanand Jha and others was formed to probe the case. Probe revealed that the accused were using apps to spoof emails and were making calls from the numbers of different government offices to scare the victims. After analysing the pattern, conducting technical surveillance and getting inputs from the victims, a trap was laid and the four accused, including Rai, were nabbed while going to take money from the target. During interrogation, Rai revealed that one Afzal Ahmed, who was out on parole in a murder case, had hatched the conspiracy with his aides — Kuldeep, Sanjay and Arjun Raghav — to earn big money. Raghav contacted Rai, who gave the final shape to the plan and eventually executed it. He roped in a cyber expert, Aakash Chauhan, to help him spoof emails IDs and phone numbers. Efforts are on to nab them. Another accused, Bhupender Singh Gossain, was working with a law firm since 2002 in Patiala House Courts. He facilitated usage of the lawyers’ chambers within the court premises to his associates so that the victims believed they were real advocates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/posing-as-ed-officers-crooks-extort-bizmen/articleshow/85748556.cms||---

Recently, a meeting was convened at the Karnataka Bhavan in New Delhi to plan strategies and future course of action to ensure that the Kalasa-Bhandura project work materialises. A legal team consisting of Mohan Katarki, Shyam Divan and others were present during the meet. Immediately after he took over as chief minister, Bommai had asserted before mediapersons in Karnataka that he would complete the unfinished work on the Kalasa-Bhandura project on priority basis. Farmers of the water guzzling crop, sugarcane, in Karnataka, have also begun their pressure tactics through protests. The central government on February 26, 2020, notified the award of the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal that was given on August 14, 2018. The Supreme Court bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi have upheld that the Mhadei Water Management Authority must be constituted and that a detailed project report (DPR) must be approved by this authority before Karnataka can begin work on the Kalasa-Bhandura project. However, Karnataka has left no available opportunity to take up damming and diversion of water of the Kalasa into the Malaprabha basin. The natural flow of the water into the Mhadei has been altered by the state. Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd has already completed work on 5.1km of the canal at the cost of Rs 244.9 crore. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has scheduled the hearing in the Mhadei matter on the Special Leave Petition on September 8. The contempt petition is scheduled to come up for hearing on September 9. Advocate general of Goa, Devidas Pangam, told TOI, “As the senior counsel for Goa P S Narsimha has been inducted as one of the Supreme Court judges. The Goa government is in the process of appointing a new counsel. We have also kept ready our submissions in the Mhadei matter and are making our best effort to protect the interest of Goa.” As per the directives of the apex court, superintending engineers of Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka have already independently submitted their reports on their findings of the status of the Kalasa work in Kankumbi. Karnataka was making efforts to involve the regional director of the Central Water Commission (CWC), Bengaluru, to conduct the inspection at Kankumbi. However, the Goa government took objection to this by writing a letter to CWC, New Delhi, on August 12, 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/new-karnataka-cm-begins-work-to-expedite-mhadei-diversion-project/articleshow/85750887.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Talking to TOI, Mayur Dixit, district magistrate Uttarkashi, said, “The collectorate and other government buildings often become the identity of a particular town. If constructed with traditional architecture, these buildings will not only promote local culture but also develop a sense of pride and individuality among people. We can see several traditionally constructed government buildings in different cities of South India. Our state government has also been promoting this trend which motivated us to take the initiative.” The official added, “In the first phase of renovation, we installed carved Deodar wood, ceramic tiles and local black stone (known as 'pataal') at the exterior of the building. On close observation, people will get to see the depictions of Gangotri and Yamunotri temples, Himalayan flora and fauna, and scenes of local fairs and festivals beautifully carved on the wood. Besides, we have also got a life-size statue of the elusive snow leopard found in our district.” He further said, “In the next phase, we will work on earthquake resistance capacity of the building, cent percent digitalisation, and underground electric wiring” The initiative has received appreciation from locals and has motivated other government agencies to follow a similar trend. “We are delighted over the positive response we have been receiving. Other government agencies like the health department and the nagar panchayat have also shown interest in renovating their offices in the traditional style,” added DM Dixit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/uttarkashi-collectorate-building-renovated-in-traditional-pahadi-architectural-style/articleshow/85746124.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Biodegradable waste: Corp plans EoI for bulk collection||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation is set to call for an Expression of Interest (EoI) from bulk waste collectors as part of devising a revenue generation model for biodegradable waste on the lines of dry waste. The health wing of the corporation is already awaiting nod from the council for its proposal to rake in money from collection and transportation of around 11 types of dry waste. The draft EoI has been completed and is expected to be issued within two weeks. Pet bottles and hard plastic, two of the major components of non-biodegradable waste in the city, will fetch the corporation Rs 15 and Rs 13 per kilogram respectively. Coloured plastic, rubber and coconut shell are other items for which the corporation will receive money from the firm for transportation. The most commonly dumped plastic waste; milk cover will earn the corporation Rs 13 per kg while carry bags will be transported at Rs 7 per kg. Oil covers, white plastic covers and paper waste are other types of dry waste for which corporation will now earn money for collection and transportation. A similar revenue generation model is being pitched for collection of biodegradable waste from households. The civic body, despite several attempts, has not been able to take any concrete steps towards identification of land for setting up a centralized treatment facility although a council session had given the approval for a centralized facility. Twenty-eight pig farm owners in the district have recently formed a collective. The city corporation plans to call for an EoI from interested parties who can collect biodegradable waste on a daily basis at a specified rate from the city limits. In addition to pig farm owners, those who need it for manure purpose are also being considered. In the meantime, the civic body has been slowly increasing the inflow of household waste to aerobic bins set up in different wards. The health wing has categorized bins under A, B, C and D groups based on daily volume of waste received from households. The officials said that in the past three months, many bins which were in D category could be shifted to A category after waste flow from households increased. Door-to-door waste collection has been resumed in three wards on an experimental basis in the city. Seven more wards will be added to this system. As per the plan, Haritha Karma Sena will be used for door-to-door collection of waste and the waste will be transported to designated collection points from where bulk waste collectors will receive the waste. The recently held council meeting saw a heated debate over the expenses being borne by the city corporation for waste management. BJP councillors said that the corporation spent Rs 150 crore in 10 years for waste management but no results were seen on the ground. The corporation officials maintain that even without a centralized plant, corporation has been able to manage 70% of waste being generated in the city and for that only a reasonable investment needs to be done every year. “With revenue generation model becoming a reality for wet waste, any deficit in income and expenditure could be bridged soon,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/biodegradable-waste-corp-plans-eoi-for-bulk-collection/articleshow/85748512.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The department has asked schools to implement the Punjab and Haryana High Court order in two months. Schools have also been asked to post fees charged from students on the website. Schools have been given strict instructions not to increase fees during the academic session. They have also been prohibited from charging capitation fees. The department warned of strict action against schools violating the orders. It is learned that the Punjab and Haryana High Court had, on May 28 this year, directed schools to upload their income balance sheets on the school website. The court had asked the education department to give private schools reasonable time to implement the orders. However, the schools did not follow court orders and the UT education department also did not issue notices to the schools as the matter was in court. Parents Association president, Chandigarh Nitin Goyal said UT had implemented the Fee Regulatory Act in the year 2018 in Chandigarh. According to the Act, private schools were ordered to post their income, expenditure and balance sheets on their websites. He said the high court had pronounced its verdict in May and the department has now given schools two more months to upload it on the website. According to the Fees Act, if fee is increased by more than 8%, schools up to class V will be fined Rs 60,000 for the first time, Rs 1.20 lakh for the second time and Rs 30 lakh for the third time. Schools up to Class VIII will be fined Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh and de-recognition respectively, schools up to Class XII will be fined Rs 2 lakh, Rs 4 lakh and de-recognition respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/schools-asked-to-disclose-income/articleshow/85748501.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Detour for Vidyasagar Setu||Kolkata: At least 13 local bus routes - which ply on Vidyasagar Setu - will have to take more than a 300 metre detour from Kona Football Gate and climb on to a specific bus bay that will be specifically created on lane 9 to reach Kazipara bus stop while coming towards Kolkata. The decision - taken after a meeting between Howrah Traffic Police and Kolkata Traffic Police in the presence of the bus owners on Friday - has been conveyed to Hooghly River Bridge Commissioner's office, the custodians of the bridge. The system will be operational from as early as September 1. The decision to use lane 9 was taken as it is the broadest lane available on the bridge. The decision - claim both police forces - will stop overtaking and illegal speeding. All longer distance buses though will continue to use lanes 1-5. The police have decided that the buses available at the bus bay will have to stick to the route allotted to them. "Any violation will lead to prosecution," said an officer. The police though have not taken a final decision on removing the Kazipara bus stand permanently. "There will be more consultation with HRBC in this respect. The bus bay itself should help in cutting down the usual traffic violations witnessed at the bus stand," said an officer adding this will stop buses from entering any random bay and stopping the passengers from running around and endangering themselves. Informatory signages will be put up for drivers to move along the bay, said cops. Back at Kolkata, the Vidyasagar Setu traffic guard said they are planning to switch the Hastings stop a little further down towards Turf View. "The Howrah bound buses tend to take the right lane all through after the PTS stop thus blocking the lane usually availed by the smaller four wheelers. We are trying to organize the area," said an officer. Earlier, five accidents reported on the Vidyasagar Setu in the past two months - three of them fatal - has prompted the Kolkata Traffic Police to write to the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioner's office requesting them to introduce some specific new road furniture. The five suggestions, drafted by DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha, are aimed at bringing down accidents on the bridge and its approaches. The police said these steps, once implemented, will also help in stopping people from jumping off from top of the bridge (two incidents have been recorded in the past two months). The suggestions include putting up mesh wires on both flanks of the bridge, increasing the height of railings by 2 metre by placing rolling barriers that can act as shock absorbers, using rolling barriers as median dividers, better illumination at particular points on the bridge and its approaches and introducing several more red blinkers to mark lanes and bifurcations. The police said that the height of the concrete barrier, on the edges of the bridge on both sides, may be increased by two feet by placing a rolling barrier system as a protective shock absorber to prevent vehicles involved in accidents from toppling off the bridge. Similarly, instead of using metallic barriers the same rolling barriers can be used - up to the height of four feet - to stop vehicles from moving over from one flank to another in case of severe accidents. In the past, multiple such instances were noticed on the Setu. The police have also argued for installing welded wire mesh on both flanks of the bridge to dissuade people from jumping from the top of the bridge. BOX: What's the plan from September 1: At least 13 local bus routes - which ply on Vidyasagar Setu - will have to take more than a 300 metre detour from Kona Football Gate and climb on to a specific bus bay that will be specifically created on lane 9 to reach Kazipara bus stop while coming towards Kolkata All long distance buses to use lanes 1-5 What are the other suggestions by Kolkata Police? * The police said that the height of the concrete barrier, on the edges of the bridge on both sides, may be increased by two feet by placing a rolling barrier system as a protective shock absorber to prevent vehicles involved in accidents from toppling off the bridge. * Instead of using metallic barriers the same rolling barriers can be used - up to the height of four feet - to stop accident involved vehicles from moving over from one flank to another. * Installing welded wire mesh on both flanks of the bridge to dissuade people from jumping from the top of the bridge. * The police have asked for sufficient illumination too, especially at night pointing out how some high mast lights have stopped functioning for a long time. * More red blinkers should be used lanes, curves and bifurcations to alert drivers in advance * The cops said there is also a need to put up new informatory signages with retro reflective tapes so as to allow the drivers - especially outsiders entering the city - know the exact direction he has to drive||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/detour-for-vidyasagar-setu/articleshow/85748576.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

On Friday and Saturday, no water was supplied and on Sunday, it was supplied in low pressure. For the last five months, similar situation is there in the entire area. Around 30,000 population of the area is affected by poor water supply. The area comes under Ward 81 of Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater where 13 colonies, including Bajrang Vihar, Shanti Nagar, Jadon Nagar, Madhav Nagar and others come. Suresh Goyal from Bajrang Nagar colony said that this problem is there in the area for the last five months. “The water is supplied either for a few minutes in which the pressure is so low that we can’t fill up two buckets or not supplied at all. We have complained many times but don’t know what the problem is,” said Goyal. Another resident B S Verma from Shanti Nagar said that residents are ordering tankers to meet water requirement in the area. They have been asked by the government that the matter is under consideration and very soon solution will be done. Reacting to the complaints, PHED officials have claimed that very soon another pump house and new tanks will be constructed in the area. For this financial sanction has been received and very soon a six-kilometre-long pipeline will be laid down. The councillor of the area Jay Vashishtha said that this problem wasn’t there five months back, but since the area is now being divided into two zones, water crisis is continuing. “PHED has divided the area in two zones in which water is supplied to one zone in the morning and other in the evening. But this has further created problem. PHED officials have given us just assurance, but nothing has been resolved,” said Vashistha. Residents have protested against the problems many times and want quick solution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/water-crisis-hits-over-30k-people-near-durgapura/articleshow/85750807.cms||---

The train will start running from September 9, the booking for which started on Saturday. Officials claimed this will benefit passengers from Rajasthan as well as now they can travel in AC, which previously might not have been affordable otherwise. The North Western Railway (NWR) has also received these coaches, which will be attached to trains operating in this zone in the coming days. “In the new economy coaches, a total of 83 berths will be there, which is an increase from the 72 berths which are usually present in AC3 Tier. Increase in berths has been done by reducing space between them marginally and through other measures. This can be compared to as how the economy travel is in commercial flights. The fare of travel in economy coaches has been reduced and it will be benefit passengers from Rajasthan as they can travel in AC without having to pay a big amount ,”said an official of NWR. Some of the facilities in the new coaches will include an enabling entrance and compartment for Divyangjan with wheelchair access and as well as disabled friendly toilet with wheelchair access. There is also improved passenger conveniences in form of foldable snack tables in both longitudinal and transverse bays, injury free spaces and holders for water bottles, mobile phone and magazines. Railway Coach Factory, Kapurthala, had earlier this year rolled out the first prototype Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) AC three-tier economy class coach of Indian Railways which will be introduced in all Mail/Express trains running with LHB coaches (except Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto and Jan Shatabdi).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/prayagraj-jaipur-exp-to-have-new-economy-ac-3-tier-coaches/articleshow/85750838.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi HC fumes over wrong information on rape convict||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has demanded an explanation from the prison authorities over why the correct facts relating to a man’s conviction being modified from gang rape to rape were not placed before the Sentence Review Board (SRB). The court directed the Delhi Prisons director general to file an affidavit also indicating the reasons why the SRB was informed that the case was for the offences of gang rape and robbery instead of the modified punishment. “In view of the fact that complete and correct facts were not brought to the notice of the SRB, director general (prisons) is directed to ensure that while putting up the case of the petitioner before the SRB in its next meeting, the judgment of conviction passed by the trial court as also the judgment of this court in appeal, whereby, the petitioner has been convicted only for the offence punishable under section 376 IPC and the gist thereof, will be placed before the committee,” Justice Mukta Gupta said in a recent order. The court’s direction came after the convict, through his lawyer, told the court that though he was convicted for the offence of gang rape, the high court later modified the charge to rape based on an appeal but maintained the life imprisonment. The counsel said the man’s case was repeatedly being rejected by the SRB as correct facts were not placed before it by the authorities, which had conveyed his conviction for gang rape. He further said the man’s conduct in prison was exemplary, and he has not misused the concession granted to him in the form of parole and furlough, which is why he deserves to be considered for remission. “The petitioner has been granted appreciation certificates in jail and has been granted paroles/furloughs a number of times, which he did not misuse,” the counsel informed the court. The counsel added that during his jail term, the convict lost his father and sister and now the family of the petitioner comprises of his mother only. The high court asked the authorities to file a status report with the outcome of the next Sentence Review Board meeting before the next hearing in the case on October 22.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-fumes-over-wrong-info-on-rape-convict/articleshow/85748548.cms||---

---||Hubballi||28 books to be released to mark MM Kalburgi’s death anniversary||VIJAYAPURA: To mark six years since the death of rationalist and writer Prof MM Kalburgi, a group of writers have organised an event on Monday wherein a large number of books on the life and thoughts of the slain scholar will be released in Kadani village in the erstwhile Sindagi taluk in Vijayapura district – the late author’s hometown.  Kalburgi, an outspoken rationalist and progressive thinker, was shot dead at his home on August 30, 2015. Apart from books about Kalburgi, a title on the life of Tontadaraya Swamiji, a progressive seer, who was a student of the former, is also being released on the occasion. Convener of Beragu Prakashana in Kadani village, now part of Almel taluk in Vijayapura district, Ramesh Katti told TOI that the ceremony was being organised to honour the legacy of Kalburgi. “The books being released on Monday vary in form and content. There are novels, essays, academic treatises and dramas. We are holding the event in Kadani, which is only 25km from Yargal, where Kalburgi hailed from. Some of Kalburgi’s relatives are expected to participate in the ceremony,” Katti said. Senior author Siddaram Uppin, who is slated to speak on all the 28 books to be released at the ceremony, said that all the titles had at their core the ideas Kalburgi championed in his lifetime. “A book written by Geeta Harihar focuses on his life and thoughts, while the drama ‘Kariyu Kannadiyolage’ by Hooli Shakhar underscores the relevance of the principles of Basavanna, while also chronicling the killing of the Sharana saints in the 12th century. ‘Devarugalive Echharike’ by KAS officer and actor Sangamesh Upase, is a book that touches upon the injustice that happens in the name of God. The drama emphasises the equality of all religions. In the play, Kalburgi’s killer is caught, and the slain thinker himself sits as judge in the trial,” Uppin said. Although the event was originally slated to be held in Sindagi town, it was shifted too Kadani at the behest of senior writer Ha Ma Pujar, said Uppin. “Not only is it a fitting tribute to Kalburgi, it is also an effort to purge the village of its reputation that it is ‘Bhima River Bank’ of rowdyism. The banks of the river Bhima is the cauldron of rich folklore, and has a vibrant literary and cultural heritage. Like the Cauvery, Bhima is also a holy river,” Uppin added. The book on Kalburgi’s student and progressive seer Siddhalinga Mahaswamiji of Tontadaraya Mutt in Gadag was authored by Shankar Baichabal, said Katti. “It will be a gathering of thinkers and writers in the rural marshes,” said Katti. Chairman of Kannada Development Authority and award-winning filmmaker TS Nagabharana will release the 28 books on Monday at the Sri PB Composite PU College in Kadani village. Prof HT Pote and Prof Rajashekhar Mathapati, and the authors of the 28 books will be among those in attendance at the event.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/28-books-to-be-released-to-mark-mm-kalburgis-death-anniversary/articleshow/85746195.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Besides making the new design pedestrian friendly, the street will have a covered venue, sculptures, art gallery space, park, street library, gender friendly toilets, drinking water fountains, food kiosks and cycle parking area. The design was approved by the SCTL board in 2019 following stakeholder consultations with government departments and art groups. The design involves dividing the road carriageway into two half-ways out of which one half will be earmarked for cultural activities, and the other half will be used as a 7.5 m wide road which will be open to traffic. In the first phase, underground utility ducts will be constructed to relay the overhead utility cables in these ducts. Smart road works are already underway in 10 corporation roads covering a distance of two km. In PWD roads, work has begun on Manaveeyam road and the stretch near Bakery junction. The project encompasses features like footpaths, safe pathways, junction improvements, storm water drains, utility conduits and underground ducts for electrical, KWA and communication lines. Besides landscaping, streetscaping, provision of smart street furniture, creating and developing basic conveniences along the roads are also included under the scope of work. It also includes development and remodelling of existing/new storm water drainage systems. The project covers 36.94 km of smart roads, including 7.40 km of white topping surface, (KRFB & PWD Roads) within the Thiruvananthapuram area based development (ABD). About 21 roads under KRFB measuring 15 km, 37 stretches under PWD measuring 20.4 km and three roads under PWD-NH will be developed as smart roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/sctl-to-give-manaveeyam-veedhi-a-facelift-soon/articleshow/85748606.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s vaccination will take year at current rate||MUMBAI: The state would have to vaccinate more than 10 lakh people every day if it wishes to fully immunise its adult population by December, a TOI analysis has found. But the Centre’s supply, which has been disproportionate to the state’s demand till now, will never be adequate to meet that goal, say experts, who recommend a stronger push for private participation. At the current rate, vaccianting the entire state will take between 11 months and a year more. Maharashtra has an adult population of 9.58 crore, which means the state needs 19.16 crore vaccines to fully inoculate all. Till date, it has administered 5.71 crore doses, and needs over 13 crore doses more. The state is typically allotted anywhere between 1.15 crore and 1.2 crore doses by the Centre every month. Although in September, Maharashtra has been assured of a slightly more 1.7 crore doses, it won’t take the state anywhere close to fully vaccinating even half of its population. Procuring the vaccine directly from manufacturers is not an option for the government, public health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI on Sunday, even though the production capacity of vaccine manufacturers may have increased. “We cannot directly procure vaccines since doses are committed to the Centre. In the past too, we had floated global tenders, but we couldn’t buy vaccines,” he said, admitting that the quota allotted to state would not be enough to meet the December target. In the limited window that the states were provided in May and the first week of June to buy their own vaccines, Maharashtra had placed orders for just 25.1 lakh doses. At least six states had ordered more doses than Maharashtra. UP, for instance, bought the highest number of doses at 67.33 lakh. Bihar bought 44.39 lakh, MP bought 32 lakh doses and Rajasthan, over 30 lakh doses. Asked why Maharashtra couldn’t purchase in higher numbers given its population, Tope said the supplies were limited and companies were not able to provide a clear supply timeline. The minister said the route of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is open and being explored. He cited the example of Risod taluka in Akola, where vaccination has been heavily supported by Ajanta Pharma. Mumbai, which had taken the lead in exploring the CSR initiative, has not had a very enthusiastic response after the initial buzz. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city got 6 lakh doses via CSR. “Calls and enquiries have dried up now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/states-vaccination-will-take-yr-at-current-rate/articleshow/85750967.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Chandigarh||40% staff in Mohali govt schools yet to be fully vaccinated||MOHALI: Mohali deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan has directed the district education officer (DEO) to conduct physical testing of students and submit a report to him. Dayalan issued orders after getting reports that no physical testing and checking was being conducted in government schools across the district. He also noticed that 40% of the total staff in government schools across the district was yet to be fully vaccinated. Taking serious note of this, the DC directed the DEO to issue orders to ensure physical inspection of schools at random to check vaccination details of the school staff, including principal, teachers, peons and babysitters. Dayalan said, “We have observed that data from government schools was being taken verbally whereas physical checking was not being done. So, we have issued orders to the DEO to physically check the staff and conduct testing of the section of school children at random, taking evasive action if found positive.” DEO Mohali failed to produce data of total children tested in government schools and if anyone was found positive and action taken thereafter. There are a total of 648 schools in Mohali, in which 1,25,647 students have been enrolled. Of these, only 1,620 students have been attending classes, which is only 1.29%. There are a total of 4,826 staff members working in these schools, of whom 2,874 have been fully vaccinated and the remaining are yet to get the second dose. Recently, teams constituted by the DC to check private schools found that the principal, teachers, peons and babysitters in many schools in the district did not even have a single dose of vaccination or had just one dose and were interacting with children in schools. Members of the management of four such schools have been booked under relevant sections. These schools include Jitender Veer Sarvhitkari Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 71, DAV Model Senior Secondary School, Kurali, Manav Mangal Smart School, Zirakpur and Delhi World Public School, Zirakpur. Principal Kavita Attri of Sarvhitkari School has not taken even a single dose of the Covid vaccine and she was found to be attending office at her school. The school managements have been booked under sections 188, 269, 270 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 51 of the Disaster Management Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/40-staff-in-mohali-govt-schools-yet-to-be-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85748581.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

---||Kolkata||Suman Dhakuria bridge 29.08.21||Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is analyzing the soil character of Dhakuria bridge to determine how stabilizing work could be done to prevent the both approach ends of the bridge from further receding. Earlier following structural assessment tests and health audit, the approach ends of the bridge have been found to have subsided a bit due to its weakened structure caused by rats gnawing at its base. “Soil sample collection work has been completed. The consulting agency which has been engaged is now analyzing the soil samples to determine its properties and character after which the agency will be giving recommendations as to how to take up the stabilizing work on the approach ends on both sides of the bridge which has subsided a bit due to rats gnawing on its base structure,” said a KMDA official. Officials said that the agency is finding out how much soil compaction is there beneath the surface. “Once the soil status is known, work could be taken accordingly like grouting to fill up the void inside the base and to stabilize it to stop the upper layer from further receding as it has been noticed”, said a KMDA official. KMDA authorities had conducted a load test of the bridge, which is over 50 years of age, earlier last year. It was noticed some years back that rats were chewing into the bridge’s base structure as large holes and cracks were noticed. The authorities took up repair work and the holes were filled up but the damage was done on the bridge’s internal structure as the approach ends of the bridge was found to have receded slightly. The bridge’s expansion joints that had weakened were also repaired back in 2018. Among other bridges, KMDA is planning to engage agencies for doing structural condition assessment including load tests and preparing detail project reports for repair and retrofitting works of three bridges over Tolly Nullah. These are Dhana Dhanyo setu at Alipore, Kidderpore steel bridge and Doi Ghat bridge.Health audit of several flyover and bridges in the city including their load taking capacity tests have been completed and repair work of some of the bridges are going on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/suman-dhakuria-bridge-29-08-21/articleshow/85748699.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Delhi||Why Delhi hospitals may not have to send SOS on O2: Hi-tech devices to give out alerts on mobile app||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is not only ramping up oxygen production, storage and transportation infrastructure with an eye on a likely third wave of Covid-19, but also installing a state-of-the-art system to give alerts on a mobile app as soon as oxygen level or pressure at the storage tanks starts dipping. A hundred “remote telemetry units” would be installed in oxygen storage tanks and cryogenic tankers, which would enable remote monitoring of the oxygen level and pressure on a central database through web and mobile apps. Not only hospitals won’t need to send SOS messages in case of a crisis, but the system would also be able to predict oxygen demand based on the usage pattern. “We will be installing these devices in all our storage tanks rather than depending on individual phone calls when the oxygen levels become critical. It’s very important to have an automated system and these telemetry units will be part of it. All these devices will be installed in the storage tanks in different parts of the city, but will be able to ‘talk’ to the central database,” said a Delhi government official. Each telemetry unit would have three channels, one for a sensor that would measure the oxygen level, another for a sensor to check tank pressure and a differential pressure transmitter. The unit would be connected with a central control hub for monitoring through software, including web and mobile apps, which would be specifically developed for this system. Access to the software would be limited to only a few officials and personnel. The system would send alert notifications ranging from low, critical to empty, based on the status report sent by the telemetry devices. This would not only help in oxygen management and averting a crisis immediately, but also assist in deciding forecast based on the tank level and an “intuitive dashboard”. Daily tank status reports would be sent in compatible formats, including history of refill and consumption. The digital telemetry units would run on electricity with eight hours battery backup and be remotely accessible through geographical interface and mapping. In June, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that as part of large-scale preparations in case the city had to battle a third Covid-19 wave, the buffer liquid medical oxygen storage capacity would be enhanced by 421 metric tonnes. Apart from pressure swing adsorption plants within hospital premises for oxygen generation, the government was also increasing storage capacity and cryogenic vertical tanks with net capacity of more than 50 tonnes. A fleet of oxygen cryogenic tankers was also being created and Delhi Transport Corporation was entrusted with procuring and operating tankers. To begin with, 15 such tankers were being procured.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-hospitals-may-not-have-to-send-sos-on-o2-hi-tech-devices-to-give-out-alerts-on-mobile-app/articleshow/85748657.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Water bodies to get facelift||Thiruvananthapuram: Ayira and Puliyoor ponds in Karode panchayat here will soon get a new life as authorities have initiated works for cleaning and renovating the ponds with Nabard’s aid. The seven-acre Ayira pond along the Chenkavila-Ayira road was a major source for farming activities in the area. The pond was in an abandoned condition for the past 15 years filled with algae and plants. “Earlier, the residents had used the pond for bathing, washing cattle and clothes. Water from this pond was earlier sourced for paddy cultivation by hundreds of farmers. Now, the present plight of the pond has led to the end of paddy cultivation in Karode panchayat” said Chenkavila ward member Kanthalloor Saji. As Ayira pond covered a large area, the panchayat had found it difficult to perform the cleaning and renovation activities. “With our limited resources and funds, we could not carry out the cleaning of the pond. Water overflowed from the nearby canal during the rainy season carried mud and other wastes that were deposited in the pond,” said Karode panchayat president Rajendran Nair. Now, with the aid from Nabard, renovation and cleaning initiatives worth Rs 1.55 crore have commenced. Rs 1.36 crore have been allocated for Ayira pond renovation while the one-acre Puliyoor pond gets a revamp worth Rs 18 lakh. The work envisaged under the project includes the removal of accumulated mud from the ponds and the construction of safety walls. According to officials, the entire project will be completed within six months. With the renovation, the officials also plan to make the area a tourist spot. “Ayira pond was once a major attraction and its real beauty was captured in a song in the 1980 Malayalam movie ‘Karimpana’. As it is situated along the main road, we are planning to turn a portion of the pond into a swimming pool. Also, a walkway will be set up,” said Saji.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/water-bodies-to-get-facelift/articleshow/85748678.cms||---

They submitted it to three candidates of ward-37 on Sunday.Dr CG Zalaki and SM Sindagi, office bearers of Probus Club Unkal, told TOI: “In the meetings held on August 22 and 26, people of our area have listed out the issues that need to addressed on priority and came out with a citizens’ manifesto. We urge the candidate, whoever will be elected, to share the update on the citizens’ manifesto at least once a month.”Other citizens Prof GV Valasang, Prof V N Sangolli, Prof Mahesh Gadag, and Shivashankar Hiremath said that as the area involves civil engineers and experts of other sectors, they have assured possible assistance and guidance for development works in the colony. “We believe that no development work is complete without participation of citizens. Many times, the manifesto, prepared by parties and candidates, will be one-sided as they are prepare without consulting citizens. Now that we have prepared a manifesto, the elected representative should be committed to address the issues raised by us. Thus, we are joining hands in the development, which is a continuous process,” they said.MK Patil and VB Kanavi noted that the government is spending crores of rupees for some canal projects involving Lingaraj Nagar area. “But citizens are not taken into the confidence while implementing them. Seeing such development, we have decided to create social obligation on elected representatives and officials to make all projects public-friendly. It’s just a beginning and we would like to participate actively in the administration in coming days,” they said.Advocate Pradeep Jangamani, Parimala Patil, AT Suryavanshi and others said that like many other areas in the city, their colony is facing issues like potholes, blocked drainage, lack of maintenance of street lights and slow supply of tap water. “We realised cursing the authorities will not yield any results. Hence we thought of joining them by presenting a manifesto and pressurise them in resolving issues,” they added.Candiates Umeshgouda Koujageri (BJP), Abhimanyu Rajendra Reddy (Congress) and Lingaraj Kallapur, who received the citizens’ manifesto, asserted that Lingaraj Nagar residents have created a history in the twin cities by preparing their own manifesto. “Their move keep us on toes to discharge our duties more efficiently. We will try to make our ward as a model one by fulfilling the demands mentioned in the citizens’ manifesto” they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/citizens-present-their-manifesto-before-candidates/articleshow/85746238.cms||---

The power utility firm had temporarily disconnected supply for over 2 lakh consumers so far this year for non-payment of bills, most of them unpaid since June 2020. Of the total arrears, Bhandup zone which includes Bhandup-Mulund, Thane and Vashi (Navi Mumbai) had arrears from residential consumers to the tune of Rs 137 crore. At the same time, the Kalyan zone which includes Dombivli-Kalyan up to Karjat/ Kasara and Vasai-Virar, Palghar had pending electricity bill payments of over Rs 350 crore from residential consumers, sources said. This included Rs 183 crore in Kalyan-Dombivli and Rs 103 crore in Vasai-Virar belt. The other consumers include those in commercial, industry and other categories, whose non-payment of bills for over a year has also caused huge losses to the power firm. A senior official of the state power agency announced on Sunday that the bill payment collection counters of MSEDCL will now remain open on holidays as well. “The drive to recover arrears will continue and more connections are expected to be discontinued temporarily this week in order to speed up recovery,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rs-1000cr-power-bills-in-mmr-unpaid-to-maharashtra-state/articleshow/85752539.cms||Somit Sen
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC eyes Rs 42L/year from water tank solar panels||CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation (MC) is eyeing an income of Rs 41.88 lakh in a year by generating power through floating solar panels atop two tanks at the waterworks in Sector 39, agenda of which will come up in the monthly general house meeting for approval on August 31. The solar plants will generate 28 lakh unit of power annually, according to rough estimates. By selling power at Rs 4.96 per kilowatt, Rs 1.39 crore will be earned in a year, according to the plan. As much as 70% of the revenue, Rs 97.21 lakh, will go to the government treasury of the UT administration. The remaining amount of Rs 41.88 lakh will come to the MC. The UT will bear the expenditure. “The science and technology department of the administration will fund the project. The civic body will not spend a single penny. It will give its space for this first of its kind solar panel on its raw water tanks. So, the maximum share of revenue will go to the administration,” sources said. “The entire installation process will be initiated by the UT. But since the area is of the MC, the approval of the general house is required. As a result, the agenda will be placed before members for approval,” sources added. Senior officials of Chandigarh Renewable Energy, Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest), UT and the MC have been deliberating the issue for past many months. In fact, technical officers and staff of the Crest had visited the waterworks to inspect the location. DIGITAL PAYMENT The civic body is planning to offer digital payment option to its consumers. Cash is being taken for some services like water meter security, labour, water meter testing fee, temporary and permanent water disconnection and construction charges. Now, the charges will be paid digitally. An agenda in this regard will come up in the monthly general house meeting for discussion and approval. “Currently, water bill payment can be paid digitally, but the rest are still being taken through cash. The agenda is coming to take payment of these services too on the lines of water bill payment through digital mode,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mc-pins-hopes-on-water-tank-solar-panels-to-earn-rs-42l/articleshow/85748670.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Raipur||Bastar seeks to shed Red tag, woos tourists with homestays||BASTAR: As a “new normal” takes shape, Bastar in Chhattisgarh is looking to shed its image of a Maoist hotbed and trying instead to entice visitors to come see its verdant appeal putting village homestays at the heart of the outreach. With around 500 people associated with this community tourism model as of now, the “Amcho Bastar Paryatan” model is also creating employment opportunities in the villages to prevent migration of unemployed youth. In order to address security concerns of tourists, Bastar district magistrate Rajat Bansal told TOI that the dedicated portal travelbastar.com will soon have a provision to issue a pass to each tourist. “The details of the tourists will be available on the district network so that they feel assured that they can access the police and district authorities at any point of time,” he added. The district administration in coordination with the gram panchayats have so far set up 16 homestays in Bastar’s villages and another 10 will be ready by mid-September. Another 14 homestays being run privately will also be listed on the portal. The DM explains while they want to open up Bastar to tourists, they do not want commercial interests to take over. He explained that this project ensures the gram panchayat decides where the homestay will be and only if the owner of the land and house agrees is the process initiated. The district supports the funding of setting up the basic infrastructure for the homestay through District Mineral Fund Trust. Close to the waterfalls of Chitrakote in Lohandiguda block, the village by the same name is home to one of the homestay facilities on a land owned by Lachindra Baghel. Since the pandemic happened, he has been struggling to run his house from the small piece of land where he grows rice during season and works as a labourer for the rest of the months. He now hopes with some handholding, the single unit homestay will bring in the resources for the family and the gram panchayat. He told TOI that so far one woman from Delhi and a couple from Kanpur have stayed at their one room set-up for one night each and he earned a total of Rs 1,400 from these visitors. Under the community tourism model, unemployed youth are also selected and trained in hospitality and tourism. They form self help groups to manage the cleanliness of the tourist destination, guide and connect tourists to camping, trekking and homestays. A youth guide Balram Kashyap said he may have ended up as a migrant labourer after he was not able to pursue the professional course he wanted to do. But just when he faced uncertainty, he was selected to be a tourist guide.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/bastar-seeks-to-shed-red-tag-woos-tourists-with-homestays/articleshow/85754036.cms||Ambika Pandit

According to sources, work has already started in setting up the plants at MGM Medical College & Hospital (MGMMCH) and Sadar Hospital. The other five plants will be located at Mercy Hospital, St Joseph Hospital, Tinplate Hospital, Ghatshila Sub-division Hospital and Chakulia community health centre. At present, there are two functional oxygen plants at Tata Main Hospital and Kantilal Memorial Hospital. According to experts, setting up of PSA oxygen plants on hospital premises will help supply the gas directly to the patient’s bed. This will help save a lot of time as transportation of oxygen from manufacturing plants will not be required. District civil surgeon Dr AK Lal has directed all the nursing homes with more than 20-bed capacity to ensure that they have adequate supply of oxygen when required. Lal has sought a detailed report on the availability of oxygen in all the nursing homes of the Steel City. During the Covid second wave, charges were raised against the government’s failure to provide sufficient oxygen to patients, thereby resulting in several deaths. So, acting on the state government’s instructions, the local administration is taking no chances this time. To tide over the crisis during that time, the railways had to run oxygen express to ferry the life-saving gas to different parts of the country. As many as 12 oxygen express trains were sent from the Tatanagar station to neighbouring Bangladesh. Meanwhile, to ensure proper medical facilities for patients at the state-run MGMMCH, members of “Team Banna” have been visiting various wards and OPDs for the last few days. These members are taking stock of the lapses at the hospital and reporting the matters to state health minister Banna Gupta. The members said the idea is to provide quality medical facilities to those who come from lower economic strata.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/7-new-oxygen-plants-to-be-set-up-at-e-sbhum-hosps-as-part-of-3rd-wave-prep/articleshow/85749252.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||Industrialists welcome govt biz move||Ranchi: A day after the Hemant Soren government signed investment commitments worth Rs 10,000 crore following its successful conduct of a two-day investment summit in New Delhi and unveiled the new industrial promotion policy 2021, industries and MSMEs welcomed the move but wondered if it would cut red tape and translate into action. Reacting to state government’s fresh push to boost industries, Praveen Kumar Jain (Chabra), president of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI), said they would always welcome any attempt to scout for new investments and job creation but remained apprehensive about the actual execution of promises in reality. “We hope that the current investment summit just does not end up being an MoU-signing spree. The BJP government during 2014-19 held a slew of summits and made big promises but hardly anything substantial was achieved on the ground,” he said. According to Jain, existing industries are still starved of basic facilities like uninterrupted electricity and water linkages across the state. Right from availability and smooth transfer of land to getting clearances for licensing and other paraphernalia is so time consuming that investors end up abandoning their projects, he claimed. “No matter how much governments brag about the single-window system for one-point clearances, but in reality they continue to remain a sham,” he said. “A few textile industries like Orient Craft which set up shop during the previous government was forced to exit today. We know of several companies which were given lands in Devipur industrial area in Santhal Pargana by the previous government but till date they couldn’t take hold of their plots, forget setting up of industries owing to local issues,” he said. Former president of Bokaro Chamber of Commerce and Industries Manoj Kumar Choudhary cited how government apathy has turned scores of industries into sick ones in Balidih industrial area in Bokaro. “Out of some 300-odd industries, barely 20% are functioning today with no support from anywhere. The mother industry — Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) — too is struggling, forcing it to eye privatization,” he said. Alleging that the government turned deaf ears to their woes, he said, “Since the Covid-19 outbreak, industries remained shut due to the lockdown but today we are being threatened to pay holding taxes with hefty penalties. The government must focus on strengthening the existing industries first rather than scouting for outsiders just for the sake of doing it.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/industrialists-welcome-govt-biz-move/articleshow/85749185.cms||ASRP Mukesh

In its evening weather bulletin, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Ranchi office said light to moderate showers are expected between August 29 and August 31 in most districts. The IMD stated that 24 districts of the state will record widespread rains on Monday. On Tuesday, all the districts will record widespread rains while on Wednesday, all the districts will have isolated rains with thunder and lightning. The IMD said the rains were a result of a low pressure area over northwestern Bay of Bengal. However, the trough of low pressure did not pass through Jharkhand as on Sunday. Abhishek Anand, a senior scientist at IMD Ranchi, said: “The cyclonic circulation prevailing over northwestern Bay of Bengal is expected to turn into a low pressure. This will change wind patterns which will bring rain into the state.” As per the IMD, monsoon rains in Jharkhand were normal till Sunday with the state receiving 776.1mm rain, which is 4% less than the normal average of 805.6mm. As many as seven districts were rainfall deficit and four districts had received surplus rains. Rainfall deficit was highest in Gumla (38%) while Lohardaga had received the most rain so far with a surplus of 54%. Chatra received 43mm rain till 8am on Sunday, the highest in the past 24 hours while Latehar received 25.4mm rain.

Albert Ekka Chowk in Ranchi, which draws lakhs of crowd every year on Janmashtami for a grand dahi-handi show, among others, will don a deserted look as organizers have announced not to host any mega bash to celebrate the occasion. Sri Krishna Janmotsav Samiti, which hosts the popular dahi-handi contest here, have appealed to people to celebrate the festival by staying indoors. Pramod Saraswat, an official of the outfit, said, “We didn’t hold any mega programmes last year during the first wave and this year, too, we have decided to do likewise due to the Covid-19 situation. While the cases are less, we prefer not to host congregations in view of apprehensions over a possible third wave. Government of India, too, recently cautioned all the states to remain on high alert ahead of the impending festive season.” He added that as a symbolic gesture, they have put up a dahi-handi at Albert Ekka Chowk two days ago, which will be there till the end of the festival. Janmashtami, this year, is on August 30 (midnight) while many will celebrate it on August 31 too. Markets on the other hand were flooded with Krishna idols and hosts of puja and decorative paraphernalia. Till Saturday, key markets like Upper Bazar, Doranda, Lalpur were crowded with festive shoppers. Sunday being a weekend lockdown, many have planned to go on shopping on Monday.

The accused identified as Narendra Attarwala had stocked up the sea fans at his shop near Mandvi. Investigations are on to ascertain if more persons were involved in the crime. According to the forest officials, a total of 862 pieces of sea fans were recovered from the accused. Some of them were recovered in a raw form while other pieces were seized in the form of photo frames. “We had received information about it from the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB). The WCCB and forest officials then laid a trap and sent in a decoy customer to buy sea fans at Attarwala’s shop,” forest officials said. Sea fans are invertebrate sea animals that form a critical part of the coral reef system. They are similar to soft corals but they anchor themselves in mud or sand. Most sea fans are nocturnal and require strong currents to carry their food. “We are trying to find out the source from which the accused got the sea fans,” said M M Rajyaguru, assistant conservator of forests (ACF), Vadodara. Forest officials said many people believe that keeping sea fans at their home or office brings good luck and money. “Keeping any kind of wildlife at home is punishable under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Sea fans are listed under the Schedule 1 of the act,” forest officials added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/man-held-for-selling-sea-fans-862-corals-seized/articleshow/85747167.cms||---

The Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC), which operates this property — one of its oldest and most commercially successful, with regularly high occupancy figures — has floated a tender inviting requests for proposal (RFP) for private players to “participate” in its renovation, operation and maintenance for at least five years. This may be renewed for a second and third term of five years each. The project site covers 21,800 sq m of land, and is located at survey no. 200/1. In the recently-concluded assembly session, opposition MLAs raised the issue of privatization of government tourism properties. “GTDC wishes to tie up with a private entity to propose a suitable commercial concept, renovate the property, and thereafter operate and maintain the same,” a senior officer said. “The already-developed Calangute residency will be given on an as-is basis to the successful bidder. The private entity must develop a suitable concept, renovate the existing structure based on the said concept, and operate and maintain the same.” The bidder should have experience in development or operations or maintenance of minimum 1,000 sq m of commercial space for a minimum period of three years anywhere in India, prior to the last date of bid submission. Also, the successful bidder has to form a special purpose vehicle to execute the project. The officer said that GTDC will hand over the existing structure — the built-up area is 1,668.8 sq m — to the successful bidder. He said that the corporation, “on best-effort basis” shall facilitate the successful bidder in securing the necessary permissions, NOCs and clearances from various statutory authorities. The GTDC will also “market the service through its website, various channels, forums, establishments, outlets and related entities to try and secure success of the project”.  The corporation may also push publicity for the project, and assist it in promotional activities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/tourism-body-moves-to-privatise-calangute-residency-floats-tender/articleshow/85751270.cms||Murari Shetye

Sawant, who stressed on the importance of improving Goa’s IT ecosystem, promised to address concerns surrounding ease of doing business and internet connectivity. Speaking at the Goa startup conclave & entrepreneurship summit, Sawant also assured startups, tech firms and investors that the government plans to implement the Centre’s BharatNet project soon. He said that Goa is one of the first four states in India to come out with a startup policy, and in fact, “we are revising the startup policy very soon with a lot of additional changes which will benefit the coming startups”. Sawant said that Goa is fast becoming the preferred base for startups and tech entrepreneurs who are looking at remote working. “The priority of my government is to retain Goans in Goa. I call upon all Goan youth and entrepreneurs. Come create a new India, not just technology startups but startups of all kinds,” he said. Goa technology association president Milind Anvekar said that the Covid-19 pandemic offers Goa an opportunity to promote a ‘work from Goa’ culture, but the lack of skilled workers and internet connectivity in rural areas remains a challenge. Anvekar urged the government to address these challenges on priority, a point that Goa IT professionals (GITP) also stressed upon. GITP member Maria D’Souza Chowdhary said that more Goans need to be employed by startups. “We would like the government to help startups by setting up public WiFi at parks, in KTC buses, bus stands and hospitals,” Chowdhary said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cm-invites-startups-to-help-improve-states-governance/articleshow/85751376.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Salahuddin Sheikh’s Chhota Udepur school under cop scanner||VADODARA: A school run by Salahuddin Sheikh, an accused in hawala racket and religious conversion activities, is also under the city police scanner. Cops investigating the case claimed that Sheikh also laundered a lot of cash using the school in Chhota Udepur, in which he is a trustee, as a front.  “The initial investigations have revealed that Sheikh had also used his position in the school for laundering money. He got a huge amount from hawala in the last five years and some of it was diverted by using this school as a front,” said a senior police official. The cops are also investigating if the conversion activities were undertaken by him in the school.  The investigators said the city-based Afmi Trust run by Sheikh got Rs 19 crores towards donations from 14 different institutions and trusts located in various countries. Among others, the trust got Rs 7.43 crores from Gujarati Muslim Association (USA), Rs 33 lakh from A Kareem Pathan, USA, Rs 1.20 crores from Retail Global Fashion (USA), Rs 2.05 crores from Majlise Alfala Trust based in the UK and Rs 32.11 lakh from Firdaus Foundation in the UK. Police said Sheikh received about Rs 60 crores from Dubai by hawala and it was routed to different states for building mosques. “The money was also used for sponsoring legal expenses of the persons arrested in anti-CAA protests and Delhi riots,” the police said.  The special operations group (SOG) has arrested Mohammed Hussain Gulam Rasool Ansari, an employee of Afmi Trust for destroying a pen drive that had evidence of the trust’s transactions. He has been remanded to five days of police custody. The cops said that Ansari’s interrogation will further reveal the trust’s activities.  Sheikh and the other co-accused Umar Gautam are expected to be brought from Uttar Pradesh to the city in the next couple of days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/sheikhs-chhota-udepur-school-under-cop-scanner/articleshow/85747202.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Weekly cases at 8-week high, 66% reported from Kerala||NEW DELHI: The sharp surge in Covid-19 infections in Kerala post Onam sent India’s cases in the week ending Sunday zooming to an eight-week high, with the southern state alone accounting for 66% of all cases in the country in this period. India recorded more than 2.9 lakh fresh Covid cases in the week (August 23-29), a 32% jump from the tally in the preceding seven days. This was the highest number of weekly infections since the June 28-July 4 week when 3.05 lakh cases were recorded.   Kerala alone reported over 1.9 lakh cases, a massive 55% rise from the previous week’s tally of 1.25 lakh. This was the highest number of infections in the state in 14 weeks since May 16-23 and the highest in any Indian state in 13 weeks.   Not since the early days of the pandemic has any single state accounted for two-thirds of all Covid cases in the country in a week. That Kerala currently appears to be in a league of its own can be gauged from the fact that none of the state’s neighbours — Karnataka and Tamil Nadu — have reported any significant rise in numbers this week. The only other large state where weekly Covid numbers seem to have risen is Maharashtra, which recorded a marginal increase of less than 1%. Kerala, meanwhile, also became the second state in the country after Maharashtra to record more than 40 lakh Covid cases so far. Kerala crossed the grim milestone on Sunday, when the state recorded 29,836 new cases. Maharashtra's total caseload is over 64.5 lakh. India recorded a 10.5% rise in deaths during the week. There were 3,439 fatalities in the period as opposed to 3,111 in the previous week. Meanwhile, India logged more than 40,000 daily cases for the fifth straight day, with Sunday’s tally at 43,399 (with Jharkhand figures yet to arrive). The day saw 373 deaths while the number of active cases rose by around 7,000 to nearly 3.8 lakh. Of these, more than 2.1 lakh were in Kerala.

As on date only 33.8% of Goa’s adult population is fully vaccinated and 61.6% partially vaccinated with a single dose. A total of 54,882 persons (4.6 %) are yet to receive their first jab. More than 11 lakh persons or 95.4% have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said the unvaccinated could comprise people who turned positive and are waiting for 90 days to be completed. This number is spread out across the state, he said. The government aims at having all teaching and non-teaching staff vaccinated by September 5, he said. “We have received details from a few schools, but are expecting reports from all schools and higher secondary schools on Monday. Accordingly, we will move. We expect the schools to get their unvaccinated staff vaccinated. We want all the teaching and non-teaching staff to be vaccinated by September 5,” he told TOI. Door-to-door vaccination continues under each health centre in batches of at least 10 people and even for those in various homes and institutions. “We can create sessions wherever, depending on the demand. If there are a considerable number of persons with no ID cards then we can also hold sessions accordingly for them,” he said. “We appeal to people to get vaccinated as early as possible. There are people who have completed 82 days after Covid-19 but haven’t turned up for their vaccine,” he said. Schools have submitted details of vaccinated and non-vaccinated teaching and non-teaching staff along with reasons for non-vaccination, on two occasions to the government. In most cases more than 95% of the staff have taken at least one dose of the vaccine, half of whom are fully vaccinated. Those unvaccinated include pregnant women or those who have been medically advised not to take the jab as well as some antivaxxers. Schools have also submitted to the education department details of antivaxxers who have refused to take the weekly RT-PCR test. “We have submitted details and it is now up to the government to act on those who are refusing to get vaccinated for no particular reason. The government is just delaying and beating around the bush. We have done our job and submitted the information,” one staff member said. If schools open the staff should be vaccinated and ready, another staffer said. “Even during online classes staff are interacting with other staff and they are a risk to others. It’s time that schools reopen as they are reopening in other states otherwise students will suffer. If we have exams online, they will pass, but what kind of students will we be producing?” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/33-8-of-goas-citizens-now-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85749654.cms||---

Gomes said that the job of the town planner was to evaluate all aspects of the issues raised and thereafter, give his findings in writing with the approval of the chief town planner, or even the government if need be. “Officers should not come under anyone’s pressure. There are several dimensions to the issue at hand. Gradient is just one of the aspects. TCP will have to go into it more holistically and not brush it off as trivial,” Gomes said. Significantly, Gomes hinted at political pressure being brought on officials in the case. Stating that he was aware that officials, including municipal officials, were being “influenced by powerful persons who have connections in the secretariat”, Gomes urged them not to succumb to such pressures. Echoing similar views, Alemao said, “If Kaknamoddi is not a hill, tomorrow they are capable of saying that Sal and Kushavati are not rivers.” “This is not only the issue of Kakanamoddi hill. Such rampant hill-cutting and land conversions are on in full-swing throughout the state with the blessings of BJP ministers and MLAs ,” Alemao said while addressing reporters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hill-cutting-land-conversion-has-bjp-blessing-yuri-elvis/articleshow/85751747.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But the new menace, say teachers, is early and primarylearners being fed when online classes are in progress. A survey of parents and teachers found that the virtualscreen, be it laptops or computers, have become the new ‘idiot box’. Over 65% of parents said they feed their children during online class. This is in addition to thetime spent in front of a television while eating. Teachers surveyed said over 55% students in the virtual class are eating at the same time. Atleast one fourth of the surveyed parents were happy to feed hot meals to their children, who were otherwise carrying coldfood in their tiffin boxes. Interestingly, 7% of teachers surveyed too admitted to eating meals during class. Last year, say teachers, both parents and students weregetting familiar with online learning. “This year children and parents know about theonline drill. Now parents keep feeding children during school hours,” said ateacher of class 3. Around 20% teachers said they waste time admonishing achild eating during class and get frustrated when parents don’t listen. Atleast22% teachers felt they fear children can choke on their food as the feedinghappens when the child is involved in some school activity. Parents, 25% ofthem, admitted that it is easier to feed the child when he/she is busy on thescreen. Dr Swati Vats,President, Early Childhood Association (ECA) and Association for PrimaryEducation and Research (APER), that surveyed 1,500 parents and 700 teachers acrossprivate and government schools said, “parents say the virtual learning timeclashes with their child’s eating time or the sessions are too long, leavingthe child hungry.” The problem of eating along with schooling is more amongchildren attending morning sessions. A private school in Mumbai starts at 8.30am for primary kids. The children are glued to the screen till 1.30 pm. “Thereis a break of 15 minutes but my child misses her breakfast and lunch,” said aparent. Another school in the city has online classes for primary students from11.30 am to 4 pm. Most of the children end up hurriedly eating lunch, said a parent. Over 40% of parents said their child sleeps till late and wakes up infront of the virtual screen.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/65-of-parents-feed-kids-during-e-class-7-of-teachers-eat-too/articleshow/85754134.cms||Sandhya Nair

The gram sabha on Sunday was informed by the panchayat that a reminder was sent to the collector emphasising the need for the order to ban heavy vehicles on the only link connecting Paroda and Avedem villages. Sarpanch Allelui Afonso said that the three-meter width bridge has become weak as it gets submerged every year during heavy rain. “We had requested the collector in 2014 to issue the order to ban entry for heavy vehicles as this bridge is weak and it is the only link to both the villages. There is a school near the bridge and since the width of the bridge is less there is a possibility of school children jumping in the river when heavy vehicles travel on the bridge since there is no space for pedestrians,” said Afonso. He said that he had informed the gram sabha a few years ago that the panchayat had resolved to construct the new bridge a few meters away from the existing bridge under disaster management fund, but the government-allotted funds were diverted to Canacona flooding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/entry-banned-for-heavy-vehicles-over-paroda-bridge/articleshow/85751853.cms||---

However, the locals who are surviving on their paddy and cashew plantations will not be benefited in any way,” Parab alleged. Elaborating on the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, Parab said Revolutionary Goans had drafted the POGO (person of Goan origin) bill two and half years ago.

RJ Ganga Tadvi’s voice resonated in high frequency when she introduced herself in chaste Sanskrit language on FM Radio 90. Tadvi introduced herself as ‘Namo Namah Sarvebhyaha, Mam Naam Ganga, Bhavantu Shravantu Radio Unity Navati FM, Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat’ followed by the PM who said: “You all must have understood the language. It is Sanskrit and the one who is on air is RJ Ganga. Also, RJ Nilam, RJ Guru and RJ Hetal are all increasing the glory of Sanskrit in Kevadia.” “It is the same place where the world’s tallest statue and the pride of our country – the Statue of Unity – is located. These RJs are playing many roles simultaneously. They have become guides and also run FM Radio 90 where they talk with the audiences and give out information in Sanskrit,” said Modi, who himself went on to quote a few lines in the ancient Indian language. ‘Amrutam Sanskrutam Mitram, Sarasam Saralam Vacha, Ekta Mulakam Rashtre, Gyan Vigyan Poshaka’ cited Modi, also explaining its meaning that Sanskrit is simple and through its thoughts and literature, the language strengthens the knowledge and science of the nation. “I have learnt about many people who are teaching Sanskrit language in foreign countries,” the PM added. Modi had even earlier mentioned about these RJ tribal women and said, “The talent and abilities of tribal women in our villages is impressive. I congratulate my tribal daughters as they acquired expertise in such less time and gave a professional touch.” At SoU, 15 guides and RJs have been trained in speaking Sanskrit fluently over last few months. The SoU authorities then picked up four of them including three women and gave them further training on how to talk like a RJ in Sanskrit and entertain the audiences while giving out information about SoU and other tourist attractions here. The Sanskrit speaking RJs were given special training in handling the radio equipment, using the software as well as hardware in the studio. They were also taught voice modulation and how to keep their audiences hooked to the radio.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/sanskrit-speaking-rjs-lauded-in-mann-ki-baat/articleshow/85747243.cms||---

Chairman of Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, Damodar Naik, announced the reopening of the cultural institute while speaking at a function held at Ravindra Bhavan on Sunday to mark the 74th death anniversary of Pai Tiatrist alias Joao Agustinha Fernandes, in whose memory the auditorium of Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, has been named. Naik said that while the main hall of Ravindra Bhavan will be made available for staging tiatr shows, but audience will be restricted to 50 % capacity as per the guidelines and SOPs of the state government. After paying tributes to Pai tiatrist, Naik said, “Pai Tiatrist is the father of modern tiatr and his contribution brought revolutionary changes in the field of tiatr. Although tiatr is a medium of entertainment, it has made great impact on society. Tiatr has the capacity to safeguard the interest of Konkani language and Goenkarponn.” Member secretary of Ravindra Bhavan, Sandhya Kamat, was also present for the function. Earlier this month, Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai had coming out strongly in support of theatre artistes, particularly tiatrists, who had had to sustain economic losses on account of loss of business during the Covid pandemic.

During his tour to Canacona Sardesai declared Prashant Naik as the GFP candidate for Canacona constituency in the forthcoming assembly polls. Sardesai was speaking after opening the party office at Chaudi, Canacona yesterday where some locals were also inducted into the party. He said that his party would soon provide internet dongles to students and offer free WiFi as many students in remote areas face difficulty in attending online classes. He criticised the government for announcing jobs ahead of the polls, explaining that this was an election gimmick, as currently jobs can’t be available, as the state is borrowing to pay government servants’ salaries. GFP working president Kiran Khandolkar stated that the pulse of the people was against BJP and expressed confidence that Naik would be the next MLA of Canacona.

---||Goa||Goa to seek one more month to ready coastal plan||PANAJI: The Goa government has decided to file an affidavit this week before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) seeking a one-month extension to the deadline to finalise Goa’s draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP). As per NGT’s directives, the plan was to be completed by August 31. The state received 8,000 suggestions and objections on the CZMP from citizens during the July 8 public hearing. Different government agencies are working to verify these inputs. “Our deadline ends on August 31, before which we will file an affidavit before the NGT seeking an extension. We will ask for time till September 30 to complete the work. Work of verifying the suggestions and objections is presently going on,” state environment minister Nilesh Cabral said. This is the fourth extension Goa will be seeking from the tribunal to finalise the CZMP. In March, the NGT had extended Goa’s deadline till August 31. The tribunal had passed an order in November 2017 directing all states and Union territories to submit their CZMPs by August 31, 2018. But when Goa’s plan was prepared by the Chennai-based National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), citizens found several errors in the draft plan. This led to widespread protests across the state, following which the Goa government agreed to seek an extension in the deadline to prepare the CZMP for Goa. Though the extension was granted three times, Goa missed each deadline. In the latest case, the August 31 date was set by the NGT after Goa Foundation approached the tribunal alleging severe deficiencies in the public hearings conducted on March 7 by the state government. The number of participants at the March 7 hearing were capped at 100 on account of the pandemic and each speaker was given only five minutes to speak, Goa Foundation had told the NGT. Based on the NGT’s directives, the Goa government then held another hearing on July 8.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/state-to-seek-one-more-month-to-ready-coastal-plan/articleshow/85750074.cms||---

Dr Samiran Panda, head of ICMR’s Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases (ECD) division, said that nobody can predict the third wave for the whole country. “It will now make sense only if district or state-specific data are used for specific projections. The wave may rear its head only if states remove restrictions prematurely and there is a new transmission-efficient variant that could in turn cause a huge increase in caseload, or there is clear violation of Covid protocols at the population level,” Dr Panda said. He further said the factors important for a wave are decline in natural or vaccine-induced immunity, emergence of a new, more virulent variant such as Delta, relaxations without Covid-appropriate behaviour or inadequate vaccine coverage. “Districts where the spread was low during the second wave might register an increase of cases this time, whereas districts that reported high infection rate may not witness high cases,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3rd-wave-could-be-less-severe-than-2nd-one-icmrs-panda/articleshow/85754159.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He said that the government is fooling the people on the evacuee property issue, and that there was a need to engage a national-level senior legal advisor to sort out the issue permanently rather than adopting delaying tactics. Sardesai also said that there is an immense groundswell to dethrone the BJP candidate in the forthcoming assembly elections and to get a GFP candidate elected. Criticizing the local MLAs he said it is the duty of MLA to stay in Mayem to solve the problems of Mayem villagers.

---||Delhi||Delhi riots chargesheets half-baked, no follow-up, accused languish in jail: Court||NEW DELHI: A city court said it was “really painful” to see that the standard of investigation in a large number of northeast Delhi riots cases was “very poor” and after filing “halfbaked” chargesheets, police had “hardly bothered” to take the probe to a logical end. As a consequence, the accused, who were booked in multiple cases, continue to languish in jails. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said, “After filing of the chargesheet in the court, neither the investigating officer (IO) nor the SHO and the supervising officers bothered to see what other material was required to be collected from the appropriate authority and what steps were required to be taken to take the investigation to a logical end.” It was high time the DCP (Northeast) and other higher officers concerned took notice of the observations and took immediate remedial action, the court stated. Riots probe: City court says senior cops must act to avoid injusticeThey (DCP (Northeast) and other higher officers concerned) are free to seek the assistance of experts in this regard, failing which there is a likelihood of injustice being caused to the people involved,” it noted. The observations came while framing charges against Ashraf Ali and Parvej Ali for allegedly attacking police and rioting in Shiv Vihar with glass bottles, acids and bricks. The court said the ilaka magistrate also failed to monitor the probe during the remand proceedings before taking cognizance of the matter. The judge said it was “really painful” to note that a large number of cases were pending before it and in a majority of cases, the IOs had not been appearing, either physically or through videoconferencing. “I have also been given to understand that police have not been briefing the special public prosecutors for arguments of charges. In the morning of the date of hearing, they simply emailed a pdf of the chargesheet to the SPP and left it upon him to argue the matter without giving him an opportunity to go deep into the facts and the investigation conducted in the matter,” added the judge. Noting that the present case was a glaring example wherein the victims were police personnel themselves, the court said the IO still didn’t bother to collect samples of acid/corrosive substances and had their chemical analysis done or collected opinion about the nature of injuries upon the victims. Observing that there was substance in the arguments of the counsel for the accused, the court said absence of the report regarding the nature of injuries to the victims was fatal to the case of the prosecution. The counsel for the accused claimed they were falsely implicated in the matter. However, the court found substance in the argument that without the chemical analyst’s report, a jolt was caused to the case of police. While this could be due to defective investigation, it couldn’t be held to effect the credibility of the opinion given by the doctor on the medico-legal case of victim constable Ravinder Yadav. “The case cannot be thrown in the dustbin on account of defective investigation by the IO as well as due to lack of supervision by the ACP of the subdivision and DCP of the district,” the judge added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-riots-chargesheets-half-baked-no-follow-up-accused-languish-in-jail-court/articleshow/85754218.cms||Usha Das
---||India||Higher uptake in rural areas boosting India’s vaccination numbers||NEW DELHI: The upswing in Covid vaccinations, that touched a new daily record of 1.03 crore doses on August 27, is primarily helped by significantly higher uptake in rural areas. Rural India administered around 3.17 crore doses during the latest week (August 21-27), more than double the number of jabs given in urban areas. On an average 45.35 lakh doses were given in villages every day during the week, whereas an average 21.21 lakh doses were administered in urban areas per day. Rural areas also registered higher week-on-week growth of over 18% in average daily vaccinations during the week ending August 27, as against the previous week. In urban areas, daily inoculation jumped by around 14% week-on-week. Overall, around 4.7 crore doses of vaccines were administered during August 21-27, up 17% from 3.9 crore doses given in the previous week. India has administered a total of over 63.33 crore doses of anti-Covid jabs so far. According to the website ourworldindata.org, India now ranks second in terms of delivering the most number of full vaccinations, next only to the US. However, the data for China is not available in the website that tracks global vaccinations. Apart from the increasing uptake in villages, the overall rise in vaccination is also driven by those initiating vaccination, particularly since July. While this indicates a significant expansion in coverage of immunisation programme, the government is now also pushing states to prioritise administration of second dose. Even as more than 37% of the country’s total population has received at least one dose, the share of fully immunised population with two doses is still low at 11%. States like UP, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have administered the largest number of doses of Covid vaccines so far. While the government aims to cover the adult population by December, it will start vaccination of children once adequate doses are available for the same. Currently, only Zydus Cadila’s three dose vaccine ZyCoV-D has been approved for emergency use in children above 12 years of age.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/higher-uptake-in-rural-areas-boosting-indias-vaccination-numbers/articleshow/85754210.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Nagpur||Closure of Ganga Jamuna will hit AIDS prevention: Experts||Nagpur: With the city police bringing commercial sex activities to a halt in Ganga Jamuna red-light area, experts engaged in HIV prevention and awareness work have expressed concern over their ongoing projects and resultant dangers. Considering the possibility of sex workers shifting elsewhere for livelihood, the experts fear that prevention work would go for a toss leading to spread of the dreaded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in uncontrolled manner. Some of the NGOs, including Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), now plan to write to collector and divisional commissioner drawing their attention to this peril. Dr Milind Bhrushundi, an HIV expert who is also part of various health committees and task forces under the district administration, said the targeted intervention by awareness campaigners from NGOs like IRCS for HIV prevention would suffer leading to adverse outcome. “It is much easier to focus on HIV prevention with the brothel-based sex workers remaining in the red-light area, where such concentrated population can be attended to. It had so far shown positive outcome,” said Dr Bhrushundi. Dr Bhrushundi said if the brothel-based population mingles with the floating population outside, then there would be no monitoring or control over the HIV. The ban on prostitution in the red-light area has not only thrown around 2,500-3,000 women off their livelihood, but also brought yet another predicament to the fore. The targeted intervention projects regarding HIV infection, which used to be implemented at Ganga Jamuna’s brothels and and customers by the IRCS, is also on the verge of being thrown out of gear. As per data with the IRCS, around 150 women had tested HIV positive from Ganga Jamuna between 2009 and 2014. The HIV prevalence was drastically brought down with the intervention of IRCS, which had been distributing condoms, and around 64 people undergoing antiretroviral therapy with it’s assistance. There had been only two HIV cases between April 2020 and March 2021, informed IRCS project manager Hemlata Lohave. “This year too, we had found two HIV cases till July,” said Lohave, adding the aim is bring it down to zero. “If this brothel-based sex workers leave the red-light area and shift elsewhere, we have no clue how to protect them or others from the HIV,” she said. Lohave, an IRCS employee, said 3.55 lakh condoms were distributed among the sex workers between April 2020 and March 2021 and another 2.10 lakh condoms till July this year from April. “It was due to our awareness programmes on HIV and Covid guidelines, the spread of the two viruses was prevented,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/closure-of-ganga-jamuna-will-hit-aids-prevention-experts/articleshow/85750576.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Days after Narayan Rane arrest, ED summons Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab||MUMBAI: The ED has summoned state transport minister Anil Parab of Shiv Sena to record his statement on Tuesday, possibly in a money laundering case connected with former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Parab said he received the notice on Sunday evening. “I do not know the notice is related to which case, as it does not mention any details. It only says that I will have to be present in their office on August 31 at 11am,” said Parab. While people close to Parab said they had anticipated the move by the ED after Union minister Narayan Rane’s arrest by the state police in Ratnagiri recently “for making derogatory remarks” against CM Uddhav Thackeray, Parab only said that he expected the notice. Notice to Parab expected after Rane’s arrest: RautShiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut tweeted on Sunday that the ED issued summons to state transport minister Anil Parab after union minister Narayan Rane’s arrest by the state police in Ratnagiri recently. “Good job! As soon as ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ concluded, ED has issued notice to Anil Parab, as expected. The Centre sprang into action. Parab is a guardian minister of Ratnagiri district, which is the epicentre of the earthquake. Please understand the ‘chronology’. We will fight the legal battle the legal way. Jai Maharashtra,” Raut tweeted. Rane was arrested on Tuesday after his remark about slapping Thackeray for his ignorance of the year of India’s independence. The same day, a video of Parab ordering police officers to arrest Rane without delay had gone viral. Parab is a close adviser of the chief minister and he will be playing a crucial role in the upcoming election to the BMC, where his party has been the ruling party for over two decades and where its rival, the BJP, would like to topple it. Speaking to the media about the ED summons, Parab said, “I will not make any comment at this moment. We will examine it and will respond to the notice legally.” Earlier this year, former city police chief Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh, at the time the home minister, had told now-dismissed police officer Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners in the city illegally every month for him. The ED registered the money laundering case based on the CBI FIR against Deshmukh. In April, Waze had tried to submit a letter to a special NIA court when produced before it by the NIA in a murder case. In the letter, Waze had alleged that Parab had asked him to extort money from BMC contractors and others. At the time, Parab had denied the charge. Nitesh Rane, BJP MLA and Narayan Rane’s son, reacting to the ED notice to Parab said: “It is not a love letter, unless it has some evidence, the ED will not send a notice to anyone.” Meanwhile, the probe agency on Monday raided the premises of deputy RTO from Wardha Bajrang Kharmate, in connection with Anil Deshmukh money laundering case. Kharmate is working under the state transport ministry headed by Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/days-after-narayan-rane-arrest-ed-summons-shiv-sena-minister/articleshow/85754246.cms||Vijay V Singh

They will need to give 15% equity which is Rs 4.5 crore. Many have submitted applications. Travel agencies of the city should meet me and I will help them become operators,” said Gadkari after performing the bhoomi puja of Gandhisagar Lake beautification project. Gadkari added that every private party will earn a revenue of Rs 5 lakh per day. “After expenses, they can earn up to Rs 1 crore per month,” he said. The BG Metro Rail will comprise eight coaches — 4 economic class, 2 business class and two for goods. “It will help in transportation of even perishables like milk and vegetables. The trains will run at 140 km per hour. This is a first-of-its kind project in the country,” said Gadkari. Trains will run every hour. “The BG Metro Rail will have connectivity to the inter-modal station proposed at Ajni,” said Gadkari. The BG Metro Rail will run on the tracks of Railway and the MahaMetro will develop special stations for it. Gadkari also said that a nine-storey building with six floors for parking and three floors for a food mall has been proposed on PDKV land at Futala Lake. “People coming to enjoy the musical fountain at the lake can park vehicles and visit the restaurants. The parking area can accommodate 1,100 cars. There will be a garden restaurant on the top floor will be even for the middle-class,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/broad-gauge-metro-will-be-privately-run-gadkari/articleshow/85768410.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Kolkata||Duare Ration pilot project to roll out on Sept 15||Kolkata: The Bengal government wants to have a pilot run of Duare Ration (ration delivery on doorstep of beneficiaries) from September 15 instead of the scheduled September 1. The pilot project will include 15% beneficiaries of each district. The test run was deferred by 15 days as it would have coincided with the ongoing Duare Sarkar and Paray Samadhan camps, where most officials are engaged. “We are expecting to run 70-80% of the target of full-fledged Duare Ration from November,” state food and civil supplies minister Rathin Ghosh said. The Duare Ration list of beneficiaries is yet to be finalised. Bengal has four categories of ration cards — Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), PHH (Priority Household), RKSY-I (Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana-I) and RKSY-II, the last being the formerly APL (above poverty line) category. Initially, it was decided that only AAY and PHH would be Duare Ration beneficiaries. Kolkata has 34,69,277 ration card-holders. Earlier, the state food and supplies department had instructed ration dealers to divide all beneficiaries under their jurisdiction into 16 clusters and designate a fixed day of a week each month for distribution of foodgrain in each cluster. As per guidelines, Duare Ration would be carried out on Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday and Friday every month. “Our plan is to have a fixed distribution day in a month from first Tuesday till fourth Friday in all 16 clusters. Dates may vary but the day must be kept the same for each cluster during upcoming months,” a senior department official said. All Saturdays would be earmarked for distribution from ration shops so that people who might have been missed to collect directly from the shop due to an urgent reason could do so. The second half of Sunday would be reserved for distributing foodgrain in Duare Ration mode for clusters that might have been missed due to holidays or inclement weather, an officer said. All India Fair Price Shop Dealers’ Federation general secretary Biswambhar Basu said: “We engaged a professional accounting firm and found that each dealer will incur additional cost of Rs 200 per quintal for Duare Ration delivery.“||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/duare-ration-pilot-project-to-roll-out-on-sept-15/articleshow/85750250.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

At least six Trinamool supporters were injured in the attack. The accused also tried to assault the MLA, but Chakraborty’s six security guards rescued him. Thirteen people have been arrested. According to sources, the incident took place around 1.30 pm while Chakraborty had called a meeting following the renovation work of a Hanuman temple adjacent to Platform No. 1 of Barrackpore station. Uttam Das, the chief administrator of Barrackpore municipality, was also present at the meeting. “Problems started when I intervened to find out how the donations being offered to the temple were being used. I had proposed that the money collected from donations be used to provide medical aid and for the educational needs of people from the economically backward sections. The idea was to form an apolitical committee of hawkers who would help in doing that. While we were conducting this meeting on Sunday, the goons suddenly attacked us,” Chakraborty said. He added that police were very proactive and 13 people were arrested immediately. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee called me up to ask how I am doing. I am safe though some of my team members have been injured. One of them has been hospitalised,” the MLA said. Das said: “During the meeting, a group of 25 to 30 youths barged into the venue and attacked us. While Chakraborty was trying to stop them they rushed towards him and tried to assault him. His guards managed to save him.” Some local criminals deliberately orchestrated the attack to create tension in the locality, he added. Police said the attack was carried out over formation of a temple committee. “Thirteen persons have been arrested. A raid is on to nab some others involved,” said Manoj Kr Verma, police commissioner, Barrackpore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/raj-attacked-at-barrackpore-meeting-13-held/articleshow/85750395.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

And it was Dhyanchand who won hands down in the thrilling contest. Surprised? Nine hockey teams consisting of junior men and women players played against each other at the VMC sports complex in Manjalpur on Sunday, celebrated as the National Sports Day. The teams were named after the Tokyo Olympic medal winning sportspersons from India. “Our sportspersons put up an inspiring performance in the Olympics this time and won us medals. So, we decided to pay a tribute to them,” said Rohan Bhanage, CEO, VMC Sports Promotion Foundation. The foundation organized a hockey tournament and named seven teams after the seven Olympic medal winners including Neeraj Chopra, Ravi Kumar Dahiya, Mirabai Chanu, PV Sindhu, Lovlina Borgohain, Bajran Punia and Manpreet Singh. The other two teams were named after Major Dhyanchand and captain of Indian women’s hockey team Rani Rampal. “Our women’s team ended at fourth position in the Olympics and they have to be honoured for their performance,” Bhanage added. All the teams played a 30-minute match against each other on the astroturf at the sports complex. Each team had a mix of men and women players. Major Dhyanchand XI reached the finals and played against Manpreet Singh XI. Dhyanchand players scored four goals while Manpreet players managed to go past the opponent goal-keeper only once. “We organized a hockey tournament to promote the sport among the youngsters.

Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday said the brazen use of agencies such as ED and CBI would not be able to save BJP from voters’ ire. On Sunday, Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien alleged that the Union home minister had drawn up a plan for remitting all cases through ED. Taking to Twitter, Derek posted: “A sparrow in Delhi tells me that the new CBI chief may have directed a few top officials not to act too brazenly. Harassing the opposition only benefits one party. So HeMan (HM) has a new plan. He is now remitting all cases through the Extremely Dedicated (ED) director who obeys HM.” Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said Derek was casting aspersions on probe agencies in an unfair manner. “The TMC sees the invisible hand of BJP in everything,” he said. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh claimed Trinamool was trying to hide the crimes against people by opposing the CBI investigation. “Mamata Banerjee knows what CBI is. While in the opposition, she always demanded a CBI probe and now, she is trying to shield her partymen by claiming CBI probe is not needed,” he said in Midnapore after an organizational meeting. On Saturday night, Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh had said that party workers were being threatened in Tripura. “But BJP doesn’t know we have passed through these kinds of phases in our childhood. People are with TMC and the BJP is scared,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-ed-summons-tmc-and-bjp-trade-words/articleshow/85750462.cms||Sujay Khanra

---||Kolkata||Software, extra invigilators to keep first online board exams ‘clean’ across Kolkata||KOLKATA: Ahead of the first scheduled online board exams, schools across the city are trying to put in place measures that would make it very difficult for examinees to resort to cheating. Both CBSE and ISCE have announced bifurcated boards, with the first semesters due in October-November. The new measures are required in order to maintain the integrity of assessment and provide credibility to the exercise. While some schools have decided to use third-party software, others have decided to have more invigilators during online examinations. There are some who plan to instruct students to have mirrors behind them, while yet others plan to instruct pupils to keep their device camera switched on for the duration of the exam, with multiple teachers monitoring. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy will use online proctoring, an assessment method that enables students to write an exam online in a remote location while maintaining the integrity of the exam. “This method will help identify whether anybody uses any unfair means. It will ease pressure on teachers and require the student to use only one device,” said director Meena Kak. Several heads of schools have admitted that they were not sure whether a section of students used unfair means and how much they learnt through online classes. Copying answers after looking it up online has become common among students, schools say. So, some schools like The Heritage, while preparing answer keys, have been keeping the readily available answers handy. “The moment the invigilator sees the answer, s/he knows whether it has been copied or not,” said principal, Seema Sapru. DPS Ruby Park will use mirrors behind board-year examinees in the final exams to get a full view of the room in which they are sitting for the test. Parents are also requested to partner in the invigilation. Loveleen Saigal, principal of Birla High School, said: “We are keeping the camera on for the entire duration and have more than one teacher invigilating to keep better vigil on examinees.” Principal of DPS Newtown, Sonali Sen, said: “We have divided the classrooms into halves so that each teacher has a smaller number of students to invigilate.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/software-extra-invigilators-to-keep-first-online-board-exams-clean/articleshow/85752552.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Bengaluru||75 days on, no Covid aid to Karnataka BPL families yet||BENGALURU: Nearly two and a half months after announcing a Rs 1-lakh compensation to BPL families that lost at least one member to Covid-19, the Karnataka government is yet to start handing out money. While the state maintained it is committed to delivering on its promise, sources flagged several issues — including lack of data about banking details to credit the compensation amount and absence of a web portal to upload documents — which are delaying the process of giving out money. Karnataka has so far reported 37,261 deaths due to Covid ever since the pandemic broke out in March 2020, and 4,228 fatalities have been reported since the announcement of compensation. Revenue secretary Tushar Girinath said they must identify an alternative bank account of the deceased person, and there are a considerable number of names who may not have been given the Patient list number or P-number. It has been 75 days since the state government announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to below poverty line (BPL) families that lost a member to Covid-19, but not a single family has received even a rupee till now. The state cabinet cleared the proposal on June 14 and the government passed an order on July 8, to that effect. On the day the government announced the scheme, Karnataka had a cumulative total of 33,033 deaths, and in the 75 days since, 4,228 more people have died from the viral disease. However, it’s not clear just how many families are eligible to receive compensation. “The government failed to provide enough beds, oxygen etc., and having failed to prevent deaths, the least it can do is to provide compensation which is announced. But there has been such procrastination on the part of the government,” said Clifton Rozario, an advocate. He pointed out that while the Centre announced compensation in March 2020, it withdrew it immediately. “The Supreme court had said the Centre must declare a compensation by August 15, but I think the government has sought more time. The Karnataka government announced it will provide some compensation, but has done nothing thereafter,” Rozario said. Committed to deliveringThe government maintains that it is committed to delivering on its promise, and that the modalities are being worked out. Tushar Girinath, revenue secretary, said: “While the government is very serious on this issue, there is a twofold problem. First, identifying the next of kin. In cases where the breadwinner died, we need to identify if there is an alternative bank account. Second, there are many who may not have got a patient list number [P-number]. These names have to be verified and added to the list.” Another official said district deputy commissioners (DCs), who are responsible for identifying the next of kin, are hesitant because they fear that if the list is not comprehensive then they will face trouble. The pension department has been asked to coordinate with DCs and secure details. “Also, the Centre will bring out a similar scheme, as per Supreme Court directives. While the Centre is yet to reveal details, the state could ‘readjust’ funding for the scheme,” an official said. Many DCs said they were ready with provisional lists of beneficiaries, but there has been a delay in setting up a digital platform to upload the data. Officials say a web portal is in a trial stage and will be launched shortly. “Our tahsildars have records of people who need to be compensated. Once the names are uploaded, it is a matter of minutes to directly transfer sums to beneficiaries’ accounts,” said Nitesh Patil, Dharwad DC. Bengaluru recorded 15,983 (Sunday) deaths, the highest, and officials are in the process of identifying BPL families. “Most have been identified, but the survey is still on in some pockets,” said J Manjunath, DC, Bengaluru Urban. He said in Rajarajeshwarinagar as many as 750 families have been identified for compensation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/75-days-on-no-covid-aid-to-karnataka-bpl-families-yet/articleshow/85754317.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The incident has forced the duo to rename the eatery ‘American Dosa Corner’. On Saturday, one person was arrested in connection with the incident, said superintendent of police (city) M P Singh. The accused was identified as Srikant Sharma, a member of International Hindu Parishad, a hitherto unknown organisation. “The matter is being investigated and strict action will be taken against the accused,” the SP said. Mathura police has registered an FIR against unidentified people under section 506 (criminal intimidation) and 427 (mischief) of the IPC at Kotwali police station. The brothers, Irfan and Aabid (who have only been identified with their first names), said they have been running the stall for the past five years under the same name without incident. "We recently sold it off to a person called Rahul Thakur, but we manage it," said Aabid, adding that the stall’s name has now been changed to "American Dosa Corner". The incident took place on August 18 and soon after, a video of it went viral on social media. In the two-minute video, a person can be seen asking Aabid, who was attending to customers at the time, why his stall carried a Hindu name. The man can be heard threatening, "Remove the name now. Hindus will not eat at the stall if they know your true identity." The banner of the stall was also torn away later. City president of International Hindu Parishad, Dev Sharma, said the organisation objected to the stall as "sentiments of Hindus were hurt by misuse of Lord Krishna’s name, Srinath." "They (Muslims) should not be using a Hindu name to earn money. Mathura is a religious town and such things can hurt sentiments of the community", said Dev Sharma. Last week, a bangle seller from UP, Tasleem Ali, was beaten up in Indore for using a "fake name" to sell his goods in a Hindu-dominated area. He was also slapped with the Pocso Act for allegedly making advances on a 13-year-old girl and arrested by police. Earlier, in Muzaffarnagar, some activists from Kranti Sena, had appealed to people to not allow Muslim men to apply mehndi on the hands of Hindu women ahead of Teej festival alleging that they "indulged in love jihad".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/dosa-sellers-harassed-over-hindu-name-in-agra-stall-vandalised-1-held/articleshow/85746481.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Police on Sunday arrested Perumal under the Pocso Act after finding 50 video clips of his rape of the children on his cellphone. Police also arrested two women aged 28 and 30 for allowing him to rape their daughters. Tipped off about storage of gutka at a grocery shop on Saturday, the T P Chatram police raided the shop and seized a bag of tobacco products. They also seized the shopowner’s phone to get details of the gutka dealers. While checking the phone’s photo gallery, police found at last 50 videos of minor girls being raped. Police said they initially thought he had downloaded child porn videos, but on closer scrutiny they realized that Perumal was the man in the videos. A team headed by Kilpauk deputy commissioner Karthikeyan and inspector Rajeshwari interrogated Perumal who finally revealed he had been repeatedly raping the minors over six months. Police said the two women, who were sisters, were also picked up as they were hand-in-glove with Perumal, even letting him rape their own children. One of the women had an affair with Perumal and later introduced her sister to the man. Perumal told police that these women allowed him to rape their daughters as payment for the goods they bought from his store. He filmed his rape of the two children as well as three of their friends who came to play at their home. “These three children were too young to tell their parents what was happening though Perumal had been raping them on several occasions for more than six months,” said deputy commissioner Karthikeyan. The parents of the three other children told police that the two women took care of their children whenever they went out for work. “It is a shocking case. If the inspector had not checked his mobile phone, the case wouldn’t have come to light and the man would have abused more children,” Karthikeyan said. Perumal was sent to Chengalpet sub-jail, while the two women were lodged in the women’s prison at Puzhal.

---||World||Wind, storm surge from Hurricane Ida lash Louisiana||NEW ORLEANS: Hurricane Ida blasted ashore Sunday as one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US, blowing off roofs and reversing the flow of the Mississippi River as it rushed from the Louisiana coast toward New Orleans and one of the nation's most important industrial corridors. The Category 4 storm hit on the same date Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana and Mississippi 16 years earlier, coming ashore about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of where Category 3 Katrina first struck land. Ida's 150-mph (230 kph) winds tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane to ever hit the mainland US. It dropped hours later to a Category 3 storm with maximum winds of 120 mph (193 kph) as it inched closer to New Orleans. The rising ocean swamped the barrier island of Grand Isle as landfall came just to the west at Port Fourchon. Ida made a second landfall about two hours later near Galliano. The hurricane was churning through the far southern Louisiana wetlands, with the more than 2 million people living in and around New Orleans and Baton Rouge under threat. ``This is going to be much stronger than we usually see and, quite frankly, if you had to draw up the worst possible path for a hurricane in Louisiana, it would be something very, very close to what we're seeing,'' Gov. John Bel Edwards told The Associated Press. People in Louisiana woke up to a monster storm after Ida's top winds grew by 45 mph (72 kph) in five hours as the hurricane moved through some of the warmest ocean water in the world in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Wind tore at awnings, water spilled out of Lake Ponchartrain in New Orleans, and boats broke loose from their moorings. Engineers detected a ``negative flow'' on the Mississippi River as a result of storm surge, US Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Ricky Boyette said. Edwards said he watched a live video feed from around Port Fourchon as Ida came ashore. ``The storm surge is just tremendous. We can see the roofs have been blown off of the port buildings in many places,'' Edwards told the AP. Officials said Ida's swift intensification from a few thunderstorms to a massive hurricane in just three days left no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans' 390,000 residents. Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents remaining in the city on Sunday to ``hunker down.`` Marco Apostolico said he felt confident riding out the storm at his home in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward, one of the city's hardest-hit neighborhoods when levees failed and released a torrent of floodwater during Katrina. His home was among those rebuilt with the help of actor Brad Pitt to withstand hurricane-force winds. But the memory of Katrina still hung over the latest storm. ``It's obviously a lot of heavy feelings,'' he said. ``And yeah, potentially scary and dangerous.'' The region getting Ida's worst includes petrochemical sites and major ports, which could sustain significant damage. It is also an area that is already reeling from a resurgence of Covid-19 infections due to low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant. New Orleans hospitals planned to ride out the storm with their beds nearly full, as similarly stressed hospitals elsewhere had little room for evacuated patients. And shelters for those fleeing their homes carried an added risk of becoming flashpoints for new infections. Forecasters warned winds stronger than 115 mph (185 kph) threatened Houma, a city of 33,000 that supports oil platforms in the Gulf. The hurricane was also threatening neighboring Mississippi, where Katrina demolished oceanfront homes. With Ida approaching, Claudette Jones evacuated her home east of Gulfport, Mississippi, as waves started pounding the shore. ``I'm praying I can go back to a normal home like I left,'' she said. ``That's what I'm praying for. But I'm not sure at this point.'' Comparisons to the Aug. 29, 2005, landfall of Katrina weighed heavily on residents bracing for Ida. Katrina was blamed for 1,800 deaths as it caused levee breaches and catastrophic flooding in New Orleans. Ida's hurricane-force winds stretched 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the storm's eye, or about half the size of Katrina, and a New Orleans' infrastructure official emphasized that the city is in a ``very different place than it was 16 years ago.`` The levee system has been massively overhauled since Katrina, Ramsey Green, deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure, said before the worst of the storm hit. While water may not penetrate levees, Green said if forecasts of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain prove true, the city's underfunded and neglected network of pumps, underground pipes and surface canals likely won't be able to keep up. About 590,000 customers were already without power late Sunday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.US, which tracks outages nationwide. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality was in contact with more than 1,500 oil refineries, chemical plants and other sensitive facilities and will respond to any reported pollution leaks or petroleum spills, agency spokesman Greg Langley said. He said the agency would deploy three mobile air-monitoring laboratories after the storm passes to sample, analyze and report any threats to public health. Louisiana's 17 oil refineries account for nearly one-fifth of the US refining capacity and its two liquefied natural gas export terminals ship about 55% of the nation's total exports, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Government statistics show that 95% of oil and gas production in the Gulf Coast region was shut down as Ida made landfall on Sunday, according to energy company S&P Global Platts. Louisiana is also home to two nuclear power plants, one near New Orleans and another about 27 miles (about 43 kilometers) northwest of Baton Rouge. President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of Ida's arrival. He said Sunday the country was praying for the best for Louisiana and would put its ``full might behind the rescue and recovery'' effort once the storm passes. Edwards warned his state to brace for potentially weeks of recovery. ``Many, many people are going to be tested in ways that we can only imagine today,'' the governor told a news conference.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wind-storm-surge-from-hurricane-ida-lash-louisiana/articleshow/85754311.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Daily Covid positivity rate below 1%, but experts back curbs for 2 weeks||BENGALURU: The average daily test positivity rate in the state over the past week has been 0.7%, crossing the 1% mark only once on August 23. However, while conceding that this is a clear sign of low transmission of the novel coronavirus, Dr MK Sudarshan, Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) chairperson, says it is still not the time to lower one’s guard against the virus. “The fall in test positivity rate is a good sign and the overall situation is not worrisome,” said the TAC chief. But he said existing restrictions must continue for two more weeks, till Ganesh Chaturthi is over. Currently, only six districts have reported a daily test positivity rate of more than 1% over the past week, with Dakshina Kannada, at 2.6%, at the head of that list. Experts say only Dakshina Kannada remains an issue. “This [casea and positivity] may continue till the end of September. We will get a clear picture only by October,” said Dr Sudarshan. The daily test positivity rate is similar to levels seen in January to early March, when the state consistently reported a positivity rate of less than 1%, which increased to nearly 4% by the end of March, and peaked at 31.6% in the second week of May, during the height of the second wave. By the end of May, the positivity rate had fallen to 13.6% and it fell even further to 6.5% on June 10. It gradually went below 2% by the end of June. In July, the rate hovered between 2.6% and 1.5 % before falling further in August. Expected linesDr Giridhara R Babu, epidemiologist and member, Covid-19 technical committee, said the pandemic situation has gone on expected lines with lower transmission levels, or what is known as endemic levels. “Expected level of cases depends on several factors including the quality of detection strategy and tests. If testing levels are uniform and there is no dilution in the detection strategy, we will continue to see less cases,” Dr Babu said. He added: “In fact, we should be worried if there are no cases as it means the system does not have the sensitivity to pick up infections.” He said if cases are not detected when transmission levels are high, deaths will reveal the actual position. On Saturday, four districts — Yadgir, Bagalkot, Bidar and Raichur — reported zero new cases. Ten other districts reported fresh cases in single digits, with Vijayapura reporting only one case and Koppal and Gadag two new cases each. “We should step up surveillance in such districts only to make sure no cases are missed,” said Dr Babu. Health department officials say districts like Yadgir and Gadag saw a high number of cases during both the first and second wave, but infections have fallen drastically now. They say they will continue with measures to curb the spread of the virus. “Despite the positivity rate being below 1%, the daily testing target has been set at 1.7 lakh a day and 30% of them will be carried out via the rapid antigen method where symptomatic persons are tested early and isolated quickly. The vaccination coverage is also increasing,” a senior official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-daily-covid-positivity-rate-below-1-but-experts-back-curbs-for-2-weeks/articleshow/85754384.cms||Sunitha Rao R

A forecast by IMD said that heavy rain would occur over north coastal areas on Wednesday and Thursday. Southern suburbs of the city received good rain in the afternoon on Sunday and live weather updates of IMD recorded 7mm at Meenambakkam since morning on Sunday. A Met department official said the rain was caused because of the convergence of wind. The changes in the wind pattern was causing a dry spell before a convergence of wind over the coast and it will trigger more rain after two days, the official added. Forecast for Monday said there were chances of light to moderate rain but Tuesday is likely to remain dry. The forecast for Monday said, "The sky condition is likely to be generally cloudy. Thunderstorm with light to moderate rain is likely to occur in some areas." The city has received 372.2mm rain since June 1, against the normal of 321.2mm, a surplus of 16%. Private bloggers had posted that the city saw surplus rain in June, July and August and that the beginning of September looks promising as there is a forecast for heavy rain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/imd-forecast-says-thundershowers-likely-this-week-in-chennai/articleshow/85754410.cms||---

After battling for life for 73 days after her body went into cardiogenic shock and her body started systematically shutting down 10 days after her birth on June 19, the girl is all set to go home with her parents. She is still a small bundle weighing merely 1.5 kg but doctors say she has demonstrated unprecedented resilience. In fact, senior neonatologist Dr Ashish Mehta said that she is the smallest baby in the country to survive MIS-N according to the database of Indian Neonatal Network Collaborative (INNC). Baby girl survives without any major complications, say doctorsThis is the first neonate with MIS-N wherein large doses of steroids were administered to save her life. So far, we have no such documented protocol. Fortunately, the girl survived sans any major complications. This case will be documented for national and international platforms as it sets new treatment standards in post-Covid world,” said senior neonatologist Dr Ashish Mehta. He added that the time was crucial as the second wave of Covid was at its peak. “The biggest concern was to administer a heavy dose of steroids in such a small baby,” he said. “The babies at this age are generally highly immunocompromised and carry risk of infection. We however carried out the procedure with extreme precaution.” Top neonatologists in India including Dr Praveen Kumar, head of neonatology in PGI, Chandigarh and Dr Dinesh Chirla, neonatology director at Rainbow Hospital Hyderabad, were consulted and steroid treatment started. Interestingly, the baby's survival is also a tale of human kindness as the girl's parents-- Arvind and Joshana Prajapati- have limited income and did not have money to fund the long and advanced treatment. "There was another couple whose premature child was admitted here. They offered to pay a significant amount for her treatment. Doctors too waived off their fee. These strangers stepped in like family to help us in the biggest crisis of our lives," says Arvind, tears flowing. An accountant, he earns Rs 10,000 per month and says the treatment running into lakhs was way beyond their means. The couple wishes to offer tribute to the strangers by naming the girl as per name recommended by the donors. "We want them to name the daughter so that we can always remember their contribution in saving her life," says Arvind. Giving history of the case, Dr Mehta said that Joshana had contracted Covid when she was five months pregnant. She got well but her amniotic fluid dried up. The doctors injected saline in her womb twice to ensure the child grows but finally she had to be delivered premature at 27 weeks. "A massive teamwork went into the treatment of the child. The team worked round the clock to keep her heart pumping and keep the blood pressure under check. This case has given confidence to us that we can save more such babies if Covid becomes endemic or more waves rage on," said Dr Mehta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/countrys-smallest-baby-fights-mis-n-triggered-by-covid-antibodies-wins/articleshow/85754415.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Chennai||Anna University campuses to begin physical classes for final year students on September 1||CHENNAI: The four campuses of Anna University will begin physical classes for final year UG and PG students on September 1 in a phased manner to maintain social distancing at hostels and labs. Classes for students from other years will be scheduled later depending on the Covid-19 situation. “The campuses including College of Engineering (CEG), Guindy, Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) in Chromepet and Alagappa College of Technology (AC Tech) will give priority to practical and lab courses,” an official from the university said. The CEG has issued a notification asking all final year students in UG and PG courses to report for readmission on August 31. Earlier, while issuing the standard operating procedure (SOP) to be followed, the higher education department had asked the engineering colleges to conduct physical classes for all students (second, third and final year) on a rotation basis from September 1. However, professors said conducting physical classes for all these students simultaneously would be difficult with a large number of hostel students. “A majority of the students in colleges such as CEG and MIT are from outside the city including from other states. These campuses have at least three to four students per room in the hostels. Further, the AC Tech hostel still functions as a Covid Care Centre where Covid patients are still being treated. So, it may not be possible to accommodate all students for physical classes at the same time,” a senior professor from the university said. The theory classes for students are likely to continue online for some time. There are more than 4,000 students in 15 hostels at CEG, while MIT in Chromepet houses around 1,500 students in 10 hostels. “We have asked the government to shift out the Covid Care Centre at AC Tech hostel for starting physical classes. The university needs to consider the health and safety of students as well. We will take steps to bring other students also to the campus very shortly,” said vice-chancellor R Velraj.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-anna-university-to-begin-physical-classes-on-september-1/articleshow/85754442.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||India||Punjab roads choke with farmers protest||KARNAL/ BATHINDA: A 45-year-old Haryana farm activist, among those allegedly assaulted by police at the Bastara toll plaza in Karnal, died late on Saturday, fanning the flames of the agitation that snowballed into a series of highway blockades across Punjab on Sunday in protest against the police action. Demanding the immediate dismissal of Karnal subdivisional magistrate Ayush Sinha, farm activists in Punjab accused him of ordering the police to “break the heads of the protesters” if they tried to remove police barricades. At many places, effigies were burnt. The family of deceased farmer claimed he was beaten up during the police crackdown on the toll plaza protest. BKU (Charuni) general secretary Harpal Sudhal said Sushil copped several blows and suffered a heart attack later. His kin, however, cremated him without waiting for an autopsy to confirm the cause of death. Karnal police denied that the farmer’s death was linked to the lathicharge on protesters. “He went home in a stable condition and died in his sleep,” district SP Ganga Ram Punia said. BKU Ekta Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said the Haryana government was acting in a dictatorial manner, which was reflected in how the police allegedly attacked the farm protesters. BKU Ekta Dakaunda president Buta Singh Burjgill said BJP would have to pay for its “misdeeds” such as not acknowledging the “miseries of those sitting at the borders of Delhi for over nine months”. “Most of those injured were not even given proper treatment. Due to pressure from the government, some of the injured farmers were discharged after first aid,” said farm leader Rakesh Tikait.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-roads-choke-with-farmers-protest/articleshow/85754468.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar defends cops but his deputy calls for action against Karnal SDM||CHANDIGARH: A day after the use of police force on farmers in Karnal, Haryana’s deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Sunday advocated action against Karnal sub-divisional magistrate Ayush Sinha for directing policemen to beat up the protesters. Action will be taken against the IAS officer, he said. “I am really hurt by the officer’s conduct. This is not expected from an officer. It does not match the standards of conduct of an officer of his calibre. An IAS officer, who is a duty magistrate, must act cautiously. We shall certainly ask for action after a probe,” he said during a media interaction here on Sunday. During the farmers’ protest in Karnal, the 2018-batch IAS officer was caught on camera Saturday instructing policemen to hit farmers and smash their heads in case they breach the security cordon. ‘Why farm protests being held in Haryana instead of Pb or UP?’Dushyant said the officer later gave a clarification that he hadn’t slept for two nights. But he should know that farmers too don’t sleep 200 days out of 365 days in a year, added the JJP leader, who is part of the coalition government led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Haryana. Just like CM Khattar defended police action on Saturday and blamed the farmers for blocking the highway and pelting stones on cops, Chautala too condemned the violence, including stone-pelting, by farmers in Karnal. “We have seen visuals of farmers attacking policemen with stones and a spade. We wonder as to what the issue is now and what is the end benefit of blocking the ways of representatives of government or political parties? How does it serve any purpose?” he asked. The JJP leader also questioned why Haryana has been made the epicentre of protests, saying, “In the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), most of the representatives are either from Punjab, Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh... Haryana has been used... just to weaken the state’s agrarian economy... Why is this movement not going to Punjab, Rajasthan, or UP? Why are the people of Haryana being provoked?” “Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu had appreciated the payment structure of crops in Haryana which forced Captain (Punjab CM Amarinder Singh) to announce an increase in the sugarcane MSP. Their former PCC president Sunil Jakhar had also admitted that they shifted the venue for protests to Haryana. Did anyone see any reaction in Punjab and UP when entire Haryana was blocked for three hours?” he asked. However, senior police officers, as well as bureaucrats, have defended the Karnal SDM. A senior IPS officer, who was present at the spot, said the Karnal SDM was the duty magistrate throughout and had been interacting with farmers before cops used ‘mild force’ to disperse them. And all this happened at the time when farmers had blocked the two lanes of Bastara toll plaza and had held up entire traffic. As officers and policemen tried to persuade the farmers, they were hit with stones and lathis by protesting farmers, he said||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/lathicharge-haryana-deputy-chief-minister-diverges-from-cm-manohar-lal-khattar-line-for-action-against-sdm/articleshow/85754483.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Chennai||Corporation set to intensify raids to stop single-use plastic across Chennai||CHENNAI: Two years after the ban on single-use plastic kicked in across the state, Greater Chennai Corporation is ‘yet again’ intensifying raids by holding meetings with trade associations and threatening to seal shops and cancel trade licences. Last week, it sealed one shop and seized 160kg of plastic carrybags and other banned items. In contrast, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and other government agencies such as RTOs have done little to stop the manufacture of plastic bags or stop them from entering from other states. One of the major hurdles in implementing the ban, a corporation official said, was the lack of awareness. “People still do not know what is banned and what isn’t. Two government orders, GO No 84 and GO No 37 were passed. But they continue to sell and buy banned plastic,” he said. The TNPCB is to stop the manufacture, form committees and ensure there is an ecosystem of alternatives in the state, but it has done precious little in this regard. A TNPCB official told TOI the board had ensured that no companies manufactured the bags and blamed the civic body and the RTOs for the sale in wholesale markets. The civic body said its role was just to stop it from being sold at wholesale and retail outlets. “We have been conducting raids, issuing notices and doing what we can. We need political will and support to implement it,” said an official. The plastic ban came into effect on January 1, 2019, and until November 16, 2020, the corporation collected ₹1.31crore in fines after seizing 318 tonnes of banned items after 4.5 lakh raids/inspections. The assembly election early this year and the subsequent second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic halted the raids. A shop owner in Parry’s said many like him had shifted to alternatives, but, “Until there is demand, we will supply.” Vamsi Shankar Kapilavai, senior researcher from Citizen Action Group, said people need to get out of the ‘throw away’ culture that began with plastic entering the ecosystem. “We need to change as a society and shift to re-usables,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/corporation-set-to-intensify-raids-to-stop-single-use-plastic-across-chennai/articleshow/85754491.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Police warn defiant dahi handi mandals against flouting ban||MUMBAI/ THANE: Individual police stations are issuing notices and summoning govinda pathaks, warning them of preventive arrests and punitive action if they defy the state's ban on dahi handi. Some dahi handi mandals have signalled that they will proceed with the human pyramid at Tuesday's festival of Gokulashtami despite Covid restrictions. Officers at Byculla police station confirmed that they had despatched a notice to Tadwadi govinda pathak, warning them to follow the state guidelines. Jogeshwari police similarly cautioned Jai Jawan govinda mandal against transgressing the law. "Smaller mandals are lying low because they do not wish to risk police wrath. Their members are working professionals who cannot afford to be embroiled in police cases, just as they are resuming their livelihoods after the lockdown," said a mandal spokesman. Larger teams too did not reveal their plans for Tuesday but said they would "do something to celebrate". The charge of the fight brigade is led by the MNS (Maharashtra Navnirman Sena) which openly admits it will defy the state ban on Gokulashtami by putting together dahi handi events. The party has been networking with aggrieved mandals which are upset at the cancellation. On Sunday MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar visited a ground in Thane to assess preparations. MNS's Thane Palghar district president Avinash Jadhav said they will "go ahead" with their dahi handi plans as scheduled. He said over 40 mandals had already registered for the event. "If the BJP can hold massive rallies, Shiv Sena can stage protests, why can't our youth celebrate Janmashtami?" said Jadhav. Mandals questioned the state's permission for Ganeshotsav which lasts 11 days, while denying them their one day festival. When the state health task force pointed out that dahi handi was a contact sport involving scores of participants, the mandals sought permission for fully vaccinated members to indulge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-police-warn-defiant-dahi-handi-mandals-against-flouting-ban/articleshow/85745198.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

MNS's Thane Palghar district president Avinash Jadhav said they will "go ahead" with their dahi handi plans as scheduled. He said over 40 mandals had already registered for the event. "If the BJP can hold massive rallies, Shiv Sena can stage protests, why can't our youth celebrate Janmashtami?" said Jadhav. Mandals questioned the state's permission for Ganeshotsav which lasts 11 days, while denying them their one day festival. When the state health task force pointed out that dahi handi was a contact sport involving scores of participants, the mandals sought permission for fully vaccinated members to indulge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/maharashtra-police-warn-defiant-dahi-handi-mandals-against-flouting-ban/articleshow/85745284.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

In view of the reduced number of Covid-19 cases, Uttar Pradesh had recently lifted all curbs barring the night curfew which remains in force between 10 pm and 6 am everyday. Keep an eye on social media, rumours: DGPAdditional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi told reporters that the festival of Janmashtami would be celebrated across the state, including all police lines and jails, with full enthusiasm and vigour as per the tradition. In view of this, the night curbs have been relaxed on Monday. He, however, said that all Covid-19 protocols must be followed during the celebrations. Everybody must wear masks and use sanitisers, he added. Recently, in view of the rising trend of Covid-19 cases in some states, CM Yogi Adityanath had directed officials to tighten night curfew in the state. Meanwhile, UP DGP Mukul Goel has instructed all the police commissioners and district police chiefs to remain on alert and also asked them to keep a vigil on social media for keeping a check on rumour mongering. “All senior officers will remain in the field and be present in the sensitive areas of their jurisdiction,” said Goel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-night-curfew-eased-today-for-janmashtami/articleshow/85754500.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||More than 50% of Punjab’s Covid deaths logged in August were old||CHANDIGARH: More than one out of two Covid deaths added to Punjab’s count in the past 28 days were casualties that occurred in the last months and had gone unreported. Punjab has been struggling, especially during the second wave, in maintaining accurate daily death count, forcing it to make additions later after the reconciliation of data. The regular addition of old deaths is one reason why the state’s fatality rate is not coming down, despite a drop in daily death count. The reconciliation exercise is being carried out for the past few months and between August1 and 28, the addition of old unreported deaths was done in 15 days. Of 73 deaths recorded in August, 38 were not logged earlier; the highest number of eight unreported deaths were added on August 6 and 12 while three each were added on August 9 and 11. At 2.7%, Punjab has highest Covid case mortality rate in countrySimilarly, in July, 90 unreported deaths were included in the monthly count of 241 and out of 1,502 deaths reported in June, 170 were late entries. Mohali, Amritsar, Mansa and Nawanshahr are among the districts where a majority of unreported deaths have been added by the health authorities. Explaining the reasons for backlog deaths being added to the state’s count, Punjab Covid nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “There are strict laid down norms which are to be followed for recording each death. The health authorities at district level have to match all records before making an entry, causing delay in some cases.” However, he ruled out any possibility of under-reporting, saying, “If we had to hide or under-report deaths, why would we add old deaths after reconciliation of data?” To expedite the process, the health department has authorised private hospitals to directly upload the details of patients who succumb to the virus on Cova portal. The private hospitals have also been directed to share the records at the earliest. Punjab has the highest case fatality rate of 2.7% in the country against the national figure of 1.3 while its death per million population stands at 545 against 325 of all-India level. Kerala, which has the highest number of nearly 2 lakh active cases in the country, has a fatality rate of just 0.5%. Since the beginning of the pandemic,16,364 people have lost their lives out of 6,00,463 infected .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/more-than-50-of-punjabs-covid-deaths-logged-in-august-were-old/articleshow/85754523.cms||Vinod Kumar

Activists of various farm organisations blocked national and state highways across the state and raised slogans against BJP’s Haryana and Union governments. They also demanded immediate dismissal of Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, accusing him of giving orders to police to hit heads of the protesters if they tried to break police barricades to move ahead. At many places, the effigies of Haryana government were also burnt. On Saturday too, similar scenes were witnessed in Punjab. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan alleged that the Haryana government was acting in a dictatorial manner and the way it attacked the farmers had unmasked its true face. Farm group BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill said BJP would have to pay for its misdeeds of mercilessly beating up farmers and not listening to miseries of those sitting at the borders of Delhi for over nine months. The farmers would teach them a lesson in coming assembly elections in UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/2-hour-road-blockades-across-punjab-on-day-2/articleshow/85754535.cms||---

Rawat’s statement, he said, had caused a “negative impact” in the state. “Two months back, the three-member panel headed by Kharge, after hearing all the MLAs from Punjab, had announced that the elections would be contested in Punjab under Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi’s leadership. Now, it is for Rawat to explain that when the decision was taken that elections would be contested under Captain Amaridner Singh’s leadership,” MLA Pargat on Sunday. Pargat said Navjot Sidhu’s remark ‘itt naal itt vaja daunga (will give a befitting reply)’ was “in all probability aimed at Rawat” but the media twisted it for the party high command. About the show of strength by CM Singh’s camp through a dinner hosted at sports minister Gurmeet Rana Sodhi’s residence, Pargat took a dig: “If so much effort were made on important issues then all this would not have been needed now. Amarinder Singh was the undisputed leader of Punjab but I feel sad that a person of his capability failed to meet expectations of the people.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-punjab-gen-secretary-keeps-pot-boiling-questions-rawat/articleshow/85754563.cms||IP Singh

UT adviser Dharam Pal issued these stern directions in a bid to draw more people to vaccination centres and prevent a third wave. The health department was told to complete the second dose by December 15. The administration has claimed 100% first dose vaccination, a target the health department supposedly achieved before the August15 deadline. “I will hold a meeting of department heads in the coming days and ensure full implementation of these directions. Vaccination is the only measure to tackle a possible third wave of coronavirus,” the adviser said. First off the blocks, Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) implemented the rules, with its CEO Yashpal Garg issuing the directions on Sunday. “The instructions applicable for visiting public are automatically applicable for officers. A list of all those officers who have not yet taken the first dose is to be prepared. In case any of them is found to be without vaccination or valid RTPCR report, disciplinary action will be taken,” a note from the CHB said. In case of outsourced staff, the outsourcing agency is to be requested for replacing officials who have not yet taken the first dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/forget-entering-govt-offices-if-jab-not-taken-chandigarh-advisor/articleshow/85754589.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Hurricane Ida made landfall in the US state of Louisiana as a Category Four storm on Sunday (local time). Notably, Ida hit the Gulf Coast on the 16th anniversary of the disastrous Hurricane Katrina. Speaking at a Sunday meeting of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Biden said that Ida was a "life-threatening" storm. "Its devastation is likely to be immense, we shouldn't kid ourselves ... Everyone should listen to the instructions from local and state officials, just how dangerous this is, and take it seriously," Biden said, adding that the states of Louisiana, Alabama and Michigan will get the "full resources of the federal government." On Sunday, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell spoke with government and state officials from Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to update them on the Biden administration's preparations for Hurricane Ida, promising assistance and help in local emergency response efforts. Biden visited FEMA's National Response Coordination Center on Sunday (local time). On Saturday (local time), he spoke with Criswel, while the day earlier the president spoke with the Governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, promising full support. According to the White House, in advance of the storm, over 2,400 FEMA employees were deployed and the agency has also prepositioned millions of meals and liters of water, as well as tarps, generators, and additional ambulances. Shelters have been opened across the impacted states and the US Coast Guard has already positioned vessels and aircraft for search and rescue efforts. Biden approved emergency disaster declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi on Friday and Saturday, respectively, authorizing direct federal help, including power generation. More than 504,000 Louisiana residents were without power on Sunday afternoon as Hurricane Ida began moving over the New Orleans area, according to poweroutage.us. The Mississippi River in New Orleans partially reversed its flow on Sunday, according to data from the US Geological Survey (USGS). Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards warned on Saturday that Ida could become one of the strongest storms to hit the US state since the 1850s, while New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged people to self-evacuate||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-says-hurricane-ida-likely-to-be-immense-promises-full-federal-aid/articleshow/85754612.cms||---

The city's Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness said on Twitter that energy company Entergy confirmed that New Orleans has no power, and that the only power in the city was coming from generators. The message included a screen shot that cited ``catastrophic transmission damage'' for the power failure. The National Weather Service said Ida, which came ashore as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, had weakened to a Category 3 storm with top sustained winds of up to 115 mph (193 kph) as its eye moved west of the city. Ida made landfall earlier in the day in Louisiana with even stronger winds of 150 mph (240 kph), blowing off roofs and inundating coastal communities with a powerful storm surge. It came ashore on the same date Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana and Mississippi 16 years earlier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ida-knocks-out-power-to-entire-city-of-new-orleans/articleshow/85754697.cms||---

There has been widespread criticism that the temple body, which has built 304 kalyana mandapams across the country, has not been in a position to properly maintain and monetise them. Of them, Andhra Pradesh has 216 and Telangana 77. Other than a handful of kalyana mandapams located in Tirupati and metropolitan cities, bookings at the kalyana mandapams in rural pockets have always been low. Eventually, the TTD was burning huge chunks of cash towards the maintenance of a majority of kalyana mandapams which had turned into white elephants. The temple body is spending about Rs 5 crore every year on their maintenance, though the income is meagre. This is the first time that the TTD is giving on lease such a large number of kalyana mandapams. Earlier, it had leased out 30 kalyana mandapams to private organisations. Ban on constructing mandapams lifted in 2012And in a drastic policy decision, the TTD has now decided to lease out as many as 191 kalyana mandapams for a period of five years. The TTD has appealed to Hindu religious organisations, mutts and individuals to submit their lease proposals on www.tender.apeprocurement.gov.in As there were no takers for its mandapams, the TTD on January 12, 2007 imposed ban on construction of kalyana mandapams in villages. Later, it extended the ban on April 6, 2010 to all over the country. However, on January 27, 2012 the TTD lifted the ban and resolved to approve construction of kalyana mandapams on case to case basis. Given the past experience sources in the TTD are sceptical about private organisation bidding for the mandapams. Earlier, efforts by TTD to lease out mandapams through district collectors had yielded little response. The TTD also could not give the mandapams on lease to local temples through endowments department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/ttd-to-lease-out-191-kalyana-mandapams-across-ap-t/articleshow/85748260.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

This means that after a gap of several months, the students will be back to their classrooms following basic Covid protocols. Cabinet minister for minority welfare, Haj and waqf, Nand Gopal Gupta 'Nandi' on Sunday passed the direction, stating that guidelines applicable for departments of basic education UP and secondary education UP would be followed for UP Board of Madrassa Education as well.

The heavy industries ministry is the sole dissenter amid strong opposition from some of the largest auto industry players, government sources told TOI, arguing that the concessions could help in the medium-term. Officials indicated that there is discussion around the tariff cuts coming with certain conditions, which may include a mandated level of infrastructure creation in the form of charging stations or similar requirements. Alternatively, a domestic sourcing clause could be added, which will require the Elon Musk-founded entity to buy some components from India, a model that was tried with single-brand retailing in the initial years. Some sections in the government are, however, in favour of getting the company to invest in charging infrastructure, which will not just help Tesla buyers but can also come handy for other electric vehicles users. They are arguing that the component suppliers may not be immediately available and in any case tracking compliance is often tough. Musk has been discussing an entry into India for the last few years, but it is contingent upon the concessions. Sources said Tesla has sought a lower import duty of 40% from current 60% on fully assembled electric cars priced below $40,000, and 60% from current 100% on vehicles above $40,000. Over the next few years, the government is hoping that Tesla could begin manufacturing in the country. The Palo Alto-headquartered company has registered an entity in India as part of its plans to foray here and start with its plans to have dealers here. Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had urged the top company executives that Tesla must have its manufacturing unit in India. “If they have to manufacture here, they need the numbers and no one can test the market when you impose such high import duty on the vehicles,” said a high-ranking officer. The proponents of local sourcing argue that it will help develop a vendor base in the country, which will be beneficial for the electric vehicle space in the long run. The government has been seeking to promote electric vehicles but the resistance from the domestic auto manufacturers has forced it to go slow apart from turf issue between the road transport ministry and NITI Aayog. On the issue of Tesla’s entry, however, both seem to be on the same page. In the past, the finance ministry has shunned proposals from companies such as Apple to enter India purely to sell its products and has instead preferred a model where the overseas player also sets up some manufacturing facility. Officials supporting Tesla’s plan, however, argue that it is important for any company to test the market for a few years before making a large commitment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/teslas-proposal-for-lower-import-duty-finds-traction/articleshow/85754725.cms||Dipak K Dash

Admitted to a ward in the new emergency building of Safdarjung hospital in Delhi, Nidhi (name changed) has stitches in several places on her skull and neck. “She is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Although there are chances of 100% recovery in such cases, we can’t say when,” the doctor told TOI. Read AlsoQuadruple murders: Two rounds of hacking on night of Gurugram slaughterDeath visited victims in House No. A-80 of Rajendra Park twice Tuesday. The interrogation of prime suspect, Rao Rai Singh (65), has revealed his daughter-in law Sunita and his tenant’s wife Anamika were alive almost four hours after he had first hacked them with a machete at 2.30am on Tuesday.The girl’s parents — Krishan and Anamika Tiwari — were tenants in the house of 65-year-old property dealer and former Armyman Rao Rai Singh, who is accused of killing four persons on August 24, including his daughter-in-law Sunita. Singh, who surrendered after the murders, and his wife Bimlesh have been arrested. Two of Krishan’s nephews — Suresh and Sandeep — have been taking turns to visit the girl in hospital. They arrived from Siwan in Bihar, a day after the murders. “She just nods her head whenever we ask her anything. That’s all. She puts in a lot of effort to speak but can’t utter a single word. She starts crying,” said Suresh. “We stay with her most of the time. When one of us goes to sleep, the other is with her,” said Sandeep. On Saturday, the girl’s relatives met the Udyog Vihar ACP Rajeev Kumar Yadav and sought full-time security for the girl. A Gurugram police constable has been posted outside her room, but the family claims he comes only in the evening. “The constable is there only in the evening. What if something happens to her in the morning? She is not only the lone survivor in the attack but also the sole witness to the murders. We are concerned about her safety. We request the police to provide her with 24x7 security,” said Suresh. When TOI visited the hospital, no constable was there outside the girl’s room. ACP Yadav, however, insisted a policeman was on duty all the time at the hospital. “We have also intimated the police in Safdarjung. They, too, are keeping an eye on the girl. We don’t suspect any untoward incident. Nonetheless, the police are always there to keep watch,” the ACP said. Doctors have advised the police against questioning the girl over the next few days. “Every two days, we check on the girl’s medical condition at the hospital. For the time being, the doctors have said she is not fit to take any questions. Her role is critical to solving this case,” the ACP added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/machete-attacks-trauma-hits-speech-of-6-year-old-survivor/articleshow/85750913.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||Soon, mobile app to help keep track of trees in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will soon roll out a mobile application to maintain records of trees in urban areas of the city, including those along roads. As part of the project, a survey will be carried out in the next few weeks to find out the number of trees in urban areas falling under the jurisdiction of GMDA and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and ensure their protection. The project, however, will not cover forest areas. The app, which has been exclusively developed for tree enumeration, will record all details of the trees, including height, girth, age, species, health and location. The exercise will help authorities maintain data on trees and assess the extent of green cover in Gurugram. Residents will also be able to download the app and see details of trees in the city. “Our teams will enumerate trees on the central verge of roads in GMDA and MCG areas. The app is ready and will be launched soon. We will start the survey by mid-September. We are waiting for the monsoon to subside, after which we will start work,” said Subhas Yadav, nodal officer of GMDA’s environment and sustainability wing. The surveyors will only need an Android smartphone on which the app has been installed. They will be able to fill in details of the trees on the app, such as their common and botanical names, approximate age, height, girth and canopy width, while the longitude and latitude will automatically be recorded. Upon entering the details of a particular plot, the app will be able to calculate the number of trees within the area. If it falls short of the norms, a notice can be sent to the owner, officials said. If the surveyors are not sure about a tree species, the app will also have a database of 200 commonly found trees to help identify it, along with detailed photographs of easy identifiers such as leaf and stem patterns. Environmental activists have welcomed the move and said a tree census for every sector in Gurugram is imperative to prevent tree felling. Every year, more than 1,000 trees are being chopped for construction of stilt parking areas in Gurugram, they said. “The blatant mindless act of destroying all green cover has made this city unliveable, unbreathable and with high temperatures in summer. The government should undertake measures to save every possible tree within city limits,” said Vaishali Rana, an activist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/soon-mobile-app-to-help-keep-track-of-trees-in-gurgaon/articleshow/85750970.cms||Ipsita Pati

Over 100 residents, including senior citizens and women holding banners, raised slogans against the builder at the Terra site over pending works . They alleged that the developer took occupancy certificate (OC) for project in 2017 but failed to complete the pending work even after 4 years despite repeated complaints. The residents have demanded that the OC of project Terra be put on hold by the authorities concerned till the time all works in the project are completed by the builder. Over 600 families are currently living the township. Satyavir Sangwan, a resident, said, “A conditional OC was granted by the concerned department on the terms that in absence of essential services such as electricity, water and sewer lines, builders will provide these services to residents at its cost. However, the builder failed to complete any pending work after getting partial OC, and we continue to suffer.” The residents complained that during every monsoon season, the society gets flooded. The basement is usually filled with water and the plasters are tearing off. The entire structure is being compromised as the pillars have taken heavy damage, said another resident. PK Naithani, RWA president of Park Serene, said, “The department has not carried out any audit and even if the authority passes any orders, the builder unabashedly violates it.” Rajeev Gupta, CMD of BPMS, said, that the master storm water drain in the area has not been laid by the GMDA yet. “We have put other measures to pump out storm water in adjoining areas to avoid flooding on the site. Electrical infrastructure, including our 33kv substation is ready, but it can only be energised once DHBVN feeding the 33kv substation at Sector 99 is commissioned,” Gupta said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/oc-taken-4-yrs-ago-but-work-incomplete-say-flat-owners/articleshow/85751022.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Parts of old Gurgaon saw drizzle around 2pm that lasted for a few minutes, but it was not enough to be recorded at the IMD’s observatory. However, the maximum temperature dropped from Saturday’s 35.4 degrees Celsius to 34 degrees Celsius on Sunday, following a short spell of light showers and partly cloudy conditions. The minimum temperature settled at 25.4 degrees Celsius, while the relative humidity index oscillated between 75% and 80% on Sunday. According to the weather department, more rain is in store for the next four days, however, it will intensify on Tuesday with light to moderate showers accompanied by thunderstorms. The met department has issued a yellow alert for Monday predicting light showers with partly cloudy skies. An IMD official said, “The western end of monsoon trough at mean sea level is near normal and eastern end is south of its normal position. The monsoon trough is very likely to be south of its normal position during the next 4-5 days. As a result, there will be intermittent light rain during this period with a possibility of few intense spells.” Gurgaon had last received 39mm rain on August 21 and since then dry weather conditions were prevailing in the city. It has recorded 39% rain deficit in this month and received only 114.3 mm rain compared to the normal of 188.5 mm. The district, however, has 32% excess rainfall between June 1 and August 29, with 510.7 mm rain compared to season’s normal of 387.5mm. According to the weekly forecast, the maximum temperature is likely to hover around 30-34 degrees Celsius in the next six days, while the minimum temperature will settle around 25-26 degrees Celsius. The city’s air quality index on Sunday slightly deteriorated but remained in the moderate category. The overall AQI was at 122 against 107 on the previous day. Meanwhile, drizzle was also recorded in parts of Delhi on Sunday. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), rain activity is expected to pick up in the last two days of the month. While light showers are forecast for Monday, moderate rainfall may occur at some places on Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials say rainfall is expected to continue till Friday, but Delhi is unlikely to receive a spell of ‘heavy’ rainfall during this period. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, had received 214.5mm of rainfall so far this month till 8.30am on Sunday, with the normal mark being at 241.9mm. However, the station recorded no rainfall during the day. This means the station is currently at a deficit of 11%, officials said. “The monsoon trough is still south of Delhi-NCR, but some light to moderate rainfall activity will still occur in the region. Unless decent rain is recorded on Tuesday, Safdarjung could end the month in a slight deficit,” said an official. While no rainfall was recorded at Safdarjung, Lodhi Road recorded ‘trace’ rainfall between 8.30 am on Saturday and 8.30 am on Sunday, Ridge recorded 22.2mm and Najafgarh received 0.5mm during this period. Between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Sunday, only Palam received rain, recording ‘trace’ rainfall. Delhi’s air quality remains in the ‘moderate’ category. It showed an improvement on Sunday, dropping from 147 (moderate) on Saturday to 119. Safar, a government air quality forecasting body, says AQI is likely to stay in the ‘moderate’ category in the next two days as well, with PM10 remaining the lead pollutant. External dust from western part of Delhi and local resuspended dust within NCR are not able to get dispersed due to low wind speeds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/light-showers-bring-relief-to-gurgaon-imd-says-heavier-spells-in-store/articleshow/85751059.cms||---

Police have arrested the three accused in the case. They have been identified as Alok Kumar, Nikesh Pachputte and Deepak Saini. The fraud dates back to November 2020, when Alok, a peon, connected Shyam Singh, to Nikesh for government jobs for his three sons. Nikesh convinced Singh that he worked at the corporation and could help his sons get government jobs in exchange for money. After submitting personal documents, the youths were asked to visit Chhattisgarh where they were given forged documents as appointment letters. After the fraudster kept asking for money for other things, the man grew suspicious. Singh was asked to submit Rs 40 lakh in installments. He gave them the money by selling a part of his land and by mortgaging another. Nikesh kept saying that Singh’s sons will get the job call but nothing worked, following which Singh became suspicious and called the branch head and learnt that he was duped. When Singh confronted them, he was threatened with dire consequences, police said. An FIR has been registered with the Sadar Sohna police station under Sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467 (forgery), 471 (fraudulent and dishonest), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/man-promised-fci-jobs-for-sons-duped-of-rs-40l/articleshow/85751087.cms||Sagrika Kissu

They are clearly articulating it will be a hybrid way of working. So, it needs to be a solution that really is end-to-end and robust in providing that flexibility,” Hegarty said in an interaction with TOI. Dell is a vendor of a whole range of devices including laptops, desktops, tablets, servers, and storage & networking products. Enterprise customers increasingly are interested not as much in these devices, as in how all of them can be combined, together with Dell’s own software, as also technology from partners, to create solutions for different needs. Hegarty said customers want to know: How do you deploy the devices remotely? How do you ensure that those solutions are secure? That the employees can be productive and secure in that environment?||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dell-customers-want-solutions-not-devices/articleshow/85754795.cms||Sujit John

Plant employees, leaders of various political parties, and VSP land oustees and their family members including children and women participated in the ‘maha manava haram’ (mega human chain) against the sale of VSP. ‘Will continue struggle till govt rolls back its decision’The agitation was launched after the Union government gave its approval for 100 per cent strategic disinvestment of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), the corporate entity of Vizag Steel. A large number of people were seen on the roads even before the scheduled start of the human chain, expressing solidarity with the agitators. They raised slogans against the privatisation and also the BJP government. Coming down heavily on the Centre for selling the profit-making PSUs in the country, the leaders and activists of the committee said they will continue fighting for the plant. Extending support to the cause, Anakapalle MP B Satyavati said all MPs from Andhra Pradesh will strive to save the VSP. Committee members said over 8,000 displaced people have been waiting for employment in the steel plant. “They will not let anyone take over the plant as the VSP materialised because of their sacrifices. We will continue our fight till the BJP government rolls back its decision. We will intensify our protest in the coming days,” they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/10-km-long-human-chain-against-vsp-privatisation/articleshow/85748253.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: More Covid-19 deaths at night in Haveri district||HAVERI: An expert committee, constituted to assess reasons for the high fatality rate in Haveri district, has found more Covid-19 patients died in the night perhas due to doctors shirking duties. The experts found that due to a lack of monitoring by doctors on night shift, many serious patients died, especially at the Haveri district hospital. The report says, very often during the night, “doctors do not enter the Covid ward and patients are advised by junior doctors and staff nurses from the ward entrance”. The committee comprises Dr Basavaraj Kallapur and Dr Ishwar Hasbi of Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubballi, and Dr Sampathsing Rangawale, a senior specialist. They had submitted their report recently. Experts said another reason for the high number of deaths is the unsatisfactory process of identifying symptomatic patients. This led to delays in shifting patients to Covid Care Centres or hospitals for timely treatment. “Patients were not admitted to ICUs or put on ventilators even though were available in the government hospitals,” the report said. Lack of death audits was another reason. Private doctors at fault tooThe committee also lambasted private doctors, saying many deaths occurred during the second wave “due to incomplete treatment”. The report said private doctors did not refer seriously ill patients to bigger hospitals on time and they did not follow protocol while treating Covid-19 patients. The committee also found that private doctors did not refer suspected Covid-19 patients for swab tests regularly enough. The committee said 87 patients were referred from private facilities to the district hospital when the disease was in the late stages, and some 50 patients had directly approached the district hospital when their oxygen saturation was less than 30%, indicating poor field activity. “This is one reason for the high fatality rate in the Haveri district,” the report said. Private hospitals have refuted the findings. “We followed all protocols while treating patients,” said Dr Ravikumar Malladad, president, IMA, Haveri unit. “There is no question of private doctors not treating patients without test reports. The department should conduct a training programme for private doctors on what they should when treating Covid patients.” "We have received the report by the committee of experts. The government will adopt their suggestions to curb deaths and will initiate action against those who have failed to discharge their duty," Dr KV Trilok Chandra, commissioner, health and family welfare department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/karnataka-more-covid-19-deaths-at-night-in-haveri-district/articleshow/85754822.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli
---||Business||Airtel to raise ₹21k crore via 4th largest rights issue||NEW DELHI: The Sunil Mittal led Bharti Airtel announced a Rs 21,000-crore fund-raise through a rights issue at a price of Rs 535 per share. The money comes in at a time when the company gears up for the launch of 5G services in India even as it looks to cut down its debt of Rs 1.6 lakh crore. The funds are also expected to help Airtel build a war chest as a possible collapse of rival Vodafone Idea may mean it could gain a large number of new subscribers, many of whom will also move over to market leader Reliance Jio. A large influx of customers — Vodafone Idea currently has nearly 27 crore users — would mean that Airtel needs to invest in capex and other infrastructure to meet the surge. In a regulatory filing on Sunday, Airtel said its board approved the issue for “… issuance of equity shares of face value of Rs 5 each of the company on rights basis to eligible equity shareholders of the company as on the record date (to be notified later), of an issue size of up to Rs 21,000 crore”. The rights entitlement ratio entails one equity share for every 14 equity shares held by eligible shareholders as on the record date. The terms of payment of issue price envisage 25% on application and balance in two more additional calls as may be decided by the board or its committee based on the company’s requirements within an overall time-horizon of 36 months, Airtel said. “The promoter and promoter group of the company would collectively subscribe to the full extent of their aggregate rights entitlement,” it said, adding that “they will also subscribe to any unsubscribed shares in the issue”. Promoter holding in the company stands at about 55.8%, while public holds over 44%. The board of Airtel has constituted a ‘Special Committee of Directors’ to decide the other terms and conditions of the issue, including issue period and the record date. The board of directors at the meeting reviewed the telecom industry scenario, business environment, financial and business strategy of the company and approved the plan to raise further capital. In its note last week, Jefferies had said that any capital-raise by Bharti Airtel that aims to enhance capacity in anticipation of large market share shifts from Vodafone Idea could be seen “positively”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/airtel-to-raise-21k-crore-via-4th-largest-rights-issue/articleshow/85754857.cms||---

Between April and August 25, 2020, income tax refunds were paid to over 25.5 lakh taxpayers and added up to Rs 95,853 crore. The government did not give the comparative data, but officials have in the past blamed the glitches in the tax portal for a slowdown in payments. In a series of tweets, the department said that, so far, 93% of the refund claims made in returns for assessment year 2020-21 (FY2019-20) have been processed. “In the past week, refunds of over Rs 15,269 crore have been issued which will be credited to taxpayers shortly,” it said. Last year, the government had focused on refunds, which rose 42% to Rs 2.6 lakh crore and were paid to nearly 2.4 crore taxpayers. “It may be noted that this included the refunds expedited in a series of measures providing relief to taxpayers during the pandemic,” the income tax department tweeted late Sunday evening. Authorities are communicating with taxpayers to seek responses in cases where refunds have not been paid due to adjustments, defects, or bank account mismatch so that the payout can be expedited. “The department requests taxpayers to respond online quickly, so that ITRs (income tax returns) in such cases of AY 20-21 can be processed expeditiously. The department has also commenced processing of ITRs 1 & 4 for AY 2021-22 (FY2020-21) and refunds, if any, will be issued directly to the bank account of the taxpayer,” it added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/i-t-refunds-top-51000crore-but-lower-than-last-year/articleshow/85754898.cms||---

The Carlyle Group — the Washington-based multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services giant — is set to pip bulge-bracket private equity giants such as Bain Capital, KKR and the Paris-based outsourcer Teleperformance. These entities had submitted binding bids by mid-August. If the deal is materialised it will be the biggest deal in the domestic software services space. “Baring is set to go with the Carlyle Group's $3-billion bid, as it's much higher than the other bids, which are around $2.5 billion,” one of the investment bankers negotiating the deal and advising the sell-side said on condition of anonymity, as the matter is private and yet to be completed. The deal will be closed very soon, he added. A Hexaware spokesperson refused to comment saying the matter is private. An email sent to the Carlyle Asia headquarters on Saturday did not elicit a response till the time of going to the press. Atul K Nishar, the founder and chairman, had launched Hexaware in 1990 in Mumbai and, in 2013, sold majority stake to Baring PE Asia for Rs 1,687 crore with an open offer for another 26% for Rs 1,058 crore more, totalling the deal at Rs 2,745 crore, and later fully exited the company but remains the chairman. By November, Baring picked 100% in the company. After taking Hexaware private in November 2020, in late April this year, Baring put the company on the block. Carlyle had earlier unsuccessfully pursued Mphasis, which finally went to Blackstone but fell through over a valuation mismatch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/carlyle-may-buy-hexaware-for-3-billion/articleshow/85754915.cms||---

Khan, 42, had served out his prison term but continued to be in detention for nearly one and a half years in Gwalior due to Covid curbs, SP Gwalior Amit Sanghi said. “We released him at the border. He will now be taken care of by Pakistan Rangers,” said the SP. A special team took him to Wagah on Saturday. Khan’s release from Gwalior jail in March 2020 coincided with the Covid outbreak and the first lockdown A free man, but not yet free, Khan had to be shifted to an undisclosed detention centre due to the sensitivity of the case, where he spent the rest of his days until his deportation papers were cleared by the ministry of home affairs. Khan was arrested on March 13, 2006, in Gwalior’s Daliawala locality where he was living as ‘Madho Singh, son of Ved Prakash’, say police. He had even managed to obtain a driving licence via a forged marksheet, and a ration card, and was planning to marry a local girl, when police caught him. Two collaborators – Md Shahid of Bulandshahar in Uttar Pradesh and Ameen Ansari of Gwalior – were arrested for providing logistics support to him. On May 28, 2008, a Gwalior court sentenced him to 14 years in prison. The co-accused were convicted under Official Secrets Act 1923 and Foreigners Act, 1946. While Ansari was jailed for 10 years, Shahid was handed a two-year prison term. The prosecution said that Khan had a valid Pakistani passport (No K224602), issued on May 20, 2001, which showed he was a resident of Satellite Town Colony, Police Station City, Rahim-yar-Khan district of Punjab, Pakistan. Leaving behind his wife and a son in Pakistan, he entered India under visa No P 391103, dated April 26, 2005, through the Wagah border. After entering India, he secured a residential permit (Under The Foreigners Order 1948). His visa was valid till August 26, 2005, but he overstayed. Police told the court that after his visa expired, Khan went into hiding and visited various places in India. He lived in Gwalior under a fake name and managed to get hold of ID papers. Police say he took a house on rent where he sketched maps of prohibited defence organizations and sent them to Pakistan. Based on intelligence inputs, the then SHO of Inderganj police station A R Sharma raided the house and arrested Khan. A confidential defence map and some other papers were seized from the house, say police. After his conviction, Khan moved high court, admitting that he had overstayed in India but denying any involvement in any espionage. He alleged that he wasn’t heard properly during the trial. He was released after completing his 14-year prison term.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/freed-spy-who-became-a-covid-prisoner-in-gwalior-finally-back-in-pakistan/articleshow/85754901.cms||P Naveen

Recent losses in the apparel industry in Noida also have a connection with the country. For the past seven months, apparel makers of the city have been counting losses in production in an unexpected aftermath of an international ban on Xinjiang cotton. The US and a few other countries have banned the import of cotton from the Xinjiang region of China following reports of human rights violations against Uighur Muslims, who are mostly employed in cotton production. The reports suggest that the community has been forced into labour in Xinjiang, which accounts for a major chunk of the world’s cotton supply. As a result of this international boycott, Chinese manufacturers have reduced production in their country and booked large amounts of cotton yarn from India and other parts of Southeast Asia. With most of the Indian cotton now being exported to China, the prices of yarn and thread have shot up for domestic traders. Apparel manufacturers in the city said yarn prices had gone up by 70-80% in India, leading to an increased cost of production. Since neighbouring countries like Bangladesh are exporting garments at cheaper rates, the losses have mounted all the more. “In the past six months, yarn export has increased by about 75% and the price for us has gone up by almost 80%. Because of this, our cost of production has increased. We are now exporting a dress for about $8 (Rs 588), which Bangladesh manufacturers can give for $6.5 (Rs 478). This price is not viable for us anymore. Business is shifting to other countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam,” said Lalit Thukral, president of the Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC). What has added to the woes of traders is a government decision to levy an additional 10% import duty on cotton. “Our suppliers say the cotton yarn has been bought by China with an advance payment for the entire lot from not just India, but several Southeast Asian countries. The yarn companies are seeing huge profits and their shares are off the roof. But the garment industry is suffering. The issue has been raised with the government at every level, but there has been no response yet,” said Neeraj Prakash, managing director of Strange Exports Private Limited, which has been in the business for the past 30 years. Apparel makers said the increasing yarn export could also lead to job losses since it is not a labour-intensive industry. According to an industry observer, a Rs 100 crore investment in cotton production will employ about 300 people, while the same amount in apparel manufacturing will give jobs to 70,000 people. “We are looking at ‘Make in India’. But this trend is clearly not making indigenous production possible. We grow cotton in India, but we are buying it at higher prices. Our exports are suffering, and fewer people are getting employed,” said Thukral. He claimed that in the past three years, the apparel export industry has gone down from $18 billion to $12.5 billion now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/why-a-ban-on-chinese-cotton-has-hit-apparel-traders-in-city/articleshow/85749720.cms||Snehil Sinha

Around 133 new Covid-19 positive cases have been reported in 15 days between August 15 and August 29. And these cases were reported from 16 out of the 52 districts of the state. The districts where maximum cases were reported in the past 15 days include Jabalpur (35 new cases), Indore (30 new cases), Bhopal (29 new cases), Rajgarh (8 new cases), Dhar (7 new cases), Panna (5 new cases), Alirajpur (3 new cases), Harda (3 new cases), Raisen (3 new cases), Hoshangabad (2 new cases), Rewa (2 new cases), Sheopur (2 new cases), and one new case each in Gwalior, Ratlam, Sagar and Singrauli districts. Of the total 133 cases, 70% or 94 cases were reported from only three districts Jabalpur, Indore and Bhopal. Thus from 36 districts of the state no new cases have been reported in the past 15 days, said sources adding, it is a good sign as these districts are probably without any Covid-19 patient. However it has been thrice in the past 10 days when more than 10 new cases were reported in the state, August 19, then August 27 and now on August 29, said sources. And of the 16 districts where new cases were reported in the past 15 days, it was only in past three days that three of these 16 districts saw patients, though it is not alarming as of now, but given to the nature of the virus and the speed at which it spreads, it is important to ensure that everyone follows covid-19 appropriate behaviour and also vaccination is carried out at larger scale, added sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/no-new-covid-case-in-36-districts-of-madhya-pradesh-in-past-2-weeks/articleshow/85754964.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Officials said different work circles had been asked to expedite the work on cleaning the water bodies that come under the areas. Around 50 ponds have already been cleaned so far, while the others are expected to be cleaned by October. Some of the villages where the ponds have been cleaned are Milak Lachhi, Roza Jalalpur, Roza Yakubpur, Achheja, Chhapraula, Shahberi, Chipiyana Buzurg, Badalpur, Sadhopur, Dhoom Manikpur and so on. “We have begun cleaning the ponds in several villages of Greater Noida. For this, teams have been formed under different work circles and they are carrying out the job. A deadline of two months has been given for the work to be completed. Just like our residential sectors, we aim to make our villages smart and clean too,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the GNIDA CEO. The cleaning work includes removing the sludge, weeds, plants as well as garbage along the sides of the water bodies. “Due to the cleaning of ponds, water harvesting has also got a boost. This will also improve the groundwater level in the villages apart from boosting the overall beauty of the area,” said Rajkumar, a resident of Rupwas village. Uday Naga of Dhoom Manikpur said that as part of the cleaning project, dustbins had also been kept along the side of the ponds to ensure people did not litter the areas. “This is a welcome move. People are being told to throw garbage only in dustbins instead of littering the nearby areas,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/50-ponds-cleaned-gnida-targets-94-more-by-october/articleshow/85749819.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Two accused — Vijay alias Rahul, a transgender person from Ghaziabad and Prince from Hapur — have been arrested, they said. Muradnagar police station SHO Hariom Singh said a hospital staffer told them that an unknown woman has been visiting the facility for the past three days. In CCTV footage from inside the hospital, the same woman can be seen standing outside the newborn ward, he said. “A tea seller told us that a bearded person in a sari was coming to his stall for the past few days,” he said. The suspect’s picture was then sent to several people from the transgender community in other districts. Next, the accused were held from Ganga Canal, Singh said, adding that “the duo was at that time trying to flee with the child”. SP Rural Dr Iraj Raja said the accused told the police that they knew each other for the past two years. “They wanted to get married and raise a child and hence, they kidnapped the child from the hospital. We are checking whether they wanted to sell the child and if anyone else is involved in the crime. Further probe is under way,” he said. The accused have been booked under section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) of the IPC. Meanwhile, chief medical officer Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar has directed all government hospitals to strengthen their security measures. “Hospitals have been told to ensure that the premises are under CCTV surveillance,” he told TOI.
