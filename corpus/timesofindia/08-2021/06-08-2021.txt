"Nine years ago today, we witnessed an act of unspeakable hate as a white supremacist shot ten people at a Sikh Temple," Biden tweeted. "As we remember those we lost in Oak Creek, we must continue to stand up to hate and bigotry and ensure that all are able to practice their faith without fear." The Oak Creek Fire Department also reflected upon the events of the attack. "Today, we pause to reflect upon the events of this tragic day and hope that our entire community can serve as an example that coming together as one can promote healing as well as continued growth as a society," the department tweeted. On August 5, 2012, 40-year-old white supremacist Wade Page fatally shot six people and injured four others. The gunman killed himself after he was shot in the hip by a police officer. Last year, too, Biden had joined several lawmakers and the Sikh community to remember the victims of the Oak Creek shootout. "To truly honour those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbour, and reduce gun violence," he had said on August 6, 2020. The six killed included one woman and five men.

What stood out in the image was that he was having the dosa with a fork and knife, inviting a flood of tweets suggesting it wasn‚Äôt the best way to relish the dish.  Ellis, British high commissioner to India, was on his maiden two-day visit to Bengaluru when he tried the Mysuru masala dosa on Wednesday and shared the much-talked-about photo with the caption ‚Äî ‚ÄúDelicious #MysuruMasalaDosa! A great way to begin my first visit to #Bengaluru.‚Äù He also added superlatives in Kannada and Hindi ‚Äî ‚ÄòSakkat Aagide‚Äô (very good) and ‚ÄòBahut Swadisht Hai‚Äô (very tasty). Delicious #MysuruMasalaDosa!! A great way to begin my first visit to #Bengaluru. ‡≤∏‡≤æ‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤ï‡≤§‡≥ç ‡≤Ü‡≤ó‡≤ø‡≤¶‡≥Ü | ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‚Ä¶ https://t.co/sl056ZdocC‚Äî Alex Ellis (@AlexWEllis) 1628059007000The Dosa Guy, a Twitter user, replied: ‚ÄúMr Alex, you‚Äôre supposed to eat Dosa with hands. Unlike crepes, Masala Dosa is quite crisp in nature, it will be counterproductive to eat Dosa with a fork. But nonetheless, welcome to Bangalore and I hope that Dosa lived up to the expectations of our city.‚Äù 92% of Twitter is correct!

Arshad commented: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt spoil the joy of eating Masala Dosa, Alex Ellis. Avoid Fork and knife. Eat like an Indian. I am sure you will enjoy it! Try maadi!‚Äù The diplomat was quick to sense the mood and posted a poll the same afternoon. ‚ÄúSo South India; how do I eat tomorrow‚Äôs dosa? ‚Äî hands or knife and fork‚Äù. The virtual verdict was as expected: With hands, of course! Next day, Ellis posted a video of trying a dosa with his hands and wrote: ‚Äú92% of Twitter is correct! It tastes better with the hand...‚Äù He also peppered the post with Kannada and Hindi words such as ‚ÄòBombaat Guru‚Äô and 'Ekdum Mast‚Äô to describe how much he savoured the taste. Jeremy Pilmore-Bedford, British deputy high commissioner for Karnataka and Kerala, too responded to Ellis‚Äô tweet, saying he always has his dosa with hands and that‚Äôs how it is done. The diplomat‚Äôs video and use of words like ‚ÄòGuru‚Äô and ‚ÄòBombaat‚Äô won lots of virtual applause. Ellis reached the city on Wednesday morning and returned to Delhi on Friday evening. His visit was to highlight the importance of Karnataka in the India-UK relationship, and he was the first diplomat to call on new CM Basavaraj Bommai. A shift in diplomacyExperts say the friendly virtual banter over the British high commissioner‚Äôs tryst with masala dosa shows how social media has bridged the gulf between diplomats and people of countries where they are posted. Jeremy Pilmore-Bedford told TOI social media has become an integral part of contemporary international relations. ‚ÄúPlatforms like Twitter allow diplomats to reach a wide range of audiences and bring countries and cultures closer together,‚Äù he said. Mohamed Zeeshan, foreign affairs columnist and author of ‚ÄòFlying Blind: India‚Äôs Quest for Global Leadership‚Äô, said if a British diplomat ate Indian food with cutlery and then misspoke somehow, it could easily be misinterpreted as ‚Äòcultural appropriation‚Äô and ‚Äòcolonial hangover‚Äô. However, the high commissioner avoided it all by handling the matter adroitly, he said. Divya Malhotra, assistant professor with School of Strategic Studies, Rashtriya Raksha University, Gujarat said social media has removed conventional barriers between government officials and citizens. ‚ÄúIn this era of digital diplomacy, diplomats have found an alternative space to interact with local people and connect with their culture, and this chatter over dosa-eating etiquette testifies that.‚Äù Tanvi Madan, senior fellow at Brookings Institution and author of Fateful Triangle: How China Shaped US-India Relations During the Cold War, tweeted: "Good diplotwitter game..." She said the response to the diplomat eating dosa with fork and knife was ‚Äúakin to a NY politician eating pizza‚Äù with a fork and knife.

"We urge Iran to return to the negotiations soon," state department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. "If President Raisi is genuine in his determination to see the sanctions lifted, well that is precisely what's on the table in Vienna," he said. "We hope that Iran seizes the opportunity now to advance diplomatic solutions," Price said. He was referring to months of fruitless indirect talks in the Austrian capital on reviving the 2015 nuclear accord trashed by former president Donald Trump. Price reiterated that the Biden administration, despite concerns with Iran, saw the accord as key to securing "permanent and verifiable limits on Iran's nuclear program." Price said that the proposal to end sweeping sanctions in return for compliance with the deal would not last "indefinitely." "For us, this is an urgent priority, knowing the issues that are at play," Price said. "We hope that the Iranians treat it with the same degree of urgency."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-urges-raisis-iran-to-resume-negotiations-soon/articleshow/85081036.cms||---

The company‚Äôs employees will start working with the AAI staff at the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport from next week to get familiarised with the task before the management is handed over to the private operator. ‚ÄúOnly security and air traffic communication will be looked after by AAI,‚Äù sources said. The management would have taken over in July itself this year, but the company sought time until October. The airport has around 440 employees. The airport management recently slapped a notice to vacate all 220 AAI quarters at the airport residential colony by August-end. The privatisation bid had become a major issue in the last assembly election. AAI sources said the takeover took a while because of the election and also the lean business period because of the Covid-19 factor. ‚ÄúTaking over the management of the airport during or before the election could have spelled trouble for the government,‚Äù said an AAI official. Airport Authority Employees' Union (AAEU) members staged relentless protests from August last year after the Union cabinet approved the move to lease out three airports ‚Äî Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram. The displaced AAI employees at LGBI are most likely to be posted at other airports. As the gateway to South-East Asia, a new integrated terminal building has come up at the airport with a capacity of 3,100 passengers at peek hours. ‚ÄúThe Guwahati airport is an inter-regional hub. Why should the entire management be handed over to a private entity for the sake of managing a terminal building? They have no expertise in managing airports,‚Äù said AAEU leader, Pabitra Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/adani-group-set-to-take-over-guwahati-airport-by-october/articleshow/85079433.cms||Kangkan Kalita

On August 5, 2019, the Centre announced nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution that accorded a special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into Union territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. "This day (August 5) two years ago a (un)constitutional coup was executed in J&K," Chidambaram tweeted.

We must stand resolutely with the people of J&K," the former home minister said. Four terror incidents, protests by the PDP and celebrations by the BJP marked the second anniversary of the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status on Thursday as opposition parties in the Kashmir Valley vowed to strive for the restoration of the pre-August 2019 status of the erstwhile state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/every-aspect-of-democracy-was-desecrated-that-day-chidambaram-on-jk-special-status-abrogation/articleshow/85081777.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru may get dedicated minister||BENGALURU: Will chief minister Basavaraj Bommai assign Bengaluru development to one of the seven ministers from the city or will he take a cue from predecessor BS Yediyurappa and retain it? It‚Äôs arguably the most prestigious ministry as it shapes the future of the capital. Seven ministers from the city are already staking claim to it, with three biggies ‚Äî R Ashoka, CN Ashwath Narayan and V Somanna ‚Äî leaving no stone unturned. Byrathi Basavaraj, ST Somashekar, K Gopalaiah and MTB Nagaraj are lobbying for it too. There‚Äôs speculation that one of the top three contenders may be considered, as BBMP polls are imminent. Party insiders say since Bommai is keen on finance and water resources, he may have to appoint a dedicated minister for Bengaluru. However, he may retain Bengaluru development and not upset anyone as the party needs the support of all MLAs and ministers from Bengaluru to retain power. ‚ÄúBommai wants control over Bengaluru because he wants to ensure satisfactory implementation of Bengaluru Mission project,‚Äô‚Äô said a minister. Many feel not having a dedicated Bengaluru development minister will prove harmful. Yediyurappa hadn‚Äôt appointed a dedicated minister when he took charge in 2019 because there were too many contenders. This didn‚Äôt sit well with BBMP and other agencies because they faced enormous challenges in planning and implementation. Multiple infrastructure projects, including Smart City, Metro rail, sub-urban rail, drinking water and ring road are going on with little political supervision, claim officials of BBMP and BWSSB. ‚ÄúThe chief minister is in charge of the whole state, and it‚Äôs difficult for him to give adequate attention to Bengaluru. A minister for the capital will solve one of the biggest problems ‚Äî lack of coordination and integration between civic agencies and government. It will enable bold policies which require political approval,‚Äù said urban expert N Vijaykumar. However, some insist the CM managing Bengaluru would help the city as all decisions regarding budgeting and execution can be taken quickly since he holds the finance portfolio too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-may-get-dedicated-min/articleshow/85082107.cms||Manu Aiyappa

No sooner were the raids conducted, opposition leader Siddaramaiah defended his confidante Khan by claiming it was political vendetta. ‚ÄúThe ED raids on our legislator Zameer Ahmed Khan is nothing but political vendetta. BJP, which is in power at the Centre, is trying to scare opposition parties by misusing its authority and conducting IT and ED raids. It is a deplorable act,‚Äù he said. KPCC president DK Shivakumar went a step further and said the raids were intended to target a ‚Äúsection‚Äù of society. When asked whether he was hinting at targeting of the Muslim community, he said: ‚ÄúYou can take it however you want. But the raids were intended to send out a message to them.‚Äù Shivakumar said harassment of the opposition was happening across the country. ‚ÄúWhen a notice was issued by ED to our MLA in 2019, he responded to it and gave his statement. Did it take so long for the investigating authorities to raid him and supposedly seize evidence,‚Äù questioned Shivakumar. Congress also asked why there was selective targeting of leaders when complaints have been lodged against others like BY Vijayendra too. CM dismisses allegationChief minister Basavaraj Bommai dismissed the selective targeting allegation and said Congress is trying to politicise the issue. ‚ÄúJust because someone files a complaint against a person, it does not warrant raids. Central investigating agencies have their own evidence-gathering measures in place. Congress has become an expert in decoding these raids and alleging bias,‚Äù said Bommai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/congress-cries-foul-says-central-agencies-are-targeting-its-leaders/articleshow/85082109.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Veggie trader & factory owner nabbed, red sanders worth Rs 4.5 crore seized||BENGALURU: A 51-year-old vegetable trader and a factory owner were arrested on Thursday for allegedly storing red sanders in Bengaluru to smuggle them to foreign countries. Officials from Central Crime Branch (CCB) seized 9,135kg of red sanders worth Rs 4.5 crore and three vehicles, including two trucks, from the duo. According to police, the accused are Anand Kumar, 51, vegetable trader and resident of Chennai, and Aneel Singhi, 47, an industrialist and resident of Bengaluru. Two more suspects are at large and efforts are on to trace them. Police claim they received information about two persons visiting Kammanahalli-Gottigere Main Road near Hulimavu to show samples of red sanders to their customers on Thursday morning. A team headed by HS Parameshwar, assistant commissioner of police, rushed to the spot and detained the duo around 10.30am. Police found only one log of red sanders with the suspects and further probe revealed they had stored huge quantities at a godown on the second floor of a building on Hommadevanahalli Main Road. Cops said Singhi runs a factory on the ground and first floors of the building and had rented out the second floor to a gang which smuggled red sanders. The two main suspects who are at large had smuggled red sanders to China and Japan earlier. ‚ÄúKumar and Singhi claimed they joined hands with the main suspects recently and were caught by police before they could make money in this illegal business,‚Äù a source said. Preliminary probe revealed Singhi had rented out his godown to store red sanders illegally for a long time. Police found he had provided a separate set-up to lift wooden logs to the second floor of the building. The gang used to procure red sanders from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. They brought them to the godown and later smuggled them to foreign countries,‚Äù a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/veggie-trader-factory-owner-nabbed-red-sanders-worth-4-5cr-seized/articleshow/85082117.cms||---
---||World||Fire that reached Turkish power plant contained, others burn||MUGLA, TURKEY: Turkey‚Äôs worst wildfires in decades have raged for nine days amid scorching heat, low humidity and constantly shifting strong winds. The fires have so far killed eight people and countless animals. In coastal Mugla province, where tourist hot spot Bodrum is located, fires continued to burn in six areas on Thursday, officials said. Fires also raged in five districts of Antalya province, another tourism destination, where two neighborhoods were evacuated on Wednesday. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the situation in Antalya was improving. ‚ÄúWe are in better shape today than yesterday. We stopped the fire from spreading further, thanks to interventions from the air and the ground,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are more hopeful for tomorrow (when) wind speeds will be lower. We need to turn this to our advantage.‚Äù Precautions were taken before the flames reached the Kemerkoy power plant. The plant‚Äôs hydrogen tanks were emptied, and workers were evacuated. Flammable and explosive substances had also been removed, according to state broadcaster TRT. Energy Minister Fatih Donmez told reporters that the plant‚Äôs main units, including its turbines, were not damaged, adding that authorities wanted to render it operational again as soon as possible. He added that no dangerous emissions were reported from the plant. ‚ÄúAt the moment, there is no fire that is threatening the plant,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis plant is of critical importance to the region.‚Äù The privately run plant uses lignite to generate electricity, according to its website. Television images showed dozens of fire trucks and water tankers surrounding the plant‚Äôs main building, some dousing water as part of a cooling effort that also involved planes and helicopters. The main building did not appear to have been affected. A forestry authority official warned, however, that the Kemerkoy plant and another nearby power station were still at risk due to the unpredictable winds. Authorities blocked roads and were not allowing people to get close to Kemerkoy. Before the fire reached the power plant, firefighters had been working for two days to protect it from advancing flames. Videos from an adjacent neighborhood in Milas showed charred, decimated trees. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan‚Äôs government has come under intense criticism over an allegedly slow response to the blazes and inadequate preparedness for large-scale wildfires. The government acknowledged that the country did not have a useable fleet of water-dropping planes. Firefighting aircraft from Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Spain and Croatia came to Turkey to back the ground operation. Cavusoglu said two planes being hired from Israel were expected to arrive on Friday. Poland had offered to send a military Black Hawk helicopter and 14 crew members, while Turkey and the United States were discussing an offer for two military Chinook helicopters, he added. In the past week, mayors posted videos on social media pleading for aerial firefighting responses to local wildfires, and Turkish celebrities joined a social media campaign requesting foreign help to combat the blazes. The campaign drew an angry response from a top Erdogan aide, Fahrettin Altun, who said, ‚ÄúOur Turkey is strong. Our state is standing strong.‚Äù The Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office announced Thursday that it was investigating social media postings containing the hashtag ‚ÄúHelp Turkey‚Äù for allegedly spreading false information. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said proceedings had begun over 172 social media postings. In an effort to control the flow of information, Turkey‚Äôs broadcasting watchdog warned television stations Tuesday about airing reports that it said were creating an ‚Äúatmosphere of chaos‚Äù and affecting the morale of firefighters and the public. Erdogan, whom critics accuse of increased authoritarianism, has accused opposition party members of perpetuating a ‚Äúterror of lies‚Äù for disparaging the government‚Äôs wildfire response. The president said in an interview late Wednesday that Turkey‚Äôs municipalities, which the country‚Äôs main opposition party controls in many of the fire-stricken areas, were also responsible for protecting towns. Mayors have said they were not invited to crisis coordination meetings. A heat wave across southern Europe, fed by hot air from North Africa, has contributed to wildfires breaking out across the Mediterranean, including in Italy and Greece. The heat wave is forecast to continue in Turkey and Greece until the end of the week. On Thursday, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemir suggested the creation of a mechanism under which Mediterranean nations would assist each other in combating forest fires. ‚ÄúThe time has come for a Mediterranean union to fight against forest fires because it is clear that from now on we will have to live with hot weather and global warming,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/fire-that-reached-turkish-power-plant-contained-others-burn/articleshow/85082357.cms||---
---||World||US to probe Phoenix police over abuse, force allegations||WASHINGTON: The justice department is launching a widespread probe into the police force in Phoenix to examine whether officers have been using excessive force and abusing people experiencing homelessness. Attorney general Merrick Garland announced the investigation into the City of Phoenix and the Phoenix police department on Thursday. The probe will also examine whether police have engaged in discriminatory policing practices and will work to determine if officers have retaliated against people engaged in protected First Amendment activity, he said. The new investigation is known as a "pattern or practice'' - examining whether there is a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing - and is generally is a sweeping review of the entire police department. Assistant attorney general Kristen Clarke said investigators will review body camera video, along with training materials and other records. She said the justice department spoke with Phoenix city officials and they had expressed support for the probe. Earlier this year, the justice department announced it was opening similar investigation into police forces in Minneapolis, after the death of George Floyd, and in Louisville, Kentucky, after the death of Breonna Taylor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-to-probe-phoenix-police-over-abuse-force-allegations/articleshow/85081921.cms||---
---||World||'We lost Greenville': Wildfire decimates California town||GREENVILLE: A 3-week-old wildfire engulfed a tiny Northern California mountain town, wiping out historic buildings and leaving much of the downtown in ashes, while a new wind-whipped blaze also destroyed homes as crews braced for another explosive run of flames Thursday in the midst of dangerous weather.  The Dixie Fire, swollen by bone-dry vegetation and 40 mph (64 kph) gusts, raged through the northern Sierra Nevada community of Greenville on Wednesday evening. A gas station, hotel and bar were among many fixtures gutted in the town, which dates to California's Gold Rush era and has some structures more than a century old. Plumas County Supervisor Kevin Goss wrote Thursday on Facebook that the fire "burnt down our entire downtown. Our historical buildings, families homes, small businesses, and our children's schools are completely lost."  Officials could not immediately say how many buildings were razed, but photos and video from the scene indicate the destruction was widespread.  "We lost Greenville tonight," US Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents the area, said in an emotional Facebook video. "There's just no words."  As the fire's north and eastern sides exploded Wednesday, the Plumas County Sheriff's Office issued a warning online to the town's approximately 800 residents: "You are in imminent danger and you MUST leave now!"  The growing blaze that broke out July 21 is the state's largest current wildfire and had blackened over 504 square miles (1,305 square kilometers), territory larger than the city of Los Angeles.  By Thursday, it had become the sixth-largest fire in state history, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. Four of the state's other five largest wildfires were all in 2020.  There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. Dozens of homes had already burned before the flames made a new run on Wednesday.  "We did everything we could," fire spokesman Mitch Matlow said. "Sometimes it's just not enough."  About 100 miles (160 km) to the south, officials said between 35 and 40 homes and other structures burned in the fast-moving River Fire that broke out Wednesday near Colfax, a town of about 2,000 residents. Within hours it ripped through nearly 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) of dry brush and trees. There was no containment and about 6,000 people were under evacuation orders across Placer and Nevada counties, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.  Early in the week, some 5,000 firefighters had made progress on the Dixie Fire, saving some threatened homes, bulldozing pockets of unburned vegetation and managing to surround a third of the perimeter.  More fire engines and bulldozers were being ordered to bolster the fight, Matlow said. On Wednesday, the fire grew by thousands of acres and an additional 4,000 people were ordered to evacuate, bringing nearly 26,500 people in several counties under evacuation orders, he said.  Red flag weather conditions of high heat, low humidity and gusty afternoon and evening winds erupted Wednesday and were expected to be a continued threat.  Winds were expected to change direction multiple times on Thursday, putting pressure on firefighters at sections of the fire that haven't seen activity in several days, officials said.  The trees, grass and brush were so dry that "if an ember lands, you're virtually guaranteed to start a new fire," Matlow said.  The Dixie Fire was running parallel to a canyon area that served as a chimney, making it so hot that it created enormous pyrocumulus columns of smoke. These clouds bring chaotic winds, making a fire "critically erratic" so it's hard to predict the direction of growth, he added.  Dawn Garofalo fled with a dog and two horses from a friend's mountain property, and watched the soaring cloud grow from the west side of Lake Almanor, a popular summer resort area with boating, fishing and camping.  "There's only one way in and one way out," she said Wednesday. "I didn't want to be stuck up there if the fire came through."  In Colfax, resident Jamie Brown ate breakfast Thursday morning in a downtown restaurant while waiting to learn if his house was still standing or not.  He evacuated his property near Rollins Lake on Wednesday when "it looked like the whole town was going to burn down." Conditions had calmed a bit by Thursday and he was hoping for the best.  "I figure I better have a nice breakfast before I lose my home," he said. "My house is right in the way if the wind puts the fire on a separate path."  And about 150 miles (240 kilometers) to the west of the Dixie Fire, the lightning-sparked McFarland Fire threatened remote homes along the Trinity River in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The fire was only 7% contained after burning through nearly 33 square miles (85 square kilometers) of drought-stricken vegetation.  Similar risky weather was expected across Southern California, where heat advisories and warnings were issued for interior valleys, mountains and deserts for much of the week.  Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in America's West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.  More than 20,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 97 large, active wildfires covering 2,919 square miles (7,560 square kilometers) in 13 US states, the National Interagency Fire Center said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/we-lost-greenville-wildfire-decimates-california-town/articleshow/85082624.cms||---

The earlier lowest was 1.26 lakh in 2009. The number of road accidents also fell to 3.66 lakh during last year, which was lowest in the past 20 years. The sharp decline in road deaths and crashes was primarily because of restriction on movement of vehicles during to Covid-induced lockdown across the country. In 2019, around 1.51 lakh lives were lost in road crashes in India. Replying to a question in the Lok Sabha, transport minister Nitin Gadkari quoted the reduction in deaths and said his ministry has formulated a multi-pronged strategy to address the issue of road safety based on education, engineering (of roads and vehicles), enforcement and emergency care. The road fatalities had witnessed sharpest decline in the April-June quarter of 2020 calendar year when 20,732 persons were killed compared to 41,032 during the same period in 2019. Most parts of the country were under lockdown during this period. ‚ÄúThis simply shows why we must not treat road crashes as a fate. We need to take all measures to avoid crashes, deaths and injuries,‚Äù said Amar Srivasatava, member of the government's National Road Safety Council and founder of youth-led India Road Safety Campaign. Though the government is yet to come out with the annual report on road crashes and deaths in 2020, the trend shows that the number of crashes and fatal crashes increased as traffic started returning to the roads. On the other steps that have been taken to put a check on road deaths, Gadkari told the Lower House that his ministry has notified ‚ÄúMember of Parliament's Road Safety Committee‚Äù in each district to promote awareness amongst road users under the chairmanship of Lok Sabha MP from the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/road-deaths-in-2020-was-the-lowest-in-11-years/articleshow/85082975.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||Apple to scan US phones for images of child abuse||Apple is planning to scan US iPhones for images of child abuse, drawing applause from child protection groups but raising concern among some security researchers that the system could be misused by governments looking to surveil their citizens. Apple said its messaging app will use on-device machine learning to warn about sensitive content without making private communications readable by the company. The tool Apple calls "neuralMatch'' will detect known images of child sexual abuse without decrypting people's messages. If it finds a match, the image will be reviewed by a human who can notify law enforcement if necessary. But researchers say the tool could be put to other purposes such as government surveillance of dissidents or protesters. Matthew Green, a security professor at Johns Hopkins University who earlier posted his concerns on Twitter, told The Financial Times that Apple's move will "break the dam - governments will demand it from everyone.'' Tech companies including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and others have for years been sharing "hash lists" of known images of child sexual abuse. Apple has also been scanning iCloud, which unlike its messages is not end-to-end encrypted, for such images. The company has been under pressure from governments and law enforcement to allow for surveillance of encrypted data. Apple was one of the first major companies to embrace "end-to-end'' encryption, in which messages are scrambled so that only their senders and recipients can read them. Law enforcement, however, has long pressured for access to that information in order to investigate crimes such as terrorism or child sexual exploitation. "Apple's expanded protection for children is a game changer," John Clark, President & CEO, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, said in a statement. "With so many people using Apple products, these new safety measures have lifesaving potential for children who are being enticed online and whose horrific images are being circulated in child sexual abuse material,'' Julia Cordua, the CEO of Thorn, said that Apple's technology balances "the need for privacy with digital safety for children." Thorn, a nonprofit founded by Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, uses technology to help protect children from sexual abuse by identifying victims and working with tech platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/apple-to-scan-us-phones-for-images-of-child-abuse/articleshow/85083238.cms||---

The relaxations may have brought some cheer to Mumbaikars, but the city‚Äôs restaurateurs are disappointed. While they can now stay open on weekends, no changes have been made in the daily operational timings of restaurants. Social media has been flooded with anguished members of the F&B sector saying that the decision is unfair. In fact, they even organised a protest on Wednesday to air their grievances. Pradeep Shetty, Sr Vice President, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), says, ‚ÄúDuring the first wave of the pandemic, the industry was closed for 11 months and after the second wave, we were shut for four months. It‚Äôs been tough to survive and the communication from the government for the restaurant industry has come as a shock to us.‚Äù ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt want retaliation, but an understanding'On Wednesday, 200 hoteliers and restaurateurs embarked on a 60-km protest from Tungar Phata, Vasai to Collector Office Palghar to express their helplessness. They also submitted their plea to the Collector demanding easing of restrictions for the hotel and restaurant industry. Says Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, Vice President, Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) and a restaurant owner himself, ‚ÄúProtests have begun as people are worried about what to do. But why let it come to this? We don‚Äôt want any retaliation, but an understanding.‚Äù He elaborates, ‚ÄúTill date, the hospitality sector has witnessed huge job losses. We have been shut for 280 days in one-and-a-half years and there has been no stimulus or help. We have always stood by the government and we plead with CM Uddhav Thackeray to take us into consideration.‚Äù Sherry Bhatia, President, HRAWI adds, ‚ÄúIt is disappointing that there has been no interaction or communication from the government on this. They need to lift the restrictions or we will continue to hold similar protests across the state at local levels.‚Äù ‚ÄòWhat is the logic behind the 4pm deadline?‚ÄôThe premises are sanitised regularlyThe hospitality industry has rallied together to find a way out. Amrish Arora, a city-based restaurateur, says, ‚ÄúThe three associations ‚Äî NRAI, HRAWI and AHAR are meeting to discuss the way ahead. Doing food deliveries is just 20 per cent of our run rate and if we had to operate on these deliveries, we would only float cloud kitchens.‚Äù He says the curb on nightlife due to the timings will leave them badly impacted. ‚ÄúWe want to know the logic behind the 4pm deadline. For us, a large chunk of business ‚Äî almost 80 per cent of it ‚Äî is at night. Also, what happens to the staff? Our employees want to come back to work, but where should they come when restaurants are doing so badly,‚Äù he says. Adds Arora, ‚ÄúOn our part, we are following safety norms, including sanitising our premises and most staff members have got at least one dose of the vaccine. Let people decide whether they want to enter a restaurant or not. But at least allow us to do business. If people can sit elbow-to-elbow on planes, take their masks off and eat food, why can‚Äôt we function?‚Äù ‚ÄòWe need a clear roadmap‚ÄôThe hospitality industry is not only seeking relief, but also a clear roadmap. Says Pradeep Shetty, ‚ÄúIf the government wants to continue with the restrictions, then it should at least waive the applicable statutory charges for restaurants. Most of Maharashtra‚Äôs neighbouring states have eased restrictions. Gujarat allows commerce to remain open till 10pm and has also offered financial relief to businesses. Kerala, too, has announced industry-specific relief measures to support the hospitality industry. Here, we neither have the permission to conduct business, nor are we being compensated. We need a clear roadmap about what is to be expected from the government for us to accordingly make informed decisions for our businesses.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-restaurateurs-protest-against-no-relaxation-in-timings-for-operations/articleshow/85067865.cms||Ismat Tahseen
---||Guwahati||Mizoram and Assam ink pact on border hands-off||GUWAHATI: Assam and Mizoram inked an agreement on Thursday to keep their police and forest guards away from the troubled inter-state border as the first tangible step towards easing tension in the area and maintaining continuity of talks to end their decades-old territory dispute. As decided by the Union home ministry, neutral forces will remain in charge of the disputed zone straddling the three Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi, and Mamit and Kolasib in Mizoram. The ice-breaker in Aizawl, involving two cabinet ministers from either state, also saw Mizoram officially condoling the death of six Assam cops in the July 26 firing at Cachar district's Lailapur. In a reciprocal gesture, Assam revoked its July 29 advisory asking people from the state not to travel to Mizoram and telling those already there for work to "exercise utmost caution". Hundreds of trucks carrying essentials and medical supplies have been stranded along the NH 306 in the Barak Valley since the border flare-up, triggering allegations by Mizoram of an unofficial economic blockade. Soon after the meet, the Mizoram CM's office tweeted, "Govt. of Assam & Govt. of Mizoram successfully signed a joint statement today after deliberations at Aizawl. Govt. of Assam & Govt. of Mizoram successfully signed a Joint Statement today after deliberations at Aizawl. Both g‚Ä¶ https://t.co/TVqzLc6Z0Y‚Äî CM Office Mizoram (@CMOMizoram) 1628153878000Both governments agree to take forward the ministry of home affairs' initiatives to remove prevailing tensions and find lasting solutions through discussions." The dialogue followed several telephonic discussions between Mizoram CM Zoramthanga and his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma, both of whom subsequently declared their commitment to finding a solution that has eluded successive governments since the first round of talks in 1993. The joint declaration states that the two state governments ‚Äúwelcome and agree to take forward the initiatives taken by the ministry of home affairs, government of India and hon'ble chief ministers of Assam and Mizoram‚Äù. Times ViewInter-state disputes are understandable but bloody violence caused by them is a matter of serious concern. It hurts the very fundamentals of the idea of India. It is heartening that the two states have agreed to border management which will hopefully not only reduce tension in the area but also ease the life of lakhs of citizens in both states.‚ÄúBoth the states shall not send their respective forest and police forces for patrolling, domination, enforcement or for fresh deployment to any of the areas where confrontation and conflict have taken place between the police forces during recent times,‚Äù it says. Assam border development minister Atul Bora, who led his state's delegation said, ‚ÄúThis is the beginning. With meaningful dialogue, we can bring permanent peace, but it will take time.‚Äù He blamed Congress, which was in government in both Assam and Mizoram for several terms, for the border dispute remaining unresolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/mizoram-and-assam-ink-pact-on-border-hands-off/articleshow/85083604.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||World||Taliban target provincial Afghan cities in response to US strikes||KABUL/PESHAWAR: Taliban militants have switched strategy from targeting rural areas of Afghanistan to attacking provincial cities, in response to increased US air strikes after the United States said it was ending its longest war, three militant commanders said. The Taliban have stepped up their campaign to defeat the US-backed government as foreign forces complete their withdrawal after 20 years of conflict. A regional US commander said late last month the United States had increased air strikes to counter growing Taliban attacks, a move condemned by the Islamist group. Fighting has been particularly heavy inside the city of Herat, near the western border with Iran, Lashkar Gah, capital of Helmand province in the southwest, and Kandahar in the south. The three Taliban commanders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that they were focused on capturing Herat and Kandahar, with Lashkar Gah in their sights. "Mullah Yaqoob argued that when US didn't fulfil their commitment why should Taliban be made to follow the accord?" said one of the commanders, based in Kandahar, referring to the group's military chief. "Mullah Yaqoob has decided to capture Kandahar and Herat and now Helmand and then it could be Kunduz, Khost or any other province," said the commander, saying the military leader‚Äôs arguments had won over the group's political office. A Taliban spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Taliban negotiator Suhail Shaheen told Reuters the group was continuing its policy of seizing control of rural areas and implementing Islamic Sharia there, rather than focusing on cities. The Taliban, who ruled with an iron hand from 1996 until 2001, had said previously they would focus on lucrative border crossings and large rural areas, though they have encircled and at times entered provincial capitals. The group has been waging a massive nationwide offensive since April when President Joe Biden announced troops would withdraw by September and as officials warned peace talks in Doha were failing to make substantive progress. In recent weeks, there have been sustained attacks on Herat, Kandahar and Lashkar Gar, stretching Afghan special forces thin and killing dozens of civilians. Fighting 'not limited to peripheries' "The operations in Kandahar and Herat are very much important to us and our priority is to capture the two crucial airports or airbases in Kandahar and Herat,‚Äù the Taliban commander in Kandahar said. Officials and experts said they saw signs of a change in strategy last month. "Taliban are pushing against the provincial capitals ... not just to exert pressure but to capture them," said Asfandyar Mir, a South Asia analyst from Stanford University. "The main evidence is the extent of their breach of these cities. Fighting is not limited to the peripheries any more. This switch in Taliban strategy has been formalised after Eid, though Taliban forces were putting serious pressure on Kandahar even before Eid." The Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha was celebrated last month. Kandahar and Herat are the second- and third-largest cities of Afghanistan by population. Experts said their loss would be a major political blow to the government and could potentially trigger major realignments in favour of the Taliban. "Capture of Kandahar means a lot to the Taliban. It was their capital and occupying the city is great morale boost for the Taliban... This is something they cherish and for Kandahar, Taliban can risk international ire," said an Asian diplomatic source closely following the Taliban. A Western security official said: "The fact they are attacking (cities) is a sharp reaction to air support offered by the US ... The Taliban have proven that now they will not just stop with controlling trading points." It is not clear whether US airstrikes would continue after foreign forces complete their withdrawal. A spokesperson for Us forces in Afghanistan and the US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Experts and officials say that for now a military takeover of Kabul would be much more difficult for the Taliban than provincial capitals, but that the group could increase bombings and attacks to undermine security and public morale. The Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack at the acting defence minister's residence on Tuesday and warned of further violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-target-provincial-afghan-cities-in-response-to-us-strikes/articleshow/85083755.cms||---
---||World||Bill Gates says relationship with Epstein was ‚Äòhuge mistake‚Äô||In an interview on CNN on Wednesday evening, Bill Gates acknowledged that his relationship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein was ‚Äúa huge mistake,‚Äù and he told the host, Anderson Cooper, that his divorce, which became final this week, was ‚Äúdefinitely a very sad milestone.‚Äù The New York Times reported in 2019 about Gates‚Äô relationship with Epstein, begun after Epstein had been convicted of sex crimes. The two men met on numerous occasions starting in 2011 - including at least three times at Epstein‚Äôs Manhattan townhouse, The Times reported, citing interviews with more than a dozen people and related documents. ‚ÄúHis lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing, although it would not work for me,‚Äù Gates emailed colleagues in 2011, after their first meeting. A spokesperson for Gates told The Times that he ‚Äúwas referring only to the unique d√©cor of the Epstein residence - and Epstein‚Äôs habit of spontaneously bringing acquaintances in to meet Mr Gates.‚Äù On Cooper‚Äôs show, Gates said: ‚ÄúI had several dinners with him, hoping that what he said about getting billions of philanthropy for global health, through contacts that he had, might emerge. When it looked like that wasn‚Äôt a real thing, that relationship ended. But it was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúYou know, there were lots of others in that same situation, but I made a mistake.‚Äù Cooper asked Gates about another article in The Times, which this year reported on his wife‚Äôs concerns about his workplace behavior. In 2018, before their divorce, Melinda French Gates had raised issues about her husband‚Äôs relationship with Epstein and a harassment claim against his money manager. On at least a few occasions, Gates pursued women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to the reporting. Asked Wednesday if he had regrets, Gates replied: ‚ÄúCertainly, everyone does.‚Äù He added later, ‚ÄúWithin the family, we‚Äôll heal as best we can, and learn from what‚Äôs happened.‚Äù Gates, the Microsoft founder, has a net worth estimated at $130 billion, and the Gates Foundation now has an endowment of $65 billion, by most measures making it the largest private charitable foundation in the world. Gates and French Gates have pledged to keep working at the foundation on issues including global health, poverty reduction and gender equality. ‚ÄúWe are communicating and working at the foundation, so that partnership, we‚Äôre going to try and continue,‚Äù Gates said on CNN. ‚ÄúMelinda has incredible strengths that she brings that help the foundation be better. We‚Äôve always enjoyed our work together. The two of us can go out and work with leaders and help build the organization. That would definitely be the best thing for the foundation.‚Äù For much of the interview, Anderson asked Gates about his views of the state of the pandemic. Gates praised the efficacy and mass production of the Covid-19 vaccines, but expressed worry about how easily the delta variant of the coronavirus can be spread. ‚ÄúWe wanted to be nearer the end than we are,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut delta‚Äôs very bad news.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bill-gates-says-relationship-with-epstein-was-huge-mistake/articleshow/85084128.cms||---
---||India||Opposition stalling Parliament, scoring self-goals: PM Modi on monsoon session logjam||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday referenced the Indian hockey team's historic bronze-owning effort at Tokyo Olympics to slam the Opposition for continued disruption of Parliament, saying these parties were shooting "self-goals" for political gains and the country cannot become hostage to such "selfish" politics. Listing three significant developments associated with August 5 - Indian hockey team's 5-4 win over Germany for the Broze medal match, abrogation of Article 370 two years ago and the ground breaking ceremony for Ram Temple in Ayodhya a year back - the PM said when India is progressing rapidly on every front, the opposition seems busy trying to halt the march. "Those who are worried only for their position can't stop India now. The new India is after 'padak' (medals) and not 'pad' (posts). Hard work and not the family will be the way to progress in New India," Modi said. He also accused the opposition parties of trying to stop development of the country. In a virtual address after his interaction with beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) in UP, hours after Indian hockey team ended a four-decade medal drought, Modi listed out the changes and achievements that India has made. "On one hand our country, our youths are achieving new milestones for India, they are scoring goals for victory, while there are some people in the country who are engaged in self-goal for political selfishness. They are not concerned with what the country wants, what the country is achieving, how the country is changing," he said. Referring to the continued logjam in Parliament, the PM said opposition parties are trying to derail the agenda of the country's development and weaken the spirited fight of the Indians against the pandemic. Signifying the importance of August 5, he said, "It was on 5th August 2 years ago that the country further strengthened the spirit of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' by abrogating Article 370, making every right and facility available to every citizen of Jammu & Kashmir. A wait for hundreds of years for crores of Indians ended on this day last year when construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya started .. and the youth of the country today restored the golden glory of the Indian hockey after a gap of over four decades." Modi also talked of landmark 50 crore Covid vaccinations and record GST collection of Rs 1.16 lakh crore in July signalling a new momentum in the economy. He also cited high monthly agricultural exports, sea trials of the first 'Made in India' aircraft carrier Vikrant, completion of highest motorable road in the world in Ladakh and launch of e-Rupi. The PM said in the past decades, UP was always seen through the prism of politics. It was not even allowed to discuss how the state can play a better role in the development of the country. He said the 'double engine' government has changed the way people look at UP's potential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-stalling-parliament-scoring-self-goals-pm-modi-on-monsoon-session-logjam/articleshow/85085331.cms||---
---||World||Tunisian president says there is 'no turning back'||TUNIS: Tunisia's President Kais Saied said on Thursday there was "no turning back" from his decision to freeze parliament and assume executive power, moves his opponents have branded a coup. Speaking in a video published by his office, Saied also rejected calls for talks over the crisis, saying "there is no dialogue except with the honest" and that no dialogue was possible with "cancer cells". The biggest party in parliament, the moderate Islamist Ennahda, which has been the most vocal opponent of Saied's moves, had called for dialogue in a statement earlier on Thursday. Some 11 days after his intervention, Saied has not named a new prime minister, announced any steps to end the emergency or declared his longer-term intentions. The powerful labour union, as well as both the United States and France, have called on him to quickly appoint a new government. The union is preparing a roadmap to end the crisis that it says it will present to Saied. US senate foreign relations committee chairman Bob Menendez and ranking member Jim Risch said on Thursday they were deeply concerned by the situation. "President Saied must recommit to the democratic principles that underpin US-Tunisia relations, and the military must observe its role in a constitutional democracy," they said in a joint statement. Ousted Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi appeared in public for the first time on Thursday since he was dismissed. He was shown in pictures published by the anti-corruption watchdog that it said were taken on Thursday at its office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/tunisian-president-says-there-is-no-turning-back/articleshow/85085136.cms||---
---||India||Pegasus a ‚Äòserious issue‚Äô, but why were petitioners silent for 2 years, asks SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has sought the Union government's presence on Tuesday to answer the court's queries on the "serious issue" of alleged misuse of Pegasus spyware to snoop on phones of civilians and politicians, but expressed deep disappointment that the high-profile PILs demanding a judicial probe into the matter were filed casually and merely on the basis of newspaper reports without any authentic material. Appearing for petitioner N Ram, senior advocate Kapil Sibal opened the arguments and said, "Pegasus is a rogue technology, entirely illegal. It infiltrates our lives without our knowing. That's the nature of technology. All that is required is a telephone call to infiltrate our phones. Then it hears, watches and surveys every minute of our movement. It is an assault on privacy, human dignity and values of our Republic. It then penetrates into our national internet backbone. It is an issue of national security. The government must answer the questions before SC." An hour-long argument saw counsel pitching their cases high, leading the bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant to repeatedly seek answers to a few basic questions - why these educated and resourceful petitioners kept silent for two years as the Pegasus issue is in public domain since 2019? Do the petitioners, except the Editors' Guild, have any verifiable material on Pegasus misuse except for relying on newspaper clippings? If some petitioners' phones were hacked using Pegasus, did they lodge any police complaint? After Sibal's preliminary submissions on behalf of noted journalist N Ram, the CJI-led bench said, "Majority of the PILs before us, except the Editors Guild petition, are all similar and based on reports in foreign newspapers and agencies. Secondly, you all know that the PILs must have prima facie credible material, which are verifiable, only then we can order an investigation or entertain the writ petitions." No law officer was present to defend the Centre on an issue that has snowballed to stall business in Parliament. The bench agreed that "no doubt the allegations are serious, if the newspaper reports are correct". But the most dramatic charge against the Union government was made by senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for Jagdeep Chhokkar. He said use of Pegasus "constituted a war by the government against its citizenry". The bench asked all petitioners to give copies of their PILs to the Union government. The lengthy but orderly hearing saw the bench bluntly telling serial PIL petitioner M L Sharma, who was first off the block: "Except newspaper cuttings, is there anything in your petition? What type of writ petition is this? You want the court to collect information and argue your case? This is not the way to file a PIL. What is the material except paper cuttings? You made a complaint to the CBI on July 21. The very next day, you don't even give them a day's time, you filed a writ petition? There is no question of allowing this type of petition." The CJI said, "Unfortunately, what I read from the writ petitions, in May 2019, this (Pegasus issue) came into public domain. I don't know of any effort or serious concern (expressed by petitioners) about this issue. Suddenly now this is reported and again it's come into light. We don't find fault with it". "Another angle is, some of the people who have filed writ petitions, they claim that their phones were hacked and intercepted. They know about the provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act and Information Technology Act to file criminal complaints. It appears, they have not stated in their writ petition, whether any of them had made any effort to file criminal complaints against any. These are the issues you need to explain to us," the bench said. All the petitioners conceded that they have not filed any police complaint under Telegraph Act or IT Act. Sibal said the petitioners did not have direct access to the information. "The Editors Guild petition gives details of 37 verified cases of hacking by using Pegasus spyware," he said and took the court through the California court's interim order on a suit filed by WhatsApp against NSO. "Pegasus spyware is sold only to government agencies and no private agency has any access to it. After the California court order, nobody can deny that Pegasus does infiltrate. Whether it was done in India is the question, which the Union government alone can answer," he said. The CJI drew Sibal's attention to N Ram's petition and said the petitioner has stated on affidavit that the California court order indicates that some Indian journalists are being snooped upon. "Where does the California court say so, I didn't come across any such sentence in the California court order". Embarrassed by the court finding out a wrong statement made by N Ram, Sibal said, "You will not find it in the California court order. That you will find in the Editors' Guild petition where we have given names of 37 verified cases." But the CJI appeared to rub it in. "So, N Ram's statement is not correct. If you see N Ram's statement, it says California court said some of the Indians were targeted by Pegasus. But, it is not there in the US court order," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pegasus-a-serious-issue-but-why-were-petitioners-silent-for-2-years-asks-sc/articleshow/85086106.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Two men who harassed her family were, meanwhile, arrested. One of them, a national-level hockey player, could be suspended. TOI had reported the incident on Thursday. "I am Dalit. Because the Buddha's enlightenment, Ambedkar's immortality, Kanshiram's mettle and the essence of humaneness run through me. #DalitLivesMatter," one of the tweets said in Hindi on Thursday. "I am Dalit. Because I am the courage of the oppressed, hope of the marginalised, a representative of those who stand alone. #IamProudDalit #DalitLivesMatter," said another. While the account is still unverified - it is yet to get the blue tick - on August 3, Vandana, the first Indian woman to score a hat-trick at the Olympics, had posted it was her official Twitter handle. TOI had a day earlier reported that men from the dominant caste in her village, Roshnabad, burst crackers, staged a dance and mocked her family after the Indian women's hockey team's semi-final loss at the Olympics. The team lost because it had "too many Dalit players," the men had allegedly said, launching into a stream of casteist abuses. While the complaint had spoken of two men at the time, Ankur Pal, 20, and Sumit Chauhan (his age wasn't clear), one more person, Ankur's brother Vijay Pal, 25, was later identified on Thursday. Vijay is a hockey player himself and has represented Uttarakhand at the national level. A source at Hockey Uttarakhand, the state's hockey association, told TOI that Vijay could be suspended from representing the state or taking part in trials if he's found guilty. All three were booked and Vijay and Ankur were arrested. Sumit is yet to be traced. Vandana's elder brother Shekhar said, "Members of the dominant caste threatened me inside the police station in the presence of an officer. Cops did nothing. What happened was not just an attack on our family but the whole nation. Police took the case very lightly ... We are scared. We want protection." On Thursday, however, most in Vandana's village rallied behind her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-arrested-for-casteist-slurs-on-family-of-hockey-star-vandana/articleshow/85086284.cms||MS Nawaz

This assumes significance and may allay concerns that antibodies gained through infection or vaccination may become less effective over time. "We will be sharing the data and findings soon," an official said, underlining that discussion about need for repeat vaccination or even a booster dose may not be so urgent if T cells are able to provide certain level of long-lasting protection. While T cells may not prevent infection, it is likely to make the difference between mild and severe disease of Covid-19. The vaccine tracking platform that captures data of those who have been inoculated also provides insights into breakthrough infection, deaths and hospital admissions, the official said. "We have analysed data from January till July 31 and it is quite revealing. This data can be very useful in framing future public health strategies to combat Covid-19," he added. In a significant achievement, over 49 crore doses of anti-Covid jabs have been administered across the country so far. Scientists are also hopeful that T Cells may also be effective or provide immunity against certain variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/t-cells-may-offer-long-lasting-covid-shield-research-shows/articleshow/85086468.cms||Sushmi Dey

After the drone attack last Thursday, that killed two persons - a British and a Romanian - on an Israeli company-owned ship MV Mercer Street off the coast of Oman, Iran is once again amid western crossfire at a time when it seemed that the Biden administration might restart talks on reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the Iran nuclear deal. As their first step on international condemnation of Iran, western countries are pushing for a discussion in the UN Security Council. The UK has already scheduled a discussion on Saturday. Israel, under its new Prime Minister Naftali Bennet, has promised to take unilateral action against Iran. "We know how to send a message to Iran in our own way," Bennett warned. Iran is keen on avoiding any such discussion. India holds the rotating presidency of the UNSC in August, so is understandably having to balance both ends. Jaishankar's presence in Tehran would be a good opportunity for Iran for lobbying, and therefore providing an opportunity for some delicate diplomacy, during a visit which was meant to be mainly protocol-oriented. India has already scheduled an urgent discussion on Afghanistan on Saturday, two days after the country's foreign minister called Jaishankar to request for one, given the deteriorating security situation in that country. On Thursday, answering questions at his weekly briefing, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, "The issue of Afghanistan will be deliberated tomorrow (Friday). You would have seen the press statement of August 3 on the escalating violence in Afghanistan, which echoes much of what we have been saying. During tomorrow's debate, we will share our vision and perspectives on Afghanistan." Tehran on Monday warned the UK, the US and Israel that any actions in response to the drone attack on the tanker "will be met with a severe and decisive answer". Meanwhile, the UK, Romania and US along with Israel have all publicly pinned blame on Iran. In his statement, UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the attack was done by drones, calling it "deliberate, targeted, and a clear violation of international law". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was "confident that Iran conducted this", and that an "appropriate response" would follow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jaishankar-in-iran-amid-crisis-may-have-to-do-a-tightrope-walk/articleshow/85086694.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||India||Renegotiate Indus treaty with Pakistan: Parliamentary panel to govt||NEW DELHI: In a significant recommendation, a parliamentary panel on Thursday urged the government to renegotiate the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, noting that pressing issues such as climate change, global warming and environmental impact assessment are missing from the pact that divides the Indus Basin waters. The standing committee on water resources said the treaty was framed on the basis of knowledge and technology existing in 1960 when the perspective of both nations was merely confined to river management and usage of water through construction of dams, barrages, canals and hydropower generation. Any suggestion of ‚Äúrenogotiating‚Äù the IWT is seen in political light and is unlikely to be welcomed in Pakistan. Though India has not moved to alter it, PM Narendra Modi had okayed proposals to further develop use of India‚Äôs share following border tensions with Pakistan in his first tenure as PM. ‚ÄúThere is a need to renegotiate the treaty to establish an institutional structure or legislative framework to address the impact of climate change on water availability and other challenges which are not covered under the Treaty,‚Äù said the panel, headed by BJP Lok Sabha member Sanjay Jaiswal. The committee on Thursday tabled its report on flood management in the country through multiple measures including international water treaties and agreements with Pakistan, China and Bhutan. The Indus Water Treaty was signed between India and Pakistan for sharing of waters of the Indus Basin. Under the treaty, the total quantity of waters of the eastern rivers ‚Äî Sutlej, Beas and Ravi ‚Äî is allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers ‚Äî Indus, Jhelum and Chenab ‚Äî is allocated largely to Pakistan. India is, however, permitted to use the water of the western rivers for domestic use, irrigation and generation of hydro-electric power. But India has not been fully utilising its legal share. The panel, in view of this, recommended that the government should examine the feasibility of making maximum use of the provisions of the Treaty in terms of ‚Äúfull utilization of all accessible water of the eastern rivers and maximum utilization of the irrigation and hydropower potential of western rivers including permissible water storage as per the provisions‚Äù. It also urged the government to complete projects like Ujh in Jammu & Kashmir and Shahpur Kandi in Punjab expeditiously so as to ‚Äúexploit full potential of the western rivers for irrigation and other purposes‚Äù. These multipurpose projects are meant for hydro-power, irrigation and drinking. Though India as per the IWT has the right to create water capacity storage up to 3.6 million acre-feet (MAF) on western rivers, no storage capacity has, so far, been created by the country. Besides, out of an estimated power potential of about 20,000 MW, which could be harnessed from western rivers power projects, only 3,482 MW capacity of hydro-power generation units has been constructed so far. As far as China is concerned, India has MoUs with the country on Brahmaputra and Sutlej rivers. The Committee recommended that ‚ÄúIndia should constantly monitor the Chinese actions so as to ensure that they do not pursue any major interventions on Brahmaputra river which would adversely affect‚Äù the country‚Äôs national interests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/renegotiate-indus-treaty-with-pakistan-parliamentary-panel-to-govt/articleshow/85087026.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Business||Govt brings bill to axe retro tax imposed on Vodafone, Cairn||NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday moved to bury the ghost of retrospective taxation by seeking to amend the law, a move that is expected to end vexatious litigation with 17 companies, including Vodafone and Cairn, apart from addressing criticism about uncertainty of policy regime in the country. The amendments, moved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, seek to empower the government to withdraw its demand in the cases pertaining to transactions that took place before May 28, 2012 (when the President cleared the Finance Act allowing for retrospective taxation), and to refund money that has been collected in some instances. It, however, comes with the rider that the companies will have to withdraw all cases and not demand interest on the money being refunded. In 2012, Pranab Mukherjee, the then finance minister, had amended the law retrospectively to levy capital gains tax on transactions related to companies with underlying assets in India, although the buyer and seller may not have a direct presence in the country. The amendment came after the UPA government lost a case in the Supreme Court arising from Vodafone's acquisition of a 67% interest in an Indian telecom company from Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa. In this case, Vodafone's Dutch affiliate bought the stake from a company registered in the Cayman Islands, which directly and indirectly held a stake in Hutch Essar in India. The amendment had resulted in companies seeking international arbitration. Last year, the government received two adverse rulings in cases involving Vodafone and Cairn Plc. The Modi government, which took over from the UPA, had said that it was opposed to retrospective amendments in principle but had so far not dropped the litigation initiated by its predecessor. Thursday's development, however, marked a clean break from UPA's stand. Government sources said the move was meant to send a positive message to the investor community and marked another "landmark decision reversing an earlier policy" just like the nullification of the Article 370 two years to the date. The development was sudden as the finance minister caught the business and policy circles by surprise when she moved the bill in the Lok Sabha after it was listed in the supplementary list of business. While no amount is likely to be paid to Vodafone, Cairn will be eligible for a refund to the extent of the shares sold by the tax department to recover the tax claims. The two companies did not comment on the amendments, but tax experts welcomed the legislation. "This is a welcome move for foreign investors and is in line with the government's commitment to creating a non-adversarial tax environment. The amendment nullifies the retrospective application of the indirect taxes of Indian assets in 2012. The tax demand created will be dropped and taxes collected will be refunded, with certain caveats that include the withdrawal of the pending litigation and no claim of interest on taxes paid or claim of any costs or damages. It seems a good opportunity for the affected taxpayers to close all the past disputes and avoid future litigation costs," said Sudhir Kapadia, national tax leader at EY India. Although interest considerations may weigh on some of the companies, which had paid a part of the tax demand, analysts expect that to be a minor irritant. "With the proposed changes, the Indian government has not only stood ground on not introducing retrospective tax amendments but also dealt with the major one that was existing and not appreciated by the investor community. This will bring a lot of stability in the minds of foreign investors looking at investing in or entering India for the long run," said Amrish Shah, partner at Deloitte India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-brings-bill-to-axe-retro-tax-imposed-on-vodafone-cairn/articleshow/85087178.cms||---

She will have to prove her majority during a special meeting of all the ward councillors on Saturday. ‚ÄúA no-confidence motion, which was moved against the mayor on August 3 by altogether 29 councillors, will be tabled in a meeting on August 7,‚Äù the commissioner of the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), Himanshu Sharma, told this reporter on Thursday. He added, ‚ÄúSection 144 will be imposed in the Bankipore circle office till 7pm on Saturday and voting held amid tight security.‚Äù The 29 ward councillors have levelled several allegations like discrimination, inefficiency and corruption against Sahu, who is facing a no-trust motion for the third time. According to the norms, the opposition can bring a no-confidence motion against the mayor after two years of his/her tenure. Talking to this newspaper, Sahu claimed that she had fulfilled all her responsibilities with utmost sincerity. ‚ÄúI accept the no-confidence motion brought against me by a section of councillors. I have retained my chair twice before and am confident I will do so again,‚Äù she added. The PMC has 75 wards and the mayor needs 38 votes to win the motion. Section 25(4) of the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007 states that the motion can be brought against the mayor upon a requisition made in writing by not less than one-third of the total number of ward councillors. The councillors, who had signed the motion against the mayor on Tuesday, included 19 women as well. However, former deputy mayor, Meera Devi, alleged that Sahu had influenced a few councillors to move the no-trust motion against her. ‚ÄúThis is part of her plan to save her chair and elect a new deputy mayor of her choice,‚Äù she said and added, ‚ÄúUnder Sahu‚Äôs regime, the powers of the civic body have been snatched by the urban development and housing department. She has outsourced all the projects to other agencies with a view to making money.‚Äù Ward councillor, Vinay Kumar Pappu, agreed with Meera, saying the no-confidence motion moved against the Patna mayor was ‚Äúself-sponsored‚Äù. ‚ÄúAfter tarnishing the dignity of the mayor‚Äôs post, she is playing an immoral game. If she has courage, she should announce her deputy‚Äôs name before the August 7 meeting,‚Äù he said. Pappu also urged the state government to intervene into the matter immediately. On the contrary, Indradeep Chandravanshi, one of the members of the empowered standing committee of the PMC, dismissed the allegations levelled against Sahu. He said, ‚ÄúAll the councillors, who had signed the requisition letter, belong to the opposition group.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-mayor-to-face-floor-test-for-3rd-time-on-saturday/articleshow/85078658.cms||Faryal Rumi

Nitish, who made an aerial survey of flood-hit Patna, Nalanda, Gaya and Jehanabad districts, said, ‚ÄúIn case of more rainfall in the coming days and rise in water level in the Ganga, the flood threat to these districts will increase as the Ganga will not be able to take water from the rivers in south Bihar. Water will spread in these areas and there will be crop damage too,‚Äù the CM said. Smaller rivers like Punpun, Morhar, Lakaeen and Dardha have taken menacing form after three days of rainfall beginning July 30. ‚ÄúThe situation in Patna may also become a cause for concern if the water level in the Ganga rises,‚Äù the CM added. During the aerial survey, the CM was accompanied by water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, WRD secretary Sanjeev Hans, officer on special duty in the disaster management department (DMD) Sanjay Kumar Agrawal, and secretary to CM Anupam Kumar. Nitish said he could not make comprehensive tour of the flood-affected blocks in the four districts. Accordingly, he asked Patna and Nalanda DMs to make aerial survey of all the affected blocks on Friday. The DMs of Gaya and Jehanabad have been asked to do so in their respective districts. The CM said he will make aerial survey of the districts once again next week. While the WRD officials have initiated flood-fighting measures, directions have been given to provide relief to people in affected villages, the CM said. He added inter-linking of rivers could be an advantage as it will mitigate the flood problem and help in storing water, besides reaching the stored water to the crisis areas during the lean period. Meanwhile, the Ganga was flowing near the danger level at Digha and above the danger level at Gandhi Ghat and Hathidah on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/more-rain-may-worsen-flood-scene-nitish/articleshow/85079180.cms||Abhay Singh

City police commissioner Ajay Tomar has ordered additional commissioner of police, P L Mal, to find out the reason behind Irshad Shaikh‚Äôs death. Resident of Fulwadi area, Shaikh was declared brought dead at Lokhat Hospital on Wednesday evening.

Deceased was arrested under Gujarat Police Act 122 for moving around in a suspicious manner without any valid reason. ‚ÄúHe was kept in the police station lock-up and in the morning police were to produce him in court. However, Sheikh suffered a fit and collapsed in the lock-up at around 11 am,‚Äù said a police officer at Chowk Bazar police station, adding that he also suffered an injury on the head.

The NBFC arm will focus on further improving its technology platform. The bank will consider testing the market for price discovery through a small stake sale. Last year, Aditya Puri, the bank‚Äôs founding and then MD & CEO had indicated that an IPO of the HDB was on the agenda. However, under the leadership of Puri‚Äôs successor Sashidhar Jagdishan, there is a rethink on going public for now. In a recent analyst call, CFO Srinivasan Vaidyanathan had said several international and domestic investors had shown interest in the growth plans of the company and added that the bank may test the market in terms of price discovery. ‚ÄúWe do need to see Covid behind and the growth momentum starting to pick up, then we‚Äôll have an evaluation,‚Äù said Srinivasan. Speaking to TOI, HDB Financial Services MD & CEO G Ramesh said the company caters to three types of customers: Those who are digitally savvy, those who require assistance with digital and those requiring high engagement. He said that while the company would continue to be an omnichannel provider as far as customers are concerned, at the company end, there is a high level of digitisation to enable small-ticket loans in a straight-through manner, based on scorecards without any paperwork. For digitally savvy customers, the bank has been offering an EMI card in partnership with Obopay. ‚ÄúFor someone who has borrowed for a commercial vehicle, we can still accept repayments in cash. But the collection data is instantly entered into a tablet and I can get data on the exact location where we have collected cash from each borrower,‚Äù said Ramesh. ‚ÄúWe have a presence in 1,000 cities and can cater to customers who require a high level of engagement. We also have products for digitally savvy customers and are growing in consumer durable financing, where we have the capability of instant approval,‚Äù said Ramesh. The company‚Äôs loan book had witnessed stress in the first quarter of the current fiscal due to the pandemic but is already seeing a bounceback in collections. ‚ÄúThere was a tendency to hold back from fear that money may be needed for medical emergencies. We were empathetic and did not pursue recoveries during this period,‚Äù said Ramesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bk-shelves-hdbs-ipo-plans/articleshow/85082990.cms||Mayur Shetty

Prasad also pleaded with Sitharaman that the Centre should increase the fiscal deficit cap for Bihar to 5% of the GSDP for the current financial year, as the state government has been practicing financial discipline. Otherwise, the Centre gives its sanction for the raising of the 25% of the total market borrowings for the financial year in December-January, so that the money is raised through market borrowings by the state government in the last quarter (January-March) of the fiscal. As much as 75% of the total market borrowings is made in the first nine months of the financial year. The state government raises money through market borrowings in two segments adhering to the fiscal deficit cap fixed for the financial year concerned. It has fixed its fiscal deficit at 4% of the GSDP for 2021-22.

Tejashwi had even reminded Chirag of the ‚Äúcordial relationship‚Äù between Lalu and LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said, ‚ÄúBoth Tejashwi and Chirag are young leaders and rising stars in the state politics. If they come together, no political force can stop them from coming to power in the state.‚Äù Tiwari also hinted at a possible alliance between the RJD and Chirag Paswan led faction of the LJP in future. However, he said they were not in a hurry. Sources close to Chirag said he was planning to visit Uttar Pradesh in near future. The assembly polls in neighbouring UP is scheduled to be held early next yeare. State chief of Chirag Paswan-led Raju Tiwari said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt throw more light on Chirag‚Äôs visit to poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, but I can say that his visit to Uttar Pradesh will take place in the near future.‚Äù The JD(U) is little concerned about growing camaraderie between Chirag and Tejashwi. ‚ÄúOur leader Nitish Kumar is banking on development works alone. It hardly matters who is with whom and who enters into an alliance,‚Äù building construction department minister and JD(U) leader Ashok Choudhary told reporters at Jamui where he had gone to oversee development works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-tejashwis-camaraderie-sets-tongues-wagging-in-bihar/articleshow/85079770.cms||Ramashankar

The NSO is presently conducting three major household surveys which are to be held throughout Thiruvanthapuram district. The periodic labour force survey (PLFS) with objectives to measure the dynamics in labour force participation and employment status, would be actively pursued in the grama panchayat wards of Kadinamkulam, Nagaroor, Madavoor, Vellanad, Manikkal, Kizhuvilam-Koonthalur in the rural sector of the district and city corporation in the urban sector of the district. Annual survey of unincorporated enterprises (ASUSE) will be conducted in the grama panchayat wards of Peringamala, Nanniyode, Navaikulam, Nagaror, Parasuvaikal, Kunnathukal, Mudakkal, Chemmaruthi, Aruvikkara, Mangalapuram, Pallichal, Kalliyoor, Uzhamalakkal, and Maranallur in the rural sector and Thiruvananthapuram Corporation in the urban sector. ASUSE survey will be targeting to encapsulate the economic and operational characteristics of unincorporated non-agricultural establishments in manufacturing, trade and other services sector. The importance of this particular survey increases manifold especially when the country is going through an economic crisis created by the Covid-19 pandemic. It brought out the ground reality of the establishments that are completely out of the formal sector, but are pivotal to the sustainment of the national economy when this sector‚Äôs role of being an employer to unskilled/semi-skilled and skilled persons comes into light. In August, ASUSE will stage routine conduct of sample surveys, as a geographical frame has to be decided that allows the enumerator to fix targets and achieve them in an estimated time schedule.  For this purpose, the urban frame survey is undertaken through satellite mapping using mobile app. Thiruvananthapuram corporation urban locales would be covered in August for updating the urban frame.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/national-statistical-surveys-resumed/articleshow/85112468.cms||---

Patel was abducted by five men, including a former employee, from his shop on Wednesday. They had demanded a ransom of Rs 1 crore from his family. Goa police pursued several leads and managed to track down two of the accused, who after interrogation admitted that Patel had been kidnapped and confined at an abandoned building. DGP Mukesh Kumar Meena said that the five men had hatched the plan to kidnap Patel from his store. ‚ÄúThe incident happened on Wednesday and immediately on getting the information, Goa police began the investigation and a team was deployed under the supervision of senior officers,‚Äù Meena said. ‚ÄúPatel, who is in his mid-thirties, is safe but mentally shaken up,‚Äù he added. Police have identified the accused as Virendra Kumar (Bihar), Nishant Mogan (Mangaluru), Manjunath (Karwar), Sujit and Subhash (Kolhapur). The accused visited Patel‚Äôs store on the pretext of purchasing plywood. According to the police, Patel was overpowered, tied up and transported in a white SUV, which was rented. Then using a stolen mobile phone, the accused called up Patel‚Äôs wife and demanded the ransom. ‚ÄúWe learned that the phone had been stolen from Old Goa and was being used to make calls. After that we found the location of Virendra Kumar and Nishant along with evidence. We picked them up and interrogated them. While interrogating, they told us that Patel has been confined at an abandoned building,‚Äù Meena said. Interestingly, the owner of the stolen mobile attempted to file a police complaint at the Old Goa police station, but the head constable on duty did not register the theft. Meena said that the head constable has been suspended for not registering the case. The same stolen phone was used to make ransom demands. ‚ÄúMogan used to work for Patel and he knew all about the victim‚Äôs relatives and family. Both Mogan and Kumar have been arrested earlier too and a case of vehicle theft is there against them at Agasaim police station. They were threatening him and demanding money,‚Äù the DGP said. Goa is still interrogating the accused to see if more individuals are involved in the case. Police are also trying to find out if the five were involved in any other crimes and the duration of their stay in Goa. ‚ÄúWe are verifying all the details. All of the accused were staying in Goa at different places. This information is preliminary. We will verify when they came to Goa and what their old antecedents are. If proper investigation and quick action was not taken, his life would have been in danger,‚Äù Meena said. The DGP said that the police personnel who cracked the crime will be rewarded. He also urged the people to conduct due diligence and verification before employing workers or keeping people on rent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cops-rescue-kidnapped-bizman-nab-five/articleshow/85085177.cms||Newton Sequeira

As a backup option, she is looking at IAS. Flavia has secured admission in Bengaluru‚Äôs St Xavier College based on her marks of Classes X and XI much before the Class XII results were announced. ‚ÄúIt is completely my decision to pursue corporate law, I want to help those people who are uneducated and are forced to work hard, but hardly get any money. I want to work for the employees and labour welfare,‚Äù Flavia, who resides in Sanguem town and is a student of Kings School, Margao, said. Flavia, a student of humanities stream, secured 99 marks in economics, 98 in business studies, 99 in mass media, 99 in psychology and 96 in English. She studied her pre-primary in Perpetual Succor Convent, Curchorem and later completed her Classes I to X in Manovikas, an ICSE school, in Margao. She used to travel 60 km to and fro Margao to pursue her studies from Class I to Class XII. Asked how she performed well despite the pandemic, she said, ‚ÄúThere was stress and fear among the people, but I overcame the fear and managed to focus on studies, despite the pandemic. I began my studies early at 5am and ended at 9pm.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy main aim is to make my parents proud. I want to see happiness on their faces.

Flavia‚Äôs mother Enid D‚ÄôCosta is a geography teacher at Miracles High School at Sanguem, and her father is an automobile engineer employed abroad, but is presently at home due to the pandemic. ‚ÄúIf we have resources, then why can't we break the barriers and admit our children to good schools and give them quality education? People are spending lakhs of rupees for constructing houses. But people should spend money on children‚Äôs education because better education is also an investment,‚Äù Enid said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-scoring-98-2-at-cbse-xii-sanguem-student-sets-sights-on-pursuing-corporate-law/articleshow/85083652.cms||Johnny M

The sky-rocketing sea freight cost (from the US, Europe and China), along with shortage of containers, is hurting the profits of companies in sectors such as engineering, auto components, pharma and medical devices. To make matters worse, the cost of air freight from the US and China has also increase 50-200%. Industry experts attribute the container shortage to China, which has a dominant share in global trade, as well as a stronghold in container-manufacturing. Further, there is congestion at ports with uncleared containers, while some are lying at warehouses. Due to these bottlenecks, there are delays of 10-15 days, while price volatility is affecting orders. ‚ÄúTo overcome the demand-supply mismatch of containers, there is a suggestion of a digital platform to display the freight rates as well as container vessel status, on a real-time basis. Increased digitisation of shipping services and improved communication between supply chain partners will also help‚Äù, Sanjay Budhia MD, Patton group & co-chair CII national committee on exports, told TOI. Shipping companies have jacked up rates over the last year by adding peak season surcharge and other increases, which vary with shipping lines and container sizes. ‚ÄúOver the last six months, freight rates for US vessels have doubled to $6,000. We suspect there is cartelisation, and hence have been asking for government intervention in regulating rates,‚Äù said Sharad Saraf, former president, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, and owner of export house, Technocraft. Exports during the April-June quarter jumped to $95 billion on account of healthy growth in sectors including engineering, rice and pharmaceuticals. Pharma exports, valued around $25 billion for FY21, have been growing around 14% year-on-year, but the first quarter has been slow due to logistics‚Äô bottlenecks. ‚ÄúExports have shown tremendous growth in the last four months despite constraints like container shortage and vessel unavailability, leading to huge upsurge in freight rates. With MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) unresolved issues for the last six months and RODTEP rates (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products) not being announced for the last four months, there is anxiety amongst all exporters regarding the bottom line. The government must ensure clarity as slowdown of Chinese exports-based economy presents a wonderful opportunity for optimising Indian exports sizeably,‚Äù Dinesh Dua, chairman, Pharmexcil, said. ‚ÄúCost of freight has witnessed a substantial upsurge. In markets, where we sell generics, these increases (in freight) are making it unviable to continue selling our products at current market prices. Our margins are impacted,‚Äù an executive with a Mumbai-based pharma company, said. There is a need for a national shipping regulatory body to be formed to determine freight rates, experts added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/trade-hit-as-cost-of-freight-from-china-surges-200/articleshow/85083086.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

He said the first half so far has seen growth thanks to base effect and in the second half, it‚Äôll be led by robust growth. ‚ÄúWe, therefore, believe the recovery is delayed and not derailed,‚Äù he told L&T shareholders. L&T is considered as the barometer of the state of the infrastructure sector and the general economy.

The chairman further said L&T will continue to focus on shareholder value creation by divesting non-core assets, capturing cost efficiencies and leveraging technology for productivity gains. The company‚Äôs diversified portfolio, geographical dispersion, robust balance sheet and strong order book are reliable signposts to a brighter future, he said. On the company‚Äôs international operations, Naik said though the Middle East remained an area of focus, it had turned its attention to other countries in Africa and southeast Asia as part of a conscious de-risking strategy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/eco-recovery-delayed-not-derailed-naik/articleshow/85083052.cms||---

SOTTOs across the county have targeted to rope in 75,000 vaccinated people for organ donation by August 15 to mark the 75th Independence Day. SOTTO information, education and communication consultant Ekta Rani said they started the awareness and sensitisation programme on July 6. ‚ÄúPeople who come for vaccination spend 30 minutes at the observation centre. In these 30 minutes, our team motivates them for organ donation. We show them video clips and documentaries and also counsel them,‚Äù said Ekta, adding this initiative is proving fruitful. Asked about people who have pledged to donate their organs, Ekta said majority are from rural background and not highly educated. ‚ÄúThe educated urban people are still hesitant.

The deal is part of Reliance‚Äôs bid to fast-track the creation of an EV ecosystem in the country and create a market for high performance energy storage batteries it proposes to produce under a $10 billion green energy plan. The two entities began trials on Thursday, the company said in a statement. Reliance BP Mobility will set up battery swapping stations at its retail outlets, operating under the Jio-BP brand, in the next five years. It will also provide technical assistance and training to Swiggy delivery partners and other staff. The company also plans to build such stations at leading residential and commercial complexes, malls, hotels, business parks, IT hubs, parking lots etc. across India to help faster adoption of EVs, especially in the food delivery segment. ‚ÄúRBML is setting up a robust and sustainable infrastructure consisting of EV charging hubs and battery swapping stations offering digitally-enabled services to all stakeholders.

Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Gaya Junction, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction, Sitamarhi, Barauni, Darbhanga, Dhanbad and Singrauli have been shortlisted by the Railway Board for redeveloping them as world class stations. A technical expert of railways, G N Sahay, said the much talked about suburban train terminal on the Hardinge Park land in Patna has been sidelined as the state government has not yet handed over the land to the railways in lieu of its R-Block‚Äì Digha Ghat track land transfer to build expressway in the city. Safety of passengers and punctuality of trains are other the concerns. Besides, security of women passengers is the major concern for railways in Bihar. Railways needs to refurbish its security system at vulnerable places, an ECR security official said. ECR CPRO Rajesh Kumar said though normal movement of traffic operations has not been restored as yet since March 2020, 279 pairs of special passenger trains and 74 pairs of local passenger trains were running on different routes of the zone. It has to be ensured that traffic movements run uninterrupted. The new GM, who is familiar with the ECR work culture and had a brief stint as ADRM of Samastipur division, will have to ensure that the diesel locomotive factory at Marhaura in Saran district, wheel factory at Belapur in Chhapra and electric locomotive factory at Madhepura run in a proper way. During the Covid pandemic, these factories have not made desired progress, sources said. People‚Äôs agitations, alarm-chain pulling and hosepipe disconnections are more rampant in a few divisions of the ECR, causing hindrances in smooth running of passenger trains as well as loss of punctuality of long-distance mail and express passenger trains. The new GM will have to tackle these issues tactfully, said Bihar Daily Passengers‚Äô Association secretary Shoaib Quraishi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ecr-gm-faces-challenging-task-of-completing-projects/articleshow/85079829.cms||Kumod Verma

Sawant said that he has asked the directorate of health services to verify if the individuals reside in the state and their reasons for not taking the jab. Sawant said that some of the individuals who remain unvaccinated may be residing in other states or may be bed ridden. ‚ÄúWe had said that the first dose would be completed by the last week of July. One lakh-odd persons have not been vaccinated yet. I have sought details,‚Äù Sawant said. The directorate of health services estimates that of the state‚Äôs estimated population of 15.4 lakh, there are around 6.5 lakh individuals in the 18-44 years age group, and 5.5 lakh persons in the 45 years and above bracket. Sawant had set himself an ambitious target of making the state the first to inoculate everyone by July-end, but failed to meet the target. The chief minister said that the government is relying on the official voter list to keep count of those vaccinated and those who have not stepped forward to take the jab. ‚ÄúWe are going by the voting list, but now we will have to verify if those who have not taken the vaccine are in Goa. Some work outside the state. There are some voters who no longer live in Goa, some are physically disabled,‚Äù Sawant said. Goa‚Äôs vaccination drive had a slow start but gathered speed after authorities took corrective measures. Misinformation and propaganda, particularly rumours that the vaccine affects fertility, potency and menstruation dissuaded many from taking the vaccine. Doctors with the directorate of health services had said that the state needed to vaccinate 10,000 people per day in order to meet the July 31 deadline set by Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-1-lakh-yet-to-take-first-jab-in-state-cm/articleshow/85085414.cms||---

Many of them are preparing detailed notes on the steps to be taken to provide a safe environment to the students and adhere to the government guidelines. They are also seeking the parents‚Äô consent before their children return to schools. Don Bosco Academy has buckled up to welcome the students of secondary and elementary classes. Its principal, Mary Alphonsa, told this reporter on Thursday, ‚ÄúPupils will be called on alternate days on the basis of odd and even roll numbers and online and offline classes conducted simultaneously in different shifts,‚Äù she added. St Xavier‚Äôs High School (SXHS) will also call its students on alternate days and conduct classes with 50% capacity. Each batch will, therefore, have three classes every week. The school has, however, sought the parents‚Äô consent first. ‚ÄúNow, we will suspend virtual classes as it will be difficult for the teachers to conduct both offline and online classes simultaneously. The progress will definitely be slow, but we have no other option,‚Äù SXHS principal, Father Christu Savarirajan SJ, said and thanked the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations for reducing the syllabi. Sharat Kumar Singh, the principal of Litera Valley School, echoed similar views. He pointed out, ‚ÄúDespite the fact that the Central Board of Secondary Education has reduced the syllabi, it will be a challenge for the teachers to hold both online and offline classes together. Even if they record their lectures, the students may not be able to clarify their doubts.‚Äù Singh promised that all the Covid-19 safety protocols would be followed on the campus and urged the parents to send their children to the school. Bishop Scott Boys‚Äô School has come up with a special routine to conduct both online and offline classes. ‚ÄúWhile live streaming of the classes will be done for the kids who are at home, safety measures like physical distancing, usage of masks, thermal screening and sanitisation will be adopted on the campus every day,‚Äù the school‚Äôs vice-principal, Ashfaque Iqbal, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schools-to-hold-classes-on-alternate-days-stick-to-covid-safety-protocols/articleshow/85079122.cms||Faryal Rumi

They feel with an amicable closure of the tax dispute between the UK-based Vodafone Group and the Indian government, the foreign partner in Vodafone Idea, may look at investing in the domestic telecom services provider. The move, meanwhile, had a positive impact on the Cairn Energy stock which was trading 26% higher on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Vodafone Group stock was up only 0.5%. The UK‚Äôs Cairn Energy too had taken the government to various arbitration panels and won. Although the announcement relating to introduction of a bill to amend the tax rule came after the market closed on Thursday, the Vodafone Idea stock price witnessed a good recovery after touching a year-low level early in the session. Within the first hour of opening, the stock lost nearly 25% to Rs 4.6 on the BSE, but closed at Rs 5.9, down just 1.5%. In the broader market, the sensex opened flat and rallied to an all-time high at 54,577 points but late selling pulled it down to close at 54,493 points, up 123 points.

---||Goa||Goa: Landslide incidents on rise in Sattari after recent floods||KERI: The heavy monsoon downpour during the last week of July has led to a rise in landslides in various parts of Sattari taluka. Recently, landslides have occured in Zarme and Satre, and this has been attributed to disturbances in the natural stability of the slopes. When villagers of Zarme visited their cashew plantations, they saw landslides that have damaged plantations. The destabilisation of the slopes has caused cracks to develop, and this eventually aggravates landslides. Speaking to TOI, Kalpesh Gawas from Zarme, said, ‚ÄúThe heavy rainfall triggered landslides in Zarme area. This might be due to saturation by rain water infiltration. Cashew plantations that are vital sources of livelihood have been badly affected. Intense rainfall has caused cracks to develop in the sloppy areas, thereby leading to landslides.‚Äù Sattari mamlatdar Dasharath Gawas has directed officials of the zonal agriculture office of Valpoi to visit the affected areas and submit a report of the losses suffered by the villagers. Another landslide incident occurred in Satre of Nagargao panchayat. Recently, when villagers were travelling on the pathway from Satre to Parwad, they noticed a huge portion of the landmass had moved downwards along with rocks and debris, causing a landslide. Three decades ago, these areas were under Kumeri cultivation, the primitive slash burn practice of agriculture. This year, as the heavy rain resulted in causing landslides, these areas lost the vertical vegetative structure, soil nutrients and soil structure on account of slash burn practice of agriculture. Hence, this has destabilised the slope, thus directly inducing landslides. Landslides have also occured In Caranzol, Wazale, an area above the cashew plantations, where trees have been uprooted and vegetation has been degraded. Subodh Naik, a volunteer of Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade, who frequently visits forests of Sattari said, ‚ÄúIncreasing deforestation, removal of deep-rooted vegetation and afforestation of monoculture species have badly affected the top most portion of the soil. The heavy rainfall increased the frequency of erosion in already degraded areas, thereby causing landslides.‚Äù The recent torrential downpour in Sattari and Bicholim talukas wreaked havoc, causing floods, destroying homes and farmland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/landslide-incidents-on-rise-in-sattari-after-recent-floods/articleshow/85083680.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Goyal said the alternate route towards Jhuriwala dumping ground from the national highway was to be used during emergency. After the residents‚Äô protest, MC sanitation workers did not collect garbage from the city on Thursday as there was no place to dump it in.

---||Kochi||Muthalappozhi harbour issue rocks assembly||Thiruvananthapuram: The unscientific construction of the fishing harbour at Muthalappozhi in Anchuthengu came in for a heated debate between the government and the opposition in the assembly on Thursday. Opposition leader V D Satheesan demanded that the government should immediately create a safe corridor for the passage of the fishermen and there should be a permanent mechanism to remove the sand being accumulated. Seeking leave for adjournment motion on the matter, Kovalam MLA M Vincent said the government‚Äôs callous attitude has cost at least 57 lives of fishermen till date in the accidents and there is widespread coastal erosion in the area that is posing a threat to the existence of the Anchuthengu area. Fisheries minister Saji Cherian said that since the mouth of the harbour area is narrow, dredging is becoming difficult. However, the dredging will commence within one month that will ensure that the water has a five metre depth. He said that as per government records, there have only been 16 deaths till date, and the figures cited by the opposition are incorrect. The minister said the government is giving high priority to the coastal area of the state and had spent Rs 9,985 crore for the development of the coastal area in the past five years. ‚ÄúAs much as Rs 1,500 crore has been earmarked for the development of harbours this year alone,‚Äù he said. However, the opposition leader challenged the minister to prove that his figures regarding the death of fishermen at Muthalappozhi are wrong. While the minister said that the figures that he had quoted are from the police reports, the opposition leader said that the figures that he has, were collected under RTI Act from the fisheries department officials. ‚ÄúThe minister, instead of depending on the police reports, should trust his own officials,‚Äù Satheesan said. Satheesan said that there are several reports of unscientific construction at Muthalappozhi that have led to blockade of natural sand bypassing, causing heavy deposits of sand on one side leading to heavy sand deposits on one side, while coastal erosion on the other. He said that the sea has already eroded at least 500m of land at Anchuthengu, and the narrow land strip between the sea and backwater will soon disappear if it continues in this manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/muthalappozhi-harbour-issue-rocks-assembly/articleshow/85081321.cms||---

Civic activists, however, said that many citizens were unaware of the initiative and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) needed to be more aggressive in taking it to the maximum number of people possible. The civic body should cite examples of the work done under the participatory budget process on its website and social media platforms to encourage citizens to submit their proposals, said activists. Officials said that the option of online submission of applications was being made available this year due to the ongoing pandemic in addition to physical submission of the forms. Vaishali Patkar, who has been suggesting civic work for the last few years, said that the initiative was good, but it had not reached many people yet. ‚ÄúFor this, the administration should hold joint meetings with citizens to understand peoples‚Äô sentiments and requirements. It has also been observed that many works suggested under the initiative come from supporters of political leaders. The administration should also consider the work suggested by common citizens,‚Äù she added. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said that the PMC should share the details of the work carried out during the last few years under the participatory budget. Sharing such details would boost confidence of people, prompting them to come up with more suggestions. Otherwise, the entire exercise would just remain on paper, Velankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-invites-suggestions-for-participatory-budget/articleshow/85081391.cms||---

With no means to identify and screen fake callers in the ‚Äò100‚Äô system, city police were depending on the launch of emergency response system ‚Äò112‚Äô for controlling the menace but its repeated postponement seemed to have aggravated their problem. City police have now landed in a soup after the suicide of 38-year-old Mahesh Raut at his place at New Somwaripeth near Raghuji Nagar. It‚Äôs learnt Raut ended life after allegedly being humiliated by two bike-borne patrolling cops after he called up ‚Äò100‚Äô to report a fracas in the neighbourhood involving a woman and a mentally challenged man. After the suicide, police have claimed Raut had called up the police control room 30 times and NMC‚Äôs Hanuman nagar zone office another 26 times. Police procured details of Raut‚Äôs calling records with much difficulty as there is no convenient way to trace, identify and earmark fake calls in ‚Äò100‚Äô system. It takes manual efforts to collect and collate fake or hoax calls in ‚Äò100‚Äô system. Raut‚Äôs family has denied that he made fake or hoax calls to the control room. ‚ÄúWhy would someone casually call up the police control room for the sake of fun or mischief. He (Raut) was a helpful man who may have alerted police a couple of times seeing some injustice happening,‚Äù said a kin. The kin also confronted police theory that there was no manhandling. ‚ÄúAnyone can come to our neighbourhood and ask onlookers as to what has happened,‚Äù he said. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar said that a list of hoax and fake callers is being manually prepared and such callers would be dealt with methods ranging from warning to counselling and even strict legal actions. ‚ÄúOur police commandos would attend the calls, whether fake or genuine. We have issued firm instructions to our patrolling commandos to deal with the civilians with dignity and not like they do with hardened criminals,‚Äù he said. The CP said that the launch of the emergency number 112 would have helped him completely analysis fake and hoax callers against whom corrective measures could have been initiated. ‚ÄúOur control room is flooded with fake or hoax callers but police have been mostly tolerant and attending each and every call within shortest possible time. Unfortunately, some citizens are causing disruption in the 100 system,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dial-112-project-delayed-cops-helpless-in-tracing-hoax-callers/articleshow/85081376.cms||Soumitra Bose

The order also disallowed the MSCB to take over the Mumbai-based City Cooperative Bank, stated a communication to both the banks and the MSCB from the Commissioner for Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies (CC&RCS). The communication has been accessed by the TOI. Though neither the RBI and nor the CC&RCS communicated reasons for the denial of permission to the banks to merge, sources familiar with the matter said National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) expressed reservations about the deal. A source said Nabard expressed concerns about agro-finance being used for retail banking, with the MSCB being primarily an agricultural bank. The source said RBI was concerned about the merger setting a precedent for cooperative banks across the country, which would bring about policy difficulties. MSCB chairman Vidyadhar Anaskar said, ‚ÄúWe had prepared and submitted the proposal nearly two years ago after RBI asked for a joint proposal with the Rupee Bank and getting approved at the annual general meeting. But during this time, we were asked no questionsabout the financial positions or feasibility. Nabard should not have had a say in this proposal, as they are a supervisory authority, with RBI being the sole licensing authority,‚Äù Rupee Bank administrator Sudhir Pandit said, ‚ÄúThe RBI‚Äôs decision is not totally unexpected. It is necessary to mention here that there are no shortcomings or lacunae in the merger proposal. Rupee Bank has good business potential. We will continue our efforts for its merger with other strong banks, or its conversion into a small finance bank or its revival.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rbi-denies-rupee-bank-msc-bank-merger-nod/articleshow/85081424.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

It proposes the new programme to be implemented with the PG (broad specialty) batch that has joined for the postgraduate course in 2021. There are a total of 1,874 PG medical seats in Gujarat. ‚ÄúAbout 40% of posts for MD/MS doctors at district hospitals are vacant. They will get a major relief with the government‚Äôs new move,‚Äù said an expert in the medical education field. The main objectives of the District Residency Programme (DRP) include exposure of the postgraduate student to district health system and involving them in healthcare services being provided at the district hospital for serving while learning, the draft states.

All postgraduate students pursuing MD/MS in broad specialties in all medical colleges/institutions under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 shall undergo a compulsory residential rotation of three months in district hospitals/ district health system as a part of the course curriculum, according to the draft. ‚ÄúSuch rotation shall take place in the 3rd or 4th or 5th semester of the postgraduate programme. This rotation shall be termed as ‚ÄòDistrict Residency Programme‚Äô (DRP) and the postgraduate medical student undergoing training shall be termed as a ‚ÄòDistrict Resident‚Äô,‚Äù it says. During this rotation, the District Resident will be posted with the concerned/aligned specialty team/unit at the district hospital, and will be trained under the overall guidance of the district specialists. The District Resident will work under the overall directions and supervision of the District Residency Programme Coordinator (DRPC). The clinical responsibilities assigned to the ‚Äòdistrict residents‚Äô would include serving in outpatient, inpatient, casualty and other areas pertaining to their specialty, and will encompass night duties.

In the street play performed inside the Jhansi medical college, the medical students propagated the message of saving lives of accident victims on roads by timely action. A number of online awareness programmes were also held in various schools in which the orthopedic doctors interacted with the students telling them about various simple ways of life saving activities which can be performed by anyone to save a life during a road accident.  The most important activity is inducing oxygen in patients by artificial methods, including CPR, because in most of the accident cases, victims die due to lack of oxygen. Talking to TOI, the president of Jhansi Orthopedic Club said, ‚ÄúIn the world, the highest number of accidents take place in India in which a sizable number of people die due to lack of timely treatment‚Äù. Our aim is to create awareness among people to come forward and help accident victims, he added. On the other hand, secretary JOC told TOI, ‚Äúit is very sad to note at accident sites, people are seen shooting video of the incident rather than helping the victims. This year our target is to reach out to around two thousand school and college students and motivate them to come forward and help such victims in emergency situations. I am happy to say that we have got a wonderful response from children during the seminars‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/joc-held-awareness-drive-for-lending-a-helping-hand-to-road-accident-victims/articleshow/85053783.cms||---

She raised an alarm following which the guards rushed to the cell and untied him. Though the medical officer on duty gave him resuscitation, he could not revive him and the doctor pronounced him dead around 8pm.

In reply, Modi not only got an assurance of a ‚Äúgood meal‚Äù, but also of votes by Badami Devi. The PM was interacting with PMGKAY beneficiaries of UP, including of Varanasi, Kushinagar, Jhansi, Sultanpur and Saharanpur districts via video conferencing in presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on August 5, a day commemorated as anniversary day of abrogation of Article 370 and foundation laying of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. This event was also witnessed by a gathering at Bhishampur village of the first model block ‚Äî Sevapuri ‚Äî of the district, where Badami Devi was sitting along with other beneficiaries. It was surprising for her when the PM started interacting with her. The PM asked her about her family members, means of earning livelihood, condition of house, availability of foodgrains and whether she feeds her children properly. In reply, Badami said, ‚ÄúI have been given benefits including ration card, LPG cylinder under Ujjwala Yojana, house under PM Awas Yojana, free power connection and toilet while water supply line will also reach very soon. I also receive 35-kg of foodgrain every month while my husband got a job under MNREGA.‚Äù Smiling on the style of her reply, the PM said ‚Äúall the benefits you have received should be written on a paper‚Äù. When he asked about the time saved in cooking food after getting the LPG connection, Badami innocently replied, ‚ÄúI cook rice, pulce, roti and ‚Äòaloo ki bhujia‚Äô in no time.‚Äù The PM then questioned whether she would offer food to him during his next Varanasi visit, Badami said, ‚ÄúI would not only offer food but also vote for your victory. Before ending his interaction with Badami, the PM asked her to feed her children properly and educate them. Later, in his address the PM targeted the opposition for ‚Äúexploiting UP to come in power at Delhi but never paying attention to the progress of the state and its people‚Äù ‚ÄúThey never tried to bring the people in the mainstream of the economy and kept increasing their own wealth,‚Äù he said adding, ‚Äúbut now UP has come out of their tentacles and is showing the capability of becoming the powerhouse of growth for India.‚Äù The PM said that August 5 has become very special for India. ‚ÄúTwo years ago, on August 5 the country witnessed abrogation of Article 370. Every right and facility was made available to every citizen of Jammu and Kashmir.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn August 5 last year, the countrymen took the first step towards the construction of a grand Ram temple after a wait of hundreds of years. Ram temple is being constructed at a rapid pace in Ayodhya today,‚Äù he added. Meanwhile, Anna Mahotsava under PMGKAY was conducted at 23 places in the district with a target to distribute foodgrain to minimum 1.43 lakh beneficiaries from 1,432 fair price shops. Apart from UP ministers Anil Rajbhar, Neelkanth Tiwari, Ravindra Jaiswal and other public representatives, senior BJP leaders also took part in the foodgrain distribution events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/badami-assures-pm-of-a-good-meal-vote-if-he-visits-her-house/articleshow/85084862.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Kashi the common thread in two historic matches||Varanasi: As fans erupted in joy after Indian hockey team‚Äôs thrilling 5-4 victory over Germany in the bronze medal play-off match, ending the 41-year drought in hockey at the Olympics, old-timers said both the historic matches ‚Äì Thursday‚Äôs win in Tokyo and the ‚Äògolden moment‚Äô of 1980 against Spain ‚Äì had the common Kashi connection. While Varanasi‚Äôs legendary dribbler, Padma Shri late Mohd Shahid, was a part of the Indian squad in 1980 in Moscow, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay of Kashi‚Äôs Bhagatpur village was the lone player in the Indian hockey team from Uttar Pradesh this time around. After Thursday‚Äôs feat, India became the most successful team in men‚Äôs hockey at the Olympics with 12 medals, including eight gold, one silver and three bronze. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is also the member of parliament from Varanasi, posted a tweet congratulating Lalit for the team‚Äôs success. Lalit‚Äôs family remained glued to the television set as soon as the match began on Thursday. His father, Satish Upadhyay, had performed special rituals at a local temple to pray for team India‚Äôs victory. Though Lalit was not a part of the ‚Äòplaying eleven‚Äô, cheering for India was what mattered to the family. And when the winning moment arrived, the family jumped with joy. ‚ÄúIt was a great show by the Indian team. The boys had played well in the semifinal too but lost in the last 15 minutes. This time, they held their nerves till the last moment.‚Äù Satish said. ‚ÄúThere can be nothing more valuable than a father being recognised by the name of his son. Today, wherever I go, people identify me as Lalit‚Äôs father. I have two sons, Lalit and Amit. They have never demanded anything from me and always focussed on their goals. Lalit doesn‚Äôt talk much but shares everything with his mother,‚Äù he added. Lalit‚Äôs mother, Rita Upadhyay, got emotional while watching the match. ‚ÄúHe has to stay away from home most of the time. But whenever he is around, he shares everything about his game and friends,‚Äù she said. Lalit‚Äôs sister Anjali said, ‚ÄúIt is great to see India winning an Olympic medal after decades. I am happy that my brother is a part of this team.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am proud of my brother. He has brought honour to the family and his hometown,‚Äù Lalit‚Äôs brother, Amit Upadhyay, said. Lalit started his journey from UP College in Varanasi under coach Parmanand Mishra and went on to become a part of the national hockey squad as a centre forward. ‚ÄúWe all are emotional right now as Lalit has faced a lot of hardships in the past. But we don‚Äôt want to talk about it today as he has proved his mettle and made us all extremely proud,‚Äù coach Parmanand Mishra said. People were seen celebrating the success in various parts of the city. Keshav Prasad Yadav, a sweet shop owner, came out on the streets and distributed sweets among passersby. Sportspersons also gathered at the Olympian Vivek Singh Academy, Sampurnanand Sports Stadium and Lalpur hockey stadium to cheer for India.  ‚ÄúAfter winning gold in the 1980 Olympics, when Shahid Bhai was in the team, we had been facing a long drought of medals.

But it may soon become a thing of the past as the Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL), in association with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), has launched a QR code-based waste collection system in the city. With a view to improve door-to-door garbage collection, such QR code stickers will be affixed on the houses of citizens. The QR code sticker has been affixed to 10 houses in Marartoli and P&T Colony in Ravi Nagar (Amravati Road) under Dharampeth zone on an experimental basis, in this innovative new system to address the complaints received by NMC, announced mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on Thursday. ‚ÄúAs a result, the usual complaints of citizens whose garbage is not picked up regularly will be curbed. The QR code will now provide real-time information on whether a household‚Äôs garbage was picked up or not. This will make the waste collection system more comprehensive and transparent,‚Äù Tiwari said, after visiting the localities where the pilot project was launched. Solid waste collectors will have to scan this QR code using their smart mobile phones daily after collecting garbage. Then, whether garbage has been collected or not will be displayed in the integrated command and control centre (CCC) of the Smart City. Details such as the house number, its owner etc will be received by the authorities concerned. NMC health officials can also check the process. During the mayor's visit, one of the garbage collection vehicles arrived. The worker in the vehicle scanned the QR code affixed at the house, took the garbage, weighed it and put it in the waste collection vehicle. The mayor inspected the entire system, interacted with the citizens and also gave them certificates for their cooperation with the NMC and Smart City in this process. If the pilot project becomes feasible, it can be extended to other wards, Tiwari said. Nodal officer of the NMC‚Äôs sanitation department Dr Gajendra Mahalle and zonal officer Dindayal Tembhekar, among others, were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/qr-code-based-pilot-project-to-monitor-garbage-collection/articleshow/85081502.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The accused allegedly cheated his employer, a shop owner, by releasing cheques meant for farmer clients in his name and those of his family members. Inspetor Mohinder Singh, in-charge, detective staff, said that the accused has been identified as Nitin Singla, a resident of Defence Colony, Ambala Cantt. Police said they received a complaint from Sanjay Singhal, a resident of Raipur Rani, who deals in sale and purchase of food grains from private and government agencies at New Grain Market in Raipur Rani. In his complaint, Singhal said that he hired two brothers, Nitish Singla and Harsh Singla 12 years back to maintain records of sale/purchase as well as cash transactions. Singhal alleged that he received complaints from his farmer clients that they had not received payments from his office for three months. Singhal said that he checked to find that the payments released for farmers had been fraudulently transferred into the bank accounts of Nitin Singla‚Äôs relatives. Singhal hired a CA and conducted an audit of the shop and found that Nitin and Harsh Singla had committed fraud of Rs 2 crore. He said when he confronted them, they confessed to the crime and promised to return the money. A police complaint was filed on July 7 and a case was registered under the relevant sections of the IPC at Raipur Rani police station.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Covid seroprevalence seen more among family members||AHMEDABAD: About 29% of the family members of Covid-19 patients were found to have seroprevalence ‚Äì a phenomenon where pathogens for a specific disease or infection are found in the bloodstream ‚Äì in Ahmedabad. The number was higher compared to the general population where the figure was 26%. The analysis, based on the data of sero survey carried out by the AMC in October last year, was published in the recent edition of Journal of Health Science & Medical Research. The sero survey included 17,000 citizens, whereas analysis of its impact on immediate contacts had at least 10% or over 1,700 samples. The samples processed by AMC-run hospitals ‚Äî AMCMET, Maninagar, and NHL MMC, Ellisbridge ‚Äî indicated that for other contacts, seroprevalence was 24.4%. Moreover, the study indicated that females had slightly higher seropositivity among family and other contacts. It was 29% and 26.8% compared to 28.6% and 22.4% respectively among males. ‚ÄúIt is quite possible that the second wave during April-May that recorded a very high number of cases, also gave higher seropositivity to families and society at large,‚Äù said an epidemiologist. ‚ÄòIt can be said that about a fourth of total contacts had already acquired an immune response without being identified as a confirmed case,‚Äô mentioned the study. The researchers also stressed on contact tracing and isolation as an effective strategy based on the evidence. The study added that there was a rise in seropositivity as the age of citizens increased, but reduced steadily after 60 years. Experts said the dynamics of immunity and infectivity would decide how the potential third wave would unleash. ‚ÄúIf there is high seroprevalence as indicated by recent sero survey, the chances of widespread infection may be minimised. At least there could be lower mortality. In the first wave, the infectivity was comparatively lower, which according to Delta variant increased manifold this year,‚Äù said the epidemiologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-seroprevalence-seen-more-among-family-members/articleshow/85081580.cms||Parth Shastri

On Thursday, it asked the river management board to postpone the meeting, fix another date. The GRMB on Wednesday intimated about the tenth emergency meeting of the board on August 9 and asked Telangana to attend the meeting. GRMB member-secretary BP Pandey, in his letter to the Telangana government, said the meeting was being held mainly to take measures on the gazette notification issued by the Centre on the jurisdiction of GRMB and have an organisational structure in place to perform the functions of the board. Telangana engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar intimated to the GRMB on Thursday, expressing the state‚Äôs inability to attend the meeting on the grounds that a case was pending in the Supreme Court and another in the National Green Tribunal on sharing of Krishna river water. ‚ÄúThe next meeting should be fixed in consultation with the special chief secretary (irrigation) of Telangana,‚Äù he said. Telangana had already skipped the coordination committee meeting of the GRMB held on August 3, urging it to convene a full board meeting to discuss various issues and its concerns in the wake of a notification issued by the ministry of Jal Shakti on jurisdiction of the Godavari and Krishna river boards. In another letter to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) chairman MP Singh, Telangana said the objection raised by neighbouring state Andhra Pradesh over the inclusion of an officer hailing from Telangana for the visit of Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) site was unfortunate. ‚ÄúThe KRMB formed a team to visit the RLIS site comprising officers from KRMB and Central Water Commission. It is not a single-man committee to make a decision. A report will be made based on the views of the entire team. Hence, the credibility of the team cannot be questioned,‚Äù Muralidhar said. He said attributing intentions to a CWC officer by AP was unfortunate and unethical. ‚ÄúThe AP government‚Äôs objection is strongly protested. It seems to be a delaying tactic to postpone the NGT proceedings. The NGT has asked the KRMB team to visit the RLIS site and submit a report by August 9,‚Äù he added.

---||Mumbai||With demand for paid vaccines dropping, private hospitals in Mumbai stuck with 10L doses||MUMBAI: Private hospitals in the city are believed to be in possession of nearly 10 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine, as per estimates with BMC. While civic authorities have urged these hospitals to exhaust the doses as early as possible, many are unable to do so due to substantial drop in demand for paid vaccination‚Äîsequentially, 41% less doses were administered in the private sector in July. The bulk of the stocks are with a handful of hospitals, sources said. A glance at CoWin shows some, presumably with adequate supplies, have opened slots for up to a week in advance. Most others have offered a few hundred slots for 1-3 days. Hospitals said anywhere between 60% and 90% of slots get filled up. Nanavati, Surana, Advanced Multi Speciality in Vile Parle and P D Hinduja are among hospitals that have opened slots many days in advance. In MMR, Apollo in Navi Mumbai, Doddu Sheena Shetty in Badlapur and Highway Hospital in Thane have thousands of doses on offer. A private hospital head told TOI some facilities that had procured doses in bulk are worried as demand has dropped and their stocks have an expiry date. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely more hospitals could take the CSR route to use up doses,‚Äù he said‚Äîthey may collaborate with government agencies to reach the unvaccinated population. Many are also optimistic that demand will show an uptick when more become eligible for 2nd dose in August. BMC numbers show at least 9 lakh were eligible for the second jab through July. BMC, meanwhile, said it remains open to tie-ups to vaccinate sections that cannot afford to pay. As of now, it has commitments for more than 6 lakh doses through CSR channels. ‚ÄúPeople who could pay to get vaccinated have done so already. Hence, we see a drop in demand for paid vaccination and longer queues at public centres,‚Äù said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. While doses in private hospitals have few takers, BMC couldn‚Äôt hold a drive on Wednesday due to shortage. It resumed on Thursday after the corporation received 1.05 lakh doses, but that will barely last a day or two. The corporation has the capacity to vaccinate 1-1.5lakh daily; but it has managed to vaccinate one-lakh a day only on eight days since January. Recently, the Centre indicated that the 25% quota for private sector may be reviewed because of low utilisation. Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya had told Rajya Sabha that the government procured 7-9% of stocks from the private sector‚Äôs quota since it had not been utilised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-demand-for-paid-vaccines-dropping-private-hosps-in-city-stuck-with-10l-doses/articleshow/85085981.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court suspends land acquisition in Sircilla||HYDERABAD: The government‚Äôs new notification to acquire land around Kotha cheruvu tank in Sircilla was suspended by the Telangana high court on Thursday after affected farmers raised a red flag over state not doing a social impact assessment (SIA) in the area by falsely claiming it as an irrigation project. They also highlighted how the new notification was issued despite the earlier one being suspended by the HC in 2019. In his interim order on a petition filed by Vennamaneni Srinivasa Rao and other land owners of Sircilla, Justice K Lakshman sought answers from the state by Sept 1 on why it was equating a tank bund beautification with irrigation project. The state had issued notification under the new land acquisition Act to acquire 4.28 acres for developing Kotha cheruvu tank with park, gym, parking area and playground while claiming exemption from SIA. Contending that the collector had openly said this was beautification of tank bund and not irrigation work, petitioners‚Äô counsel K Pratik Reddy said that as per section 10A of the Act, exemption could be granted only if the public purpose was for national security, infrastructure or irrigation, housing to the poor and for establishing industrial corridor but not for beautification of the bund. Social impact study makes it mandatory for the state to see whether the acquisition was essential in the first place or if there were any ways of minimising or whether any alternative sites are available, Pratik added. ‚ÄúThe social impact report filed by the government shall be evaluated by an independent multi-disciplinary expert group which in turn can direct the government to abandon the proposal if warranted. To avoid the above process, the government has claimed it as irrigation project and sought exemption,‚Äù Pratik added. He also pointed out how an identical notification was issued by the state for the same public purpose, against the same petitioners and for the same properties in the year 2018. ‚ÄúThe same were suspended by the high court in Jan 2019,‚Äù Pratik said, adding that those petitions were still pending and the state moved no application seeking vacation of the stay orders in them. The state had issued notification under the new land acquisition Act to acquire 4.28 acres for developing Kotha cheruvu tank with park, gym, parking area and playground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-suspends-land-acquisition-in-sircilla/articleshow/85086005.cms||---
---||Mumbai||My girl was beaten, wasn‚Äôt allowed to return to me: Mom||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has denied bail to a woman whose teen daughter-in-law committed suicide last year, just two months after her wedding. ‚ÄúA young life was cut short at the age of 14, though the poor girl aspired to fulfill her dream of education,‚Äù Justice Bharati Dangre said. The girl‚Äôs mother, estranged from her father for over a decade, had filed an FIR after her death. She said she never wanted to marry off her daughter. According to the girl‚Äôs mother, she had rejected the marriage proposal, but on the persuasion of some middlemen, she met a man and his mother. They expressed interest in the girl and even paid for the hospitalisation and surgery that the mother needed. However, when she refused to perform her daughter‚Äôs marriage, they allegedly demanded their money back. Left with no option, the mother consented. The young bride attended school for a few days. But soon, her in-laws restrained her. ‚ÄúShe was thrashed‚Äù when she expressed her desire to continue studying. When the girl informed her mother, she sought her return, but her request was ‚Äúflatly turned down‚Äù by her son-in-law, the woman said, adding that her daughter would call and narrate the harassment she suffered. On February 25, she called saying her husband had assaulted her and she wanted to return home. The same day at 1.30pm, the mother was told her daughter had died. Describing the woman as a ‚Äúvictim of circumstances‚Äù, the HC said the government‚Äôs campaign ‚Äúaims to generate awareness and improve efficiency of welfare services intended for girls in India‚Äù. Justice Dangre added that the case before the court ‚Äúdemonstrates how the laudable policy for empowerment of girl child remained only a mirage for this little, but ambitious victim girl‚Äù. The HC noted that the chargesheet has been filed in the case. ‚ÄúIf the accused by his acts and by his continuous course of conduct creates a situation, and it leads the deceased perceiving no other option except suicide, the case will clearly fall within the four corners of Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC,‚Äù said Justice Dangre. Both incitement to commit offence and instigation have clearly surfaced in the chargesheet, it said. ‚ÄúThe mother-in-law persuaded her to give up her education, her future, and drove her to the noose, which she used for committing suicide. Also, the proximity of the alleged harassment to the time of the suicide also bears great relevance,‚Äù said Justice Dangre, adding that her release on bail is therefore not warranted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/my-girl-was-beaten-wasnt-allowed-to-return-to-me-in-mumbai-mom/articleshow/85086465.cms||---

The CM also took a dig at the Congress saying that the opposition was shedding crocodile tears for farmers for many years, while real work for the welfare of the farming community was done by the BJP governments in Gujarat and at the Centre.

In fact, with the help of his two goals, the Indian hockey team was able to spring a surprise. It is returning home with an Olympics medal after 41 years. Back home, in Pilibhit‚Äôs Majhara village, people were busy recalling their association with Simranjeet and his family. And those close to the family were at his home, relishing sweets and greeting his father, Iqbal Singh. But Iqbal was grateful to his brother, Rashpal Singh, a hockey player in Punjab‚Äôs Gurdaspur who spotted talent in his son and took him under his wings at an early age of 10. Simranjeet had left Majhara when he was in Class V. Since then, he had been living in Punjab and came home during breaks. Rashpal, with the help of his friend Surjeet Singh Cheena -- a national hockey player who is serving in Punjab Police as sub-inspector -- trained Simranjeet. Later, Simranjeet shifted to a professional training centre in Jalandhar. His father Iqbal Singh told TOI, ‚ÄúI am over the moon. Our hockey team has made the country proud by winning an Olympics medal. I am happy that my son played a major role by scoring two field goals and playing a supporting role in a penalty corner goal. He called me up after the match and he was short of words because of the joy. I congratulated him and said that he has made us all proud. His uncle Rashpal and first coach Surjeet Singh Cheena are the reason why my son is playing hockey for India today.‚Äù His uncle Rashpal told TOI, ‚ÄúSimranjeet was only 10-year-old when he came here and played hockey with local boys at Guru Nanak hockey academy. His speed was very good. He had good control over the stick at such a small age. On top of that, he had affection towards the game which is why I told my brother that Simranjeet will stay in Punjab and learn hockey. My friend Cheena taught him the skills of professional hockey. Since then, Simranjeet has never looked back.‚Äù While Cheena told TOI, ‚ÄúSimranjeet was not part of the initial 16 member Indian squad for the Tokyo Olympics. Covid-19 pandemic situation forced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to pick an extended 18 members squad. Despite scoring a crucial goal against England in the quarter final, Simranjeet surprisingly lost his place to Lalit Upadhyay in the semi-final. He was included in the bronze medal match and showed his worth by scoring 2 goals in the most important game for India in the past four decades.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIn 2008, Simranjeet played his first professional tournament at KD Singh Babu hockey stadium in Lucknow at the age of 12.

We are opposing everyone as we are against the construction of the dam. BJP Tamil Nadu will never allow anyone to construct the dam ever,‚Äù said Annamalai while launching the hunger strike organized by the party along with over 500 cadres and farmers near Panagal building here. Annamalai and functionaries reached the venue on a bullock cart in a procession from Rajaraja chozhan statue. Addressing reporters after the demonstration, he quoted the assurance given by Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat that the central government will not give the nod to Karnataka to construct the dam.  He said the construction of the dam will not be possible because the Interstate River Water Disputes Act 1956 clearly states that a dam cannot be constructed without the permission of the state to where the river water is flowing. He cited Cauvery water management authority‚Äôs (CWMA) statement that the dam cannot be constructed at Mekedatu. ‚ÄúYet, we are staging a non-violent protest to make farmers of Tamil Nadu believe that the Modi government at the Centre revolves around the welfare of the farming community,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/wont-allow-anyone-to-build-dam-at-mekedatu-bjp-chief/articleshow/85081641.cms||---

The civic body is planning to conduct the test run of the lighting facility to illuminate the 273-ft tall hillock and Teppakulam in the coming days.Corporation officials said that LED lights to illuminate the hillock were fitted on the existing poles around the Rockfort as the local people had opposed installing new light poles in the congested streets around the hillock. Under design, build, operate and transfer (DBOT) basis for five years, the civic body had initiated the Rs-11 crore project in October 2020. This will enable people even from far places to enjoy a picturesque view of the landmark lit up by LED lights. The hillock is a protected monument of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and obtaining clearances from it was cited as a major reason for the delay.Meanwhile, the work on installing infrastructure for conducting light and sound shows at Teppakulam was almost completed. In the five-acre waterbody, equipment was installed above the water level to use water as a screen to display the history of the city. A water screen panel room was constructed to accommodate the equipment to host the show.People can watch the show from the ghats of the tank. While the people from adjoining buildings can also watch the display, the interactive sound through headphones is likely to be heard only by people seated on the ghats. ‚ÄúWe will conduct the trial run soon after finishing some minor works. The purpose of the project is to promote tourism through interactive screening of Trichy city‚Äôs history,‚Äù an official said. The civic body is yet to decide on charging a fee for the light and sound show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rockfort-teppakulam-illumination-test-run-soon/articleshow/85081659.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Nagpur||HC: DV Act not applicable to in-laws‚Äô casual visits||Nagpur: Coming to the rescue of a 71-year-old woman along with seven of her family, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has ruled that their occasional visits to her son‚Äôs home couldn‚Äôt come under the definition of ‚Äòshared household‚Äô in the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (DV) Act, 2005. While quashing proceedings filed by a housewife from Washim under the DV Act against the petitioners ‚Äî the old woman, her daughters, sons-in-law and their children ‚Äî justice Manish Pitale, however, maintained the charges against the husband. While partly allowing the plea, the judge said, ‚ÄúMere fleeting or casual living shall not make a shared household. Therefore, alleged visits of in-laws in vacation or otherwise, during which the wife allegedly suffered harassment, can‚Äôt come within the definition of shared household, although it may give rise to some other offence.‚Äù All eight petitioners moved the HC through counsel AV Band for setting aside a police complaint lodged by the wife against her husband and in-laws on January 16 last year for allegedly harassing her during their visits in vacations to her matrimonial home. The wife claimed that the petitioners used to provoke her husband to harass her mentally, physically and psychologically. In this case, the family of old woman‚Äôs one daughter resides in Nagpur while another in Raigad. The petitioners contended that they were residents of various places and aren‚Äôt living in the matrimonial house or the shared household, as claimed by the wife. Justice Pitale clarified that even if the wife‚Äôs allegations are taken as it is, the petitioners can‚Äôt be said to have a domestic relationship with her, and it can‚Äôt be said that they are either living or had lived at any stage in a shared household. The judge said that the wife can‚Äôt be said to have been in a domestic relationship with the petitioners, for the very same reason that they can‚Äôt be said to have lived at any stage or presently living in a shared household with her. ‚ÄúTherefore, it becomes evident that she can‚Äôt be permitted to progress further under the DV Act against them,‚Äù the judge held. The judge added that the question of petitioners‚Äô inflicting domestic violence on the wife would depend on whether they could be said to be in a domestic relationship with her and or at any stage having lived in a shared household with her. ‚ÄúA perusal of the definition of ‚Äòdomestic relationship‚Äô and ‚Äòshared household‚Äô, as well as the law laid down in that context would show that insofar as the petitioners are concerned, the wife can‚Äôt claim relief under the provisions of DV Act.‚Äù Citing a Supreme Court verdict in the case of Satish Chander Ahuja, the judge said that it has clearly laid down that the staying of a complainant woman in a household has to refer to a living which has some permanency. What the HC said * Mere fleeting or casual living don‚Äôt make a shared household * In-laws visits in vacation can‚Äôt come within shared household‚Äôs definition * It may give rise to some other offence * Wife can‚Äôt be said to have been in domestic relationship with petitioners * She didn‚Äôt live with them at any stage or shared household * She can‚Äôt be permitted to progress further under DV Act against them||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-dv-act-not-applicable-to-in-laws-casual-visits/articleshow/85081650.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

As per the data available with the health department, the active Covid cases in the hill retreat had come down to 503 on Wednesday, from 701 on July 26. Dr P Balusamy, deputy director of public health, said the micro containment zones in panchayats and municipality areas had helped curtail the virus transmission. ‚ÄúWe were too swift to track primary and secondary contacts. And this helped contain the contagion further.‚Äù According to him, around 40 to 50 people are testing positive for the virus daily in the district. On Thursday, the Nilgiris reported 47 fresh cases of Covid. The district administration has, meanwhile, tightened the precautionary measures and implemented a strict procedure at check posts for Keralites to enter the district. ‚ÄúThe visitors from Kerala should produce a Covid negative certificate. For the people of Tamil Nadu returning from Kerala, swab samples would be taken and they would be kept in isolation till the results are out,‚Äù Balusamy said. Random samples are also taken from the people from other districts entering the Nilgiris. ‚ÄúWe are taking all the possible precautionary measures to contain the transmission of the virus,‚Äù the official said. As per the data, at least 2,800 swab samples are collected daily in the district for Covid-19 testing. The door-to-door survey is also being carried out ward wise across the district to check for Covid symptoms among the residents. While the district has tested 6, 40,537 swab samples so far, 30,755 of them were turned out to be positive for the virus. Of them, 30,083 have recovered till date.

Chemical discharge from a factory is being suspected to be the cause. Residents alleged that the rivulet passes through the Panchkula Industrial Area before entering Dhakoli and chemical discharge from any of the factories could have mixed with the water. They also fear pollution of groundwater. The matter was brought to the notice of Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, who said, ‚ÄúAn inquiry has been initiated to find the source of chemical discharge. Executive engineer of the environment department will conduct a thorough probe and sampling will be done so that action could be taken.‚Äù The deputy commissioner said prima facie it seemed the chemical came from a factory in the neighbouring state and teams have already been deputed to the site. The red water was detected by the local farmers as the seasonal rivulet passed near their fields. They traced the flow source to the Panchkula side. Krishan Singh, a farmer, said, ‚ÄúWe saw red water flowing in the seasonal rivulet on Thursday morning and then walked along the banks to find the cause. It may be a discharge from factories as the rivulet flows into Dhakoli after passing through the Panchkula Industrial Area.‚Äù The farmers have been using the water from the seasonal rivulet for irrigation and fear chemicals would pollute the groundwater if not detected and plugged in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/factory-discharge-turns-seasonal-rivulet-red-dhakoli-residents-panic/articleshow/85081674.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

A trial run of 250 smart meters, which provide real time data to the department for better planning, is complete. The meters were placed across Goa in different terrain and the department found that they were 95% efficient. The department is now drawing up a plan for phasewise installation of 6.5 lakh meters and has plans of replacing around 50,000 meters by the end of the financial year. Around 30% of the cost of each meter will be borne by the Centre and the rest by the department. ‚ÄúThere will be no cost to consumers. The department will pay the balance in instalments over the next eight years,‚Äù chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni said. Through the smart meter programme, the government of India aims to bring in efficiency in the power distribution system leading to better service delivery. On how it would benefit consumers, Keni said the meters, connected through a web-based monitoring system, will ensure real-time monitoring of consumption, accurate data analysis and better power management. ‚ÄúWhen there is better planning, consumers will receive better quality power. Through a specially designed app, consumers will also be able to monitor consumption within their houses,‚Äù Keni said, adding that states like UP and Rajasthan are installing these meters. The system will provide area-wise and time of the day, data on consumption and shortfall in capacity, which will help the department in its upgradation projects. The meters will help the department keep a check on power theft. ‚ÄúIt will bring more efficiency to the entire system and help the department avert power losses.

History enthusiasts from various parts of the central region took to social media to recall his conquests, considered as a pioneer in naval expedition which helped him conquer southeast Asia.As per the stone inscriptions at Thiyagaraja swamy temple in Tiruvarur, Rajendra Chola I himself was said to have acknowledged Aadi Thiruvathirai as his star birthday. For centuries, the temples built by Rajendra Chola across south India have been celebrating Aadi Thiruvathirai with special prayers as there was an order and tradition. Compared to previous years, the celebration of Rajendra Chola‚Äôs birth anniversary this year was more visible, history enthusiasts said. While Raja Raja Chola‚Äôs birth anniversary ‚ÄòSathaya Vizha‚Äô was celebrated at Thanjavur in fervour for decades, a similar observance has been missing for Rajendra Chola, who was equally regarded as one of the greatest, which was a concern among researchers. ‚ÄúMaritime trade flourished during Rajendra Chola‚Äôs rule.

The federation comprising 58 self-help groups (SHG) across the state held a consultative meeting in Trichy on Thursday and sought the government to resurrect them by giving an opportunity to produce seven crore sanitary napkins required for government hospitals and schools. The federation was entrusted by the government to produce one crore sanitary napkins per year in 2018-19 and 2019-20, for government health centres that provide cost-free napkins. However, for 2020-21, they did not get any order. They made the appeal as each SHGs had invested at least Rs 6 lakh for machinery, and around 600 women are reeling under debts. The women could not produce the napkins even for other clients as there was trouble in sourcing the raw materials amid the lockdown. ‚ÄúWe have decided to meet the health minister seeking the order to meet the requirements of government hospitals. We can also produce 30% of the requirement of the cost-free sanitary napkins required for government school girls,‚Äù S Thilagavathy, convenor of the federation said. They also sought the government to revise the price of a napkin to Rs 30 per piece as imported wood pulp, a key raw material, has witnessed a 100% price hike. Each napkin was sold to the government at Rs 21.50 before the outbreak of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/govt-orders-sought-to-make-low-cost-napkins/articleshow/85081682.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Hidco blueprint to tackle New Town waterlogging||Kolkata: Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) engineers on Thursday came up with a number of short- and long-term proposals and plans to minimize and prevent severe waterlogging in New Town and parts of Rajarhat‚Äôs border area under Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation. These include silt clearance of canals, repairing sluice gates, increasing the height of the canal banks and setting up new pumping stations.  ‚ÄúA report has been submitted to us. A multi-stakeholder and multi-departmental approach will be taken to implement the proposals. We will refer the report to the state housing department for holding meetings and taking the plans forward,‚Äù said Hidco managing director Debashis Sen. The short-term plans include repairing the damaged sluice gates of Bagjola and Kestopur canals. The gates control the flow and level of water in the canals. The mid term plans include clearing the silt of both canals for water to flow properly and to increase their capacity to flush out excess rainwater during a heavy downpour by increasing the height of the canal banks. Both the canals and other small outlets like Pass Khal, were overflowing during last week‚Äôs heavy rains as the excess water was flowing back in, resulting in waterlogging in several parts of New Town. The long-term plans are to set up new drainage pumping stations and to increase the capacity of the existing ones to effectively flush out excess rainwater during heavy rains. The state public health engineering department is already working on setting up a 100 HP capacity new drainage pumping station near Chinar Park junction in Rajarhat to partly solve the waterlogging problem and airport bound monsoon traffic woes at Haldiram junction on VIP Road. The pumping station is expected to start operating before monsoons next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hidco-blueprint-to-tackle-new-town-waterlogging/articleshow/85082135.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Be prepared to wait longer for your preferred model or else, shell out more to get your favourite product. With the ongoing shortage of semiconductors faced by manufacturers of computing devices vis-√†-vis a surge in demand since the pandemic, dealers are struggling to meet order requirements of consumers and businesses. Semiconductors are widely used in manufacturing of an array of computing and electronic devices, automobiles, computers and cell phones. Explaining the scenario, Rupin Barot, an authorized dealer of computers, laptops and other computing devices, said, ‚ÄúI recently received an order for 50 computers from a corporate company which I was compelled to deny. I will not be able to fulfil the order before four months or so. For such an order volume, we must place an order with the manufacturer directly and the delivery will take time due to the chip shortage.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are experiencing at least four to six months of waiting period for order deliveries. We can give a certain model if it is available but the demand has grown since the pandemic and laptops and computers tend to fly off shelves quickly,‚Äù Barot added. Industry players also said that supply side constraints have emerged for web cameras, CCTV devices and also LED TVs. Semiconductor shortage has pushed the prices of computers, laptops and other electronic devices by at least 30%. ‚ÄúPrice of several electronics has also soared due to semiconductor price surge. Despite that, demand for luxury electronics and appliance brands has sustained,‚Äù said Prathmesh Sharma, an Ahmedabad-based distributor of high-end electronics. In case of certain products, prices have surged by as high as 50%. However, for general electronics, despite semiconductor shortage, the demand hasn‚Äôt yet been impacted. For home electronics and appliances, the stock is available because demand has taken a hit and with limited supply. ‚ÄúThe demand is not buoyed since last year. Therefore, supply-side constraints are not impacting the sales. Moreover, with increase in price, people are deferring purchases ,‚Äù said Bhavesh Waria, president, Ahmedabad Electronics Dealers‚Äô Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/electronics-computing-devices-get-30-dearer/articleshow/85081754.cms||Niyati Parikh

The 14 CRs include Munia in Nagpur and Kolamarka in Gadchiroli districts. Conservation reserves are uninhabited areas completely owned by the government but used for subsistence by communities and community areas, while sanctuaries are exclusives meant for wildlife preservation. The decision was taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is also chairman of SBWL, in the 16th meeting of the board held on December 4, 2020. The 96 sq km Munia reserve has been carved out from North Umred and Butibori forest ranges. It was among the 11 CRs declared on December 4, 2020. Wildlife conservationists Prafulla Bhamburkar and Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel have welcomed the move and said there should be no second thought to declare Kolamarka a sanctuary. The 181sq km area was declared conservation reserve on January 8, 2013, for the presence of genetically pure breed of wild buffaloes. On a suggestion by Kishor Rithe at the SWBL meeting in October 2016, it was agreed to notify Kolamarka as a sanctuary. However, even after five years, the area has not been upgraded as a sanctuary. Each committee will be headed by respective CCFs and DyCFs will be member-secretaries. APCCFs (wildlife) will be coordinators. The committees include expert board members. The committee includes Kishor Rithe, Poonam Dhanwatey, Kundan Hate, Bandu Dhotre and DyCF of Sironcha as members. The other CRs include Bhorgad, Ajneri, Muktai-Bhavani, Toranmal (Nashik) and Tilari, Jor-Jambhli, Panalghad, Chandgad, Vishalgad, Amboli-Dodamarg and Mayani. The committees will study rights of local people in these forest areas, identify strengths and if the sanctuary is declared how it will affect the livelihood of locals and what alternatives can be worked out. It will also find out whether the relocation of villages is required and at its cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/panel-to-explore-munia-kolamarka-as-sanctuaries/articleshow/85101284.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

He raised the issue in a letter to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who handed over investigations to the principal secretary, housing and urban development department.Replying to the letter by the MP, the chief minister said, ‚ÄúI have before me your letter bringing to my notice that real estate developers in Mohali, Kharar, Kurali and New Chandigarh have not fulfilled their obligations after selling plots and flats to people who have invested their hard earned savings. I have directed the principal secretary in the department of housing and urban development to look into the matter and submit a report in a fortnight whereafter I would like to review it at my level.‚ÄùThe development comes in the wake of local residents telling MP Manish Tewari about the problems they were facing at the hands of real estate developers during a meeting with him. The MP escalated the issue with the CM. On July 26, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh constituted a special investigating team (SIT) to probe malpractices allegedly adopted by realtors of Mohali. The SIT has been formed after receiving numerous complaints against the realtors, said the SSP. It is headed by superintendent of police (rural) SP Ravjot Kaur Grewal and supported by two deputy superintendent of police (DSP)-level officers; DSP Manjit Singh and DSP Joginder Pal Singh. SSP Satinder Singh said that realtors were allegedly cheating people and duping farmers of their land. ‚ÄúAll angles will be probed and no realtor found guilty will be spared. Our efforts are to eradicate real estate bungling from our district,‚Äù he said. Earlier, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) lodged a complaint against 48 colonisers, who have been booked by the police. The SSP said that the main task of SIT will be to identify illegal colonisers operating in Mohali and not operating according to the norms set up by the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA) as well as against those facing probes with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). Mohali police recently booked 48 builders for developing illegal colonies and selling these to people in Jhampur, Badmajra and Behlolpur villages of Mohali. A case was registered after additional chief administrator (ACA), Gmada, wrote a letter to the SSP to take action against errant builders. According to the complaint, 15 colonies have been carved out of the farm lands by duping villagers and sold without getting Change in Land Use (CLU) conversion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/realtors-dont-keep-word-probe-on/articleshow/85081784.cms||---

Villagers pelted stones targeting police personnel to protest the death of the youth, Grijesh Yadav (24), a resident Lakhawar village under the Ghosi police station area in the district.

This is the second such violence in Jehanabad within two weeks. On July 24, a woman constable, Kanti Devi (54), was killed and at least 15 police personnel, including a trainee DSP, were injured on NH-110 near Nehalpur Bazaar under Paras Bigha police station area in a violent clash between villagers and police after the death of one Govind Majhi (25) inside Daudnagar sub-jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mob-goes-berserk-as-youth-ends-life-in-jehanabad-police-station/articleshow/85080206.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Madurai||HC dismisses villagers‚Äô plea for patta on forest land||Madurai: Observing that a claim made by villagers seeking patta in a forest land, is thoroughly misconceived and unsustainable, the Madras high court has dismissed the petitions filed by villagers challenging the eviction proceedings initiated by the forest department in Sivaganga.The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by villagers of Mithiravayal and Monnani in the district. The petitioners stated though they and their forefathers have been performing agriculture in the land parcels for the past 75 years, their representations seeking patta were rejected by the authorities on the ground that the land belonged to the forest.A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the claim is that the petitioners and their forefathers have been doing agricultural activities for a period of 75 years. The land is indisputably a reserved forest land. Though such tall claims have been made by the petitioners, there is not a single scrap of paper produced before this court at least to prima facie show that they have been cultivating the land.The judges observed that the reason why the petitioners would contend that they and their forefathers have been cultivating the land is to bring themselves within the definition of ‚Äòother traditional forest dwellers‚Äô as defined under Section 2(O) of the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights), Act, 2006.The judges said the ‚Äòother traditional forest dwellers‚Äô has been defined to mean any member or community who has for at least three generations prior to December 13, 2005, primarily resided in and dependent on the forest or forest land for bona fide livelihood needs. Unless and until the petitioners are able to establish that they are other traditional forest dwellers, the rights favouring ST and other forest dwellers as adumbrated in the Act would not arise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-villagers-plea-for-patta-on-forest-land/articleshow/85081792.cms||Kaushik Kannan

During the resumed hearing of the petition filed by UT‚Äôs powermen union through general secretary Gopal Dutt Joshi, the UT administration told the court about opening of financial bids. On HC‚Äôs query, the UT counsel submitted that the process would take two to three months for getting the Union cabinet nod. Meanwhile, the petitioner‚Äôs counsel submitted that they had challenged the project right from the beginning and still UT went ahead with the opening of financial bids. The court has adjourned the hearing. Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution was the highest bidder for the privatisation of the electricity department with Rs 817 crore against the reserve price of Rs 174 crore, defeating giants like Tata and the Adani group. The company is a subsidiary of Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation Ltd, a flagship of RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group. The empowered committee opened the bids on Wednesday after UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had approved the report of the technical evaluation committee. The UT will compile a report and send it to the power ministry for cabinet approval. After relief from the Supreme Court, the administration had recently speeded up the project.

The petitioner stated that the person who had set up the prawn farm had also laid a pipeline and is drawing sea water illegally.A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the assistant director of fisheries had sent a communication to one of the villagers on June 16, stating that the farm would be removed and the pipeline dismantled. However, it appears that no action has been initiated by the assistant director to inform the disaster management tahsildar who has to take action in this regard.Hence, the judges directed the authorities to conduct a surprise inspection and if it is found that there is illegal drawal of sea water and if any prawn or fish farm has been established without obtaining permission, the same should be locked and sealed immediately. The pipeline should also be dismantled. The judges further directed that notice should be issued to the person who set up the farm and the matter should be proceeded in accordance with law.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/seal-illegal-prawn-farm-hc-tells-authorities/articleshow/85081814.cms||---

It provides more opportunities for students from government schools and will also encourage enrolment in these schools. Government schools have all facilities and quality teachers but still many turn to private schools despite high fees thinking of the social status. This will change that,‚Äù said K Anand Raman, legal secretary, Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary School Headmasters Association. Government school headmasters said the quota will motivate students to go for higher studies. ‚ÄúMany students who study in government schools are often unaware of the opportunities and choices they have for higher studies. Some even stop studies at Class X or XII. This quota will greatly help government school students get representation in higher studies,‚Äù said a Physics teacher at a government higher secondary school.This year, especially due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many students had shifted from private schools to government schools as well. ‚ÄúAny welfare-oriented scheme must be welcomed. This will motivate government school students and give them confidence to show their mettle. This quota can offer the chance for students to avail of seats which otherwise would not be possible for them, especially for those from poor backgrounds. This is in line with social justice,‚Äù said Dr R Murali, Tamil Nadu secretary, Save Higher Education Movement. The educationist said that the government must also consider paying the fees for students who get seats through the 7.5% quota. ‚ÄúThe students should not be deprived of opportunities if they are unable to pay the fees. Many from poor backgrounds will not take up the course otherwise. The government should hence come up with some measure to avoid this. Paying the fees of these students can even be made a corporate social responsibility for private institutions,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/7-5-quota-expected-to-open-up-higher-studies-to-more-poor-students/articleshow/85081832.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC rejects Bhatt‚Äôs plea against co-accused||Ahmedabad: In a setback for ex-IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt, the Gujarat high court on Thursday dismissed his plea challenging a Palanpur court‚Äôs decision to permit retired DySP I B Vyas to turn an approver and grant him pardon in the 1996 drug planting case, allegedly to frame a Rajasthan lawyer. While rejecting Bhatt‚Äôs application, Justice I J Vora observed that it is evident that Bhatt has been adopting dilatory practice on each and every stage of the trial. The court said, ‚ÄúThis is a classic example of how the provisions of law are misused to delay and protract the proceedings and the attempt made by the applicant is nothing but an abuse of process of law.‚Äù Bhatt, who was a superintendent of police of Banaskantha then, was arrested with Vyas in September 2018 on charges of criminal conspiracy to frame the lawyer, Sumer Singh Rajpurohit, under the NDPS Act. Vyas proposed to turn an approver and sought pardon from the court, which was granted. Bhatt questioned the pardon contending that Vyas‚Äôs confession is nothing but an outcome of collusion of Vyas with the state government. Bhatt had also questioned the trial court‚Äôs jurisdiction to grant pardon under section 307 read with section 306 of the CrPC and argued that it is prerogative of the state government under section 64 of the NDPS Act to grant immunity. Bhatt had also challenged the trial court order on the ground that the co-accused‚Äôs confession is not an honest one bringing out the veracity of truth, but a confession to fill up a lacuna in the prosecution case. After hearing the case, the high court said that the trial court has taken into consideration the confessional statement made upon the oath and it led to the judge‚Äôs satisfaction that Vyas had made the statement without any coercion, threat or inducement. The trial court also verified that Vyas was a party or privy in the commission of offence and it also took into account the consent of the prosecution that tendering of pardon would be in the interest of successful prosecution of other offender. The court rejected Bhatt‚Äôs contention that Vyas was the principal offender being the investigating officer of the case. The HC said that the record indicates that Bhatt is shown as principal offender in the alleged crime and Vyas‚Äôs role is of an abettor. Meanwhile, the high court has also rejected Bhatt‚Äôs plea for modification of charges in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-rejects-bhatts-plea-against-co-accused/articleshow/85081847.cms||---

She has also received awards and her documentary films have been screened in various film festivals across 45 countries. It is therefore clear that the petitioner will have to travel to foreign countries to attend international film festivals and also to participate in various other gatherings involving rights of marginalized communities and LGBTQIA+ issues.The judge observed that the case of the petitioner is that when she was doing her first year course at Madurai Government Law College in 2009, an incident took place and a protest was held by the students demanding for better hostel facilities. Two criminal cases were registered against the petitioner and others. Final reports were filed in both the cases and the same were also taken on filed by the Madurai judicial magistrate II court in 2011.The judge observed that the magistrate had acquitted the petitioner in one of the cases and the petitioner had filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2020 seeking to quash the proceedings in the other criminal case.The judge observed that the application seeking for passport is now kept pending by the Madurai regional passport officer and a showcause notice has been issued to the effect that there is a criminal case pending against her and a report to that effect has been received from the police.Taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case and also the fact that the quash petition is pending before this court and other criminal case against her has ended in acquittal, the judge directed the RPO to process the application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-directs-rpo-to-issue-passport-to-docu-filmmaker-divya/articleshow/85081819.cms||---

The party claimed that Chhabra‚Äôs statements were damaging the party, an allegation which he vehemently denied. The move came during the first meeting of the newly-appointed office-bearers of the Chandigarh Congress, which was attended by most of the local senior party leaders, including former city MP Pawan Kumar Bansal.With this, it has happened for the first time that a senior leader‚Äîwho remained the president for six years when BJP was in power, also held the mayor‚Äôs seat and served the party for around 35 years‚Äîwill be given the show-cause notice. Chhabra has been among the loyalists of Bansal for many years. The development may hurt the party severely in the coming municipal elections, as Chhabra has a stronghold in the city. The internal rift has increased so much that now some local leaders have also started resigning from their posts. The party performed poorly in the past two MC and parliamentary elections and failed to clinch optimum seats in other polls, like those of market committees. Strife may prove damaging for the UT unit, which is looking to strengthen itself.Both, the present and the former Congress presidents Chawla and Chhabra, respectively, were once considered companions. During Chhabra‚Äôs tenure as the party president, Chawla was present at all crucial activities, but now they don‚Äôt see eye to eye.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-cong-to-serve-notice-on-former-chief-chhabra/articleshow/85081876.cms||Deepak Yadav

Police had arrested Fernandes and another Benaulim resident, Kennedy Mario de Cunha, 40, for trespass and theft of domestic items worth lakhs of rupees from under-construction houses, and had booked the duo under provisions of the IPC. Police sources said Fernandes and de Cunha had accumulated large gambling debts and were under pressure to pay them, prompting them to commit the thefts. In a complaint filed on May 10, Alva Rodrigues had stated that unidentified accused had broken into her under-construction house and decamped with the main door, four balcony doors, five bedroom doors, two toilet doors, four wash basins, toilet taps, shower fittings, electrical items, crockery and utensils. Subsequently, on June 1, Mukesh Kumar from Mumbai had also filed a similar complaint stating that items worth Rs 1.9 lakh were stolen from his house. The issue was raised in the recently concluded monsoon assembly session by Benaulim NCP MLA Churchill Alemao. He pointed out that there was a marked rise in house-breaking, thefts and robberies and that the Colva police were not registering cases and arresting the accused involved.

They were produced before the court on Thursday. Later, they were remanded in judicial custody. The alleged incident took place on Monday when a group of Indian Youth Congress members, led by Shinde, allegedly barged into the chamber of Arjun Shelke (45) of Sayedpur and physically assaulted him and beat him with chairs and other articles. The group was upset with Shelke, who was elected as a member of the panchayat samiti on Congress ticket but at the time of elections for chairman and vice-chairman, he defected to the BJP. His switching over to BJP came as a surprise to the MVA, which had the numbers to be elected, but still had to taste defeat.This did not go down well with the Congress office bearers. Several videos of the incident were uploaded and widely shared on social media, resulting in a heated exchange of supporters of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi and BJP.Police sub-inspector Anantha Tangade said the incident left Shinde and two others injured, and they had to be temporarily admitted to the hospital. Based on his complaint, City Chowk police immediately booked Shinde, Vijay Jadhav and six of their accomplices on the charges of voluntarily causing hurt by using an instrument, which is used as a weapon may cause death.

The post was deleted immediately and the cybercrime police informed. This is the first threat this new academic session. The school had received the earlier threats in September 2020 and subsequently a police complaint was filed on September 9 about the cyber threat of sharing morphed images. The complaint was converted to an FIR on October 3. Since then the school has received a series of threats warning authorities that morphed pictures of girl students ‚Äî casting them in lewd light ‚Äî will go online unless exams are cancelled. Subsequently, keeping the interest of students in mind and connecting with all stakeholders, exams were cancelled by the school authorities. Fresh threats and circulation of links with morphed images have again started giving parents sleepless nights. One of the parents said, ‚ÄúIt is sad that the culprit is making a mockery of the cybercrime police and education system, all stakeholders are mute spectators.‚Äù He asked, ‚ÄúIf it was the case of some senior politician or national security, would the cybercrime department respond in a similar manner?‚Äù Another parent said, ‚ÄúEverybody is dancing to the tunes of the culprit and the crime continues to date.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time the case is handed over to some responsible agency so that our yearlong agony is put to an end.‚Äù Talking to TOI, Anand Niketan School principal Binu Thomas said, ‚ÄúWe have informed the cybercrime police about the new development and they have assured us of proper investigation.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWe understand the plight of parents and I have personally contacted all 35 parents and assured them of all possible support from the school.‚Äù Earlier, top cybercrime police officials had said that they have found the threat sender.

---||Business||SII won't seek special marketing nod from EU body for vax||MUMBAI: Serum Institute of India will not be seeking a separate marketing approval from Europe's regulator for its Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, as its partner Astra Zeneca has asked that SII be considered as an alternative manufacturing site. The marketing approval is a requirement linked to the jab being accepted as part of 'Green Pass' for travel to the EU. UK drug company, AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine with Oxford University, has asked the regulator European Medicine Agency (EMA) to add SII as 'an alternative manufacturing site', on the approval given for its vaccine, Vaxzevria. So far, of the 27 EU countries, 17 have accepted Covishield for quarantine-free travel. SII-manufactured Covishield is identical to the one made by its licensee, AstraZeneca and used in Europe, hence a separate approval is not required, sources told TOI. The company does not need to apply for a marketing licence as it will not be marketing Covishield in Europe, they added. The request made by the UK firm to the EMA made in May is pending, and is being processed. "We have requested the addition of SII as an alternative manufacturing site on the Vaxzevria licence,'' an AstraZeneca spokesperson told TOI. Besides AstraZeneca, vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson have received EMA's authorisation and are eligible for the 'vaccine passport'. This comes in the midst of issues and travel restrictions being faced by several students flying to the EU to study, and people wanting to travel for work. The EU's Digital Covid certificate or 'Green Pass' came into effect from July 1. Under this, people who have taken vaccines authorised by EMA will be exempted from travel restrictions within the EU. Individual member-states can also accept vaccines that have been authorised at the national level or approved by the WHO. EU member-states are encouraged to accept WHO-authorised vaccines, experts say. It may be noted that SII's Covishield was authorised by WHO earlier this year.

The facility will cater to the Indian as well as neighbouring markets.

The company has already invested Rs 45 crore in its India operations with a wholly owned subsidiary ‚Äì Monin India Pvt Ltd ‚Äì being headquartered in Hyderabad. It also has an in-house R&D centre in Hyderabad‚Äôs HiTec City area that is focused on understanding the Indian flavour palette and developing new flavours and product categories. ‚ÄúWith the increased investment of Rs 200 crore, India remains a top-priority market for MONIN,‚Äù said Olivier Monin, chairman, Georges Monin SAS.

---||Pune||Pune: Traders refuse to give in, to continue defying 4pm deadline for further ease||PUNE: The Federation of Trade Associations Pune (FTAP) has decided to continue defying the 4pm deadline for closing shops by keeping their shutters open till 7pm. This was decided by the association at a meeting that started late on Wednesday evening and continued beyond midnight. The meeting discussed issues faced by many traders with the state government not yet extending the business hours and the police action against them for keeping the shutters open beyond the official 4pm deadline in various parts of the city. A senior police officer told TOI a penalty of Rs 500 each was slapped on 120 shopkeepers on Wednesday and Thursday for not abiding by the 4pm deadline. FTAP president Fatehchand Ranka warned member shopkeepers against getting into ‚Äúunnecessary arguments‚Äù with the police personnel and urged them to stay united and show support to colleagues confronted by the authorities. ‚ÄúDo not hand over the shop licences to any official even if they ask for the documents. Pay the Rs 500 fine if told to. This is a peaceful protest. It is a fight to secure our rights to run the business and ensure an income adequate to pay our bills. We will continue this protest till Friday, after which we will decide our next course of action. One possibility is that we may hand over the keys of our shops to the government and tell officials to run the businesses and pay the bills. We will have daily meetings with the members before taking the final decision,‚Äù he said. The federation comprises 82 associations, of which only the plywood association has decided not to be a part of the stir. Additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde said, ‚ÄúInstead of registering FIRs against the shopkeepers, we decided to slap the fine on them for violating the Covid orders issued by the government. We took video grabs of the shops open after 4pm on Thursday.‚Äù Siddharth Shirole, MLA of the Shivajinagar constituency, tweeted on Thursday questioning why the state‚Äôs MVA government is finding new excuses to continue with the curbs in Pune, while relaxations have been granted in Mumbai.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board‚Äôs 2 BHK goes for Rs 1.01 crore, 3 BHK for Rs 1.07 crore||CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) earned Rs 9.81 crore with the sale of 12 residential freehold units in different parts of the city. In the e-tender process, which was completed on Thursday, a 2BHK went for a whopping Rs 1.01 crore in Sector 49 and a 3 BHK in Sector 63 for Rs 1.07 crore. The board had invited e-tenders for the sale of 46 built-up dwelling units on freehold basis. The 12 units were included for the first time and the other 34 were those which could not be sold during the last three tendering process. The units were available in sectors 38 (West), 49, 51 and 63. The last date for submission of e-bids was August 4 till 6pm and these were opened on Thursday 10am onwards. Thirty e-bids were received for 12 dwelling units. Board‚Äôs CEO Yashpal Garg said, ‚ÄúBased on the location, view and number of available units, it was decided to go for dynamic reserve prices for some of them. Accordingly, the reserve prices were enhanced on an experimental basis. This experiment has resulted in a good revenue to the Chandigarh Housing Board.‚Äù During the last three months, the board has conducted three e-auctions for its 109 freehold residential properties. A total of 76 properties have been sold so far and the remaining along with some new properties were included in this auction. Many more vacant properties were identified and included in the e-tenders for the first time. The exercise of identifying vacant and dispute-free properties of CHB was started recently following the directions of Garg. The CHB staff had identified four commercial properties (leasehold), 15 residential units (leasehold) and 14 residential properties (freehold).  The CHB had prepared a list of 270 properties, including 11 residential (leasehold), 109 residential (freehold) and 156 commercial (leasehold), for sale. To get a good response, the CHB had reduced the reserve price of the properties by 10%. Not even a single bidder expressed interest in the auction of CHB properties held in 2019 as the reserve price was too high for both residential and commercial properties. This time, the board had decided to replace the e-auction process of selling properties with the e-tender one. In e-auction, the earnest money deposit (EMD) for participation cannot be paid online. The bidder deposits it in the CHB account and submits a proof. The payment is confirmed by the CHB officers before allowing the bidder to participate in the e-auction process. Hence, the number of bidders for a particular property and their identity is not fully confidential.  However, in the e-tender process, EMD can be paid online and there is no need of any approval. Hence, there is complete secrecy about the number of bidders and their identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2bhk-in-sec-49-goes-for-rs-1-01cr-3bhk-in-sec-63-for-rs-1-07cr/articleshow/85081936.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Aurangabad||Jalna court orders registration of offence against inspector, PSI in 3-year-old case||Aurangabad: Almost three years after an incident involving an inspector heading Ambad police station in Jalna district allegedly asking a police sub-inspector to release sand trucks plying illegally, the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) has issued directives to register an independent offence against the duo. The court has concluded that prima facie it appears to be an excess use or misuse of power. The directives have been issued by JMFC MM Choudhary in a case that was filed in August 2019 by activist Devanand Chitral, demanding registration of an offence for theft, criminal conspiracy, forgery, forgery for cheating and under other relevant sections of Mines and Minerals Act 1952. In his complaint to the court, Chitral, citing an audio clip of a phone call on March 5, 2018 in which the then inspector Devidas Shelke allegedly ordered police sub-inspector Pandurang Mane to release a truck that was seized for illegally lifting sand without paying any royalty. The PSI had made a station diary entry about seizing the trucks, but later he allegedly scribbled on the records. The complaint states that on March 6, 2018, Shelke summoned local journalists and informed them that the PSI allegedly took bribe and release the truck carrying the illegally lifted sand. He informed them about the scribbled station diary record. Reacting to the defamatory news published in local newspapers, Mane uploaded the audio conversation on social media following which an internal inquiry was ordered against the cops. After the complainant demanding immediate action on his complaint, sat on indefinite hunger strike, on March 27, 2018 an offence of theft was registered against truck owner and driver, and revenue department imposed a fine of Rs 3.82 lakh. The JMFC ruled that registration of FIR against the two was necessary and said: ‚ÄúIn any case when fresh facts come to light, then the interest of justice is paramount. This complaint discloses new facts and constitutes cognizance offence against the two.‚Äô||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jalna-court-orders-registration-of-offence-against-inspector-psi-in-3-year-old-case/articleshow/85077277.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Aurangabad||HC: Transfer Beed collector to ensure impartial probe||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has directed the state chief secretary to transfer Beed district collector Ravindra Jagtap and appoint another district collector with promptitude to enable an impartial probe in an alleged misappropriation and siphoning of huge funds meant for MGNREGA scheme.The bench of Justice Ravindra Ghuge and Justice Sanjay Mehare said on August 3 that it had lost complete faith and trust in the incumbent collector for the way he has handled the court‚Äôs earlier directives relating to setting up of a probe panel and submission of an affidavit relating to the probe findings. "Prima facie, we are of the opinion that the incumbent collector (Jagtap) has exhibited an extreme lack of solitude for the rule of the law and conducted himself in a manner not befitting the responsible office he holds,‚Äù the bench said.The HC was hearing a PIL by activist Rajkumar Deshmukh, who has alleged, among other things, that cheque and cash payments worth crores of rupees were made between 2010-11 and 2018-19 for MG-NREGA works in violation of the provisions of the scheme in the district. The matter has been posted for next hearing on August 18 when, the bench said, it will issue directives to a new collector.On Jagtap‚Äôs failure to comply with its January 21 order for an inquiry and affidavit by April 3, the HC said, ‚ÄúHaving regard to his conduct, the matter needs to be dealt with appropriately under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. We have thus lost complete faith and trust in the district collector, Ravindra Jagtap. There is a serious possibility that he would botch the investigation if he continues to be the collector, being the head of the district administration. He has already commenced a cover up operation.‚ÄùThe petitioner‚Äôs lawyer, Girish Thigale-Naik, had brought to the court‚Äôs notice that some of the members of the inquiry committee (set up in a delayed response to the court‚Äôs directive) are themselves accused of malpractices. The HC took a strong exception to the one-and-half-page affidavit-in reply filed by Jagtap in June, in which he stated that he was not aware of the HC order issued in January. The HC also expressed its unhappiness over the district collector writing letters to different departments and asking them for "a proper compliance should be made in the context of all these serious illegalities."Citing the all the records placed before it, HC observed, ‚ÄúWe open any page of any report and we find gross illegalities like, specific bills not being raised, crores of rupees being disbursed in cash and by bearer cheques, miserable failure in GST/TDS/VAT/TIN compliances, no names are found on the bearer cheques though payments have been made to the tune of crores of rupees in about 9 to 10 years, details of work done are not placed before the auditors, bills raised and sanction of appropriate authorities through documentation are missing.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-transfer-beed-collector-to-ensure-impartial-probe/articleshow/85077311.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Dehradun||21 underpasses on Delhi-Dehradun e-way for safe passage of animals: NHAI||NAINITAL: To protect animals on a 3.4-km stretch of the proposed Delhi-Dehradun expressway that will pass through forests of the Shivalik hills, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will build 21 wildlife underpasses, bridges and similar structures of passage. In an affidavit filed with the Uttarakhand high court, NHAI project director Pankaj Kumar Mourya said that bamboo plantations will be in place to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù animals through the underpasses and barriers will be installed on both sides of the road to reduce noise pollution. Noise barriers absorb sound waves and wall them off on one side. ‚ÄúThe existing road has no passage for wild animals and its poor geometrics lead to frequent road accidents,‚Äù the affidavit said. The high court was hearing two petitions on the environmental impact of the project. The Centre had said the six-lane expressway would cut travel time between Delhi and Dehradun by over half ‚Äî from five hours to two. Environmentalists said they were worried about a 19.7-km section between Ganeshpur (UP) and Dehradun that goes through forests. Most of it is in UP, except the 3.4-km stretch in the eco-sensitive zone and reserve forests of Shivalik hills. The first animal underpasses in India were built in 2018, nine of them, beneath a section of NH-44 (Srinagar-Kanyakumari highway) between the Kanha and Pench tiger reserves. Two years after that, Wildlife Institute of India scientists found it was working ‚Äî 5,675 animals of 18 wildlife species were using them. This year, the numbers went further up ‚Äî a 193% jump in the number of animals taking the underpasses, at 16,608, of 21 species. The NHAI also told the court orally that it is exploring the possibility of building an elevated road on the 3.4-km stretch, which would protect wildlife and require fewer trees to be cut. A 12-km stretch of the project in UP has also been planned that way. At the moment, 2,572 trees will have to be felled for the Uttarakhand section of the project. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma asked the NHAI to inform it how many trees would have to be cut then. Either way, the NHAI told the court, it will plant about 40,000 trees on a 20-hectare plot of degraded forest land nearby. It will also monitor human-wildlife conflict in the area and keep track of animal deaths on highways and places nearby for the next two to three years. The next hearing is on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/21-underpasses-in-shivalik-forest-stretch-of-delhi-doon-e-way-for-safe-passage-of-animals-nhai-to-hc/articleshow/85077351.cms||Prashant Jha

So, wherever I go in the state, I discuss development-related issues with some of the local authorities. Such discussions were held on Thursday,‚Äù he told media persons after holding a meeting with the Nanded district administration. The governor is the ex-officio president of the Marathwada Development Board and two other such statutory bodies meant for Vidarbha and the rest of Maharashtra, which were formed for overcoming developmental backlog of these regions. Koshyari parried queries on whether he feels the MVA government was playing politics over his tour of Marathwada, by stating that a section of media was trying to do so. Incidentally, Koshyari, who arrived at Nanded on his three-day visit, did not inaugurate the boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô hostels for the minority students at the Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, despite his earlier official schedule mentioning the same. Maharashtra Cabinet minister Nawab Malik had taken a strong objection to the inauguration by the governor. While these hostel facilities have already been used by the university administration for Covid-related work, no formal inauguration of both the hostels had taken place yet. Earlier, addressing an event at SRTM University, Koshyari stressed on imparting education in the mother tongue. ‚ÄúThe unfolding of education in one‚Äôs mother tongue is simpler and important from the learner‚Äôs perspective. Such grasping of knowledge along with the pride for the mother tongue would create a confident young generation,‚Äù he said. The Governor, who will be visiting Hingoli and Parbhani districts over a period of next two days, also paid visit to the famous Nanded Gurdwara on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maha-governor-clears-air-on-his-marathwada-tour/articleshow/85077352.cms||Prasad Joshi

Airlines had announced direct flights to Qatar in August from various parts of the country, resulting in a surge of bookings on the India-Doha-Dubai route, said travel agents. The UAE banned travel from India on April 25, but relaxed some restrictions on Thursday. Pradhikaran resident Dinesh Shingote (32), who booked tickets from Mumbai to Doha and onwards to Dubai for August 10, said the changes have cost him financially. ‚ÄúI paid Rs 32,000 for the ticket and also bought a ticket from Doha to Sharjah for Rs 13,000,‚Äù Shingote told TOI. Travel agents said they received multiple inquiries for flights to the UAE over the last two months and were expecting a large volume of bookings. ‚ÄúMany people with UAE residency visas have been stranded in India since April . The number of calls has increased in the past two days,‚Äù Nilesh Bhansali, director of the Travel Agents Association of Pune, said.

The forest department was constructing a road between Vanpath Gomthara and Goram Mandir in the sanctuary using funds provided by the District Mineral Foundation Trust (DMFT). ‚ÄúTill next date of hearing, construction activities inside the proposed tiger reserve and wildlife sanctuary shall remain stayed,‚Äù the court order said. After the construction work was proposed, a PIL was filed by wildlife conservationist and lawyer Rituraj Singh. The petitioner had alleged that the project was being undertaken by the forest department due to the political clout of the sitting MLA who had promised such a path to the temple to the voters of his constituency. ‚ÄúPathways leading to religious sites inside the forest are a real cause of concern. In one such incident, which happened at Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, a leopard was hit by devotees on a bike going to Trinetra Ganesh Ji Temple situated inside the reserve‚Äù At present, there is no motorable connectivity and thousands of devotees flock to the temple at specific intervals. To reach the temple, devotees have to take a metre gauge rail from Marwar Junction, which passes through the jungle, and get down at Goram Ghat station. ‚ÄúFrom that point, devotees have to walk all the way to the temple on foot. The project will make the path leading to the temple motorable and, thereby, let more devotees enter the forest and go to the temple in vehicles,‚Äù Singh said. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has already written to the director Wildlife Institute Of India, Dehradun, to conduct a rapid survey of Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary for exploring the feasibility of declaring it a tiger reserve. According to the draft, the name of the area is proposed to be Kumbhalgarh Tiger Reserve which will constitute Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary and adjoining forest areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-stays-construction-of-road-inside-proposed-kumbhalgarh-reserve/articleshow/85084384.cms||---

The woman was also chargesheeted under the Child Marriage Restraint Act in Solapur. The girl, who lived with her ailing mother and was in Class 8, was married on New Year‚Äôs day last year. On February 25, 2020, she was dead. Her mother received a call saying the girl had hanged herself. ‚ÄúA young life was cut short at the age of 14, though the poor girl aspired to fulfill her dream of taking education,‚Äù Justice Bharati Dangre said. The girl‚Äôs mother, estranged from her father for over a decade, had filed an FIR after her death. She said she never wanted to marry off her daughter. According to the girl‚Äôs mother, she had rejected the marriage proposal, but on the persuasion of some middlemen, she met a man and his mother. They expressed interest in the girl and even paid for the hospitalisation and surgery that the mother needed. However, when she refused to perform her daughter‚Äôs marriage, they allegedly demanded their money back. Left with no option, the mother consented. The young bride attended school for a few days. But soon, her in-laws restrained her. ‚ÄúShe was thrashed‚Äù when she expressed her desire to continue studying. When the girl informed her mother, she sought her return, but her request was ‚Äúflatly turned down‚Äù by her son-in-law, the woman said, adding that her daughter would call and narrate the harassment she suffered. On February 25, she called saying her husband had assaulted her and she wanted to return home. The same day at 1.30pm, the mother was told her daughter had died. Describing the woman as a ‚Äúvictim of circumstances‚Äù, the HC said the government‚Äôs campaign ‚Äúaims to generate awareness and improve efficiency of welfare services intended for girls in India‚Äù. Justice Dangre added that the case before the court ‚Äúdemonstrates how the laudable policy for empowerment of girl child remained only a mirage for this little, but ambitious victim girl‚Äù. The HC noted that the chargesheet has been filed in the case. ‚ÄúIf the accused by his acts and by his continuous course of conduct creates a situation, and it leads the deceased perceiving no other option except suicide, the case will clearly fall within the four corners of Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC,‚Äù said Justice Dangre. Both incitement to commit offence and instigation have clearly surfaced in the chargesheet, it said. ‚ÄúThe mother-in-law persuaded her to give up her education, her future, and drove her to the noose, which she used for committing suicide. Also, the proximity of the alleged harassment to the time of the suicide also bears great relevance,‚Äù said Justice Dangre, adding that her release on bail is therefore not warranted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-no-bail-for-mom-in-law-in-minors-suicide/articleshow/85086224.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Congress shedding crocodile tears: CM||Gandhinagar: Chief minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday claimed the Congress was shedding crocodile tears for farmers since many years, while real work for the welfare of the farming community was done by the BJP governments in Gujarat and at the centre. Addressing a gathering in Bhuj town of Kutch district, Rupani alleged that protesting farmers were even shot dead during the Congress‚Äôs rule in Gujarat. He was speaking on the occasion of the ‚ÄòKisan Samman Diwas‚Äô, organised by the state government as part of the nine-day celebrations to mark the completion of his five years as CM. Rupani said, ‚ÄúThe Congress always sheds crocodile tears in the name of farmers. ‚ÄúHe further alleged, ‚ÄúFarmers knew your reality, that is why the Congress got wiped out in the recent panchayat elections. Farmers who demanded timely payment of crop insurance, were shot dead in your (Congress‚Äôs) rule.‚Äù While the Congress always talks about farm loan waiver, it waived off cultivators‚Äô debts worth Rs 70,000 crore only once in 10 years of the UPA rule, he said. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government is depositing Rs 6,000 in the bank accounts of farmers every year under the ‚ÄòKisan Samman Nidhi‚Äôscheme. Rs 8 lakh crore have been disbursed to farmers across the country in just five years,‚Äù Rupani said. Referring to previous Congress governments in Gujarat, Rupani said cultivators used to pay 18% interest on farm loans, which has now been brought to zero by the BJP government in the state. ‚ÄúDespite a gradual rise in coal prices over the years, we never increased the power tariff for agricultural connections in the 25 years of BJP rule in Gujarat,‚Äù the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/congress-shedding-crocodile-tears-cm/articleshow/85082086.cms||---

State general secretary of Congress Namrata Acharya-Themaskar interacted with patients and found that many patients were being refused sonography tests since several days, due to a glitch in the sonography machine. The patients were being sent to private labs for testing. Patients also complained about doctors in GMCH referring them to private labs for pathology tests. ‚ÄúI visit GMCH every Thursday to hear problems of patients. We found a person, Vinod Naitam, whose baby was admitted in neonatal ICU following rare kind of jaundice. But he was refused of sonography testing since two days as the machine was non-functional. We contacted the concerned doctors and technicians to inquire about the problem, but they gave evasive excuses. However, when they the issue will be taken up by guardian minister and member of Parliament, they swung into action and the machine was repaired within an hour,‚Äù Acharya told TOI. The interaction between Acharya and Naitam, where the aggrieved father is narrating his woes, had gone viral on social media. As complaints started pouring in, officials in GMCH started patching up the problem. Another patient, Kishor Kulmethe, with complaints of abdominal pain had been coming from Wardha since four days, but was repeatedly denied sonography as well as admission. Instead, he was given painkillers and asked to stay put till his sonography diagnosis, she said. Acharya said that while she was there insisting on immediate repair of sonography machine, several patients approached with complaints of being denied sonography and pathology tests. ‚ÄúThe women patients in maternity ward require several tests during the final days of pregnancy. Many patients complained they have been referred time and again for tests to private labs,‚Äù she alleged. She claimed to have recorded the woes of patients on video and would take up the matter with guardian minister. GMCH dean Dr Avinsh Tekade admitted that both the sonography machines were not working since a few days, but both of them were repaired on Thursday and put into service. He explained that sonography machines are under Annual Maintenance Contract with a company. The biomedical engineer often needs related spares to repair the machines, hence the repairs are delayed sometimes. When asked about complaints regarding patients being referred to private labs for pathology tests, he claimed that their central clinical lab is fully functional. He maintained that if there is any complaint regarding patients being sent outside for pathology tests, they will inquiry into the matter and take action against those found guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/irregularities-exposed-in-sonography-pathology-tests-at-chanda-gmch/articleshow/85079980.cms||Mazhar Ali

The new recycled PSF facility, to be built and exclusively operated by Srichakra Ecotex India Pvt Ltd for RIL, will more than double RIL‚Äôs recycling capacity to over 5 billion post-consumer PET bottles per annum. The company, however, did not specify the investment in the project. At present, RIL converts more than 2 billion post-consumer PET bottles into fibers annually at its Barabanki, Hoshiarpur and Nagothane plants. The facility will use post-consumer PET bottles as raw material for manufacturing recycled PSF, branded as Recron GreenGold, which is further used to manufacture green fabric through selected downstream partner mills. Pointing out that it is focusing on sustaining India‚Äôs post-consumer PET recycling rate that is currently the highest in the world, RIL said the move is part of its commitment to lead the industry on circular economy, enhance its sustainability quotient and bolster the entire polyester and polymer value chain. Vipul Shah, COO - petrochemicals business, RIL, said the expansion is part of Mukesh Ambani‚Äôs vision to transform RIL‚Äôs legacy business into sustainable, circular and net zero carbon materials business and support entrepreneurs to take risk throughout the value chain. ‚ÄúRIL shares expertise and technical knowhow with entrepreneurs to produce top quality products at lowest possible costs and has underwritten the entire production from Srichakra‚Äôs facility to provide support for development of the business,‚Äù Shah added.

---||Dehradun||‚ÄòLow sighting‚Äô of moths a concern, experts urge people to switch off extra lights||Dehradun: Low sightings of moths in Dehradun has prompted environmentalists to urge people to minimise light pollution to enable the insect populations to thrive. The concerns were raised following an annual survey by Titli Trust under the aegis of the Uttarakhand forest department which recorded only 72 moth species this year, much less than the 116 species that were spotted last year. The survey was conducted in Lacchiwala, Malsi and Kaduapani in Dehradun between July 19 and July 22. ‚ÄúMoth sightings this year were much lower than in the previous year. We are urging people to mitigate light pollution. Light pollution is dangerous to moths as it can distract them from mating, feeding and pollinating. Moths are ignored and underrepresented in studies, if we want them to survive, we need to take urgent steps,‚Äù founder of Titli Trust, Sanjay Sondhi, told TOI. Moths are crucial pollinators and an important element of the food chain. But there is a downfall in numbers across the globe. In January this year, a research paper published in Munis Entomology and Zoology, had said that moth populations had recorded a substantial decline in various countries, including India. It had found that numbers in Great Britain, Sweden and Netherlands were down by 31%, 27% and 71% respectively. Talking about the possible reasons behind the decline in moth numbers, Pritha Dey, country coordinator for India's National Moth Week (July 17 to July 25), said, ‚ÄúIt is a well-known fact that the insect population is on a decline worldwide and moths are no exception. Deforestation, urbanisation, climate change, artificial light pollution and encroachment have left the habitats of insects vulnerable.‚Äù The Uttarakhand forest department officials said they were conducting regular nature walks, developing new nature trails and conducting various competitions to acquaint local residents with moths, butterflies and other creatures around them. ‚ÄúMoths and butterflies have been a priority as they are highly vulnerable to climate change,‚Äù said Rajiv Bhartari, head of the forest force. Experts at Wildlife Institute of India said there was a strong need to understand moths better. ‚ÄúAll we know so far is that they are mainly found near agriculture belts,‚Äù said Dr VP Uniyal, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/low-sighting-of-moths-a-concern-experts-urge-people-to-switch-off-extra-lights/articleshow/85077473.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Kolkata||Refuge island to tackle pedestrian rush at Phoolbagan||Kolkata: Three years after initially mooting the idea, the city traffic police has finally decided to re-introduce refuge islands to put pedestrians at ease and increase their security, Kolkata Police has written to the KMC to construct one such island on Narkeldanga Main Road close to CIT Road crossing to facilitate pedestrian movement. The crossing is expected to witness more footfall once the Phoolbagan Metro station gets operationally linked with the Sealdah Metro station and cops want to be ready for the surge in pedestrian movement at the crossing. Police also plans to introduce the same structures on EM Bypass and AJC Bose Road. A refuge island ‚Äî also called a pedestrian refuge or a pedestrian island ‚Äî is constructed in the middle of roads, particularly those that don‚Äôt have dividers, to regulate the flow of traffic at a junction. Pedestrians can cross one flank of the road, wait on these islands and cross the second flank when the traffic clears. There used to be traffic refuges on AJC Bose Road between Moulali and Mullick Bazar for tram commuters but they were demolished as police said they were an obstruction to traffic flow. "These are semi-permanent structures with modern designs that will be used so that minimum road space is used," said an officer. "A huge pedestrian crossover takes place each day between the State of India branch and the Bata outlet near the crossing. Several autos on the Phoolbagan-Salt Lake-Karunamoyee route also take U-turn from that spot. Now that Metro will be extended to Sealdah and the pressure at the crossing will increase, we want to ensure pedestrian security and motorists' right to the road,‚Äù said a Lalbazar officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/refuge-island-to-tackle-pedestrian-rush-at-phoolbagan/articleshow/85082195.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A profusely bleeding teacher, Natwar Yadav (45), was taken to a local hospital before he was referred to SMS Hospital in the city for specialised treatment. Deputy SP, Kotputli, Dinesh Kumar told TOI that the student, who fired at the teacher, was a minor. As per police, the teacher had issued a transfer certificate (TC) to the student last year due to the latter‚Äôs alleged habit of misbehaving with teachers. ‚ÄúYadav was going to his home through the main road in Nareda. Two youths on a bike intercepted him near Chimanpura and one of them fired at Yadav,‚Äù said Hajari Lal, assistant sub-inspector, Sarund police station. Late Thursday night, a team led by DSP Dinesh Kumar, detained both the boys from Haryana, who were found to be minors. Police said the student had regular quarrels with his teachers. After leaving the school, he left for work in the Rajsamand district. ‚ÄúWhen all his friends passed Class 12, he was angry and decided to settle scores with the teacher,‚Äù DSP Kumar said. Police said the teacher had sustained firearm injuries on his left thigh after he fell to the ground following the shooting. The gunshots triggered a wave of panic with several people running for cover. Staff from the Sarund police station immediately arrived at the spot, followed by senior officials. ‚ÄúThe minor was a student of the same government school where Yadav taught. For the past one year, after leaving the school, he started working at a place in Rajsamand district,‚Äù an official with Jaipur (rural) police told TOI, adding that the axed student was nursing a grudge against Yadav for several months. Police suspect that somebody had given him an illegal weapon that he used to fire at the teacher. ‚ÄúHe (suspect) asked Yadav for a marksheet. The teacher scolded him and a heated argument broke out between the two before the student took out a firearm and shot Yadav,‚Äù the official added. Yadav taught history to class 10 and 12 students. ‚ÄúThe student who fired at his teacher was a student of 12th standard. We asked the injured teacher to reveal more details about what led to the student being removed from the school, but he was in pain and trembling with fear after the incident,‚Äù the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/axed-student-fires-at-teacher-in-kotputli/articleshow/85084488.cms||---

A week into the state‚Äôs introductory home jab policy for the bedridden and the immobile, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted Maharashtra‚Äôs policy saying it has got off to a good start. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC said to administer the vaccine, a two-member team, comprising a doctor and a nurse, visits homes of the registered people along with an ambulance. Sakhare said in Mumbai, administered doses total 73,36,171. Beneficiaries face difficulty in getting fitness certificates from doctors that state they will be bedridden for at least six months, the BMC submitted in HC. Advocate Dhruti Kapadia who had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in April for a door-to-door policy, in which the court had gently nudged the state via orders into action, questioned the role of NGOs which were in collaboration with the BMC for the drive. She said where the fitness certificate is not possible, the BMC could send its doctors to check the person. She reiterated the need for a helpline. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni asked Kapadia to let the drive continue saying, ‚Äúthere may be some teething troubles at the start‚Äô‚Äô. HC adjourned the matter to August 12. It sought an affidavit from the BMC on the NGOs‚Äô role and an update on the jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/602-of-4-7k-bedridden-citizens-have-got-home-jabs-bombay-hc-told/articleshow/85082285.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: CET route for some colleges, others prefer class XII marks||PUNE: The idea of conducting a common entrance test (CET) for admissions to undergraduate courses has found takers among some autonomous institutes. Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce‚Äôs principal Seema Purohit said the college has received 6,000 applications for the 600 seats in the aided divisions for the undergraduate section. ‚ÄúWe have heard that many students have got almost the same marks. A decision on how to admit students with the same marks is difficult. There needs to be some way to prepare the merit list and an entrance exam is a fair way. We have already started the application process for CET. It will be held online and the syllabus will be HSC commerce syllabus along with logical reasoning and mathematical aptitude. The exam will be conducted in batches and we have done all the preparation so that the process is smooth,‚Äù she said. Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal of Fergusson College, said the college will not conduct an entrance examination as the number of students applying is huge. ‚ÄúWe have around 720 seats in the science stream and 480 seats in the arts faculty. We get around 15,000 applications. We tried a system, but that did not work out to enable so many students to appear for the exam at the same time. Proctoring is not possible for so many candidates. The cut-off percentage is expected to go really high this year,‚Äù he added. Meanwhile, Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, said his college has decided to go ahead with the Std XII results for preparing the merit list. ‚ÄúOur priority is to start the next academic year on time at least by the fourth week of August. If we conduct an entrance exam, the entire process will be delayed, which we don‚Äôt want to happen,‚Äù he said. The college will apply for an increase in intake within the current divisions. ‚ÄúFor the 480 seats in FY BCom grantable divisions, we get around 1,500 applications. We generally request the university to increase the existing intake capacity by 20%. Applying for additional divisions is a long process and also requires new staff recruitment. We don‚Äôt want any delays in the process and this is more effective,‚Äù he added. SK Jain, president of Shikshan Prasarak Mandali that governs SP College, said he will hold a meeting on Friday with all officials concerned to arrive at a decision on whether to conduct an entrance examination or not. ‚ÄúWe are considering an entrance exam. However, we will set aside some seats for students. A decision will be taken in tomorrow,‚Äù he said. Hrishikesh Soman, principal of Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce, has also decided to go ahead with HSC marks to prepare the merit list. ‚ÄúWe had previously thought of a CET. Students have gone through enough delays and stress during the last year. And even if we conduct an entrance test, without proctoring, it is unfair. Hence, we have decided to prepare the merit list using board marks. Cut-off marks will be high this year. We may even have to devise various methods to break ties when two or more students have got the same marks. But our plan is to start the academic year in time hopefully by September 1 or latest by September 15 so that students can get on with their studies,‚Äù said Soman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cet-route-for-some-colleges-others-prefer-std-xii-marks/articleshow/85082280.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Delhi||No chance of heavy rain in Delhi in next few days, says IMD||NEW DELHI: The capital may have received 141% excess rain above the normal mark in July, but the next seven days will see only subdued rain activity. The Met department, which had earlier forecast moderate rain during the week, has now predicted light rain on Friday and Saturday and formation of thundery development from Sunday. Delhi has not received rain in the past two days. Track the pollution level in your cityIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) had earlier issued an orange alert for Friday with the prediction of moderate rain. The department later removed the orange alert, but forecast light to moderate rain for three days and light rain or thundershowers in remaining days of the week. However, on Thursday, the Met department said there is a possibility of light rain or thundershowers at isolated places on Friday and Saturday. Rain is unlikely from Sunday to August 11. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, ‚ÄúRain activity is likely to be subdued in most parts of north-west India, including Delhi, over the next few days.‚Äù On Thursday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 35.3 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum temperature settled at 26.5 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity oscillated between 86% and 59%. No rainfall was recorded till 8.30pm at Safdarjung, which is the city‚Äôs base station. With no significant rainfall in the region, Delhi‚Äôs air quality deteriorated to the lower-end of ‚Äòsatisfactory‚Äô category. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of the capital was 99 on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-chance-of-heavy-rain-in-the-next-few-days-says-imd/articleshow/85082358.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rain in excess, but Delhi yet to get any good air day this year||NEW DELHI: While Delhi may have recorded five days that were categorised as ‚Äògood‚Äô according to the Air Quality Index in 2020, this year, despite the lockdown and regular showers, the city is yet to record such a day. Delhi may have received more than 500mm of rainfall in July, 2.4 times the normal for the month, but that didn‚Äôt clean the air enough for it to be ‚Äògood‚Äô. Track the pollution level in your cityA ‚Äògood‚Äô air AQI is 50 or below. The lowest rating recorded so far in the current monsoon season is 57, which is classified as 'satisfactory'. Experts said that other sources of local emissions, as well as gaseous pollutants such as CO, O3 and NO2 could be playing a key role even when the rain settled down the PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants. Last year, Delhi recorded five ‚Äògood‚Äô air quality days: one in March during the Covid lockdown, and four in August during the monsoon period. The monsoons blew into Delhi on July 13 and on July 19, the capital saw its first ‚Äòheavy‚Äô rainfall for nearly 7-8 hours. The average 24-hour AQI on the day, however, was 62 in the ‚Äòsatisfactory‚Äô category. Heavy rainfall was also recorded on July 27 and July 29, but Delhi still did not log ‚Äògood‚Äô air levels. In May too, cyclone Tauktae brought 119.3mm of rain to Delhi in a single day, but the daily average AQI was 58. A recent study by IIT-Kanpur analysing the pollution sources in the summer said power plants were the biggest contributor to PM2.5 pollutants, with the study also finding an increase in the concentration of sulfates and organic aerosols in summer compared with high chlorine and nitrate composition in winter. Of the organic aerosols found in the air in summer, the study listed solid fuel combustion as the biggest contributor (16.2%), followed by traffic (12.3%) and cooking (7.3%). Sachchida N Tripathi, head of civil engineering department at IIT Kanpur, who carried out the study in June-July 2019, said that while dust was an obvious factor during the summers, combustion sources, such as power plants, were identified as the other major factor. Delhi government recently filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking closure of the 10 thermal power plants in the National Capital Region that had not switched to cleaner technology. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, pointed that in contrast to the common belief that rain washes away pollution, it only washes away particulate matter. ‚ÄúGases still remain a problem and in fact can increase because waterlogged roads cause idling and traffic snarls,‚Äù said Chowdhury, adding that why there was a need to reduce fuel combustion of all types. After the ‚Äòheavy‚Äô rainfall on July 19, the AQI was an acceptable 62, but the waterlogging and consequent traffic snarls caused the primary pollutant to be NO2, followed by PM10 in the CPCB data. On July 27, NO2 was again the lead pollutant, while O3 and CO were dominating pollutants on July 29. Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB‚Äôs air laboratory, said background emissions were higher than normal across the Indo-Gangetic Plains, with dust and localised sources sometimes pushing AQI to ‚Äòpoor‚Äô in the summer. ‚ÄúDust can be settled through a spell of rain, but it is not easy to control other sources of pollution, which can make a significant impact over a 24-hour period,‚Äù said Saha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-in-excess-but-capital-yet-to-get-any-good-air-day-this-year/articleshow/85082324.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Agra||For 1st time, Taj Mahal‚Äôs main dome to get mud pack for 6 months||AGRA: Hundreds of workers will again scale scaffolding, this time to reach to the top of Taj Mahal, as they will apply mud packs on the mausoleum‚Äôs huge main dome to give it back its original pearl white shine. The restoration work is likely to begin this October and will go on for next six months, a period during which the dome will remain under scaffoldings. Earlier, all the four minarets of the four-century old monument were put under mud packs to restore their glory. The monument has been given mud pack treatment six times in the past, but the main dome was never part of it. The mud pack therapy, similar to the one women use to get back glow on their faces, is being used to remove yellow stains from the marble. Superintending archeologist (science branch) of Archeological Survey of India‚Äôs (ASI) Agra MK Bhatnagar said, ‚ÄúWe had plans to start it after the monsoon season. But weather conditions have to be favourable. The cleaning cannot be carried out in high humidity. Covid-19 pandemic is also one of the factors that will have to be considered, as it will directly impact the availability of manpower that time.‚Äù The first mud-pack treatment was given in 1994. Then again it went under the wet mud in 2001 and 2008. In May 2014, it was done to get rid of stains of paan and gutka on the interior walls left behind by local visitors. And in 2019, the four minarets and interior periphery portions were given fresh mud-pack treatment. Last year, a brief clay-pack treatment was provided to the replicas of the graves of Mughal emperor Shahjahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal for a facelift ahead of the then US President Donald Trump‚Äôs visit to the 17th century monument. Officials said the process of cleaning will take over six months and the entire project will cost at least Rs 50 lakh. ‚ÄúIron scaffolding will be tied all around the dome for this. The load will be divided equally according to the suggestions given by a technical team and we will also take the help from engineers,‚Äù said Bhatnagar. The pack contains the same ingredients used by women to restore their natural glow on the face. ‚ÄúA thick layer of lime-rich clay is plastered over the affected surface and left to dry,‚Äù said an official, adding that when it dries the flakes are removed from the surface with a soft brush. Then it is washed with water and finally with distilled water to clear the impurities. For the dome, the mud pack will be applied at least 2-3 times (coats) as it is being done for the first time. Shamsuddin Khan, the president of Tourist Guides Association, said that this is the right time for cleaning the main dome as tourists footfall is very low due to closure of international flights.

The glaring mismatch has surfaced at a time when the Kerala government is struggling to explain the difference in number of Covid deaths between the death registration figures and the official data published by the health department. Kerala recorded the highest number of dengue deaths ‚Äì 165, and the second highest number of cases in the country in 2017 ‚Äì 21,993, after Tamil Nadu. It was the highest ever fatalities and cases ever recorded in Kerala. The data on communicable diseases kept by the directorate of health services (DHS) also show district and month-wise details of deaths in Kerala in 2017 and corroborate the figures as 165 and 21,993. Meanwhile, the number of state-wide dengue cases and deaths presented in the Lok Sabha for the past five years by health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, in response to a question by YSR Congress MP N Reddeppa, shows that in 2017 Kerala had 19,994 cases and only 37 deaths. The data show that the highest number of deaths in 2017 was reported in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu - 65 deaths. The economic review (ER) published by the state planning board in 2018 also quotes figures from DHS to show that there were 165 deaths and 21,993 cases in the state. Owing to the high number of deaths and cases, ER also made certain observations. ‚ÄúDengue fever, which surfaced in Kerala as early as 1998, has now become the single largest vector borne disease. The main reason for this wide spread distribution is believed to be the changes in environmental factors causing proliferation of the dengue vector-Aedes mosquitoes. These mosquitoes, which in the earlier days seen more in rural settings have now spread to urban areas also,‚Äù the ER document states. As per DHS data, the death rate due to dengue was severe in June, July and August in 2017. Thiruvananthapuram had the highest number of cases in 2017 - 8,955, and Malappuram reported the highest number of deaths - 62. When asked about the reason for mismatch in data presented in the parliament, health secretary Rajan N Khobragade did not respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/disparity-seen-in-dengue-death-data/articleshow/85080138.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Mumbai||Why not a ‚Äòcard‚Äô for those fully vaccinated to use railway locals: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday asked the Maharashtra government to consider issuing a ‚Äúcommon card‚Äù to enable selective access on local trains to those fully vaccinated. Counsels for the state and Centre replied they would discuss the proposal, but indicated that the sheer volume of daily commuters on Mumbai‚Äôs suburban network‚Äî70 lakh‚Äîhad to be borne in mind before implementing any system. The judges referred to an interview of Covid Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi where he was quoted as saying that the process to identify those vaccinated to enable train travel would be cumbersome. Dr Joshi had said the state was yet to achieve 70% immunization coverage among adults and 30% of its total population remained unexposed to the virus, going by serological surveys. In such circumstances, it would not be safe to allow even those fully vaccinated to use trains as that would spread the virus faster among those unexposed or unvaccinated. However, Chief Justice Dipankar Datta said ‚Äúit is for the Centre and State to find‚Äù a mechanism, adding that dedicated counters should be opened to issue passes to those vaccinated. Justice Girish Kulkarni said entry to stations must be by cards as it is in some countries. Cater to the needs of all sections while lifting Covid-19 restrictions rather than ‚Äúallowing some and preventing others,‚Äù said the judges hearing PILs on the issue. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the State has agreed to let lawyers, their clerks and staff travel by train. Advocate Alankar Kirpekar, representing activist Mohan Bhide, said all those with dual vaccination must be allowed to commute by railways. The judges agreed. The bench said travel is a serious issue in Mumbai and train travel is most economical. ‚ÄúYou cannot compare Mumbai with other cities in the State. This is a city with special needs,‚Äô‚Äô said Justice Kulkarni. He suggested an expert committee, like the Task Force, to decide on issues coming to HC. ‚ÄúWhatever lakhs are to be allowed, those doubly vaccinated allow them,‚Äù said the CJ. Justice Kulkarni then said there can be a ‚Äúcommon card for all utilities... even for foreign travel.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt can be considered,‚Äô‚Äô replied Singh. Advocate Nilesh Pawaskar, for Mumbai Marathi Patrakar Sangh, asked for journalists be allowed on trains ‚Äúto reach ground zero.‚Äù He said their PIL is for declaring journalists as frontline workers; 140 journalists have died of Covid, he said. ‚ÄúOur endeavour is not only for lawyers to travel (by train ) but also other walks of life,‚Äô‚Äô said CJ, asking if one could be infected in buses as well. Advocate Milind Sathe, for State Bar Council, said ‚Äúon buses anyone can travel... social distancing is gone.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/why-not-a-card-for-those-fully-vaccinated-to-use-rly-locals-bombay-hc/articleshow/85082495.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly to consider setting up ad hoc panel||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The assembly will consider setting up an ad hoc committee so as to give recommendations regarding modifications in the assembly proceedings, including the inordinate delay in giving replies to the MLAs on several occasions, speaker M B Rajesh has ruled. In reply to a point-of-order raised by Anoop Jacob MLA that on many occasions there were inordinate delay in receiving the answers, the speaker said that the completion of e-Niyamasabha would be a permanent solution to several of such issues being faced at present. He said that a meeting of the parliamentary party leaders that was convened on July 27 had discussed the matter regarding the delay in receiving the answers, but it was deferred for broader discussions. He said that the chair would hold discussions with the chief minister and the opposition leader and take a call in this regard. Jacob said that on several occasions, the answers get delayed by months or even years that the relevance of the question itself would be lost by the time the MLAs receive the answers. He said that questions asked under the RTI Act would be better answered than raised in the assembly, as the RTI Act has some penal provisions for delayed answers over a particular time frame. Subsequent governments have been skipping the answers on several important yet uneasy questions that may have answers that would be self-critical or by which the opposition are likely to nail the government over an issue. For example, questions raised by the opposition MLAs in the assembly to the government regarding the gold smuggling case, including those questions which have been raised during the tenure of the previous government, are still pending for being answered. The government either evades such questions without answering or gives an answer that the ‚Äúdetails are being collected‚Äù.

More than 10.23 million people in the state continue to be exposed to the catastrophic event. Latest analysis done by experts from Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) unfolds that the main hotspots of extreme flood events are the districts of Mumbai, Thane and Ratnagiri. ‚ÄúMumbai alone has witnessed a three-fold increase in the frequency of extreme flood events in the last 50 years. In the last decade, the districts of Raigad, Ratnagiri, Solapur and Satara also witnessed increased frequency of storm surges, often intensifying to cyclones,‚Äù the analysis stated. According to experts, climate-vulnerable states like Maharashtra need to accelerate the climate-proofing of critical infrastructure, industry and communities. ‚ÄúStates across eastern and western coasts are witnessing compounding impacts of climate risks and ecosystem damage,‚Äù said climate expert Abinash Mohanty. Mohanty, who is also the programme lead at CEEW, added, ‚ÄúRestoring natural ecosystems like mangroves, forests and wetlands can mitigate the microclimatic changes leading to increased dry spells and desertification, and act as shock-absorbers against other extreme events like floods and cyclones.‚Äù The analysis also highlights the vulnerability of Goa, which saw a four-fold increase in storm surges and cyclone events in the last 50 years. ‚ÄúWhile North Goa is more exposed to coastal flooding than South Goa, both parts are exposed to storm surges and cyclones. The frequency of storm surges and cyclones has been slightly higher in North Goa compared to South Goa in the last two decades,‚Äù it stated, adding that other cyclone-associated events including sea-level rise, heavy rainfall, thunderstorms have also increased six-fold in the state since 2005. On the mitigation measures that are the need of the hour, Mohanty said that states can protect livelihoods and infrastructure better by carrying out micro-level climate risk assessments. ‚ÄúThis can be done using a climate risk atlas and by issuing impact-based public warnings and setting up a unified emergency response framework to better tackle the compounded impacts of extreme climate events and aid recovery and reconstruction,‚Äù he added. TOI had reported the previous day that India is one of the five countries in the world exhibiting high increase in the population exposed to severe floods. Over 5,000 people have been killed and around 70 lakh displaced between 2003-2018 in the country due to the extreme weather event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/6-fold-rise-in-maha-extreme-floods-in-last-50-years-analysis/articleshow/85094340.cms||Manka Behl

The warrant had been issued by the Farrukhabad court in a case of alleged misappropriation of central grants for a trust Louise ran. It was issued against her and trust secretary Athar Farooqi. The order issued by the court of the chief judicial magistrate of Farrukhabad stated that as interim bail was granted to the accused in December 2019 and the matter is still pending before the high court, the implementation of NBW, issued by the court, is adjourned till further order. The court also directed immediate recall of the NBW order from the police station concerned. The case goes back to 2010. The Dr Zakir Husain Memorial Trust in Delhi, a government-funded organization which, among other things, also runs the Zakir Husain College, had received a grant of Rs 71.5 lakh from the Centre for distribution of wheelchairs and hearing aids among the disabled in 17 Uttar Pradesh districts, including Farrukhabad. Government officials‚Äô signatures were allegedly forged and fake seals used to show that distribution camps had been organized. A news channel claimed that the money meant for the disabled had never been used. Louise, a former Kaimganj MLA, filed a defamation suit against the channel in Delhi high court ‚Äî it was eventually settled in 2015 ‚Äî while the trust was issued a notice by the Allahabad high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/farrukhabad-court-recalls-nbw-against-cong-leader-salman-khurshids-wife/articleshow/85077853.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Delhi||Work on Delhi‚Äôs third Ring Road to start once green nod is in||NEW DELHI: After a decade-long delay, construction work might finally start on the Urban Extension Road (UER)-II project, to be Delhi‚Äôs third ring road. Work on two of the three six-lane sections of the project falling in Delhi has been awarded and only the go-ahead from the forest department is awaited. Planned by Delhi Development Authority, the third circular road promises to make travelling from the northern end of the capital to Indira Gandhi International Airport and southern areas a breeze. DDA handed over the project to National Highways Authority of India as it was felt that the NHAI was better equipped to handle a project of such a scale. Three ‚Äòpackages‚Äô of the project fall in Delhi, for which the contract for work on two ‚Äî from NH 1 to Karala-Kanjhawala Road and from Karala-Kanjhawala Road to Nangloi Najafgarh Road ‚Äî was awarded last week. ‚ÄúThe bids were invited in December 2019 for the three packages. Letter of award for two were issued last week,‚Äù an official said. ‚ÄúNow, forest department permission for tree felling for the project is required, after which work can start and a timeline can be finalised.‚Äù The official said that DDA has released funds for the city‚Äôs segments after the agency allocated Rs 100 crore for UER-II and other highway projects in its annual budget in February. The nearly 80-km road will start from NH1 near Narela, cross NH10 through Rohini and Dwarka, touch IGI Airport and NH8 near Rajokri and end at NH2 near Badarpur. While a 49-km section between NH1 to NH-8 and then Nelson Mandela Marg will be finished in Phase I, the UER will be extended 11km to Badarpur in Phase II. The Third Ring Road is part of the three UERs proposed in Master Plan for Delhi 2021. The major problem the project faced was land acquisition, particularly in Mundka, Najafgarh, Dichaon Kalan, Kanjhawla and some other places. DDA was also up against large-scale encroachment on land through which the road was to pass. It was earlier decided that DDA would hand over 125 acres along the road to NHAI, which the latter would be allowed to monetise and generate the necessary funding. It was later decided that the land parcel could be enlarged to 350 acres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/work-on-3rd-ring-road-to-start-once-green-nod-is-in/articleshow/85082409.cms||Sidharatha Roy

In reply to a point-of-order raised by Anoop Jacob MLA that on many occasions there were inordinate delay in receiving the answers, the speaker said that the completion of e-Niyamasabha would be a permanent solution to several of such issues being faced at present. He said that a meeting of the parliamentary party leaders that was convened on July 27 had discussed the matter regarding the delay in receiving the answers, but it was deferred for broader discussions. He said that the chair would hold discussions with the chief minister and the opposition leader and take a call in this regard. Jacob said that on several occasions, the answers get delayed by months or even years that the relevance of the question itself would be lost by the time the MLAs receive the answers. He said that questions asked under the RTI Act would be better answered than raised in the assembly, as the RTI Act has some penal provisions for delayed answers over a particular time frame. Subsequent governments have been skipping the answers on several important yet uneasy questions that may have answers that would be self-critical or by which the opposition are likely to nail the government over an issue. For example, questions raised by the opposition MLAs in the assembly to the government regarding the gold smuggling case, including those questions which have been raised during the tenure of the previous government, are still pending for being answered. The government either evades such questions without answering or gives an answer that the ‚Äúdetails are being collected‚Äù. Usually, questions are accepted by the legislature secretariat from the MLAs 10 days before the assembly session begins. These are then sent to the administrative departments concerned in the Secretariat which then are forwarded to the field departments for collecting the information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/assembly-to-consider-setting-up-ad-hoc-panel/articleshow/85080186.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Antilia bomb scare case: Court rejects Sachin Waze bail plea as ‚Äòmeritless‚Äô||MUMBAI: Rejecting dismissed police officer Sachin Waze‚Äôs plea for default bail in the case involving an explosives scare near industrialist Mukesh Ambani‚Äôs residence Antilia, a special NIA court on Thursday said that it ought to have imposed heavy costs on the former officer considering that such a meritless plea was submitted. It said that hearing such an application had wasted the precious time of the court. ‚ÄúHowever, considering that the applicant (Waze) is in custody, I have refrained from imposing such costs. But the aforesaid certainly should give message to the litigants who submit such meritless application only with a view to waste time in the court,‚Äù the court said. Special NIA judge D E Kothalikar granted the NIA an extension of 30 days to submit the chargesheet against the arrested accused in the case. The court rejected the plea of dismissed assistant police inspector (API) Riyazuddin Kazi. When a chargesheet is not submitted within the stipulated time and in the absence of an extension granted by the court, the accused has to be granted default bail. Making submissions via video-conferencing from Taloja jail, Waze had said on Wednesday that his detention in the absence of the chargesheet was a violation of his fundamental rights. He said in his submissions that since sections under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) were invoked only after his first remand in March, the 90-day limit to submit the chargesheet was applicable under the relevant Indian Penal Code sections mentioned in the initial FIR. He said that the total 180-day period under the UAPA was not applicable. He cited a 2001 Supreme Court order in a case where he was the investigating officer. Waze‚Äôs earlier plea for default bail was rejected by the court. Rejecting his plea again, the court said that the application was not maintainable. ‚ÄúThe law does not permit to consider the application of bail before the expiry of time (to submit the chargesheet) . There is no force in the application and it deserves to be rejected,‚Äù the court said. The court will hear the bail pleas of another accused police officer, Sunil Mane, on Tuesday. Last month, for the second time in the case, the NIA moved a plea seeking an extension of 30 days to submit the chargesheet. In June it was granted an additional 60 days to submit the chargesheet. The NIA‚Äôs first extension was to come to an end on Saturday. On Tuesday, seeking more time, special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves had said that the statements of over 150 witnesses were already recorded in the case. The prosecution had said that if extension was not granted the accused and others would slip out of the clutches of law and justice. It said the case had repercussions on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and security of the country. On February 25, a Scorpio with explosives stocked in it was found near Antilia. It is alleged that on March 4, Scorpio owner Mansukh Hiran was killed. The prosecution submitted that Hiran was the ‚Äúweak link‚Äù and was aware of the conspiracy. It was also submitted that had he been alive, the larger plot would have failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-rejects-waze-bail-plea-as-meritless/articleshow/85086278.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: JP Nadda tryst with ZP chiefs, seat incharges on Saturday||LUCKNOW: BJP organisational machinery is all set to move into top electoral motion even as the saffron outfit lines up the first direct interaction of each of 403 assembly seats in charge with party national president JP Nadda during his stay in Lucknow on Saturday. Nadda will also meet the newly elected 66 Zila Panchayat chairperson who won with the support of BJP, in what is seen as the party‚Äôs attempt to activate its grassroots cadre to take on a belligerent opposition. Both the meetings will be organised at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan. Nadda will then hold organisational meetings with state office-bearers in the party office, before heading to Agra where he will address a convention of Corona warriors and then meet party functionaries. While the meeting with the assembly in charge is likely to be kept away from media glare, sources said that Nadda is expected to take feedback about the prevailing political situation and performance of sitting MLAs. The feedback, sources said, will be crucial for the party in taking decisions pertaining to ticket distribution. The assembly in charge are senior party functionaries who are tasked by the party to keep a close vigil on the performance of legislators. In 2017, BJP had contested on 384 seats and managed to win 312 seats, securing 41.57% of the votes on the seats contested. BJP sources said that the feedback gathered by Naddda will help the party draft a detailed plan to set its organisational machinery into a full fledged poll mode. Experts interpret Nadda‚Äôs scheduled interaction with the Zila Panchayat chairperson as BJP‚Äôs attempt to bring the political spotlight back on the rural polls ahead of assembly polls early next year. Sources said that the BJP brass was in no mood to let the ‚Äúhistoric win‚Äù in the rural elections wane, while enabling it to counter opposition‚Äôs aggressive positioning. Significantly, while the ZP elections are not conducted on party symbols, the BJP went all out in giving its affiliation to the contesting candidates by announcing their names from its party‚Äôs official platform. Even as the BJP registered a landslide victory, the opposition upped the ante accusing the ruling party of resorting to foul play. In fact, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav went on to call BJP‚Äôs win a ‚Äúmockery of free and fair elections‚Äù and a ‚Äúdisgraceful face of power‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-tryst-with-zp-chiefs-seat-incharges-on-saturday/articleshow/85084641.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‚ÄòFirst jail, then prove marriage not by force?‚Äô||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday sought a response from the state government over a challenge to the recently enacted ‚Äòanti-love jihad‚Äô law, with the question that if somebody gets married, must he first go to jail and then satisfy the court that the inter-religion marriage and conversion was not by force or allurement. The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav put the question to the state government after petitions complained that the anti-conversion law, in the form of an amendment to the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, put the burden of proof on the person who administers the conversion to prove that the conversion was not without coercion, fraud or allurement. The petitioners, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and convenor of the Minority Coordination Committee Mujahid Nafees, have challenged the provisions added to the anti-conversion laws. They contended that the law renders the institution of marriage illegal and further criminalises it, whereas marriage is an inherently legal and most basic fundamental right guaranteed to every person. They have demanded the deletion of the amended Section 3, which prescribes ‚Äúconversion by marriage‚Äù as void and provides punishment for it. The petitioners argued that by inclusion of ‚Äúbetter lifestyle‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine blessings and displeasure‚Äù in the definition of allurement, the law renders all religious propagation criminal. This is against Article 25 of the Constitution. It has also been contended that this law will lead to a disproportionate consequences by terrorising interfaith couples and act as a deterrent, as any aggrieved person has the freedom to lodge a complaint. ‚ÄúThis can lead to grave misuse by the state and by favoured non-state actors. Besides, by its very term and object, the impugned Act, turns specific and targeted eyes of suspicions on Muslims and Islam, which is a recipe to engender suspicion, division and even hatred within Indian society,‚Äù the petition reads. The petitions further said that in the context of the discourse around love jihad, it is clear that the law is ‚Äúenacted with nothing but a communal objective and is thereby opposed to constitutional morality, and the basic features and fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 19, 21, 25, and 26 of the Constitution‚Äù. The petitioners‚Äô advocate argued that the law aims to criminalize marriage on vague terms like divine blessing and better lifestyle, which are not material objects. The state government requested the court to grant time to prepare a defence to the challenge. The court has posted further hearing on August 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/first-jail-then-prove-marriage-not-by-force/articleshow/85082629.cms||---

The exam will be conducted offline and the marks scored would be the only criteria for admissions to junior colleges. Experts said since the format of the exam is still very unclear students need to be thoroughly prepared with all topics in the syllabus. Director of IITians Prashikshan Kendra, Durgesh Mangeshkar, said aspirants must revise the key ideas from the chapters of SSC text books and pay special attention to the questions bank which the education department has said it shall publish for all subjects. ‚ÄúTaking a few mock tests will help students. Since there is no negative marking, they are advised to attempt all the questions regardless of whether they know the answer or not,‚Äù he said. Students targeting top junior colleges must prepare with reasonable levels of seriousness, he added. Principal and dean of Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed University) College of Engineering, Anand Bhalerao, said, ‚ÄúStudents should focus on the basics of subjects. If they are strong, any analytical question can be addressed. Time management in solving questions is necessary. Every day, a minimum of 3 to 4 hours study and practice to solve MCQs will prepare students better. An organised timetable, following a healthy lifestyle and self-motivation will help perform better.‚Äù Karishma Shah, who is preparing for the CET, said she has joined an online tutorial for preparation of the CET exam. ‚ÄúI started 45 days ago and am not used to the MCQ pattern of question papers.

According to a senior BJP leader, the ‚Äòpaathshala‚Äô is likely to be held at the state BJP headquarters in Lucknow on August 7. Sources said that this class was being kept confidential as it might trigger speculations around cabinet expansion or dropping of some of the ministers. Sources added that it was certain till now that no minister would be dropped. The party think tank believed that with elections only about eight months away, it was high time that the ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government were given tasks other than nursing their constituencies. ‚ÄúTime for feedback is over. Now, ministers should be given tasks to consolidate the party‚Äôs vote bank so that the BJP returns to power in the state. Ministers have been looking after their constituencies since they became ministers, but now they could also be asked to get involved in the election campaign,‚Äù a source added. Earlier, when national BJP organisation secretary BL Santhosh and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh visited Lucknow, they had taken feedback from party leaders and ministers.

Moyeen Ali Thangal, who is also a national vice-president of Muslim Youth League (MYL), said on Thursday that for the past 40 years all the financial transactions related to IUML had been carried out not by party treasurers but by Kunhalikutty himself and that the Thangal family does not have the tradition of dealing with funds. Ali made the remarks at a news conference convened by advocate Mohammed Sha, the state president of IUML-affiliated Kerala Lawyers Forum, at the League House. Sha also reiterated that the allegations of money laundering through the daily‚Äôs bank accounts were false. However, Ali said that it was Kunhalikutty who entrusted Sameer with the job of handling the financial matters of Chandrika daily and as such it was he who should provide answers to the questions. ‚ÄúIt is the inefficiency on the part of Sameer and overconfidence in him which has led to mismanagement in Chandrika,‚Äù Ali said. He added that the issues had caused much mental pain to Hyderali Thangal and it had also contributed to his current hospitalization. Referring to Kunhalikutty‚Äôs influence in the party, Ali said that what is going on is the organization getting focused on one individual and even people in the state committee are remaining silent fearing him. The news conference witnessed dramatic scenes after an IUML activist barged into the hall and hurled abuses at Ali for criticizing Kunhalikutty. Following the melee, the news conference was stopped midway. ED is probing into allegations of transactions of unaccounted money through the bank account of Chandrika daily. Hyderali Shihab Thangal has been summoned in his capacity as chairman and managing director of Muslim Printing and Publishing Co. Ltd, the publisher of Chandrika. The ED is probing the allegations of money laundering during the time of demonetisation through the bank account of the newspaper. It has been alleged by the petitioner Girish Babu G that a director of the newspaper had deposited Rs 10 crore in the bank account of the daily in Ernakulam and several crores of rupees were deposited in the account of the newspaper in the Kaloor branch of another bank. It was also alleged that the transactions were benami transactions of former PWD minister V K Ebrahim Kunju who was later arrested by the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau in connection with alleged graft in Palarivattom flyover case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/panakkad-thangals-son-lashes-out-at-kunhalikutty/articleshow/85080237.cms||---

---||Vadodara||SSG resident doctors go on strike||Vadodara: Residents doctors of the SSG Hospital (SSGH) went on a strike boycotting all work except emergencies. The doctors took the decision to press for their long pending demands. The resident doctors have been demanding implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission suggestions, appointments in their parent organisations during the bond period, considering senior residency towards the bond period and considering one day Covid-19 duty equivalent to two days of regular duty during the bond period. While other demands are raised by the junior doctors, it was the government that had promised considering one day of Covid work equivalent to two days of regular duty. President of the Junior Doctors‚Äô Association of the Baroda Medical College, Dr Akash Desah said that recently, the government had backtracked on this decision too. According to Desai, the resident doctors began the strike on Wednesday evening. They had informed the dean regarding this. Teachers of the college were assigned duties to ensure that normal functioning of the hospital is not affected. Desai said that the doctors would stay away from all duties including emergencies from Friday. If this happens, work may get affected drastically at the hospital. In-charge SSGH superintendent Dr R G Aiyer said that the srike would lead to a shortage of 450 doctors at the hospital. He added that to take care of the shortfall, medical officers had been sought for duty at the hospital from the health department. Aiyer said that teachers of non-clinical branches at the college will also be roped in for duty at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ssg-resident-doctors-go-on-strike/articleshow/85078176.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‚ÄòPaperwork perfect, constant phone use raised suspicions‚Äô||AHMEDABAD: The paperwork of Bindu Sharma was all in order and raised no red flags about her, but the day she landed in Ahmedabad, Ranjit Barva had his suspicions about her and even instructed his society‚Äôs guards not to allow Bindu to go out with his 11-month-old daughter. ‚ÄúAfter she arrived, she was constantly on the phone making video calls and talking and when I asked her why she was on the phone frequently. She told me she was talking to her daughters and the younger had some medical issues. Bindu, who came to work in May, even took Rs 5,000 apart from her salary saying she needed it for her daughter‚Äôs treatment. I never asked her to return the money,‚Äù said Barva. TimesViewThis attempted abduction should be an eye-opener for Amdavadis. Getting one‚Äôs domestic help registered at the local police station should be mandated by all residential societies. Police should ensure that once a citizen makes an application online or in-person, they cross-check the domestic worker‚Äôs credentials. Resident welfare associations may contact NGOs or organisations locally to help residents connect with individuals seeking work as domestic help whose credentials are verified, instead of going to unverified websites.‚ÄúHowever, we had doubts about Bindu and had asked her not to take the baby out of the house. We had also instructed our society security guards not to allow Bindu to leave the society with the baby,‚Äù he said, Barva said when he got the call from West Bengal police, his fear turned to be legitimate but he was lucky to find Bindu and his daughter still at his house. Barva said he contacted a home services agency based in Airoli, Navi Mumbai, through the internet and was put in touch with Bindu. ‚ÄúTo convince me about their services, the agency gave me several references in Mumbai and other places and when I spoke to these clients of the agency, I got good reviews. Finally, we made a contract online after interviewing Bindu. It was agreed that we would pay her Rs 18,500 a month.‚Äù The agency, in the contract, stated that no police verification was done. ‚ÄúBindu was hired and given a flight ticket to come to the city. I was given her Aadhaar card and several other documents to prove her identity. I have almost 100 pages of her documents,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/paperwork-perfect-constant-phone-use-raised-suspicions/articleshow/85082593.cms||---

He was speaking after sarpanchs and citizens from various panchayat areas and the municipal council of the Canacona taluka submitted a memorandum to him demanding that the word ‚Äòbhumiputra‚Äô be removed from the bill. The deputy speaker told reporters that Goan people who have been building houses on devalaya land, comunidade land or in forest areas over the past 40 years would now be protected by the law as many of these houses have been faced with demolition. ‚ÄúThere will be more than 500 such dwellings that mostly belong to Goans. However, I cannot deny the possibility of some others also benefiting from the bill,‚Äù he said. Panchayats that have supported the bill include Agonda, Loliem-Polem, Gaondongorim, Shristhal and Cotigao. When Fernandes was asked why insufficient time was given to the legislators before the bill was passed in the House, He said that despite being aware of the bill being presented, the opposition chose to walk out, thereby leading to the bill being passed without any discussion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-mla-over-500-bhumiputras-will-benefit/articleshow/85082535.cms||---

Mumbai division has the highest number of students with 2.63 lakh followed by the Pune division with 1.86 lakh students. However, the board said the numbers include students who have submitted their forms and also those with incomplete forms. As many as 10.98 lakh students have submitted completed forms out of which 2.55 lakh are from the Mumbai division and 1.82 lakh are from Pune, while 35,814 are from the other boards. No extension likely Dinkar Patil, chairman of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, said, ‚ÄúWe have given sufficient time to the students to fill up the forms. We will not be extending it, otherwise the admissions schedule will be affected. We will be allowing only those who have completely filled their forms and submitted them to attend the CET. We are not providing any question banks to students. We had declared that the exam will be held on August 21 but since the matter is sub judice, I don‚Äôt know whether there will be a delay or not. We want to conduct the exam in time so that students can get admission on time and the academic year can start.‚Äù Delays can be expected The Bombay HC has said that non-SSC boards can submit their own question banks to the state board. Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson of Maharashtra State Headmasters‚Äô Association, said, ‚ÄúThe next hearing is on August 6. The bench had given other boards a chance to give question sets to the state board. A compromise was suggested that apart from the four sets of question papers from (English, maths, science and social science) as suggested by the state board, three more sets be given by the other boards and the student will have an option to choose any four of the subjects, which would amount to a total of 100 marks. Since the exam is OMR sheet based, there should be time to print the papers and send to the exam centres. Hence, the possibility of a delay cannot be ruled out.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/of-10-98l-complete-forms-35k-from-other-boards/articleshow/85082512.cms||Ardhra Nair

V G Kulkarni, chief engineer of the PMC‚Äôs road department, said, ‚ÄúWe have asked our staff to launch a drive to fill all the potholes at Meethanagar and the interior parts of Kondhwa on Friday.‚ÄùAccording to local corporator Haji Gafur Pathan, there are over 1,000 potholes spread across nearly 200 interior roads in Kondhwa. ‚ÄúThese roads do not come under the development plan. PMC officials have inspected the roads where there are huge potholes, but no action has been taken till date,‚Äù said Pathan. The corporator also said he has filed several complaints, met with civic officials, and even launched a protest demanding better quality roads, but to no avail.Businessman Rajendra Babar said that while the civic body repairs roads in the suburbs of Kondhwa, they are dug up again for drainage work, laying stormwater lines and underground cable wires, and even illegal water connections. ‚ÄúInfrastructure work can be executed in a planned manner before the roads are constructed. The road department has no control over the activities of other civic departments and government bodies,‚Äù said Babar, who said compensation should be given to the victims of pothole-related accidents.Constant waterlogging due to the recent spells of rain has also damaged roads in Shivnerinagar and other areas, according to activist Tanaji Lonkar. ‚ÄúThe civic body delayed the cleaning of stormwater drains before the monsoon. Navigating bad roads also damages vehicles and causes health-related problems,‚Äù said Lonkar. Sameer Pathan, president of the Nagrik Adhikar Manch, faulted the civic body‚Äôs use of substandard material to repair Pargenagar and the NIBM-Kausarbaug link roads. ‚ÄúThe potholes were back again once heavy vehicles used the road. We have appealed to the PMC to use better quality material to repair the roads and prevent accidents,‚Äù he said.Former corporator Raees Sundke said the Meethanagar was damaged by heavy construction vehicles and rainfall. ‚ÄúI have requested the PMC road department to fill the potholes to prevent accidents,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/roads-riddled-with-potholes-in-kondhwa-put-people-at-risk/articleshow/85082586.cms||Asseem Shaikh

However, teachers have raised the question as to how outstation students would return within 10 days. A circular issued by registrar Vikas Gupta stated, ‚ÄúTaking note of the decline in the number of Covid-19 cases, it has been decided that classes and practical/project work of UG/PG students in science courses in the university and its colleges shall be conducted in physical mode with effect from August 16 observing necessary protocols to prevent the spread of the virus.‚Äù Online teaching-learning activities would continue for all other academic programmes based on the notified academic calendar. The university said all teaching and non-teaching staff should attend duties at their workplace with immediate effect. ‚ÄúThe principals of colleges and provost of hostels shall ensure strict adherence to all guidelines while providing accommodation to eligible outstation students in consultation with dean (students welfare) of the university,‚Äù said the circular. Rajeev Gupta, dean (students welfare), said, ‚ÄúThe circular is only for final-year students and it‚Äôs up to the head of the colleges to decide how they will call them.‚Äù However, Abha Dev Habib, physics teacher at Miranda House, said, ‚ÄúHow can classes for any stream be held in the physical mode? It‚Äôs easy to write that all protocols should be followed, but how will they be ensured? In both UG colleges and science departments, there is overcrowding in classrooms and labs. MSc physics department has more students than the number that can be actually accommodated.‚Äù Habib, who is also the treasurer of Delhi University Teachers‚Äô Association, added, ‚ÄúThe university has not cared to publish any report on how many students, teachers and karmacharis have been able to get themselves and their families vaccinated. The letter has been issued in complete disregard of students, teachers and karmacharis.‚Äù As part of the last Delhi Disaster Management Authority guidelines, educational institutions in Delhi are to remain closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-to-reopen-labs-for-final-year-science-students-teachers-object/articleshow/85082669.cms||---

Thackeray also said government was considering allowing the general public to travel on local trains but would assess the pros and cons before taking a decision. He said public health is the biggest priority. "We are reviewing the situation. We are considering allowing the general people on local trains. Every decision is being taken responsibly and in the interest of the public," said Thackeray during the inauguration of BMC's H-West ward office building. Officials said the state was holding talks with railways to consider opening up suburban services for the lay public. Proposals like allowing those fully vaccinated to board trains or permitting women commuters during certain hours or the general public in non-peak hours are all under consideration. "A decision may be taken soon," said a senior official. Thackeray said while cases in parts of the state were dipping, some districts required a more cautious approach. "Relaxations have been given where we could; wherever we couldn't, we had no option. But if relaxations were not given this time, it doesn't mean those businesses will be shut forever. Traders and people should be patient," said Thackeray The government has allowed extended timings for shops, parks and allowed malls to re-open in many districts, but restaurant hours have not been extended. Theatres and multiplexes have not been allowed to re-open too. What‚Äôs more, the relaxations have been confined to 25 districts while 11 others, including Pune, where Covid indicators are higher than the state's average remain under a tighter lockdown. Thackeray singled out the BMC for praise for its effort in curbing the spread of the virus.

---||Delhi||E-book that brings back into focus 475 forgotten heritage sites in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Thousands go past the bastion of the city wall that runs parallel to the road going to Ansari Road opposite Ambedkar Stadium and on to Daryaganj. Not many know that it is a heritage structure. There is also Ansari House in the same locality, the residence of Dr Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, one of the founders of Jamia Millia Islamia. Many may have wondered about the identity of the man after whom Ansari Road is named. Such sites marking the city‚Äôs history are not known to all. South Delhi Municipal Corporation has now taken steps to unveil these for the general population. On Thursday, the civic body launched its first e-book, Glorious Heritage, which details the importance of 475 heritage sites. The e-book can be accessed on SDMC‚Äôs website at https://heritage.mcdservices.online/book.html. It contains details of locations of structures, time of their construction, year of notification of these sites for preservation and their histories. To help people visit such places, information on the nearest metro stations have also been provided in the book. The first volume has pictures and information related to 108 heritage sites, of which 45 are in the Daryaganj ward. ‚ÄúTwo more volumes are being drafted and these will discuss the remaining heritage sites,‚Äù mayor Mukesh Suryan, who added that SDMC created a Heritage Conservation Cell and identified historic sites under its jurisdiction for conservation and protection. Launching the book through video conferencing on Thursday, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal said, ‚ÄúThrough this book, people, especially the younger generation, will learn about historical monuments, medieval buildings and memorials. The civic body has been conserving heritage sites despite its limited financial resources.‚Äù Baijal advised SDMC to work in association with external agencies on a public-private-partnership mode to carry forward the conservation programme. The oldest site considered in the book is Anangtal Baoli in Mehrauli, which was mentioned by Budh Sridhar in 1132 AD, and the newest is the Daryaganj police station constructed in 1930. Among the 475 heritage buildings listed by the civic body are 16 enemy properties. Many of them are over 100 years old and some require permission from the Heritage Conservation Committee for repairs/restoration, particularly those in the Grade 2 category, said officials. These were notified by Delhi Government and fall under the unified building bylaws. Commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that apart from providing civic services, SDMC was also working in fields like heritage to make citizens aware about their city and to safeguard cultural legacy. Last week, SDMC also introduced a proposal in the standing committee for the maintenance and operation of its selected notified heritage buildings through a partnership with private players. On a pilot basis, it plans to lease an old SDMC building in Mehrauli for a period of 20 years and to receive a monthly licensing fee of Rs 3 lakh for it. The building, constructed in 1910-12, was once used by the municipal corporation‚Äôs tax department and has been lying vacant for decades after the office shifted to RK Puram, disclosed officials. There is a proposal to call an e-tender to finalise a private player who will repair the complex and carry out permitted commercial activities there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-book-that-brings-back-into-focus-475-forgotten-heritage-sites/articleshow/85082576.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad-based company MD held in Rs 1,700-crore fraud case||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate on Thursday arrested Vuppalapati Hima Bindu, managing director of Hyderabad-based VMC Systems Limited, in connection with the Rs 1,700-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case. The ED booked Hima Bindu and two other directors of VMC Systems for duping PNB under Prevention of Money Laundering Act. ED officials said: ‚ÄúWe have established laundering of money with evidence during the investigation. However, the directors of the company are not cooperating and refusing to submit documents relating to the company.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have arrested Hima Bindu and are on the lookout for two other directors,‚Äù said ED officials. Company‚Äôs two directors ‚Äî Vuppalapati Venkat Rama Rao and Bhagavatula Venkat Ramana ‚Äî have applied for an anticipatory bail, while Hima Bindu will be produced in court. VMC Systems is a telecom equipment manufacturing company. The arrest of Hima Bindu comes three years after the CBI filed a case. In September 2018, the CBI registered an FIR against the company and Hima Bindu, Rama Rao and Ramana and charged them with criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery. VMC Systems owed dues of Rs 539 crore to PNB and Rs 1,207 crore to Corporation Bank, State Bank of India, Andhra Bank and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company. In its complaint, the PNB alleged that VMC Systems defaulted on repayment of Rs 1,700 crore loans to the consortium of banks. VMC Systems was incorporated in February 1997 with an authorised share capital of Rs 65 crore and a paid-up capital of Rs 50 crore. In 2018, when the CBI booked an FIR, the company claimed that it had pending dues of Rs 262 crore from BNSL, but it was found that the dues were only Rs 33 crore. The company had shown receivables from other private companies, but they were found to be false when the bankers verified. The total loss to a consortium of public sector banks as per present dues outstanding is estimated to be Rs 3,316 crore. Forensic audit has revealed that VMC circulated loans to various related entities to inflate its books. The audit also revealed that PISL, a related entity, was given 3% commission by VM for all receipts from BSNL, without PISL having any specific role in the state-run telcom‚Äôs tenders. It was also found that VMC had opened various letters of credit (LCs) worth Rs 692 crore in the name of fake/dummy entities, which were subsequently devolved. V Hima Bindu, through her company VMC, and with the active assistance of her brother V Satish, the MD of PISL, created false/exaggerated operational revenues by generating fake sales/purchase invoices through companies controlled by their directors/family members to dodge the banks. V Hima Bindu siphoned off a part of proceeds of crime by remitting it to overseas entities controlled by her family members. Earlier, on July 20, searches were conducted by ED at the residential premises of V Hima Bindu, V Satish and V Madhavi and huge amount of incriminating documents and digital data in form of 40 external hard discs, six cellphones and two laptops were recovered. The prime accused was not responding to the ED summons, not supplying the documents of her companies and transactions on one or the other pretext, and blatantly lying about the foreign transactions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-co-md-held-in-rs-1700-cr-fraud-case/articleshow/85084769.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: SP invoking Janeshwar Mishra to woo Brahmins, says Mayawati||LUCKNOW: BSP supremo Mayawati paid her heartfelt tributes to socialist leader Janeshwar Mishra on his birth anniversary on Thursday and used the opportunity to slam Samajwadi Party, accusing it of only renaming the park started by BSP government during her tenure as chief minister that was to be named after Dr BR Ambedkar. She said Samajwadi Party is now suddenly invoking Mishra‚Äôs name and legacy since he was a Brahmin and SP leaders are rattled by the ‚Äúresounding success‚Äù of BSP‚Äôs ongoing Prabuddha Sammelans. ‚ÄúThe park in Lucknow, which is named after Janeshwar Mishra, had been constructed by BSP in the memory of Dr BR Ambedkar. The SP government only changed its name, just like it renamed new districts, revealing its casteist mindset and biases. Did this renaming of park really bestow any honour on Mishra,‚Äù asked Mayawati. The BSP chief further accused Samajwadi Party of indulging in theatrics in Mishra‚Äôs name as SP leaders took out cycle rallies across the state on Thursday to mark his birth anniversary and kicked off party‚Äôs campaign for the 2022 assembly polls. ‚ÄúSP has been rattled by BSP‚Äôs Prabuddha Sammelans. Seeing the success of these meetings, SP has now started remembering Mishra and the Brahmin community who have been harassed by BJP. If this is not for political self-interest and aimed at cheap publicity, what is?‚Äù she said. On Wednesday, Mayawati had levelled similar charges against BJP, saying it was unsettled by her party‚Äôs programme to reach out to the Brahmin community to such an extent that the state government had started harassing her party workers. The local administration had filed FIR against some BSP workers after a meeting in Kasganj for violating Covid norms. BSP‚Äôs Prabuddha Sammelan are being led by party MP SC Mishra and the first phase of this social engineering programme will continue till August 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-sp-invoking-janeshwar-mishra-to-woo-brahmins/articleshow/85084751.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Delhi||Foreign investment case: Is custody of portal chief needed, asks Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court asked the city police why it needed custodial interrogation of Newsclick editor-in-chief Prabir Purkayastha in the foreign investment case after the Reserve Bank of India had prima facie cleared him of violating funding laws. ‚ÄúPrima facie, there is no delay, etc, (as per RBI). In that case, why do you need his custodial interrogation?‚Äù Justice Yogesh Khanna asked on Thursday while hearing Purkayastha‚Äôs anticipatory bail application. It extended the interim protection from arrest granted to him till December 17. The investigating officer, present in court via video conferencing, responded that he was ‚Äústill verifying other transactions‚Äù. The allegations in the FIR, registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police, are that PPK Newsclick Studio Pvt Ltd received foreign direct investment of Rs 9.6 crore from Worldwide Media Holdings LLC, USA, in 2018-19 in violation of the laws. The court also extended the interim protection granted to Newsclick director Pranjal Pandey. Police submitted that letters rogatory had been sent to certain institutions abroad and their replies were awaited. Other individuals were also being interrogated. The court sought a final reply from police and posted the matter for the next hearing in December. Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, representing Purkayastha, urged the court to confirm the interim protection granted to his client on the ground that as per police status report, RBI, which is the body concerned, had taken a stand that there ‚Äúwas no delay in the issuance of shares‚Äù and the transaction pertaining to the foreign funding were in compliance with the law. The FIR claims the investment was made by greatly overvaluing the shares of the company to avoid the cap of 26% on FDI in a digital news website, being thus in violation of FDI and other laws. Police further alleged that over 45% of this investment was diverted/siphoned off for payment of salary/consultancy fees, rent and other expenses, all done with an ulterior motive. On July 7, the court had granted interim protection from arrest to Purkayastha and Pandey while directing them to join the investigation. On June 21, the high court had directed the Enforcement Directorate not to take coercive action against the news portal and its editor-in-chief in connection with the money laundering case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/is-custody-of-portal-chief-needed-asks-hc/articleshow/85082600.cms||---

According to the sources and high court website, as many as 18,000 contempt cases have been filed against heads of various government departments in the past few years, including 300 cases against Kumar. Interestingly, over 50 cases were registered against Kumar when he headed the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation between 2014-15. He is also in-charge principal secretary of revenue, commercial taxes and excise departments and chief commissioner of land administration. Sources said that among those against whom the highest number of cases were filed were officers from revenue, municipal administration and irrigation departments, GHMC and district collectors. For instance, current GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar has over 500 cases, including 53 new contempt cases, filed against him. He said there have been instances when officers did not implement the court orders by succumbing to the pressures from politicians and superior officers. ‚ÄúWhy should such a situation arise where officers or bureaucrats have to appear before the courts in contempt cases, plead guilty and cases are dropped against them,‚Äù he wondered. K Sunil Goud, vice-chairman of Bar Council of Telangana, said the judiciary has become pro-active ‚Äî in protecting the rights of people and delivering justice to them. ‚ÄúEven now, the courts are sympathetic towards the administration considering its own issues in implementing the orders in some cases,‚Äù he said. While admitting that there were lapses on the part of the government in implementing the court orders, a senior IAS officer said: ‚ÄúA majority of them are not personal or individual cases and government is made a party by the courts. Some cases might have been filed prior to a certain officer‚Äôs posting. Unless it comes to his or her notice, it is humanly not possible to track all the cases and fall in line with the court orders,‚Äù he said. Former bureaucrat and Lok Satta founder Jayaprakash Nayaran said coordination problems were galore in the government. ‚ÄúThe left hand doesn‚Äôt know what the right hand is doing.

While launching the policy on August 7, 2020, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the EV Policy is one of the most progressive in the world and will make Delhi a world leader in the field of electric vehicles. To mark one year of its implementation, Delhi government organised a discussion between stakeholders from the EV ecosystem at the second meeting of the Delhi EV Forum on Friday, which saw participation from more than 140 representatives from auto, charging and fleet sectors, civil society organisations and experts. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot, power minister Satyendar Jain and Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson, dialogue and development commission of Delhi were also present. The transport minister said that the capital now has 1,12,321 electric vehicles and the adoption of EVs in the city has increased despite the battle with the Covid-19 pandemic. He also said that Delhi government will soon sign an MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Limited to set up public charging infrastructure on all DTC properties. As per figures shared by the government, the number of electric two-wheelers has gone up from 1,013 in August 2019-July 2020 to 2,243 in August 2020-July 2021 and the number of electric cars from 813 to 1,002 during the same period. ‚ÄúThe execution of the policy has been systematic, including the rollout of financial incentives and a city-wide campaign on spreading awareness called Switch Delhi,‚Äù Gahlot said. Jain said that if there is a technology, which can automatically charge EV‚Äôs at a favourable time of the day depending on the tariff structure, it will act as a new source of revenue to consumers, who would be willing to switch to EVs with the option. ‚ÄúThe Delhi Electric Vehicle Forum is an exercise in collaborative policy implementation and provides a much-needed platform for the entire community that is committed to deploying electric vehicles at scale in the capital,‚Äù Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/year-after-policy-e-vehicles-comprise-3-3-of-city-fleet/articleshow/85116118.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Jaipur||Mobiles worth Rs 50 lakh stolen from showroom in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Mobile phones worth over Rs 50 lakh were stolen from a newly opened showroom near Govind Marg in Vaishali Nagar on Thursday. The midnight theft left the city police in a quandary because the showroom‚Äôs shutter and glass doors were completely intact with no signs of tampering. ‚ÄúThe accused fled with 93 mobile phones of different models, they took away a digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTVs to erase evidence,‚Äù said SHO, Vaishali Nagar, Anil Kumar Jaiman. The accused also took away Rs 8 lakh in cash from a drawer of the showroom. The owner, Nitin Rela, a resident of Mansarover, told TOI that he had arrived at the showroom on Thursday morning. The staff rolled up the shutter, only to find empty cartons and mobile boxes strewn around all over the floor. The accused also broken into the storeroom where many freshly arrived mobile phones were kept in different boxes. Interestingly, the gate of the storeroom was designed in a way to make it appear as part of the showroom‚Äôs walls. Therefore, it was difficult for any outsider to easily find the way to the room. The accused had broken into the showroom in a very mysterious manner. The entry gates including the iron shutter and a glass door did not have anything to suggest that the accused had tried to uproot them, how the accused entered the place remains a mystery even to the cops. The police asked the owners to give the list of all the employees that worked at the showroom, which opened about a month ago. While the police have not ruled out the possibility of the staff as yet, the daring theft has footprints of a more skilled gang. ‚ÄúThe way in which the accused had slipped into the mobile showroom is bewildering. It only suggests that the gang had a prior experience of sneaking into shops without leaving much evidence behind them,‚Äù an official told TOI. The place where the incident took place is located on one of the busiest spots of the shopping area which divides the jurisdiction areas of Vaishali Nagar and Chitrakoot police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mobiles-worth-rs-50l-stolen-from-showroom-in-jaipur/articleshow/85084821.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Don‚Äôt seek govt nod for religious place against TP provisions: HC||Ahmedabad: In an important order, the Gujarat high court observed that no person or religious sect should request the state government for permission to construct a religious structure in the name of ‚Äòright to worship‚Äô or ‚Äòright to religion‚Äô. The court also said that such permission must not be sought in violation of the Town Planning Act, so as to make the authorities to use their special powers under the law, which otherwise is exercised strictly in the public interest. The HC asked the state government to frame appropriate guidelines or regulations for exercising powers under Section 29 of the TP Act for granting such permission. The court‚Äôs observations came in response to a PIL taking exception to special permission granted by the state government and AMC for construction of a Jain derasar by Ratnatrayi Aradhana Bhavan Trust in Vasantkunj Cooperative Housing Society on a plot earmarked for residential purposes. The dispute first reached the HC in 2010 and the court said that a religious building cannot be constructed on a plot where a residential building was permitted. The court said that such construction is permitted only after the requirements are satisfied with regard to construction norms. The trust was declined permission by the AMC, but it approached the state government and obtained permission as a special case. The permission for construction was granted even after the requirements under GDCR were not adhered to. The state government and AMC told the HC that except this special permission, they would not have permitted the trust to construct the religious place. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I J Vora said, ‚ÄúIn fact, it could be said that the state government has ignored all the orders passed by this high court over a period of time in various litigations relating to the present subject matter.‚Äù The judges further said, ‚ÄúWe fail to understand what is so special that the government thought it fit to consider it as a special case, against all odds and by relaxing and giving the go-by to the CGDCR, 2017, accorded permission to put up a derasar.‚Äù The court also said that the government did not give any explanation as to why it was treated as a special case. After criticising the state government‚Äôs indulgence, the HC, however, refused to order the demolition of the derasar as demanded by the petitioner. ‚ÄúIt is not in dispute that the construction of the derasar has been completed. At this point of time, we do not want to go to the extent of telling the authority concerned to pull down the entire structure,‚Äù the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dont-seek-govt-nod-for-religious-place-against-tp-provisions-hc/articleshow/85082748.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Hosps refunded Rs22L, but Covid bills worth crores still pending: VHA||Nagpur: After social workers and politicians raised issue of overcharging patients during the Covid-19 second wave, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had penalized some private hospitals who eventually refunded the excessive bill amount. Now, according to Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), hundreds of hospitals are yet to receive payment from patients who defaulted on Covid treatment bills and the amount runs into crores. Dr Ashok Arbat, chairman of the Vidarbha Hospital Association, said that of the more than 140 Covid hospitals, only six have till date submitted details of pending dues and the amount is Rs2 crore. ‚ÄúIt means the comprehensive figure is going to be astonishingly high,‚Äù he said. VHA, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Nagpur branch and the NMC representatives have formed a committee to deal with the excessive billing issue. More than 50% of the 614 excessive bill complaints lodged with the NMC were found improper. The civic body has disregarded these complaints while 25 complainants have withdrawn their plea. According to VHA convener Dr Anup Marar, till date, 69 hospitals in the city have refunded Rs22 lakh to the patients. ‚ÄúBut who will take responsibility for clearing outstanding bills of hospitals from defaulter patients?‚Äù he said.He demanded that the defaulters should be individually called to settle the payment compeletely under the same laws that were applied to hospitals. Dr Sanjay Deotale, president of Nagpur IMA, said that many hospitals were pressurised to forgo balance amount. ‚ÄúMany received only minimal payment as authorities had warned us not to seek full advance at the time of admission. At the time of discharge or death of a patient, the so-called social workers and politicians would pressurize us to reduce or waive off the bill amount. We received no help from NMC or any authorities during that time,‚Äù he said. Nagpur IMA secretary Dr Sachin Gathe and VHA secretary Dr Alok Umre said that since authorities had taken proactive steps to address complaints of excessive bills, they should similarly address the issue of non-payments to hospitals. ‚ÄúNMC should be impartial and render justice to both parties,‚Äù said Dr Gathe. What pvt hospitals claim- Excessive bill complaints issue was highlighted a lot during Covid-19- Of the 614 complaints received, NMC has already disregarded 386 - 25 complaints withdrawn by complaints - NMC had directed 136 hospitals to refund excess bill amount - 69 hospitals refunded around Rs22 lakh - 67 hospitals in process of refunding, committee getting it finalized - More than 140 Covid hospitals are yet to get payment for pending bills - Of them, pending dues of only six come to around Rs2 crore- The outstanding amount may be quite high||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hosps-refunded-rs22l-but-covid-bills-worth-crores-still-pending-vha/articleshow/85080296.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

It took more than an hour for six fire tenders from different stations and personnel from NMC‚Äôs fire and emergency services to douse the flames. According to chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake, the reason behind the fire is not known yet. ‚ÄúNobody was injured in the incident,‚Äù he said. None of the police personnel was present at the spot though Nagpur city police crime branch office too is locate near it.The chief fire officer further said that petrol and chemicals apart from parts of vehicles acted as fuel. The fire spread quickly as all the shops were set up in temporary sheds.He said that the shops that were gutted included Rathore Automobile, New Nagpur Garage, Janata Garage, Hemant Cushion Works, Gajanan Welding Works, Gulzar Auto works, Vyas Auto Electric and Yuvraj Cushion Works. ‚ÄúOffice of advocate Jitendra Rathore and part of residence of one Akshaylal Pande were also caught up in flames,‚Äù said Uchake. Air compressors and cylinders at many workshops too were exploded in the fire. According to Kachipura residents, the NMC‚Äôs fire department responded almost an hour late after the fire broke out at around 1.30am at Gajanan welding Works. Within minutes, the fire engulfed adjacent garages.The fire department claimed to have received the call at around 2.28am. According to a garage owner, the fire was first spotted by a passer-by who informed the police control room. But it took almost an hour for the fire brigade to respond, the garage owners said. ‚ÄúHad they acted swiftly, at least four automobile workshops and my office could have been saved,‚Äù said Rathore.Rathore told TOI that he stays behind his office in Kachipura. ‚ÄúAfter being alerted I came to the spot at around 2am, when the fire was restricted to three garages. Due to the thick smoke, I could not enter my office and soon the fire engulfed it too. I helplessly saw my office turning into ashes,‚Äù said Rathore, who practices in district court and high court. Most of the garage owners expressed suspicion over the cause of fire and ruled out short-circuit in any of the workshops as a possible reason. ‚ÄúWe have made it a practice to switch off the main power whenever we close the garage,‚Äù said Mustaq Ahmed, owner of New Nagpur Garage. Now, the garage owners are worried as the entire place has been destroyed. Most of them claimed that they had recently stocked up their workshops with spare parts worth lakhs. ‚ÄúWe will also have to bear the loss of vehicles that were with us for repair works,‚Äù said Yuvraj Ingale of Yuvraj Cushion Works.For security reasons, most of the Kachipura slum dwellers switched off all the domestic gas cylinders and kept them outside their homes. ‚ÄúOur entire family came out on streets carrying most of our important documents and other articles in case the fire spreads to the slums,‚Äù said Urmila Singh Rathore, one of the slum dwellers.According to eyewitnesses, a major tragedy was averted as Kachipura is considered as one of the city‚Äôs biggest slums with a population of over 5,000 and the dwellings there are very congested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fire-in-the-dark-8-garages-pvt-office-destroyed-in-flames/articleshow/85080338.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||Delhi man smuggling liquor via Asola sanctuary held||NEW DELHI: Officials of the forest and wildlife department on Thursday morning arrested a liquor smuggler with country-made liquor that was being transported from Haryana to Sangam Vihar. Two men had been arrested in a similar manner on Tuesday as well. Forest officials claim liquor smugglers have been breaking down the boundary walls of the Asola Bhatti sanctuary to enter from the Haryana side in the early hours. On Thursday, forest officials patrolling the sanctuary said they spotted a man at around 12 pm with three boxes of a country-made liquor as well as 17 bottles of another local brand of liquor. The man was found to be a resident of Sangam Vihar. He was unable to produce any valid documents for carrying such large quantities of liquor. ‚ÄúThere were over 100 bottles and the man was not able to produce a document, or tell us where he had purchased the liquor from,‚Äù said a range officer in the south forest division. The man was taken into custody and the bottles were seized under Section 50 (C) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the officer added. On Tuesday morning, forest officials had caught two men with 11 boxes containing a total of 620 liquor bottles, along with a two-wheeler, which was being used to move in the eco-sensitive zone. ‚ÄúA trap had been laid at around 4 am, as these smugglers have attempted the same in the past as well. In two previous attempts, they fled, leaving bottles behind. They generally bring liquor over to Delhi at around 4-5 am, when it is still dark,‚Äù said a forest official. ‚ÄúThe accused persons have been taken into custody and will be produced before the court,‚Äù said Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forest, south division. Forest officials said it suspected the illicit liquor was arriving into Delhi from Haryana‚Äôs Sarangpur village, which is located near the sanctuary. The movement of the smugglers disturbs wildlife and affects the ecology of the sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-smuggling-liquor-via-asola-sanctuary-held/articleshow/85082754.cms||---

On August 3, the Supreme Court restored the PIL with the HC for a hearing before admission. The SC also set aside an HC order directing Shinde to deposit 1% (Rs3.9 crore) of the project cost to establish his bona fides and let the bench hear the matter. Shinde had moved the apex court against this order. Shinde has challenged project on the grounds that Pune Municipal Corporation has failed to prepare, publish or send a draft development plan for the 11 merged villages to the government for sanction, as per the MRTP Act, despite declaring its intent to prepare the draft DP three years ago. ‚ÄúThe e-tender notice issued for laying sewer networks and STP plants in the absence of a draft DP is contrary to the principles of planned development and would not only cause developmental hazards, but also financial losses. Even sewer plans drawn by the project consultant are made merely based on Google Maps, without conducting on-field surveys,‚Äù Shinde stated. He stated the e-tender notice was contrary to government policies regarding land acquisition, payment of mobility advance, demarcation of flood lines and PMC‚Äôs own internal guidelines for fair tendering. He claimed that the clauses in the e-tender notice were tailormade to erase competition and ultimately aid bid-rigging, thereby escalating the cost of the tender. Finally, he said, the PMC did not seek the general body‚Äôs approval before incurring the expenditure regarding the project. ‚ÄúThe petitioners must now furnish the SC order before the HC, which will issue notices to the respondents and fix a date for hearing before admission of the PIL,‚Äù lawyer Abhijit Kulkarni, representing PMC, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hc-to-hear-corporators-plea-against-stp-project/articleshow/85080383.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Mumbai||Row as tetrapods are dumped by Bandra Bandstand without study||MUMBAI: Questions are being raised after concrete tetrapods, left over from the coastal road-building at Haji Ali, were dumped into the sea along the Bandra Bandstand promenade without waiting for a report on erosion of the coast from the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS), Khadakvasla. In fact, the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) issued the permission to shift the tetrapods two days before a planned site visit of the CWPRS. The site visit came on March 5, two days after the Mumbai Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) had given MMB the go-ahead. TimesViewIt is intriguing that the state maritime board neither waited for a report from the Central Water and Power Research Station nor conducted a deep-sea study before dumping the tetrapods at Bandra Bandstand. Government engineers appear to have only two solutions for all ills ‚Äî concrete and construction. They need to work with nature to create a liveable environment.‚ÄúTechnical guidance has been sought from CWPRS regarding relocation of the tetrapods. Meanwhile, it has been understood that MCZMA had given the permission (March 2) for relocating the tetrapods from coastal road project to Bandstand,‚Äù the CWPRS report said, mentioning a 2019 site visit when the tetrapod plan was not in the offing. P K Das, architect and town planner who had developed the Bandra Bandstand promenade as a public space, said the Bandra coast is dotted with black basalt rock that forms a natural barrier against which the waves crash. ‚ÄúThe tetrapods have been dumped into the sea at Bandra without conducting any deep sea study to understand if there is any erosion of the coast. How can you live near the coast and say the sea must not spray the shore?‚Äù he asked. The MMB also defended its action, saying it had obtained permission from the Bandra Bandstand Residents Trust as well before dumping the tetrapods in the sea. This ‚Äúpermission‚Äù to protect the compound wall and the garden has not only outraged local residents, but split the trust that maintains the promenade. The trust letter is not signed by any office bearers, but by three trustees who oversee the daily maintenance of the promenade. Criticised for allowing the dumping, trust chairman Robin Nath recently quit. ‚ÄúThe tetrapods are an eyesore no doubt but it was done in good faith by the trustees. We are senior citizens and it is not easy to maintain the promenade,‚Äù said Rusi Jabulee, trust secretary, adding that there was no strong opposition in their meetings. Benedict Soares, who maintains the promenade for the trust, said the MMB approached them saying it had MCZMA permission. ‚ÄúThe sea annually destroys the garden and the tiles along the promenade, so we allowed it. Why does no one protest the increasing slums along this coast or the fact that rocks were put near Chimbai village a few years ago to prevent erosion?‚Äù he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-row-as-tetrapods-are-dumped-by-bandra-bandstand-without-study/articleshow/85082742.cms||Clara Lewis

Speaking at a virtual programme, Yogi said that this scheme had benefited 15 crore people in UP. In UP, we started food distribution under the scheme in April 2020 and continued till November 2020.

---||India||No scientific reason to believe 3rd Covid wave will hit kids: Experts||LUCKNOW: In what would bring a relief to parents, experts say that there is no biological reason that the third Covid wave will affect children. It was hypothetical to say so. Speaking at the webinar organised as part of the Times Group's Protect UP - My Mask My Jab campaign, experts came together to address issues related to Covid-19 pandemic, its prevention and management. Times Group had joined hands with the Uttar Pradesh government for the campaign, which began in June. In the webinar titled 'Covid-19 Third Wave: Prevention and Preparedness Matters', president-elect of International Paediatric Association Dr Naveen Thakker said, "There is no biological reason that the third wave would affect children. It is never the children who pass on the infection to the adult, it is always the other way round." He stressed that children are definitely at the receiving end of the pandemic but that is because routine immunisation is affected, school is being missed and pressure is on mental health. There is no need to panic for parents, he said. "Infection is not severe in children and they are mostly asymptomatic," he added. Besides Covid-appropriate behaviour, there is a need to tell people that ensuring proper ventilation is equally important. "One of the foremost things that we need to tell people is that vaccination reduces the risk of infection manifold. A person who has been vaccinated may get the infection but it would not be severe," said professor Rajesh Ranjan from IIT-Kanpur. Ranjan's team at IIT-K, which had done research to predict the second wave, said, "We should not say that the third wave will not come. The US, UK, Japan, and Russia have had many peaks so far. This virus is weird." On suggestions to tackle the third wave, he said that people aged 18 to 59 years are more at risk and need to be vaccinated. "Our research showed that 40% among those above 60 years of age had developed herd immunity while those aged 18 to 59 had 25% herd immunity," he said. "If we assume that at least 30% have developed immunity by now in the state, the third wave could be predicted around October," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-scientific-reason-to-believe-3rd-covid-wave-will-hit-kids-experts/articleshow/85087540.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Lucknow||Arson accused Babloo inducted in BJP to keep Thakurs happy?||Lucknow: The induction of former BSP MLA Jitendra Singh Babloo ‚Äî key accused in arson and torching of the house of then UP Congress Committee chief, now BJP MP, Rita Bahuguna Joshi ‚Äî into BJP has trained the spotlight on the saffron party‚Äôs outreach to Thakur community which accounts for 7% of the voting population in UP. The development gained political significance in the backdrop of the Opposition, primarily SP and BSP, positioning themselves as benefactors of Brahmins. Party sources said, Jitendra‚Äôs induction should be attributed to his influence in Ayodhya, the nerve centre of Hindutva politics. As a matter of fact, BJP suffered losses in Ayodhya during zila panchayat member elections recently. Jitendra‚Äôs induction into the saffron political outfit coincided with BSP chief Mayawati‚Äôs charge that BJP was rattled by her party‚Äôs statewide Brahmin conventions. While BSP supremo has been reaching out to Brahmins through her confidante and party MP Satish Chandra Mishra, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav organised a cycle yatra on Thursday to coincide with the birth anniversary of party stalwart Janeshwar Mishra, a Brahmin. Akhilesh had earlier whipped out the Brahmin card by announcing installation of Parshuram statues in all districts. In contrast, experts said, BJP has been treading a cautious path by not going overtly to consolidate the Brahmin community, which accounts for 13% of the voting population and has traditionally been voting for BJP. Jitendra‚Äôs induction, nevertheless, has not gone down well with the grassroots cadre, who perceive it as a move to arm the opposition and put BJP in a tight spot vis-a-vis Brahmin consolidation. Rita Bahuguna Joshi, whose house was set ablaze by Jitendra, is a Brahmin. The opposition has already been accusing the BJP regime as anti-Brahmin. While Joshi has demanded terminating membership of Jitendra Singh, highly placed sources in BJP told TOI that the latter has been hobnobbing with the saffron party since 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He was, however, not taken into the party as Joshi was contesting Lok Sabha elections as a candidate from Allahabad. A senior BJP leader confirmed Jitendra‚Äôs induction was again put off a year ago given his criminal antecedents. As per the affidavit submitted to the Election Commission in 2017 assembly polls, Babloo faces 60 criminal charges, including attempt to murder, rioting, kidnapping, theft, robbery, dacoity and breach of peace. Babloo was elected as BSP MLA from Bikapur in Ayodhya in 2007 assembly elections, which saw Mayawati forming the government with an absolute majority for the first time after effecting a social engineering formula amalgamating dalits with upper castes. He had then defeated SP‚Äôs Sita Ram Nishad. Babloo was, however, denied a ticket by the BSP chief in 2012 assembly elections, following which he switched over to Peace Party. Even as Mayawati expelled him, he was disqualified from UP assembly under anti-defection law. Jitendra‚Äôs political fortunes, however, began dipping. In 2012 assembly elections Babloo contested as a Peace Party candidate, but slipped to fourth position, losing his seat to SP‚Äôs strongman, Mitra Sen Yadav. Mayawati took Babloo back in the party and fielded him from Bikapur in the 2017 UP assembly elections, but lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/arson-accused-babloo-inducted-in-bjp-to-keep-thakurs-happy/articleshow/85084916.cms||Pankaj Shah

Apart from Dr Tayade, Dr Sushma Thakre, associate professor of community medicines, Indira Gandhi government medical college and hospital (IGGMCH) was also part of the training session which was organized by the Nagpur district collector R Vimala and health department of the Zilla Parishad under CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar. A dedicated YouTube channel too has been created for weekly health trainings of the officials posted at the different remote places of the district, informed district training officer Dr Sachin Hemke.Dr Tayade stressed on the importance of dengue management in the pregnant women among other vulnerable groups like the elderly, diabetic, renal failures and pediatric population. She threw light on several issues of dengue management ranging from means and methods to manage the infection at primary stage and also secondary stage.Sharing her experience of the training session with TOI, Dr Tayade said patients developing second infections are far more complicated to manage than the first infection. ‚ÄúThe patients develop hyper immune-response in the second infection leading to complications,‚Äù she said.During her session, Dr Tayade urged the medical and health officers to practice caution while dealing with pregnant women. ‚ÄúThere is no need to abort until there is any requirement or complexity,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúVertical transmission is possible in dengue in which the baby can be infected from the mother,‚Äù she added.Dr Tayade also informed the medical and health officers to look for warning signs like unrelenting fever, bleeding or any other complications, in dengue for advising hospitalization. She also spoke on the use of antibiotics and other drugs for managing dengue apart from warning that misuse of certain medicines may lead to renal complications.Dr Thakre said, ‚ÄúThere are four sero types of dengue and there is no cross-immunity. We had to explain the medical officers regarding the ambience and conditions conducive for dengue mosquitoes to lay eggs and complete the life cycle.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-dengue-infection-more-complicated-to-fight-expert/articleshow/85080389.cms||Soumitra Bose

Dhoke, who took over charge after serving as director of Srinagar airport for two years, said on Thursday that the facility, which would solve the parking problems, was expected to be ready before time. ‚ÄúI will meet the construction company officials as well as the contractors to push for its early completion,‚Äù he said, calling the facility one of his top priorities. The construction of the Rs 120-crore project started in January last year and is expected to be ready by January 2022. Dhoke said the focus would also be on increasing the passenger traffic, connecting new destinations with Pune and easing the crowd at the terminal building during security checks. ‚ÄúThe goal is to bring the passenger traffic to pre-pandemic levels and we will have discussions with all airlines. However, Covid-19 appropriate norms must be followed. We will look at increasing the number of CISF personnel at the security check counters. The construction of the new terminal building is 60% complete. A system must be developed to prevent crowding,‚Äù said Dhoke. When asked whether the airport will operate for 24 hours again after October, he said the Indian Air Force (IAF) will have to be consulted on this decision. ‚ÄúThey have not come to us with any fresh information on the ongoing runway re-carpeting work,‚Äù he explained. On the lack of food and beverage options at the airport, the director said that the number of stalls will be increased. ‚ÄúA lot of changes have taken place after the pandemic and Master Concessionaire, who would provide service to the Airports Authority of India, have backed off across airports. Those coming in place are smaller outlets,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/multi-level-parking-facility-to-start-soon-airport-director/articleshow/85080405.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nagpur||18-44 group tops vax takers‚Äô list, reports more fever cases||Nagpur: The 18-44 group now tops the chart with over 9.71 lakh vaccinations as compared to 9.08 lakh for 45-60 group and 6.60 lakh for senior citizens (above 60) in the district. The achievement comes despite the government permitting vaccination for the 18-144 age group only in July. The group also saw high number of beneficiaries experiencing fever and body ache soon after the jab. According to Dr Ashwini Tayade, infectious disease specialist at Kingsway Hospital, reactogenicity is expected to be higher in younger groups ‚Äúbecause they have better immune response‚Äù. Some doctors said that they found good proportion of antibodies among 18-44 group soon after vaccination while it took the second dose for many above 45 years to develop antibodies. Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, chief pulmonologist and director of Getwell Hospital, said, ‚ÄúMany youngsters had fever soon after first and second doses for at least two days. In comparison, the 45-60 and above group had less cases of fever. In certain cases, the antibodies were quite high among youths while in older people it took the second jab for developing antibodies.‚ÄùPulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said that there are some common minor adverse events post vaccination, not just for Covid but any immunization. ‚ÄúThere could be pain at the site of infection, mild fever or bodyache. Some people may have high fever for 48 hours. These are moderate side-effects. If fever persists for more than 48 hours, then it is considered severe,‚Äù he said. Dr Sarnaik further said that some keep feeling giddiness, which is more due to anxiety and phobia, for a couple of days. ‚ÄúThese are common observations world over,‚Äù he said.He explained that those above 50 or 60 years generally are comorbid and, therefore, have a weak immune system. ‚ÄúFrom such point out of view, they may not have fever after vaccination. Also, the monitoring is good among young people. We also see this with pneumonia cases in which advanced age patients‚Äô body reactions are hostile. Fever means the body is reacting,‚Äù he said.Paedetrician Dr Anup Marar said, ‚ÄúYoungsters are among the most keen to get vaccinated. Many consider Sputnik as fast food, anticipating single vaccination and no side-effects. But they are misunderstood. All vaccines, be it for children and newborn, do generate a bit of symptoms as in the disease for many. However, it is only for a day or two and manageable by a paracetamol.‚ÄùThe OCHRI director further said that the youngsters should understand that there is more experience about Covaxin and Covishield in Indian scenario as compared to new vaccine.Meanwhile, the over 150 centres Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) collectively crossed 10 lakh first doses on Thursday. These include 46,584 HCWs, 53,490 FLWs, 18-44 group 40,9198, 45-60 group 29,4092, and above 60 - 20,3613.

---||Delhi||DU defers order to reopen labs for final-yr students||New Delhi: Amid opposition from teachers, Delhi University has deferred the reopening of colleges and departments for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate science students from August 16. The order had been issued on Thursday. However, vice-chancellor PC Joshi said the deferral was done keeping in mind the guidelines of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). Teachers had opposed the reopening raising the difficulty outstation students would have in getting accommodation. They had also pointed out that the order was passed hurriedly giving less than 10 days without any clear guidelines for following it. The order issued on Friday stated, ‚ÄúIn continuation of the office order dated August 5, the instructions issued for the conduct of classes for PG and UG programmes with respect to science courses in the university and its colleges in the physical mode with effect from August 16 have been deferred.‚Äù Clarifying the reasons behind the decision, Joshi told TOI, ‚ÄúWe have to align all our notifications with the DDMA guidelines as we are bound by them. DDMA will soon take a decision on it. There was no pressure from anyone.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are concerned about science students because practicals are very important for them. Physical classes have a lot of importance. Once the situation improves and vaccination picks up pace, we will also think about students of other courses,‚Äù added Joshi. Teachers welcomed the decision and said for re-opening colleges and departments, the university must bring out a well-thought plan. Abha Dev Habib, physics teacher at Miranda House and an office-bearer of Delhi University Teachers‚Äô Association, said, ‚ÄúThe sudden notification regarding classes and labs in physical mode had resulted in immense panic. It‚Äôs good that the university has reviewed its decision. The university should give time to students to complete their vaccination doses.‚Äù Pankaj Garg, mathematics teacher at Rajdhani College, said, ‚ÄúAfter the notification, students had been calling me saying that the houses they were living in earlier were not ready to accommodate them. Most DU colleges do not have hostels, so students manage on their own. It was important for the university to review the decision that was taken in haste. We are in favour of physical classes, but everything has to be done systematically.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-defers-order-to-reopen-labs-for-final-yr-students/articleshow/85116206.cms||Shradha Chettri

But he remained tight-lipped about the name of the companies involved in the cash transactions and for what purpose the cash was couriered, citing ongoing investigation. The courier firm‚Äôs employees were carrying a private company‚Äôs cash from Solapur to its offices in Mumbai and Bhiwandi. The suspects in police uniform appeared to have had a pinpoint information about it, a police officer said. ‚ÄúApparently, an insider tipped off the suspects about the cash movement. We shall question all those involved in end-to-end chain of money transfer by the courier firm,‚Äù the officer said. The police recorded the statements of the ST bus driver and the conductor to corroborate the incident narrated by the complainant-employee of the courier firm. But the police said it was not possible to record the bus passengers‚Äô statements. ‚ÄúThe bus driver and the conductor said they did not notice anything suspicious during the journey.

---||Jaipur||Congress to use Lord Ram against BJP in byelections||Jaipur: Lord Ram has remained a favourite election issue for the BJP for long, but the Congress intends to turn the tables on the opposition party in the upcoming assembly bypolls in Vallabhnagar (Udaipur) and Dhariawad (Pratapgarh). The two seats fell vacant after the demise of their sitting MLAs due to Covid-19.Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria‚Äôs recent statement that ‚ÄòRam would have been in the sea but for the BJP‚Äô, has given fodder to the Congress to attack the opposition party. Congress leaders have called Kataria‚Äôs statement an arrogance of the BJP and an insult of the Ram worshippers.‚ÄúKataria claims that Ram got recognition because of BJP, otherwise, the Lord would have been in the sea. He said there is no need to speak for roads and drains or any other development issue, but the religion. The truth is, Lord Ram‚Äôs temple is being built by the Supreme Court direction and by the unanimous decision of the country's 130 crore people,‚Äù said school education minister Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra, on Thursday.Dotasra added, ‚ÄúBJP leaders are doing business from the donation money collected in Ram‚Äôs name. We are receiving information that RSS men are collecting donations and filling their houses. BJP should tell how much donation was collected from Rajasthan and how many receipts were given.‚ÄùTransport minister and Udaipur‚Äôs in-charge Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, ‚ÄúBJP came to power assuring development as under the ‚ÄòRam Rajya‚Äô but now it is dissuading people from speaking on building roads and drains. CM Ashok Gehlot is implementing schemes of public welfare. BJP will have to explain Kataria‚Äôs statement on Lord Ram in assembly bypolls.‚ÄùThe Congress committees formed to oversee bypolls in Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad met at the PCC headquarters on Thursday. Half the committee members, however, remained absent. Sports minister Ashok Chandana, who participated in the meeting along with Dotasra and Khachariyawas, claimed Congress was united in the state. ‚ÄúCongress victory in the last assembly bypolls proved the unity of the party state unit. The saying that Congress gets defeated because of Congress has been proved wrong,‚Äù said Chandana.Dotasra said Congress would win Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad because the ruling party has fulfilled 64% of its manifesto promises despite a cut of 80% in its revenue due to the pandemic. Targeting Kataria once more, the PCC chief said, ‚ÄúHe said Vasundhara Raje could not get a BJP ticket for Randhir Singh Bhinder even when she was the CM, so there is no way she can get it now. If the leader of Opposition can say such a thing for his former chief minister under whom he worked as minister, you can imagine the extent of his arrogance.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congress-to-use-lord-ram-against-bjp-in-byelections/articleshow/85084942.cms||---

Such schools are located in the entire region of CBSE Dehradun which includes all 13 districts of Uttarakhand and eight districts of western Uttar Pradesh. The reasons for upholding the results is mainly due to uploading incorrect information, including roll number, date of birth of students and district name on the CBSE portal. Meanwhile, after the schools for classes IX-XII were reopened on Monday, it has been recorded that among the state government-run schools, the ones located in the hill districts, especially in Rudraprayag and Chamoli, have recorded better attendance than the plains such as US Nagar and Haridwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cbse-doon-regional-office-releases-results/articleshow/85080429.cms||Mohammad Anab

This time, NU has made it mandatory for all aspiring students to enrol with it through the website. They need to register their names and upload all requisite documents like mark-sheet till August 18. The admission schedule would also be made applicable for all autonomous colleges under the university.A notification issued by deputy registrar Raman Madane has made it clear to all students that without enrolment on NU website, they would not be allowed to seek admissions in any of its affiliated or conducted colleges. NU further clarified that the website would allow enrollment only once and therefore, the students should take extra precaution to feed correct data, including names and marks.NU officials told TOI that this time, there would be a rush in all 500 affiliated colleges for admissions, due to the fact that a majority of students were declared cleared in the Std XII without appearing in the state board HSC examinations due to Covid pandemic. Out of over 1.40 lakh students appearing in Std XII, from Nagpur division‚Äôs six districts, only 534 failed.Since over a decade, the colleges‚Äô number has reduced from nearly 900, after the students turned their back to NU. It included those of professional courses like engineering and pharmacy.In Nagpur district, 56,540 candidates were declared passed and all of them would need to be accommodated in the first year. Even 6,295 repeater candidates were declared passed and they too need to be granted a seat in any college. It means 62,835 students would need to provide a seat in the university. State higher and technical minister Uday Samant had already made it clear that no student would remain without admission.NU officials said they would grant permission to the colleges to apply for 20% additional seats if there was a shortage. They need to apply to the state higher and technical education department through NU. According to them, not all 62,835 passed out students would seek admission in NU colleges, but they need to be prepared. ‚ÄúSome of them move to institutions like IITs, NITs and other universities. Some also prefer diploma engineering courses. There may be few cases of drop outs, particularly in the rural areas,‚Äù they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ug-admissions-nu-makes-it-mandatory-for-students-to-enrol-through-website/articleshow/85080446.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Dehradun||College teachers claim denying of promotion as professors despite orders from central govt||Haridwar: The SMJN College has not yet allowed its teachers in several departments to get promoted as professors despite orders issued by the government in this regard. Teachers of the college, which is a government-aided private college, alleged that "the 2010 and 2018 regulations issued by the central government provide that teachers fulfilling eligibility conditions should be promoted as professors in colleges as well, but since the principal of the college is himself not eligible for the post, he does not want others to be promoted". "The promotions will render the principal junior to all teachers promoted as professors, and threaten his position as officiating principal which he has got on the basis of seniority," said a teacher in the college. SMJN College is the only college in the state to do so, he alleged. Earlier, the post of professor existed in universities alone. The 2010 and 2018 regulations issued by the Central government provide that teachers fulfilling eligibility conditions should be promoted as professors in colleges. A state government letter of July 12, 2021 issued by additional chief secretary Anand Vardhan categorically stated "meetings of promotion committees at the levels of directorate/head of department/districts be held and the administration be informed after completing the process of promotion by July 30." But, the college did not even initiate the process by the date. A Nainital high court order passed on June 14, 2018 in a case filed by Prashant Singh and others said that a teacher's promotion as professor will be on the basis of his performance based appraisal report, not seniority. The eligibility conditions will be the same as mentioned in the Regulations 2010. In the assessment period of three years, the teacher must have published at least five research papers and his API (academic performance index) each year must be minimum 20, the order said. According to MS Randhawa of DAV College, Dehradun, promotion as incentive to teachers may ensure quality of education. But the government seems to be coming in its way as was done by Uttarakhand director of higher education, who suspended promotions on March 23. On July 30, after the Nainital high court stayed the order, the promotion process was allowed to resume. DBS College and Guru Ram Rai College in Dehradun have already completed the process as has been done by colleges in the Haridwar district, except SMJN College, a teacher said. Sunil Kumar Batra, the principal, said the process was initiated a couple of months ago for one department, but due to the director staying the process in March, it could not be completed. A fresh letter in this regard has been sent to the director and the university by the management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/college-teachers-claim-denying-of-promotion-as-professors-despite-orders-from-central-govt/articleshow/85080439.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

---||Delhi||Vendors object to outside mgmt of weekly mkts||New Delhi: The municipal corporations are planning to outsource the management and fee collection from weekly markets to a private agency, which will pay a monthly licence fee to the civic body. Under the current arrangement, vendors are expected to pay Rs 10-15 per day, but the issue of corruption, leakages and unauthorised vending in weekly markets has been flagged on multiple occasions. The commissioner of North Delhi Municipal Corporation has proposed to run 30 markets ‚Äî five in each of the six zones ‚Äî on pilot basis on this new commercial pattern. South Delhi Municipal Corporation will also be working on a similar action plan. However, National Street Vendors Association had said the plans were against the street vendors‚Äô Act and it would oppose the move. A civic official explained that there were 106 authorised weekly markets in north Delhi areas from which a fee of Rs 15 per day per site was levied in category A to category D colonies, while Rs 10 per day was charged in categories E to H colonies. ‚ÄúThese rates were fixed in 2009. The issue of enhancing revenue collection from these markets and preventing leakages was raised on several occasions at the corporation meetings. Shortage of ground-level collection staff is another major reason for non-collection. Lately, a view has emerged that work related to collection of fees from weekly markets should be outsourced. However, unauthorised markets will be kept out of this process,‚Äù said the letter from the municipal commissioner. An official said an open tender process would be used to select the agencies. The terms proposed by the civic body stated that the space allocation to new vendors or change in their location would be the right of the civic body and these would not be carried out by the agency. However, the vendors are apprehensive about the move. Arbind Singh, head, National Association of Street Vendors of India, said such a move would violate the provisions of street vendors‚Äô Act and such decisions could only be taken by the town vending committees. ‚ÄúWe will oppose this move. The introduction of such contractors has been problematic in other parts of the country. Ultimately, these private contractors start acting like landlords, and a lot of illegalities creep in,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-object-to-outside-mgmt-of-weekly-mkts/articleshow/85116293.cms||Paras Singh

Interacting with beneficiaries of the PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana in UP through video-conferencing, Modi said that his government blocked all ways which allowed pilferage of ration. ‚ÄúWe are satisfied that every grain sent from Delhi reaches the plates of the needy in the state,‚Äù he said. The PM said for many years, UP was viewed from a political lens and its prospects of playing a vital role in the country‚Äôs development were not even discussed. ‚ÄúBut the state‚Äôs ‚Äògrowth engine‚Äô potential has been promoted in the past few years,‚Äù he added. CM Yogi distributes ration to beneficiaries under PMGKAY scheme on Thursday‚ÄúPeople only used to consider that the route to Delhi went through UP. They never mentioned that the prosperity of the country also went through UP,‚Äù he said, adding that after providing houses, toilets, electricity and gas, the government is working to provide water through pipelines to every household. Modi slammed the opposition of making UP as a mere ‚Äúpolitical centre‚Äù with some adhering to nepotism while others using it to serve individual political interest. ‚ÄúUP was only used to meet political ends,‚Äù he said, underscoring that a big state like UP never got linked with economic prosperity of the country. ‚ÄúThe confidence that UP can become the powerhouse of the country has been generated in the last few years,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThe way Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana is being implemented in the state defines the new Uttar Pradesh,‚Äù he said. Terming UP CM Yogi Adityanath as a ‚ÄòKarma Yogi‚Äô, the PM said that it was for the first time that criminals are fearing law and land-grabbers are being brought to book. ‚ÄúThe system which got infected with Bhai-Bhatijawaad‚Äô has undergone a drastic change,‚Äù the PM said, pointing out that it was because of a robust law and order situation that investment was pouring in and big companies are heading towards UP. Thursday marked UP‚Äôs celebration of PMGKAY under which almost 15 crore beneficiaries of the state have been getting ration free of cost under the ambitious scheme through nearly 80,000 Fair price shops in the state. Under the PMGKAY scheme, 5 kg per person additional foodgrain is given to all beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act. The PM‚Äôs virtual address was telecast across nearly all fair price shops in the presence of party MPs, MLA, UP ministers and even Zila Panchayat chairpersons. Modi also hailed the people of UP for not getting swayed by the rumours and lies spread by few people having vested interest around the `India-made‚Äô Corona vaccines. He said that administering over 5 crore vaccines was a big achievement for UP and he hoped that the state would take the benefits of the free vaccination programme. The PM lauded the efforts of people from UP in elevating strength of the country. He said that the upcoming expressways and dedicated freight and defence corridors. Modi stressed that the implementation of PMGKAY scheme in UP has affirmed its identity of being one of the leading state in the country. He also hailed the state government for providing relief to street vendors who were provided bank loans under the PM Svanidhi scheme. MSP doubled in UP: ModiPM Modi said that his government was committed to controlling the inflation which had an overbearing effect on poor and middle class families. ‚ÄúWe are facing the challenges. But we are trying our best in controlling the price rise. Modi also reached out to the farming community by saying his government created records by providing a minimum support price. In case of UP, he said, the number of farmers getting the benefit of MSP doubled in 2020-21 in comparison to 2019-20. Aug 5 auspicious: PMRaising a nationalist pitch Modi termed Thursday (August 5) as an auspicious date which turned the dream of ‚ÄòEk Bharat Shreshtha Bharat‚Äô into reality by revoking Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The day, he said, also marked one year completion of the foundation laying ceremony for a grand Ram temple after centuries‚Äô old dispute. Modi‚Äôs reference to Ram temple held much significance even as CM Yogi reached the temple town and stayed there for almost three hours to take stock of the temple construction besides visiting the Ram Janmabhoomi. Modi also acknowledged the day as a ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù one as India men‚Äôs hockey team claimed an Olympic medal after 41 years, defeating Germany 5-4 to win a bronze. ‚ÄúThe sport has been our ‚ÄòRashtriya Gaurav‚Äô (national honour) which was reclaimed by our youth,‚Äù the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-up-was-never-linked-to-nations-prosperity-in-past/articleshow/85085029.cms||Pankaj Shah

Ramgopal, whose son also failed the Class 12 examination, said the school had been forcing students to take tuitions. ‚ÄúThey neither gave us the result of Class 11 nor showed answersheets. We had protested last year too when the school had failed to give us the results of our children in Class 11,‚Äù he said. Superintendent of police, Rae Bareli, Shlok Kumar said an FIR had been lodged and further investigations were on in the case. The delegation of parents also met Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma and submitted a memorandum to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/school-manager-principal-booked-for-threatening-students-staging-stir/articleshow/85085085.cms||---

The Luni river, called Maruganga of Rajasthan, on the other hand is dealing with another issue. Polluted water discharged by the factories in Pali and Jodhpur flows into the river, adding to the farmers‚Äô woes. The farmers are worried about the polluted water in the Luni river reaching Barmer and held an awareness rally on Thursday under the banner of ‚ÄòPradushan nivaran va paryavaran Sanrakshan samiti‚Äô, to stop the polluted water coming from the factories into the Luni river. The rally was taken out from Samdadi to Tilwara. A memorandum has been given to the district collector. Former MLA Kansingh Bhati Kotdi and Samiti president Tulsaram Choudhary, Samdadi sarpanch association block president Khet Singh Bhati flagged off the rally. For the last one decade, the chemical effluents from the factories in Pali collected at Nehda Dam and were released into the Luni river before the monsoon, due to which farmers cultivating crops along the riverside have to face heavy damages. Around 100 small and big towns are affected due to this. The polluted water has seeped into the agriculture wells due to which potable water has been defiled. Hundreds of cattle die every year after drinking this polluted water. Samiti president Tulsaram Choudhary said that there is a need to provide relief to farmers by stopping the flow of chemically polluted water into the river. Illegal units running at Pali and Jodhpur are snatching away the livelihood of the farmers of Samdadi tehsil area. If the polluted water is not stopped then the farmers would agitate, he said. Samiti secretary Om Prakash Soni said that for the last many years, farmers have been requesting the government but in vain. On the other hand, the speed of the water discharged by the factories in Pali and Jodhpur was so high that within a few days it entered the Barmer district border via Dhoondhada. The polluted water has reached Kotdi Ajeet via Rampura and within a few days, there is a possibility that the polluted water will reach Samdadi. The contact of small villages and towns gets broken due to this polluted water and people have to take long routes to commute. The administration and public representatives are apprised about this problem but a permanent solution has not been arrived at.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/farmers-irked-over-discharge-of-effluents-in-luni-river/articleshow/85085069.cms||---

Kundra moved the sessions court after a magistrate court rejected his plea for bail. The matter will come up for hearing on August 10. The court will also hear the bail plea of Kundra‚Äôs IT head, Ryan Thorpe. The two were arrested on July 19 for alleged production and streaming of pornographic content via apps. The magistrate court had said since there are allegations that Kundra in connivance with Thorpe deleted some incriminating data, there is every possibility the accused could tamper with the evidence if released on bail. In their bail pleas, Kundra and Thorpe had contended they were falsely implicated.

Also three bodies, including of an eight-year-old girl, were recovered by the rescue teams from a canal situated at Jharbalpura village in Bundi district of the state. On Tuesday, a car carrying three members swept away in rain-fed nullah. ‚ÄúAll the three bodies were recovered,‚Äù said an officer with the district administration in Bundi. Since negligible rainfall activity was witnessed in the Kota division, Udaipur division, Jodhpur division and Jaipur division, the rescue work was at full swing throughout the day on Thursday. Many places in Jhalawar and Baran districts were witnessing more than 250mm rainfall per day in the past seven days. ‚ÄúOn Thursday, a rainfall varying from 150 mm to 10 mm that too in scattered form was witnessed,‚Äù said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. ‚ÄúOur team rescued 77 people from various areas of Dholpur district and 75 people from affected village in Jhalawar district of the state. As water level was depleting all these people who got stuck were taken to the safer places,‚Äù said Pankaj Chaudhary, commandant, state disaster relief force(SDRF) told TOI. Civil defence teams in Jaipur got alarmed when they were intimated that a dam at Kalka village got damaged at the Phagi tehsil in Jaipur district. ‚ÄúAlmost 28 people including 16 women, five children and seven senior citizens were rescued as portion of their houses and areas where they were living got inundated. No casualty was reported from the village,‚Äù said an officer with civil defence team. Meanwhile, in the absence of rainfall mercury took an upward swing and humidity levels were also increased. At Jaipur it was a sultry day on Thursday when cloud cover was also vanished. ‚ÄúThere is a possibility that from Saturday onwards mild rainfall activity is likely to take place in and around Jaipur,‚Äù said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. People in the affected villages of the district Baran, Kota and Bundi had sigh of relief as they had been witnessing heavy showers for the past seven days. ‚ÄúMany villages in Baran district are still disconnected with the district headquarter while electricity lines are also damaged,‚Äù said a senior officer with the district administration Baran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-1k-people-rescued-from-rain-affected-districts/articleshow/85085087.cms||---

It has also been decided to conduct raids to curb sale of low-quality headgear. City traffic police say around 90 per cent of the two-wheeler riders now obey the helmet rule thanks to the vigorous enforcement drives carried out in the past one year. However, some motorists are using low quality (non-ISI-marked) helmets just for the sake of avoiding police checks. Total number of vehicles in Vizag crossed 12.5 lakh mark in 2020 from 5.5 lakh in 2012. Two-wheelers continue to dominate Vizag roads, accounting for around 80 per cent (over 9 lakh two-wheelers) of its total vehicular population, followed by cars 10 per cent (1.2 lakh cars).  ‚ÄúWe have observed that some two-wheeler riders are buying low-quality helmets citing the high price of ISI-marked ones. They are not aware of the consequences in the event of an accident,‚Äù said ADCP (traffic), Vizag City, Ch Adinarayana. Transport Research Wing, under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, has said that out of the total 3,287 two-wheeler riders who were killed in road accidents in 2019 in Andhra Pradesh, 1,861 did not have helmets. Similarly, 775 helmetless pillion riders lost their lives. Speaking to TOI, deputy transport commissioner, Vizag, GC Raja Ratnam said they were booking riders who were without helmets. ‚ÄúWe are also creating awareness among riders on the use of ISI-marked helmets and we will give them some time to comply with the norms. Cases will be registered if they fail to fall in line,‚Äù he added. Officials said Section 129 of IMV Act mandates use of quality headgear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/traffic-police-set-to-crack-down-on-substandard-helmets/articleshow/85080369.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Coimbatore||Emu farm owners sentenced to 10 yrs in jail, fined Rs 2.5 cr||Coimbatore: The special court for Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors (TNPID) Act on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old S Yuvaraj, the prime accused in the honour killing of dalit youth Gokulraj, and two of his aides to 10 years imprisonment in the emu scam case and imposed a fine of Rs 2.47 crore on them.A court source said Yuvaraj, a resident of Iveli village near Akkamapettai in Salem, had duped 121 people of Rs 2.70 crore between 2011 and 2012 after floating Suthi Emu Farms along with 34-year-old S Tamizhnesan, of Thiruvenkitampalayampudur near Perundurai in Erode, and 52-year-old C Vasu, of Nehru Street at Soorampatti in Erode.Yuvaraj was the director of emu farms, which was set up at Perundurai in Erode in 2011, while Vasu was its manager. Tamizhnesan was their business partner.The source said they had announced two schemes to lure the investors. In one of the schemes, they promised to provide six emus, feed and shed to rear them, an annual bonus of Rs 20,000 and a monthly return of Rs 7,000 on an investment of Rs 1.5 lakh for 24 months. They promised to return the capital investment on maturity of the scheme. In the second scheme, a monthly return of Rs 8,000 was promised on an investment of Rs 1.5 lakh for 24 months, in addition to six emus for rearing.While 121 people from Salem, Erode, Namakkal and neighbouring districts had invested in the schemes, they were not provided any monthly returns.T P Palanisamy, of Tiruchengode in Namakkal, one of the duped investors, lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) police in September 2012 and they registered a case against Yuvaraj, Tamizhnesan and Vasu under sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 5 of the TNPID Act. While the three were arrested, Tamizhnesan and Vasu later came out on bail. Yuvaraj was, however, lodged in Madurai Central Prison in the murder case. On Thursday, Yuvaraj was brought to the TNPID court in Coimbatore from Madurai Central Prison for the trial. While Vasu was also present, Tamizhnesan did not appear before the court, which has issued a non-bailable warrant against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/emu-farm-owners-sentenced-to-10-yrs-in-jail-fined-rs-2-5-cr/articleshow/85082984.cms||---
---||Madurai||3 years on, no sign yet of Vaigai river front being beautified||(Cleared/Gopa)Madurai: The Vaigai river front development scheme was devised as a visionary project under the Smart City programme for beautifying the two banks of the Vaigai at a cost of Rs 81.41 crore. But with almost 60% of work over in three years, the appearance of the river on this stretch is anything but encouraging ‚Äî it is filled with a brackish, algae floating, garbage-filled water spread, one of the ugliest scenes in the city now.The river and its surroundings were to be beautified for a stretch of 3.1 kms between Raja Mill road and Kuruvikkaransalai bridge like the Sarbarmati riverfront in Gujarat. Two check dams have come up near the AV bridge as part of the project, which have indeed helped bring water to the Mariamman Teppakulam. Retention walls have been constructed and in a move to arrest the flow of sewage into the river from Panthalkudi channel, which flows through Sellur, Madurai corporation has also constructed a sewage treatment plant (STP). Nevertheless, sewage continues to flow into the river bed at many places.Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam coordinator M Rajan said the construction of check dams at a distance of just 200 metres from each other is one of the main reasons for sewage retention within the city. ``Even the older check dams were more than 20 kms away, one at Kochadai and another at Viraganoor at two ends of the city.‚Äô‚Äô he said. The check dams were constructed without ensuring that there was enough silt at the bottom. So, water seepage and groundwater recharge is not possible as they were constructed on the rocky surface. Retaining walls on both sides have been constructed by digging to a depth of 15 feet with the result that chances of neighbouring areas benefiting when there is a flow in the river are almost nil, he said. Garbage is also thrown over the walls and not monitored.This stretch had about 300 well-grown trees, but they were uprooted and pushed into the river. ‚ÄúNow, they are saying these trees are not going to be replanted. This is a big disappointment as far as the beautification of the city is concerned,‚Äô‚Äô he said. Ancient ghats that bordered the river at many places were also demolished. ``They said parks would be established on the banks, but now they say it has been dropped,‚Äô‚Äô said Rajan.Though the final detailed project report of the Smart City plan for Madurai in 2015 stated that it would include integrating the Vaigai river front zones with greenery and public amenities, the greening process has been dropped now. The entire stretch taken up for the programme has been concretised and there is no place for planting trees. Corporation Commissioner K P Karthikeyan said they were confident of arresting the sewage flow into the river in the city and were chalking out plans to make the riverfront people-friendly.Tile:Cost of Vaigai Riverfront Development Programme - Rs 81.41 lakhAim: Greening and making it people-friendly.Trees removed for programme - about 300.Sewage Treatment plant near Meenakshi college completed at Rs 2.5 crore.Vox pop:``The corporation not keeping its promise to provide a green cover which it destroyed for the riverfront development scheme is a big disappointment. It will be a drawback to the rejuvenation of the river,‚Äô‚Äô - M Rajan, coordinator, Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam``If the corporation achieves the goal of arresting sewage flow into the river, it would be big, but at present it is impossible,‚Äô‚Äô - G Thilagar, former councillor.``We are trying to make the river banks people-friendly, but trees would not be planted on the stretch,‚Äù - K P Karthikeyan, Madurai corporation commissioner||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/3-years-on-no-sign-yet-of-vaigai-river-front-being-beautified/articleshow/85082981.cms||---

Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said that Metro‚Äôs entire fleet of about 2,000 coaches have seating capacity of one lakh while more than 2 lakh passengers come to stations at rush hours. To regulate entry of passengers, it is necessary to restrict the number of gates as opening more gates will make it difficult to regulate the number of passengers inside trains, he said. ‚ÄúThis is the reason why a limited number of gates are opened,‚Äù he said. Dayal said that recently, random incidents of impatient passengers trying to barge into stations breaking the queues and manhandling DMRC and CISF personnel on duty have been reported.

Many people are forced to put off their travel plans and not in a position to take up job offers, as they don‚Äôt have the certificate, which has been made mandatory to travel abroad and some states in the country.Youngsters said some employers had already made vaccination mandatory to take part in interviews and offer appointment orders. Delay in getting the certificate, they said, was delaying them to take up the job. In some cases, they also lose job opportunities because of this.Varghese Thomas, a youth from the city, said while five of them had taken the first dose of vaccine around 40 days ago, only one had received the vaccination certificate so far. ‚ÄúWhen we apply for jobs, prospective employers are asking us about the vaccination. They want us to produce the certificate.‚ÄùS Baburaj, a resident of Chinna Thadagam, said he had taken the first dose on July 26, but hadn‚Äôt received the certificate till date. Recently, he was stopped by a team of health officials near Ukkadam, asking him to undergo Covid-19 testing if not vaccinated. ‚ÄúI had a difficult time convincing the officials.‚ÄùDhiraj Lunawat, another resident who got his first dose on May 27, has the same story to tell. While seven members of his family were inoculated the same day, two of them, who had registered on CoWin app, hadn‚Äôt received the SMS containing link to the certificate. The remaining, who registered on the spot, have received the messages.‚ÄúIt is the fault of the health workers, who don‚Äôt get the user code from the beneficiaries to enter onto the system. After running from pillar to post, I finally managed to get a token from a doctor at the vaccination centre for the second dose,‚Äù Dhiraj, who is yet to get the certificate, said.When contacted, a health official said the delay could be due to the higher volume of data to be entered on the system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/delay-in-issuing-vax-certificates-hits-jobs-spoils-travel-plans/articleshow/85083001.cms||V Devanathan
---||Kolhapur||BJP demands waiver of property & water taxes||Kolhapur: The city unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded that the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) waive the property and water taxes of traders and residents affected by the floods. After the floods in 2019, the civic body had waived the water bills of around 3,500 households amounting to Rs 7 lakh. Rahul Chikode, the BJP district president, said, ‚ÄúThe floods coupled with the Covid pandemic has forced the citizens and traders into severe financial crisis. Now, talks of another lockdown in the wake of anticipated third wave of Covid is going on. In such a situation, putting the citizens and traders into more financial trouble by forcing them to pay the taxes is unjust. Hence, we have demanded the KMC to waive the property and water taxes. Similar demand was made earlier in the wake of last lockdown.‚Äù The demand to waive the taxes in the wake of lockdown was not approved by the KMC citing shortfall in revenue collection. The traders body from the city had also approached the KMC to waive taxes, but civic officials denied it saying waiver will cause a revenue loss of Rs 4.5 crore. Later, additional time of one month was given for clearing the dues. ‚ÄúWe have been told by the authorities that a survey of the damages caused to the traders and residents due to flood is being worked on. The authorities have also assured us to start actual depositing of relief amount in the next three to four days into the bank accounts of the affected citizens,‚Äù said Chikode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bjp-demands-waiver-of-property-water-taxes/articleshow/85075020.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Satellite pics show extent of Panchaganga floodplain||Kolhapur: The satellite images of the receded Panchaganga river after the recent floods clearly show the floodplain of the river and the possible extent of crop damage due to deposition of sediments and inundation. The flooding of the Panchaganga river last month led to relocation of over 20,000 people across Kolhapur city besides damage to standing crops grown along the river banks. Raj Bhagat, the senior manager at the Bengaluru-based World Resources Institute (WRI)-India,has accessed the satellite images sent by the European Union and processed them. The images show the receded river along the Ambewadi to Gandhinagar stretch passing through Kolhapur city. ‚ÄúThe extent of the floodplain is defined by the deposits of sediments carried by the river. The deposits are fertile for the crops. However, the cropping pattern needs to change to reap maximum benefits‚Äù Bhagat said. On other hand the long time inundation of crops makes them weak and thereby leads to damage. ‚ÄúI processed the images for observational purpose, but a detailed study is yet to be carried out. The primary aim of such images is to see till which point the floodwaters had reached and the areas affected. The Panchaganga floodplain is around 2.5 km across. In case of the Krishna river the, it is 6 km wide,‚Äù he added. Bhagat said such detailed images can be brought to use by authorities for the purpose of proper planning. ‚ÄúThe land use planning can be done according to the behaviour of the rivers during floods. The rivers are going to flood and it‚Äôs a natural process. We have to ensure maximum details are collected through such images which will help us mitigate the losses caused by the floods. For instance, in case of Kolhapur, sugarcane is the major crop grown along the floodplains and during floods the crop gets damaged. If the cropping pattern along the flood plain is changed, the farmers can not only avoid losses, but also benefit from it,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satellite-pics-show-extent-of-panchaganga-floodplain/articleshow/85075000.cms||---

Censuring the actor for refusing to pay up even after the issue was settled by the Supreme Court in 2018, Justice S M Subramaniam directed him to pay Rs 30,30,757 tax due within 48hours and report. (On July 13, the judge had made certain caustic observations against actor Vijay in a similar case which were later stayed by a division bench). ‚ÄúCrores of poor and middle-class people of this great nation are purchasing half a litre and one litre petrol for their low-end two-wheelers and they are not choosing to file cases seeking exemptions. While so, citizens enjoying a reputation for importing the most prestigious and luxury cars are expected to pay entry tax to the state, as they are going to be driven on the roads established by the state. Roads are laid from and out of the taxpayers‚Äô money,‚Äù said Justice Subramaniam. On Thursday, counsel for Dhanush sought the court‚Äôs permission to withdraw the case. He said Dhanush had already paid 50% of the tax and that he was willing to pay the rest now. Refusing to allow Dhanush to withdraw the plea, Justice Subramaniam said the petition had been pending since 2015. ‚ÄúIf your intentions are genuine, you should have paid the tax at least after the Supreme Court had settled the issue in 2018. But now, after the high court listed the matter for passing orders, you are seeking to withdraw,‚Äù the judge said. Noting that Dhanush was absolutely right in arguing that claiming such exemption was his right, the court said, ‚Äúhowever, while dealing with the rights of the citizen, constitutional courts are bound to remind the duties of the citizen under the Constitution. When the duties are reminded upon to citizens, they cannot make a complaint that the court has exceeded its jurisdiction by unnecessarily penning down certain points.‚Äù ‚ÄúConstitutional courts are not functioning to simply resolve the disputes by saying 1+1=2. Beyond resolving the issues between the parties, the extraordinary powers conferred under Article 226 is bound to be exercised by the high court, whenever an occasion comes for the development and march of law,‚Äù Justice Subramaniam said. ‚ÄúWonderful ideas, ideologies, theories, doctrines in numerous judgments by way of ‚ÄúObiter dicta‚Äù (expression of opinion by judges) became the law of this great nation and contributed for the development of our Indian democracy,‚Äù the court asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pay-rs-30l-tax-in-48hrs-hc-to-dhanush/articleshow/85083066.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid interval over, viewers return to theatres for big-screen thrill||KOLKATA: A Salman Khan fan, a senior citizen, a Tollywood actor and a college student‚Äîthis diverse group had one thing in common. They all flocked to theatres to watch a film on Thursday, the very first day halls in the city reopened after a long Covid-safety break. Four properties of INOX and Star Theatre resumed business, with safety measures in place, while the remaining will reopen only once there‚Äôs a steady flow of new releases. Considering Thursday is a working day for most, the response seemed encouraging for hall owners. INOX Metro opened on February 20 this year and was shut on May 1. According to the government order, 50% of the 420 tickets at the Esplanade theatre were available for viewers. Actor Gulshanara Khatun, who watched the afternoon show of ‚ÄòThe Suicide Squad‚Äô there, pointed out watching films on home theatre could not match the thrill of watching an action movie with computer graphics on a big screen with Dolby digital sound. ‚ÄúAll safety protocols were maintained. I was so hooked that I didn‚Äôt even realise when my tub of popcorn got empty,‚Äù she said. She was impressed to see youngsters, who might be hooked on OTT, visiting theatres. ‚ÄúI saw quite a few young couples entering Nandan for the evening show. That is a positive sign for us involved with the movie industry. We are shooting films with the hope that one day people would watch them in theatres,‚Äù she said. Senior citizen Prodyot Kumar Basak had read in the newspaper about theatres reopening. The Tollygunge resident went all the way to Esplanade to watch ‚ÄòThe Suicide Squad‚Äô. The practice of slipping out of college classes to catch a film seems to continue in the new normal. Among the viewers was a young boy, who decided to give his online classes a miss to visit a theatre. Akash Mitra (23), who watched the first show at INOX City Centre 1, travelled from Deshapriya Park to Salt Lake. ‚ÄúThe theatre was sanitized. It was such a refreshing experience for me,‚Äù he said. At Star Theatre, Manish Upadhyay, along with three of his friends, turned up at noon to watch a rerun of Salman Khan‚Äôs ‚ÄòRadhe‚Äô. ‚ÄúI am a die-hard Salman fan but hadn‚Äôt watched ‚ÄòRadhe‚Äô on OTT,‚Äù he said. The number of viewers on the first day might not be flattering, but theatre owners are not complaining. Joydeep Mukherjee, who has the lease for Star Theatre, said it was ‚Äúbetter than expected‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn normal times, we have no shows due to the absence of patrons. It was a pleasant surprise that with no publicity, a Hollywood release and a rerun of a Hindi film got viewers on a Thursday... My risk paid off,‚Äù he said. Three INOX properties at Hiland Park, Rajarhat and Darjeeling are set to reopen next week. ‚ÄúAll safety protocols have been followed. Since viewers have to sit one seat apart, cinemas are much more vigilant about social distancing than many public places. It is a good start and I am sure the numbers will increase once Hindi and Bengali releases begin,‚Äù said Amitava Guha Thakurta, regional director at INOX (East).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-interval-over-viewers-return-to-theatres-for-big-screen-thrill/articleshow/85083074.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Lucknow||‚ÄòMarriage of Muslims outside faith regretful & unfortunate‚Äô||Lucknow: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Thursday said that marriage between Muslims and non-Muslims was ‚Äòregretful‚Äô and ‚Äòunfortunate‚Äô. The document issued by the acting general secretary of AIMPLB, Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani, further highlighted steps that parents, guardians and representatives of mosques and madrassas across the country should take to stop such inter-religion marriages. ‚ÄúIslam does not consider marriage between a Muslim and a non-Muslim who are plythesists, as valid. Even if it appears to be valid by societal standards, it is not considered legal in the eyes of Sharia,‚Äù said Maulana Rahmani. ‚ÄúDue to co-working spaces, lack of religious teaching and nurturing from parents, a number of inter-religion marriages with non-Muslims are taking place. We have come across several such cases where Muslim girls who went away with non-Muslim boys, have later had to face tremendous hardships or even lose their lives. This is why we have issued an appeal for parents, guardians and responsible pillars of our society to stay vigilant and help young boys and girls,‚Äù he added. In the seven-point directive to the Muslim community, the board has said that parents should be watchful of the use of mobile phones by their children and not admit their children, especially girls in co-education schools. It further asks Imams of the mosques to take Friday sermons and clerics to hold gatherings on teachings of the religion on marriage within the Muslim community and about the loss incurred from it in the herafter. ‚ÄúGenerally when such marriages take place, a notice is put up outside the marriage registry office with their names. It is an appeal to religious organisations, social workers, madrasa teachers and other responsible citizens, to visit the homes of these youngsters to motivate them against falling into a fit of passion. Not just after death but in life, too, such marriages of momentary passions are falling apart,‚Äù the document read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/marriage-of-muslims-outside-faith-regretful-unfortunate/articleshow/85085173.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Mumbai||Drugs case: No anticipatory bail for celeb manager Karishma Prakash||MUMBAI: A special NDPS court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of celebrity manager Karishma Prakash in a drugs case case being investigated in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. A former manager of Deepika Padukone, Prakash had sought the bail about nine months ago, on October 31. After the order was pronounced, following a plea submitted by the defence, the court granted a stay on the order until August 25. The defence submitted that interim protection was granted to Prakash by the court during the pendency of the application and that needs to be continued to enable her to approach the Bombay high court against the order. The defence sought for continuation of the interim protection for four weeks. Special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande opposed the application for continuation of the interim protection on the grounds that Prakash was not entitled to any leniency in view of her conduct during the pendency of the anticipatory bail plea. He also submitted that it would not be permissible for the court to continue the interim protection after the anticipatory bail plea was rejected. ‚Äú‚Ä¶[T]he applicant (Prakash) is seeking continuation of the interim protection for approaching the hon‚Äôble high court and it would be within the discretion of this court to continue the protection for a reasonable period. In view of above, interim protection granted to the applicant shall continue till August 25, 2021,‚Äù the court said. Special judge V V Vidwans said that in the meantime Prakash is directed to attend the office of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) once a week for the purpose of investigations. The special NDPS court specified that Prakash would have to provide her mobile phone number and address to the NCB if there is any change. The NCB had booked Prakash after it allegedly found 1.7g of hashish at her Versova home. NCB officials allegedly also seized three vials of CBD oil or cannabidiol, which has traces of cannabis. Prakash denied that she had consumed drugs. Sarpande had opposed the plea. The NCB alleged that during the examination of the suspected peddler‚Äôs cellphone, some links were found with Prakash. The NCB has been investigating a series of cases involving celebrities and drug peddlers. This probe was triggered by an investigation into a drug angle pertaining to Rajput‚Äôs alleged suicide on June 14, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-anticipatory-bail-for-celeb-manager-prakash/articleshow/85083120.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Dehradun||Will fill all vacant govt posts within a year of coming to power: Harish Rawat||Dehradun: The three-day-long Chitan Shivir of the Uttarakhand unit of Congress concluded in Rishikesh on Thursday. During the session, the party has decided to contest the upcoming assembly elections on three key issues ‚Äî unemployment, changes effected by the incumbent BJP government in land laws, and the creation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. After the event, former CM Harish Rawat told TOI, ‚ÄúThe last Uttarakhand Public Service Commission exam was held in my tenure in 2016. Since then, the BJP government has not been able to conduct the exam. If voted to office, we will ensure that all vacant government posts are filled up within a year.‚Äù Rawat asserted that if Congress is voted to office, it would make Uttarakhand Subordinate Services Selection Commission more active. ‚ÄúIf required, we will form more bodies to help provide employment opportunities to youths. At the same time, we will encourage self-employment through our resources. Besides, the unemployed people would be covered under the NYAY scheme, which would be launched after coming to power,‚Äù he added. Under the scheme, Congress plans to give Rs 6,000 every month to the bottom 20% of the population. The former CM also took a swipe at the BJP government for amending Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act and coming up with Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act. ‚ÄúThe Congress government led by ND Tiwari had placed a ceiling on land purchased by people of other states but former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat lifted the restriction to allow land mafias to purchase any desired amount of land in Uttarakhand. People are hurt by this decision. Similarly, people were against the Devasthanam Board but still, the BJP went ahead with its decision. We will take our message to people,‚Äù he added. Meanwhile, Congress state in-charge Devender Yadav said, ‚ÄúWe interacted with 10 committees and discussed ways like social media to reach out to maximum possible people. The findings of the three-day Chitan Shivir will help the party prepare better for the 2022 elections.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-fill-all-vacant-govt-posts-within-a-year-of-coming-to-power-harish-rawat/articleshow/85080599.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Lucknow||Congress to launch campaign against BJP on August 9-10||Lucknow: Intensifying its attack on the ruling BJP government ahead of the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections, the Congress Party will be launching the Bhajapa Gaddi Chordo Abhiyaan on the Quit India Movement Day. Under this, Congress workers will hold demonstrations at all the 403 Vidhan Sabha constituencies of the state on August 9 and 10. The move also aims at boosting morale of the newly appointed sub-district level infrastructure. Speaking about the campaign, UPCC president Ajay Lallu said: ‚ÄúThe state government has failed on all fronts and their faulty policies, myopic vision has made people from all walks of life suffer. The campaign aims to expose their wrongdoings.‚Äù Insiders claimed that the campaign is one of the many things planned by the party to build momentum against the ruling government. The training of divisional and district level leadership is in the final stages and applications for candidates are being taken. Sources said that more than 1,600 applications have been received by the UP Congress Committee. These are in addition to the 100 odd persons who have been indicated to contest the elections in 2022. ‚ÄúSome of these candidates met party national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her recent visit to the state. A few of them representing crucial seats are also being mentored by her team,‚Äù sources said. The party has also engaged an election management company for the state which is giving a final shape to its social media strategy and generating content that relates to the young voters. Lallu has already stated that Congress will not enter into any kind of tie-ups with any party to ensure that the efforts gone in re-building the organization over the past two years do not go in vain. However, the party leadership will take a final call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/congress-to-launch-campaign-against-bjp-on-august-9-10/articleshow/85085210.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||Delhi: Protest against Haj house plan at Dwarka, letter sent to Anil Baijal||NEW DELHI: The proposed construction of a Haj house at Dwarka‚Äôs sector 22 is being opposed by a large number of residents, including villagers, from the area on the ground that it will disturb ‚Äúbrotherhood, harmony and peace‚Äù. A huge gathering near the burial chowk on Friday morning ‚Äî which was described as a mahapanchayat‚Äî protested against the move with BJP functionaries and Hindu groups turning up to lend their voice. The pradhans of many villages who attended the meeting said they would not allow a Haj house to be constructed at the spot. Slogans of ‚ÄòJai Shri Ram‚Äô rent the air. The secretary of All Dwarka Residents Federation, B P Vaishnav, had in a letter to the LG on August 3 expressed his apprehension of law and order being disturbed.  ‚ÄúThere will be every possibility of riots, migration of Hindus and repetition of a situation like Shaheen Bagh, Jaffrabad and Kashmir,‚Äù he wrote. The immediate provocation seemed to be release of funds for the project on land allotted by DDA. The president of the Federation, Ajit Swami, said: ‚ÄúWe already have a mosque in Dwarka‚Äôs sector-11. If the government wants to construct one, it should be on waqf board land. Why use public money for this? The population of Muslims is very less in the area. The mosque has only around two dozen people visiting it,‚Äù he claimed. ‚ÄúThe Delhi government is trying to build its vote bank. If they want to build something, they should construct a school, hospital or park. Why are they making it for one community? Why are they wasting the taxpayers‚Äô money like this,‚Äù said Ram Kumar Solanki, pradhan of Palam village. The participants suggested that the government can easily expand the Haj house at the airport and should not make it in a residential locality. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta accused chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of supporting a particular community against the wishes of villagers for political gains when there is shortage of schools, colleges and hospitals in Delhi. Proclaiming ‚Äúwe are with the villagers‚Äù, Gupta too said it could be built on waqf board land or elsewhere but not at that spot. Rakesh Nambardar, pradhan of 28 villages, predicted there would be conflict.  ‚ÄúIn 2008, the Congress government had made the plan and took the land from DDA. Now, the AAP government has decided to release funds for it. If they have so much money, why not build something for the children! Our country is behind in Olympics and they can construct a stadium,‚Äù he said. Rakesh. Delhi State Haj Committee member Syed Shadab Hussain Rizvi Ashrafi pointed out that it was a government project and construction had not even started. ‚ÄúHaj is a message of peace and happens for about a month. The rest of the time is spent in preparations. It‚Äôs almost like a transit point. We heard about the protest and won‚Äôt say anything that will hamper peace and harmony,‚Äù said Ashrafi. ‚ÄúThe government can do whatever it likes. The Sheila Dikshit government laid the foundation stone and after that nothing has happened really,‚Äù said another committee member. For Hajis from around the country, Delhi is a nodal point. The Delhi government had prepared the building plans for a modern facility three years back. The Haj house would provide accommodation, prayer and dining spaces and even immigration facilities. It will then do away with the need for the pilgrims to stay at transit camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/protest-against-haj-house-plan-at-dwarka-letter-sent-to-baijal/articleshow/85116424.cms||---

He said the BJP should tender an unconditional apology to the people of Maharashtra for the CBI‚Äôs failure to arrive at a conclusion in the case. ‚ÄúA year has passed since the CBI took over the probe into the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and it is yet to reach any conclusion.

UAE authorities had initially decided to allow only those with residency permits to take flights out of India to the UAE, extending the relaxation to transit passengers as well. A source at Kolkata airport said two airlines are lined up to fly with passengers from Kolkata on Friday and Saturday as of now. Apart from that, Emirates has scheduled two flights on August 8 and 11. There is good demand on both flights. FlyDubai has a flight scheduled on August 13. The development brought cheer to business travellers who have been postponing important meetings due to the constraints. Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni said the relaxation would go a long way in easing travel pains that people from Kolkata have been experiencing since Gulf carriers stopped accepting Indians on board in April. ‚ÄúTravel to the US and Europe had become very difficult with few seats on offer and extremely high fares. Travel to the US is now costing around Rs 1.5 lakh-Rs 2 lakh while that to Europe is around Rs 1 lakh. Once Gulf carriers resume service, the cost will go down to Rs 80,000-Rs 90,000 and that to Europe will reduce to Rs 40,000,‚Äù Soni pointed out. Airlines sources said the initial flights that had been scheduled were recording good loads with those stranded desperate to return to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and other cities. However, some Indians who work in UAE and have taken the vaccine doses here will be unable to fly back with the authorities specifying that only those who have been vaccinated in the UAE will be allowed into the country. For transit passengers though, there is no such pre-condition. All they are required to do is furnish a visa and RT-PCR report from an accredited lab with QR code link. The test has to be done within 72 hours prior to departure. Meanwhile, queries poured in before airlines and Kolkata airport authorities about the flying norms to Dubai. ‚ÄúWe (family with a 6-year-old) are transit passengers from Kolkata to Amsterdam via Dubai. Does the child need to present a RT-PCR report? Final destination doesn‚Äôt need a report for kids up to 12-year-old,‚Äù wrote Bitihotra Chatterjee tagging Emirates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uae-flights-to-re-establish-citys-air-link-with-rest-of-the-world/articleshow/85080636.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Schools plan with caution but parents not keen on campus classes without vaccine||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee‚Äôs hint at reopening of schools in a restricted manner after the Puja vacation elicited myriad reactions‚Äîranging from hope, joy, relief to anxiety, fear and apprehension‚Äîfrom principals, teachers, parents as well as students. While excited children called each other up to share the news, parents‚Äô groups reflected anxiety, while school principals and teachers started discussing among themselves how students could be brought back to campus safely. Talks about the possibility of reopening of schools have been on for some time. But though the rate of Covid infection was low right now, the fear of the third wave was looming and much caution had been spread by doctors about the risk among children, both parents and schools pointed out. They hoped vaccination for children would roll out before the state decided to re-open schools so that the kids could get at least the minimum protection. Both schools and parents spoke about logistical issues, like safety of sending kids in pooled cars and availability of public transport. Schools said alternate-day class would lead to a lot of backlog and repetition as the hybrid mode could not work with their limited number of teachers and recruitment was impossible now. ‚ÄúChildren returning to school will help them cope better because not everyone is benefiting by the online mode. Parents are also finding it difficult to motivate children at times. But we can‚Äôt predict the infection scene after the Pujas,‚Äù said John Stephen, acting principal at La Martiniere for Boys. The need to vaccinate children before calling them to the campus was something that needed to be thought about, said Rupkatha Sarkar, principal at La Martiniere for Girls. Most schools had re-opened in February for lab-based practice and exams and also for pre-board exams but they had to shut down as children and teachers started to contract the novel coronavirus. ‚ÄúWhy vaccination alone, it is impossible for children to keep their masks on for such a long stretch,‚Äù said management faculty Sukanya Das, whose two children are in classes IX and III in La Martiniere for Boys. Her feelings were echoed by Subhra Ganguly, whose daughter, Shubhadrita, studies at Calcutta Girls‚Äô School. ‚ÄúI am happy about schools re-opening because we need to once again be around friends and our normal social set-up. But we hope vaccines for us will come in by then,‚Äù said the Class IX girl. Ayushman Sarkar, who scored 97% in CBSE X from DPS Ruby Park, said, ‚Äú It would give us such a relief from this monotony of online classes.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdults in school should follow all protocols and schools need to do a safety check continuously and inspections need to be carried out,‚Äù advised Rita Chatterjee, director of North Point Senior Secondary Boarding Schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-plan-with-caution-but-parents-not-keen-on-campus-classes-without-vaccine/articleshow/85083162.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||India||Rajya Sabha dy chair's remarks on suspended MP spark row||NEW DELHI: A day after 6 Trinamool MPs were suspended from Rajya Sabha for a day, a row broke out on Thursday when Deputy chairman Harivansh called a suspended member's conduct "highly deplorable and condemnable" while alleging that the MP, during the adjournment of the House on Wednesday, had broken the glass of a door, injuring a woman member of the security staff. However, the Opposition accused the deputy chairman for "supporting the wrong narrative" of the incident. Union minister Piyush Goyal said the chamber was closed for sanitisation and the MPs were trying to enter the chamber during that time. Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said the suspended MPs had returned to collect their belongings and "in the commotion, the glass pane was broken". As the TMC and other opposition MPs opposed the remarks, the House was adjourned. But despite the continued impasse over the Pegasus row and several other issues, Rajya Sabha managed to pass three important bills-the Constitution (Scheduled Tribe) Order (Amendment) Bill, the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill and the Essential Defence Services Bill. On the defence services bill, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh assured that House that it was not going to come in the way of anybody's right to protest peacefully. Congress accused the government of using the commotion to rush through the bill. Even while speaking on the bills, the opposition MPs kept raising issues related to snooping, farm laws and fuel price hike. Earlier in the House, Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge blamed the Centre for the stalemate and claimed that he had got a call from Rajnath Singh saying that he would resolve the issue once back from abroad, but no member of the opposition had got any official invite for any meeting. Singh said he had not given any assurance and had only said that the House should hold proper discussion and the pandemonium should stop. Proceedings in Lok Sabha were also marred by opposition protests. After repeated adjournments when the House met at 5 pm, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021. The bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act of 1961 and the Finance Act of 2021. Earlier amid the din, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan introduced the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, 202, that seeks to amend the Central Universities Act, 2009 for establishment of a university in the Union Territory of Ladakh. When the House met for the day, Speaker Om Birla congratulated the Indian hockey team for its Olympic medal after 41 years as well as women who won medals at the Tokyo Olympics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajya-sabha-dy-chairs-remarks-on-suspended-mp-spark-row/articleshow/85087584.cms||---

The facility aims to help students from government schools who aspire to join the National Defence Academy (NDA). In the first phase, 200 children would be selected for Super NDA 2022 and Super NDA 2023, officials said. A two-hour-long pen-and-paper exam will be organised across 22 centres ‚Äî one government school in each district ‚Äî and 1,400 students from the state have applied for the programme. ‚ÄúThis is a level-1 exam to select students for our free coaching facility. With the Covid situation under control, we found it feasible to hold offline examinations. Directions have been issued to district officials to make specific arrangements according to state government orders,‚Äù said a senior official from the education department. The education department has directed district officials to sanitise centres before the examination. Each centre should have two different entry and exit points and students should be allowed to move in a staggered manner. The centres have been asked to have a maximum of 18 students in one room and ensure that no one shares stationeries. The Super NDA programme is being conducted by the directorate of secondary education. Last month, the department had proposed to start a coaching facility for government school students who want to join NDA. ‚ÄúMost students in Haryana do not have adequate resources to prepare for the entrance. We want to bridge that gap,‚Äù education minister Kanwar Pal said. In the first edition, there will be 200 students. For the first group, 100 Class XII students would be selected and trained for NDA entrance scheduled in 2022. For the second batch, 100 students from Class XI will appear for NDA entrance in 2023. The programme will start on September 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/nda-coaching-1st-selection-exam-to-be-held-on-aug-10/articleshow/85094174.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

---||Kolkata||Bengal makes Covid negative report mandatory for flyers from Maharashtra, TN||KOLKATA: The state on Thursday took guard against the possible third wave of Covid-19 by announcing that RT-PCR test will be made mandatory for incoming passengers from Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu from August 8. On Wednesday, Maharashtra recorded 6,005 new Covid cases while Tamil Nadu recorded 1,949 fresh cases. West Bengal, in contrast, had registered 826 new cases on Wednesday. Currently, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the city has around 12 flights from Mumbai, six from Chennai and three from Pune. The airport used to have flights to and from Nagpur but the sector has been suspended for quite some time. ‚ÄúFollowing the state government‚Äôs decision to allow passengers with double vaccination, loads at the aircraft had increased significantly. Most of the flights were running full and some additional flights were also introduced in these sectors. Now that the order has been revoked, it is likely to take a toll on the passenger count from these destinations,‚Äù said an airline official in Kolkata. In a letter sent to civil aviation secretary P S Kharola by state additional chief secretary B P Gopalika, the state announced the decision to make the RT-PCR test mandatory for flyers from Pune, Mumbai and Chennai from August 8. The tests have to be conducted within 72 hours prior to flight departure. From other cities, only those passengers who are not fully vaccinated need to undergo the Covid test. Since last year, flights from cities in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu along with Gujarat have been restricted to only three days a week to limit the number of people arriving from these cities that have had higher prevalence of Covid cases. Delhi had also initially figured on the list but was taken off it in December. When the state had on July 19 announced the decision to withdraw the mandatory RT-PCR tests for fully vaccinated passengers, business travellers were particularly relieved as they had been avoiding trips to Bengal unless absolutely necessary to avoid the hassle of taking time out for the RT-PCR test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-ve-report-again-a-must-for-maha-tn-flyers/articleshow/85080670.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Delhi||Delhi: Metro security their job, but they save lives too||NEW DELHI: For the personnel of Central Industrial Security Force deployed at Delhi Metro stations, a day‚Äôs work could include saving a life. Resuscitating unconscious passengers by acting as first responders is in many ways a much easier task than persuading suicidal individuals not to do anything drastic. But the CISF men have succeeded in both ‚Äî and saved 16 lives this year. In four cases, the uniformed jawans administered emergency CPR to unconscious individuals, including a male passenger at Indraprastha metro station in February and another at Dabri Mor metro station in January. ‚ÄúCISF personnel are provided special training to carry out CPR in emergencies. If any passenger is found unconscious inside the metro train or on the station premises, the quick-reaction team, or the nearest jawan, rushes to the spot and provides CPR. If done correctly and in a timely manner, CPR can save a person‚Äôs life,‚Äù said a CISF officer. While patrolling the station on security duty, the khaki-clad men also keep an eye on the people, ready to identify passengers who may be behaving abnormally or appear disturbed. ‚ÄúWe often approach such passengers. There have been cases of passengers contemplating jumping in front of an approaching train or simply leaping from the height of the station to the busy street below. We convince them not to and counsel them,‚Äù said the officer. They have been particularly instructed to be observant of such aberrant behaviour due to the stress caused in society by the Covid-19 pandemic. There were two such cases recently. Last week, CISF constable Nandlal Ram earned a cash reward of Rs 10,000 and a commendation certificate from the director general, CISF, for preventing a 23-year-old woman from jumping off the metro station at Sector 28, Faridabad. Ram spotted the woman climbing a sidewall and perching on a concrete ledge high above the road, her intention clearly to throw herself down in an attempt to kill herself. The constable calmed her down and persuaded her to climb back to safety. The CISF officer said, ‚ÄúNandlal kept telling her that everything would be fine and was able to convince the woman not to take the leap.‚Äù Another such attempt was thwarted on Tuesday. A 21-year-old jumped in front of an approaching train at Janakpuri West metro station, but the train driver noticed her and applied the brakes. The CISF team ran down to the tracks and pulled her out from under the train and took her to the nearest hospital, where she was treated for her injuries. What is more, noticing the woman‚Äôs torn clothes, a constable took off his paramilitary fatigue top and covered her with it to spare her any embarrassment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-security-their-job-but-they-save-lives-too/articleshow/85083288.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

They alleged that most of the ward committees had the relatives and friends of councillors and senior MCG officials as their members and did not have any representation from the RWAs. The residents had anyway been protesting against the committees for some time, but their decision to take their complaints to the chief minister‚Äôs door followed a resolution in the MCG House that all parks would now be maintained by the ward committees. Parks are usually maintained by the RWAs under supervision of MCG. But in sectors where the RWA is involved in some dispute, the ward committees have been given theresponsibility.The RWA members alleged that in areas where the committees proposed a project, residents were neither informed about any development work nor any feedback was taken from them. ‚ÄúResidents are faced with civic problems such as sanitation, overflowing drains, bad roads and waterlogging. When we buy a plot, we pay for each service, such as parks, community centres, etc. Then, why are we not involved in decision-making and monitoring of projects?‚Äù asked Pramod Sharma, president of UERWA.Mayor Madhu Azad denied the allegations. ‚ÄúI was not aware of the matter. However, whenever any development work is carried out, suggestions and feedback of people are always incorporated.

---||Kolkata||Tech brakes on speeding on Kolkata flyovers||Kolkata: Kolkata Traffic Police has decided to use cutting-edge technology to put a brake on speeding on flyovers and bridges that have witnessed several accidents this year. Police has either installed latest cameras or deployed part-time speed-reading cameras and laser speed guns at multiple such bridges. Howrah bridge has became the latest to get a speed-camera signage ‚Äî on the Howrah station-bound flank end. This is a spot where, cops claimed through data, that buses trying to complete their trips on time often overspeed. Such a facility is already existing on Maa flyover and AJC Bose flyover. ‚ÄúThe aim is to stop buses and private cars from suddenly speeding towards the down slope. If this happens, chances of accidents always tend to be higher. In the past one month, we saw such accidents on Vidyasagar Setu where trucks ended up hitting two-wheelers. On Durgapur bridge, a private car hit a bicyclist and on Brabourne Road flyover, a bus ran over a man. We have drawn a conclusion from experience that vehicles remain alert when such boards are set up to record speed. There is a fear that they might get prosecuted if they overspeed,‚Äù said an officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said there was a dynamic process of choosing the spot to set up cameras. ‚ÄúOur priority areas get changed according to ground realities and our internal surveys. As of now, we are keen on cutting down road accidents on flyovers. Recording the speed of vehicles, especially on bridges, is important,‚Äù said DC Sinha. Motorists, however, wondered if these speed signage were ‚Äúoverdoing‚Äù things. ‚ÄúEven when driving around 40km/hr, these are sending out alert signage,‚Äù wondered one motorist. Cops said they had identified the spots from where bikes get ‚Äúunrestricted access to flyovers without any checks‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe have informed Lalbazar that we need access control at these points. We want strict access control on Garden Reach and Lake flyovers,‚Äù said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tech-brakes-on-speeding-on-kolkata-flyovers/articleshow/85080693.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

However, a final decision will be taken after the cabinet meeting scheduled next week, said a senior official. The school fee issue is likely to come up for discussion a third time at the cabinet meeting. Addressing the media after last week‚Äôs meeting, minister for school education Varsha Gaikwad had said the government would issue a notification instructing all private schools to reduce fees by 15% within a day or two. However, no notification has been issued so far. On Wednesday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a discussion with the state advocate general and senior officials from the school education department where the issue was reviewed. The legal aspects and mechanism for implementation and monitoring if the state directed private schools to reduce fees were among issues that were discussed. ‚ÄúHowever, no concrete decision was arrived at,‚Äù said an official. Gaikwad was not available for comment despite repeated attempts. Sources said after hearing from the AG, Thackeray asked the education department to table a draft ordinance, suggesting amendments in the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fees-act-likely-to-be-amended/articleshow/85086383.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Various government departments have been roped in with a collective target to provide self-employment opportunities to 46,500 youth in the state. Reviewing the drive, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the objective of self-reliant India would be fulfilled only through self-employment. The CM directed the officials to complete the targets set within the stipulated time period. ‚ÄúUnder various schemes, people should not have any problem in taking loans from banks, so that coordination should be ensured with all the bankers. To connect the people with self-employment and solve their various problems, camps for self-employment should be held in all the districts. For this, the chief development officer should be made the nodal officer in each district,‚Äù Dhami said. In the employment camp, district level officers and bank officials would give information to people about various schemes of the Central and state governments. Besides, they have been asked to find on spot solutions to the problem faced by people in starting their own work. The camps to encourage self-employment would be held in all the districts from September 1 to 15. The CM said, ‚ÄúThe district level officers and bank officials will ensure the loan approval process after disposing of all the applications. Loans of all the applicants found to be correct should be sanctioned by September 30.‚Äù For speedy disposal of applications received in banks for loans, the senior officers of the bank would be asked to monitor the developments at the branch level. Dhami said, ‚ÄúIt is the responsibility of all of us to reach the public welfare schemes to the people at the last end of the society.‚Äù The CM gave targets to the main departments related to self-employment under various schemes. A target of 10,000 self employment has been given to the rural development department, 1,500 to social welfare, 4,000 to animal husbandry, 26,000 to urban, 4,500 to industry and 500 to tourism department. Soon after taking charge as the CM, Dhami had announced 22,000 government jobs for youths. The state government aims to start the recruitment process for the vacant posts soon. Notably, there are around 8 lakh unemployed youths registered with the state employment exchange. Meanwhile, the government department has decided to encourage people towards self-employment by promoting success stories of local entrepreneurs. ‚ÄúWe will motivate the people, who wish to start their own work, with these success stories. The objective is to make people realise that small efforts lead to major success in life,‚Äù the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-camps-from-sept-1-to-encourage-self-employment/articleshow/85080720.cms||Kautilya Singh

Twenty-five people, including pimps, brothel owners and clients, were arrested. ‚ÄúThe seven girls from Bihar were forced into prostitution. They mostly dance at local parties in Bihar and, during the lean period, they had to work at the brothel. The rest from Bengal were mostly sold off after being lured by job offers,‚Äù said Ananya Chakraborti, the chairperson of West Bengal commission for protection of child rights (WBCPCR). The girls were shifted to a West Burdwan home and the Bihar residents will be later shifted to the state, officials said. Officials of NGOs Shakti Vahini and Bachhpan Bachao Andolan said the rescue operation holds special significance as it presents a case of reverse trafficking. ‚ÄúSo far, we have seen how girls from Bengal were being pushed into bondage in the name of performing at weddings and dance bars in Bihar, and most of them were later pushed into sex rackets. But now, with most survivors found to be from Bihar, it shows that trafficking will not follow a set pattern where a large section of the population is in deep financial stress,‚Äù said Rishikant, who works closely with survivors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/22-teens-rescued-from-life-in-brothel/articleshow/85080718.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After one-year Covid-19 delay, Mahim gets a new beachfront||MUMBAI: Mahim Reti Bunder, a dumpyard till a few years ago, has been cleaned and majorly worked upon by the BMC to turn it into an accessible open space. The stretch now has a new layer of clean sand, a British-era promenade that has been repaired and placed with benches, a watchtower offering uninterrupted views of the sea and also equipment for exercising. Civic officials said the redone beachfront would be fully ready for use in a fortnight. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray inspected the site on Thursday, and tweeted that it was amazing to see the makeover. TimesViewMumbai desperately needs more open spaces and the transformation of Mahim Reti Bunder into a new beachfront will be a welcome addition for citizens of this congested neighbourhood. However, the BMC must be mindful that ongoing reclamations in other parts of the city for the coastal road does not lead to beach erosion.In January 2020, the BMC began revamping 57,000 sq metres of the beach after taking over from the Mumbai Port Trust, which had jurisdiction over the area. Civic officials said they found that there was no sand left on the beach; instead, red soil had covered massive portions of the stretch. Therefore, it was decided to transport 3,000 cubic metres of sand from Haji Ali, where reclamation work is going on for the Coastal Road. Assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar of G North ward said sustainable works were taken up, including the planting of around 250 casuarina trees, which are commonly known as Suru trees. ‚ÄúWe have also used material like concrete for the construction of seaters for those taking a walk on the promenade; these permanent structures do not run the risk of being stolen or damaged by miscreants. A number of eco-friendly wooden open gym equipment will also be placed on the beach front in a few days, for the benefit of visitors.‚Äù Shiv Sena corporator Milind Vaidya said the area got its name as years ago, reti (sand) would be transported by the local community via boat from Bhayander to Mahim. ‚ÄúHowever, after transportation shut down over two decades ago, encroachments started taking place. There were also several shops selling bamboo that were set up along the stretch. I am glad that the beachfront is being revamped and a new open space has been created for the residents of my ward,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-one-year-covid-19-delay-mahim-gets-a-new-beachfront/articleshow/85083257.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kolkata||Rain, stagnant water put Salt Lake residents‚Äô health at risk||KOLKATA: The residents of Salt Lake are staring at a grave health issue with several pockets getting frequently swamped with heavy showers and stagnant water flowing into their underground reservoirs. The VIP township‚Äôs houses are designed in such a way that the driveways have garages at the far end, with the underground reservoirs built below. The driveways are slightly higher than the street level. So, stagnant water that is refusing to go down easily these days readily flows into the driveways and the reservoirs, causing a serious health hazard for the residents. Even as some manage to empty the dirty water out of the reservoirs and refill them by buying water from the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC), most of the residents are resigned to the risk of contamination and continue to use the same water that has gone into the reservoirs from the streets. Aruna Chatterjee, an octogenarian resident, said, ‚ÄúIt is impossible for me to empty the reservoir and the overhead tank and then have them refilled every time there is waterlogging. I have tried buying mineral water for a few days. For washing and other purposes, we are pumping in the same contaminated water from the reservoir.‚Äù A senior BMC official said, ‚ÄúI am afraid that people will have to live with the problem this monsoon because the adjoining Kestopur and Bagjola canals, which drain out the accumulated water from Salt Lake and VIP Road, haven‚Äôt been dredged for more than a year now.‚Äù If the canals filled to the brim cause waterlogging, some residents are to be blamed too. They have blocked the drainage channels leading to the gully pits, as a team of engineers, sent to these areas by urban development minister Chandrima Bhattacharya on Thursday, found. ‚ÄúSome residents have covered their driveways with marble slabs. They have concreted or covered the channels, which are supposed to drain the water into the gully pits, for car parking or beautification,‚Äù said an engineer. ‚ÄúThe larger ramification is the health issue, especially with the third wave and contagion looming. People are forced to use the dirty water that has seeped into our underground reservoirs and even drink it,‚Äù said Falguni Mukherjee, a resident of AE block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-stagnant-water-put-salt-lake-residents-health-at-risk/articleshow/85080748.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Principals and vice-chancellors attribute the spike in applications to a number of factors, including a very large number of students passing Class XII boards, more students meeting the eligibility criteria to apply for various subjects, no maximum limit on subjects a student can apply for in most colleges and waiver of application fee by the government. Most top colleges said the number of applications has crossed five figures in less than four days for a few hundred seats that they have at the undergraduate level. Principals are expecting the numbers to rise further as admission portals will remain open till August 20. ‚ÄúWe have already received 18,000 applications for the 2,300 seats till Thursday evening. There are lot of applications for commerce and English,‚Äù said Asok Mukhopadhyay, principal of Seth Anandram Jaipuria College. Jadavpur University has received over 15,000 applications for its UG courses in humanities and science subjects, which have a combined seat strength of less than 1,000. ‚ÄúSuch high numbers have never been seen in less than 100 hours from the start of the admission procedure,‚Äù said a university official who is part of the admission committee. Presidency University opened its admission portal after WBJEE Board cancelled the admission tests. ‚ÄúApplications have crossed five figures already,‚Äù said an official. Goenka College for Commerce and Business Administration has received over 3,000 applications for 549 seats while Basanti Devi College received 3,180 applications till Thursday evening for 986 seats. New Alipore College has received more than 5,000 applications for its 2,100 seats. ‚ÄúThis is three times the number we received last year in as many days,‚Äù said principal Jaydeep Sarangi. At Bangabasi College, 13,500 applications were received till Thursday afternoon for 2,799 seats. ‚ÄúThe maximum number of applications are for English, Bengali, geography, physics and commerce,‚Äù said Partha Ghosh, a senior professor at the college. Lady Brabourne College principal Siuli Sarkar said the number of applications in the first three days surpassed her expectations. ‚ÄúA high number of students are able to meet the eligibility criteria to apply for various subjects. This is one of the reasons behind such a high number of applications,‚Äù said Mukhopadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/applications-cross-5-figures-in-4-days-in-most-colleges/articleshow/85080725.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The accused told police that they had purchased the sand boa from a local snake charmer in Kheri for Rs 10 lakh and were trying to smuggle it to Mumbai, where they planned to sell it for Rs 50 lakh. Sanjay Tyagi, SHO of Isanagar police station, said the accused -- Shalu Kashyap, Mukesh Kashyap, Sandeep Singhla ‚Äì are businessmen, and Afsar is their driver. Tyagi said, ‚ÄúPolice set up pickets after a tip-off that some people were trying to smuggle a Red Sand Boa from Dudhwa. While checking vehicles, the snake was found in a wooden box in the SUV. All four men in the vehicle were taken into custody and booked under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act. The snake has been handed over to the forest department.‚Äù The Red Sand Boa is a non-venomous species known for its blunt rounded tail, which often gives it the appearance of being double-headed. It is classified as ‚Äúnear threatened‚Äù by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Due to their ‚Äúdouble-headed‚Äù appearance, these snakes are associated with myths and superstitions and hence attract a high price in China and several South Asian countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/four-delhi-men-going-to-mumbai-with-red-sand-boa-snake-held-in-kheri/articleshow/85075348.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The meet was called to seek justice for minorities in the context of the death of Father Stan Swamy, the Jesuit priest who fought for tribal rights and whose death as an undertrial has been condemned by the Christian world as ‚Äúunlawful killing‚Äù. Bishop Canning, the president of BCC, inaugurated the forum and said that, if necessary, minorities will even fight elections from this platform to highlight their rights. ‚ÄúFather Stan Swamy was killed because he was bringing to the fore the rights of the tribals. We should continue the fight started by Father Stan,‚Äù said Bishop Caning, the convenor of the Minority Forum. Apart from both clergy and lay Christians, the meeting was attended by representatives from the Muslim, Jain and Buddhist communities. Sikhs and other minority religions have also been invited to join. ‚ÄúWe need to hold workshops and seminars in cities, district towns and villages. A large section of the minorities is poor and lacks education. Hence, they lead an insecure existence, always scared to ask for even basic rights. We will not let that happen any more,‚Äù Bishop Canning said. Angelina Mantosh Jasnani, president of the Catholic Association of Bengal, which is a part of the BCC and has also joined the forum, said, ‚ÄúWe need to be united. Minorities should know they have a platform that will fight for them. So we need them to join in large numbers.‚Äù Though there will be representations of religious heads in the forum along with the laity, it was said that this platform will not be the same as inter-faith religious forums. Religious issues will not be discussed here. The focus, instead, will be on rights being trampled on and issues will be taken up with the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/forum-set-up-to-seek-justice-for-minorities/articleshow/85080727.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Aurangabad||Addnl staff of over 2,200 needed to deal with 3rd wave: GMCH||Aurangabad: The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) needs at least one doctor for every 10 patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and one nurse for every five patient in order to prevent deaths and improve quality of healthcare during the third wave of Covid-19. At the ward-level, other than ICU, one doctor and one nurse is needed for every 20 and 10 patients respectively. Dr Meenakshi Bhattacharya, head of medicine department at GMCH, has made a detailed presentation before the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) as part of preparedness against the possible future outbreak of Covid-19. ‚ÄúCurrently, the ratio between doctors and patients and that between staff nurse and patients is skewed anticipating the future health challenge. The GMCH will be needing more manpower in future for effective battle against the possible third wave of the pandemic,‚Äù Bhattacharya said. In its presentation before the DDMA, the GMCH administration has highlighted the need of additional 2,239 posts, including those for ICU, in the form of specialist doctors, nurses and support staff. The desired workforce is expected a requirement of Rs 6.10 crore per month towards payment of salaries. When contacted, Aurangabad resident deputy collector Anant Gavhane said the government keeps providing additional manpower to GMCH in keeping with the severity of the pandemic situation. ‚ÄúDuring the second wave of Covid-19, around 550 additional workforce involving doctors and healthcare workers was hired on temporary basis for the GMCH,‚Äù he said. Regarding the threat of possible third wave, the GMCH administration said if such a phase occurs, it could be ‚Äúsevere or worse‚Äù due to the delta plus variant of Covid. Slow pace of vaccination and no vaccination among children and adolescents so far are some of the major threats that the GMCH has listed out. The GMCH ‚Äî serving as Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March last year ‚Äî has offered treatment to 10,568 patients, including 3,004 Covid deaths till Thursday morning. The GMCH administration, in its presentation before DDMA, has mentioned referral of critically or terminally ill Covid patients from other hospitals situated in urban and rural areas as the reason for deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/addnl-staff-of-over-2200-needed-to-deal-with-3rd-wave-gmch/articleshow/85075318.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Hyderabad||HC declines to take up CS plea to recall stay on GO||Hyderabad: The high court on Thursday refused to take up chief secretary (CS) Somesh Kumar‚Äôs plea to recall the restraint order on GO 208 on an urgent basis. The HC said it saw no urgency in the matter and posted it for Monday. The GO pertains to granting Rs 59 crore ‚Äòtowards pending contempt cases before the HC‚Äô and enables the chief commissioner of land administration to draw this money from 2021-22 budget. When advocate general BS Prasad made a fervent appeal to a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy to vacate the restraint order saying that the petitioner had misunderstood the purport of the GO, the bench made it clear that it was not the petitioner who was on the wrong but the language employed in the GO itself was misleading. ‚ÄúYour legal department failed to vet the contents of the GO in a proper manner,‚Äù the bench said. Earlier on Wednesday, the HC had restrained the state from releasing any money under the GO after the PIL by a lecturer from Mahbubnagar district described it as a fund to meet legal expenses to defend the CS in nearly 200 contempt cases over violation of court orders. While the petitioner contended that this was a GO of the CS, issued by the CS and for the CS, the AG rejected the interpretation and said that the purpose of the GO was to release compensation to those who lost their properties and had got court orders for securing the amount. ‚ÄúThis money is not for defending the CS in the contempt cases as has been alleged by the petitioner,‚Äù the AG said. The CS too in his affidavit mentioned court orders that came after the HC took up the letter written by the Mahbubnagar district judge narrating woes of farmers whose land was taken away by the state but compensation not paid. ‚ÄúThough we sanctioned an amount of Rs 450 crore last year itself for the purpose, a part of it could not be realised due to freezing measures imposed by the state government in the backdrop of the pandemic. What we are seeking to do now is to realise the same this year,‚Äù the CS said. The bench, however, declined to take it up immediately and said it would hear the matter on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-declines-to-take-up-cs-plea-to-recall-stay-on-go/articleshow/85085356.cms||---

While the leading aggregators demand up to 30% of the menu price from restaurant owners, Foodoyes won‚Äôt take a commission from the restaurants, the founder claimed. ‚ÄúWe will be taking a subscription charge of Rs 100 per day, only if there is an order on that day. And this charge is irrespective of the number of the orders taken by that restaurant,‚Äù he said. On Chingam 1st, Foodoyes is going live with pan-Kerala coverage. ‚ÄúOurs is a social media platform dedicated to food only. One couldn‚Äôt order food seeing a post on Facebook or Instagram, directly on that platform. You have to do it using an aggregator? However, ours is a platform that allows users to buy food from the listed restaurants,‚Äù Anukrishnan said. According to him, the leading food aggregators had been demanding a commission of up to 30% on the menu price of the food, which is eating into the profitability of restaurant owners in a significant manner. ‚ÄúWhat the existing aggregators do is that they list Rs 100 worth food as Rs 115-130 on their platform. On top of that, there will be GST, packing and delivery charges and tip to the valet. Finally, the bill will be high,‚Äù Anukrishnan said. With Quikr as the delivery partner, Foodoyes will be charging only the delivery charges on top of the menu price of the food, Anukrishnan claimed. The platform, designed primarily as a social media one, also provides enough recreation for the users to immerse in. ‚ÄúYou can watch what other foodies are posting and could follow them. One could also post or share his or her own recipes online,‚Äù Anukrishnan said. What makes Foodoyes different is the option to monetize the videos posted by the users, Anukrishnan said. ‚ÄúWhen somebody views your video posted on our platform, points will be added to your wallet which in turn could be redeemed when you shop on Foodoyes next. These wallet coupons is an innovation we have introduced,‚Äù he said. Son of a carpenter, Anukrishnan was educated at Government Polytechnic College Meenangadi and worked with Xpertcube before setting up his startup along with his brother Manukrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-game-changer-in-online-food-world/articleshow/85080736.cms||Shenoy Karun

Seven blocks in the region were put on the block by the ministry of coal, and the two blocks allotted have gone to private parties. The other block is at Bhivkund in Chandrapur district. This has gone to city-based Sunflag Iron and Steel Company Limited. The blocks have geological reserves of 83 and 102 million tonnes respectively. The blocks allotted are for underground mines, which consume less land as compared to opencast mines. No bids were received for four blocks and a single offer came for another, leading to annulation of proceedings. Like Gondkhairi, Hingna-Bazargaon block, was also in close proximity to the city. However, no bids were received for it. Other PSU mines are already operating within a distance of 30-60km of Nagpur city. Only two companies each took part in the auctions for both Gondkhairi and Bhivkund blocks. The government had decided a few months ago to go ahead with the auction even if only two bidders take part, said a source. These blocks had been allotted to other companies under the earlier system of direct allotment, which later led to the coalgate controversy. The allotments were scrapped and the blocks put on auction. The Gondkhairi block is along the Nagpur-Amravati Road, with no villages in the block itself, and the nearest habitation in Gondkhairi, Waddhamna and Kalambi villages. This block had earlier been allotted to three companies; Maharashtra Seamless, Dhariwal Infrastructure, and Kesoram Industries. The Hingna-Bazargaon block is in Hingna, and was earlier allotted to Mahagenco, which gave it up citing unviability based on a consultant‚Äôs report. BJP‚Äôs Hingna MLA Sameer Meghe had also opposed the mine, saying it would displace a number of people. Both Adani Power and Sunflag had bid for the Gondkhairi coal block. Adani won by offering a rate of 9.5% above the base price, assuring government annual revenue of Rs122 crore. Sunflag pipped Aurobondio Reality ‚Äî an arm of Hyderabad‚Äôs Aurbodino Pharma, by offering 9% premium on the base price, giving the government Rs799.35 crore a year. Aurobindo Realty had got the Takli-Jena coal block in Chandrapur district in the earlier round of auctions held in December last year. The other coal blocks on offer were Dahegaon-Makardhokra IV, Khapa & Extension, Dahegaon Dhapewada-Tondakhairi-Khandala, Hingna-Bazaargaon, and Kalambi-Kalmeshwar. Only one bid was received for Dahegaon-Makardhokra IV block, and no bids were received for the remaining four. Adani Power Maharashtra runs the Tiroda power plant in Gondia district. A company spokesperson at Ahmedabad confirmed the development, without giving any further details. SK Gupta, who heads Sunflag Iron and Steel Limited, said no plans have been drawn up yet. However, the company plans to start operations at the earliest. Coal in these blocks can be mined for commercial sale or captive use. Adani‚Äôs block has over 110 hectares of forest area. There is no forest area in the Bhivkund block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/adani-co-bags-coal-block-at-gondkhairi/articleshow/85082061.cms||Shishir Arya

Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla‚Äôs order was passed on a petition by Ashish Patel, whose son on April 10, 2019 was allotted Edubridge International School in an online RTE process. He urged HC to direct admission of his son, now seven, to class 1 for 2021-22. The school, run by Chankya Gyan Kendra trust, said it was a minority unaided educational institution and exempted from RTE. Its minority status was certified in February 2020. Its advocate, Pradeep Bakhru, said any administrative or executive direction cannot impinge upon its rights as a minority institution. He said there was an alternative IB school the boy could go to and ‚Äúhe will not have the ability to cope with rigours of international school‚Äù. To the judges‚Äô query, Bakhru said before it got a minority certificate (MC) the school admitted four students under RTE. ‚ÄúIf you granted him admission before getting the certificate, would you have removed him from school?‚Äô‚Äô asked Justice Dhanuka. Bakhru said it could not cancel admission once granted. While Bakhru said the school was included on the RTE portal under pressure, the judges accepted Patel‚Äôs advocates‚Äô C R Sadasivan and Anup Dhannawat‚Äôs submission that the school voluntarily came on it. They said a government hospital recommended regular school for the boy with further advice. The judges said the school was directed to admit the boy prior to getting a minority certificate. They said the school‚Äôs ‚Äúdisobedience‚Äù of BMC‚Äôs directive cannot be condoned by getting an MC subsequently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-directs-ib-school-to-admit-autistic-child-within-a-week/articleshow/85083307.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Jaipur||Budget thrust next year would be on education, says Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chairing the second meeting of the economic advisory committee, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said that the reduced compensation of GST losses and less than estimated payout from the divisible pool of central taxes have complicated the fiscal situation of the state. Despite the lower payout by the Centre, the state government has managed its finances prudently to fund programs and initiatives of departments like education, health, water, electricity road and infrastructure. He said Rajasthan is one of the few states which have been able to spend more for various programmes despite reduced share of taxes from the Centre. ‚ÄúWe are trying to fulfill all the promises made in the manifesto,‚Äù he said in a release. He said in the current budget, the focus was on improving health infrastructure and in the coming budget the thrust would be on education. He said that Rajasthan was estimated to get Rs 50,000 crore in 2020-21 from the Centre‚Äôs divisible pool of taxes as per the 15th finance commission. ‚ÄúBut now we are getting only Rs 32,000 crore,‚Äù he said. In central assistance programmes for water and others, the ratio of funding used to be 90% by the Centre and 10% by the states. ‚ÄúNow, the ratio is 50:50 which has put additional burden on the states,‚Äù he added. Similarly, from the divisible pool of fuel taxes, the state government‚Äôs share is coming down steadily, he claimed. In order to fight Covid, the state government has increased oxygen beds by 149%, ICU beds by 64% and ventilator beds by 87%. ‚ÄúIn the last two and half years, 90,000 recruitments have been done for providing better health services and another 81,000 recruitment are under process,‚Äù he claimed. The meeting was attended by several senior ministers of the government, including members of the advisory committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/budget-thrust-was-on-health-this-year-next-yr-it-would-be-education-gehlot/articleshow/85083297.cms||---

In the judgment, Justice Devan Ramachandran said, ‚Äú ...Life as a new mother is like being on a roller-coaster and being a working mother is tougher. The minutiae of motherhood can never be properly contemplated and it involves navigation through myriad daily issues, which ultimately determine the health and future of the child. The mother‚Äôs constant proximity to the child is scientifically proven to be absolutely unexpendable and this, primarily and inter alia, is why the provisions for maternity leave are now internationally accepted.‚Äù The court considered a petition by Vandhana Sreemedha J, who was engaged as a counsellor on contract basis at the Women and Child Development Department at Kollam collectorate since 2016. She was denied maternity leave and then terminated from service citing unauthorized absence when she took leave to take care of her baby. Moreover, the director of Women and Child Development Department threatened disciplinary action against Kollam district child protection officer for offering employment to the petitioner without noting that the applicant had just delivered a baby. On this, the court said, ‚Äú ...this attitude is not one which this Court can countenance in this century, when women essay several roles, take on variegated responsibilities and require to be adept multitaskers, to survive and find wings to achieve their legitimate ambitions. It is certainly my hortative hope that the endeavors of such industrious women ought to obtain unstinted support and encouragement, but the orders impugned in this writ petition can only serve to undermine the confidence and morale of persons like the petitioner...‚Äù The court ordered the director to reinstate the petitioner forthwith and reconsider her application for maternity leave within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-contract-staff-eligible-for-maternity-leave/articleshow/85080796.cms||---

The civic bodies have exposed many of its commuters to massive risks as arterial roads connecting Raja Park and residential colonies including Tilak Nagar, Gurunanak Pura are not repaired properly after digging work. Residents complaining on the issue have now lost hope of these roads getting repaired as the municipal corporation is not willing to attend to their complaints, this monsoon. Santana Khurana, a resident of Shanti Path, said, ‚ÄúI lodged a complaint on July 1 before monsoon at JMC. Despite of rigorous followup, the civic bodies did not take up the work and poor condition of roads prevails. What surprised me was my complaints were claimed to be disposed off without redressing the issue or giving an appropriate reply by the agencies,‚Äù Another resident, Simran Narang of Yash Path, said, ‚ÄúAfter rains, waterlogging prevails on the road and accidents have become regular affair as soil filled in the trenches after laying pipelines is washed away. Many motorists have fallen due to this carelessness.‚Äù People have been criticising the civic body officials for allowing digging of roads and taking up such works during monsoon season. People allege that after the recent rains, open trenches in their colony roads have gone deeper and bigger, while the bigger ones have turned dangerous, posing a threat to the two-wheeler riders. Like every year, the directorate of local bodies (DLB) had directed all the civic bodies to complete the road repairing works before monsoon.

The problem of waterlogging in Narela Industrial Estate was also discussed, a government official said.  Satyendar Jain said that maintenance/desilting of drains and even construction of new drains, if required, should be done at the earliest. ‚ÄúThese steps should be taken in not only Narela, but also all vulnerable locations in the city, so that the people of Delhi don‚Äôt face any problems due to waterlogging.‚Äù The minister asked the officials to become more active in addressing the waterlogging-related complaints. ‚ÄúThe foremost responsibility of a responsible government is to not take any problem being faced by the people lightly,‚Äù Jain said. In a meeting held last month, the minister had directed the officials concerned to deploy pumps on inundated roads and refurbish the roads that were damaged by waterlogging.

---||Goa||Goa: Rare mushroom species found in Bandora, yet to be named||PANAJI: A rare mushroom species, recently discovered in Bandora, Goa, has been identified as a species new to science and is in the process of being given a name. The mushroom species is being documented as part of efforts by the Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) and microbiologist Dr Nandakumar Kamat to identify the different types of mushrooms in Goa. ‚ÄúWe have found lots of exciting new species but due to the pandemic we are unable to study them in a laboratory. Yet we have enough information and it is a shocking finding that came out of such a micro-level intensive drive,‚Äù Dr Kamat said. Chairperson of the Bandora biodiversity committee Adv Surel Tilve said that they have identified 118 different types of mushrooms in the jurisdiction of which 12 are rare species and three have been recorded for the first time in Goa and one has been recorded for the first time in India. ‚ÄúYet another one is a species completely new to science. Currently, we are in the process of validating this species,‚Äù Tilve said. Bandora-resident and a radiologist at GMC Devesh Naik was the first to stumble upon the species and had photographed it to prove his finding. The search was carried out by GSBB by involving locals that have forest knowledge as well as scientists that are experts in the field. Geo-locations of the new findings were marked so that researchers can revisit the space next year for study. ‚ÄúThis is an example for the entire country of how biodiversity boards should work with trained microbiologists and the local communities to explore the biological wealth. This way, India will excel in research. We need new anti-virals, anti-cancer drugs, industrial chemicals and antibiotics,‚Äù Kamat said. There are two stages of claiming a novel species ‚Äì tentative identification wherein the species is not named and laboratory study with the description and publication of the species. ‚ÄúInstructions that need to be followed with the identification process has been followed by the people. When we claim that a certain species is new, we have to carry out intensive study of the species in the laboratory and the publication will be possible next year,‚Äù Kamat said. He has also called for the conservation of these rare mushrooms by urging the local communities to preserve the species instead of consuming them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rare-mushroom-species-found-in-bandora-yet-to-be-named/articleshow/85085488.cms||Nida Sayed

The 17-year old girl stole money and valuables from home on a number of occasions to pay him off. The case came to light only recently when her mother discovered that valuables were vanishing from home and quizzed her. Kurar police have registered a case under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The girl is a class XII student. Earlier this year, she befriended an unknown man on Instagram. The two would chat regularly and the man, Sanjay Ohal, would also make video calls to her over a month-and-half between May and June. "On one occasion, Ohal asked her to strip during a video call. The girl was taken aback by his demand and refused. This infuriated Ohal who brought out a knife while on the video call with her. He threatened to slit his wrists and end his life in her presence if she did not give in to his demands," a police officer said. Frightened, the girl agreed and began to undress over the video call. Unknown to her, Ohal used the screen recording app to film her in the nude. Later, he sent her the video clip and asked for money if she did not want the clip to go viral online. "Nervous about whom to confide in or where to get the money from, the girl started to steal from home. She stole jewellery from her mother's cupboard and sold it off for Rs 10000. After she transferred the sum to him, Ohal realised he could extort more money," said the officer. He kept asking her for more and the girl continued to steal from home. She paid him around Rs 58000 totally. Recently, her mother discovered that jewellery was missing and suspected something amiss. She quizzed the girl who broke down and confided in her. The two then approached Kurar police station and an FIR was lodged. The police tracked Ohal's phone number to Pune and picked him up. "He is a driver and hails from Osmanabad. Our team brought him to Mumbai where he was charged and taken into custody," said senior inspector Prakash Bele.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sextortionist-threatened-to-end-life-if-girl-didnt-strip/articleshow/85083356.cms||Nitasha Natu

Amid fear of third wave, the decision has been taken keeping in mind the shortage of nurses in RUHS hospital which provides treatment to Covid patients. The health department has decided to give a break to nursing staff after two months of deployment at RUHS hospital. The health department has issued directions to SMS medical college principal and controller to deploy 30 nurses for two months and they will be replaced by fresh batch of nurses, said a health department official. While speculation is rife about the third wave, which may emerge in the last week of August, the state has reported increase in Covid cases for the second consecutive day.

Even as the cops and Tihar jail administration maintained silence at what the gangster's family has claimed was a pre-meditated murder, sources alleged that Gujjar was assaulted by jail officials and guards on August 3 and the matter was revealed a day later only after attempts to save his life at the jail's medical facility failed. The family has claimed that Gujjar was slapped during an argument with a deputy superintendent of Jail No 3 over money. When the gangster slapped him back, the officer allegedly returned with staff and guards and thrashed Gujjar, injuring his cellmates in the melee. The family said it would demand a CBI inquiry into the matter. CBI has begun a probe into another murder at the jail and has just filed an FIR. The latest revelations were made after an inmate who was allegedly released from jail on August 3 told the family that Gujjar was thrashed in jail the same day. The inmate has recorded his statement with the police. The family also recorded his version on video. In a major development on Thursday, Sandeep Goel, DG, Tihar Jail, is learnt to have transferred five officials, including the deputy superintendent. The prison administration claimed that the step was taken to facilitate free and fair investigation because these officials were facing an inquiry. Gujjar's autopsy was conducted at AIIMS on Thursday and the report is awaited. Doctors noted numerous injury marks on Gujjar's body that appeared to be over 24 hour old, said a source. Police had found Gujjar dead in the jail dispensary in Jail No. 3 on Wednesday after receiving information about an inmate‚Äôs death. His cellmates, Gurjeet and Gurpreet, were also found injured and taken to DDU Hospital. The family has alleged that the dispute arose after a phone was found in Gujjar's cell a few days ago. The jail officials demanded Rs 1 lakh to suppress the fact and the family claimed to have given Rs 50,000, but there was a row over the remaining money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangster-murder-five-jail-officials-transferred-at-tihar/articleshow/85083445.cms||---

The incidents have been taking place despite the introduction of sewer jetting machines, using bucket cleaning technique to remove silt from choked sewers. Experts TOI spoke to said that workers are made to carry out manual scavenging in two basic forms which are the cleaning of dry latrines, and the cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. However, both are illegal under the Manual Scavenging Act. ‚ÄúTo eradicate manual scavenging, the government needs to first eliminate insanitary latrines through demolition and convert them into sanitary latrines. They should also formulate a comprehensive rehabilitation package for manual scavengers,‚Äù said president of Safai Karamchari Andolan Telangana, K Saraswati said, adding that there was also a need to increase the number of sewer jetting machines. ‚ÄúThe main reason contractors employ people to carry out manual scavenging is because most machines can only be used on large roads,‚Äù he said. The tragic incident in which two labourers died on Tuesday night comes after municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao‚Äôs recent assertion that manual labour in sewage cleaning is a thing of the past in Hyderabad. Also, in July 2017, the state government had launched mini sewer jetting machines in the city to negotiate smaller lanes. ‚ÄúThe machines are either not enough or not being used by officials,‚Äù said Mohammad Ahmed, a social activist. Meanwhile, GHMC chief engineer (maintenance), M Devanand, said, ‚ÄúWhile what happened to the labourers is very unfortunate, these operations should usually be conducted during the day and there are certain guidelines to follow. We always advise workers to open consecutive manholes before carrying out any manual work, let toxic gases escape and avoid entering into these manholes.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/even-with-sewer-jets-scavenging-deaths-continue/articleshow/85080964.cms||Moulika.KV

Thousands of SP workers accompanied the party chief on cycles behind him at the Lucknow event. Though the Cycle Yatra, organised as tehsil level across the state, marked the birth anniversary of veteran socialist leader and founding SP member Janeshwar Mishra, political observers see it as a soft launch of the party's campaign for the 2022 assembly polls in UP. The Cycle Yatra comes a fortnight after Akhilesh embarked his ‚ÄòSamajwadi Rath‚Äô to visit Unnao. While Akhilesh led the Cycle Yatra in Lucknow, his wife Dimple Yadav flagged off the event in Kannauj from where she has been a member of parliament. The SP leadership had designated senior Party leaders to lead the event in each of the 75 districts of the state. Before hitting the pedal to cover the 6.5 kilometre route to reach Janeshwar Misra park - named after one of the tallest Brahmin leaders of SP - Akhilesh recalled the party veteran‚Äôs contribution in furthering the idea of socialism in UP politics. The Cycle Yatra concluded with Akhilesh paying floral tributes at the statue of ‚ÄòChote Lohia‚Äô that Janeshwar was fondly referred to by fellow politicians associated with the JP movement. The Cycle Yatra coincides with the birth anniversary of Janeshwar Misra. Addressing a press conference, which he began by congratulating the Indian hockey squad which did the country proud by winning a bronze in Tokyo Olympics earlier in the day, Akhilesh attacked the ruling BJP stating that not only the party workers but common man has also joined the Cycle Yatra to express their unhappiness with the government. ‚ÄúTill now we were looking at 350 seats. But looking at the growing disenchantment towards the BJP, it appears that SP will win 400 seats,‚Äù he said. Paying homage to those who died of Covid-19 infection, the SP chief trained his guns at the BJP government for its failure to help people fighting the infection. The government failed to provide oxygen and hospital beds to the needy, he said. Attacking the BJP for welcoming Jitendra Singh Babloo, an accused in Rita Bahuguna Joshi house arson case, into the party fold, Akhilesh questioned the zero-tolerance approach of the party towards crime and criminals. ‚ÄúJo party kehti thi apradhion se door rahenge , chunao aate aate apradhiyon ke kitne kareeb pahunch gaye (The party which always talked of maintaining distance from criminals, is getting cosy with them as the elections are approaching),‚Äù he said. In an apparent reference to Union Home Minister Amit Shah‚Äôs appreciation of the Yogi Adityanath government at a recent event in Mirzapur, Akhilesh said when senior leaders listed the achievements of the UP government, no one talked about how UP is leading in terms of having the highest number of malnourished children, number of dead bodies found floating in the Ganga during the pandemic, black marketing of life saving drugs, death of Covid-19 patients for lack of medical attention, rising crime against women, fake encounter and deaths in police custody. The cycle yatra that began from Samajwadi Party headquarters, took the Kalidas Marg crossing route to reach Women Powerline 1090 intersection, Jai Prakash Narain International Centre (JPIC) and Sheroes Caf√© to reach Janeshwar Misra park. Accompanied by cyclist Abhishek Sharma and other party leaders on cycles, Akhilesh Yadav was welcomed by party workers playing drums and dhol at different locations along the route. Some party workers who reached Lucknow from other districts carried their cycles on a mini-truck to reach the state capital to participate in the event. It remains unsaid that pandemic protocols were thrown to the wind as party workers scrambled to take part in Cycle Yatra hitting social distancing for a six. The Yatra concluded with the SP chief paying floral tributes at the statue of Janeshwar Misra to mark his birth anniversary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-to-win-more-than-400-seats-in-up-akhilesh/articleshow/85085549.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The trio was allegedly rounded up and thrashed by villagers and relatives of the woman. Police swung into action after a video of the purported incident, that took place on July 30, went viral. They booked the woman‚Äôs friend ‚Äúfor disturbing peace‚Äù at the village. In the video that has gone viral, villagers are seen thrashing a woman and two youths (all in their early 20s) with lathis as they writhe in pain. In one clip, the two youths are made to lie on a cot while the villagers hit them with lathis. In the second clip, the woman is beaten up publicly. It all started when a youth accompanied by his friend visited the village where the woman was staying after her marriage. Apparently, taking offence on seeing a male friend visit their daughter-in-law, the woman‚Äôs in-laws informed her parents who stay in Muzaffarnagar. Once relatives of both sides gathered, they began to beat up the trio. Police suspect that there could be a love angle in the matter. ‚ÄúThe incident is said to have taken place at Titwada village in Kairana and we came to know of it only through the viral video. The details are being looked into,‚Äù said Sukriti Madhav Shamli's SP. Premvir Rana, SHO, Kairana police station, said, ‚ÄúThe incident occurred on July 30 when a resident of Ratanpuri area of Muzaffarnagar, Aaftab, accompanied by his friend had arrived at Titwada village to meet a married woman who originally belongs to Muzaffarnagar. We have booked Aaftab for disturbing peace in the area.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/married-woman-two-youths-who-called-on-her-thrashed-in-kairana/articleshow/85078957.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court says hearing bail plea of Waze wasted its precious time||Mumbai: Rejecting dismissed police officer Sachin Waze‚Äôs plea for default bail on Thursday, the court said that hearing such an application had wasted the precious time of the court and it ought to have imposed heavy costs on him. ‚ÄúHowever, considering that the applicant (Waze) is in custody, I have refrained from imposing such costs. But the aforesaid certainly should give message to the litigants who submit such meritless application only with a view to waste time in the court,‚Äù the court said. The court granted the NIA 30 days more to submit the chargesheet in the case. When a chargesheet is not submitted within the stipulated time and in the absence of an extension granted by the court, the accused has to be granted default bail. Making submissions via video-conferencing from Taloja jail, Waze had said on Wednesday that his detention in the absence of the chargesheet was a violation of his fundamental rights. He said in his submissions that since sections under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) were invoked only after his first remand in March, the 90-day limit to submit the chargesheet was applicable under the relevant Indian Penal Code sections mentioned in the initial FIR. He said that the total 180-day period under the UAPA was not applicable. He cited a 2001 Supreme Court order in a case where he was the investigating officer. Waze‚Äôs earlier plea for default bail was rejected by the court. Rejecting his plea again, the court said that the application was not maintainable. ‚ÄúThe law does not permit to consider the application of bail before the expiry of time (to submit the chargesheet) . There is no force in the application and it deserves to be rejected,‚Äù the court said. The court will hear the bail pleas of another accused police officer, Sunil Mane, on Tuesday.Last month, for the second time in the case, the NIA moved a plea seeking an extension of 30 days to submit the chargesheet. In June it was granted an additional 60 days to submit the chargesheet. The NIA‚Äôs first extension was to come to an end on Saturday. On Tuesday, seeking more time, special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves had said that the statements of over 150 witnesses were already recorded in the case. The prosecution had said that if extension was not granted the accused and others would slip out of the clutches of law and justice. It said the case had repercussions on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and security of the country.On February 25, a Scorpio with explosives stocked in it was found near Antilia. It is alleged that on March 4, Scorpio owner Mansukh Hiran was killed. The prosecution submitted that Hiran was the ‚Äúweak link‚Äù and was aware of the conspiracy. It was also submitted that had he been alive, the larger plot would have failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-says-hearing-bail-plea-of-waze-wasted-its-precious-time/articleshow/85083474.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Given these numbers, doctors are asking people to be careful as they may unknowingly spread the infection. ‚ÄúWe need to vaccinate as many people as possible before the third wave hits so that the impact is minimal. It is worrisome that people are behaving as if the pandemic has ended and even the ones who have tested positive are not following norms,‚Äù said a health department official. In fact, several clusters were identified in parts of the state last month. An investigation by health officials found that the spread was mainly due to people who had tested positive flouting isolation norms and attending social functions.  ‚ÄúTwelve states in India are now showing high positivity rate of more than 10%. With many asymptomatic people going undetected, there is a risk of jump in cases if Covid appropriate behaviour is not maintained,‚Äù said Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, director of ASCI‚Äôs Centre for Health Care Management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asymptomatic-covid-carriers-still-high-in-t/articleshow/85081018.cms||Amrita Didyala

However, challenges, too, have increased 10-fold with the population increasing from about 5 lakh in 1947 to about 50 lakh in 2021. In 1947, Lucknow had just one medical college ‚Äî King George‚Äôs Medical College (now a university) with 250 beds having basic surgical and medical facilities. Besides, there was only one hospital ‚Äî Balrampur hospital with 20 beds. Today in public sector medical education, Lucknow can boast of having three premier institutes ‚Äî KGMU, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences and Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences ‚Äî offering medical education from graduation to super-speciality levels. The Cancer Institute at Chak Gajaria is the latest addition in this category. These institutions are catering to patients of not only Lucknow and UP, but also from adjoining districts and countries like Nepal and playing a major role in serving people during the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic. Not just specialised healthcare, particularly for the poor, the contribution of these medical education institutes in producing doctors and researchers is immense. Their alumni are serving across the globe and have established departments, hospitals, medical education and research institutes which have further contributed in building the nation. Furthermore, KGMU is the only institute in the public sector that is offering dental education. There are also Ayurveda, Unani and homoeopathy colleges in the city. The private sector was nil in medical education at the time of Independence. However, today Lucknow has five private medical colleges and four dental colleges. Starting with just Balrampur hospital, Lucknow today has altogether 12 district hospitals. In addition, there are 83 primary and 19 community healthcare centres, catering to interior and rural areas. Healthcare in the private sector was limited to small clinics run by individual doctors in 1947, but today there are over 700 private nursing homes and hospitals including top brands of the country. Crisis of professionals needs addressing Experts point out that despite drastic growth in the health sector, all healthcare facilities are overloaded, which means that there is further scope of developing more such institutions and strengthening the existing ones. The government healthcare sector is particularly reeling under the crisis of required strength of doctors as an increasing number of medical graduates now want to serve in cities or corporate hospitals. Medical teaching and research is another area which needs to be made attractive for students. Medical pedagogy also needs to be modernised. There is immense scope of interdisciplinary research as well, they added. Chief medical superintendent and in charge, trauma centre, Prof Sandeep Tiwari says that to reduce patient load on hospitals, the government needs to strengthen primary health care services at the district level. Former head of Indian Medical Association Lucknow wing PK Gupta says, ‚ÄúThe government should also exploit the city‚Äôs potential to be developed as a medical tourism hub by considering it under MSME sector.‚Äù Head of medicine department at KGMU Prof Virendra Atam says, ‚ÄúIf all provisions of the National Medical Commission are implemented strictly on every medical college, the quality of medical education will improve.‚Äù Pillars of care KGMU: Established in 1906, KGMC (now university) is the foundation of medical education in the state. It has 4,500 beds in 55 clinical and non-clinical departments, providing treatment to over 15 lakh patients annually. It has 1,080 seats in bachelor, postgraduate and super speciality courses. It has produced one Padma Vibhushan, six Padma Bhushan, 27 Padma Shri and 45 BC Roy awardees till now. Over 24,000 alumni doctors serving all over the world. SGPGIMS: A state-of-the-art tertiary care referral centre that was established in 1983. It has 1,050 beds in 29 departments. The institute was the first to start liver transplant and kidney transplant surgery in UP. It has around 450 post-graduate and super-speciality seats. Over 6 lakh patients get treatment in the institute every year. RMLIMS: Established in 2006, it provides general medical and super-speciality treatment including kidney transplant. It has 30 departments with 1,000-bed strength and caters to around 1.5 lakh patients every year. Private medical colleges: There are around 16 in the city. Among these, nine offer MBBS, nursing and paramedical courses. Some of them also run BDS courses. They cater to around 11 lakh patients in a year. Government centres: Lucknow has 12 district hospitals, 19 community healthcare centres and 83 primary health care centres. In 12 district hospitals, there are 3,100 beds whereas PHCs have 400 beds and 180 beds are in CHCs. Over 5 lakh people from across the state get treatment in these facilities every year. Private healthcare: There are 700 registered private hospitals and nursing homes. As many as 60,000 minor and major surgeries are performed in these hospitals every year. Around 10 lakh patients visit OPDs of these hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/a-90-fold-increase-for-citys-healthcare-infra-in-85-years/articleshow/85085630.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The ward comprises upmarket areas of the western suburbs, including Bandra, Khar and Santacruz.Local BJP MLA Ashish Shelar, however, raised questions over the inauguration being done three months after relocation of the ward office. The ward office started operating from the new location from May 1, after which the old office in Bandra was converted to a vaccination centre. ‚ÄúThis seems to be a case of taking credit though the Shiv Sena was not involved in any way. The new office is the result of efforts made by local residents‚Äô associations and me. As an MLA, I have worked for the past six years to get a new ward office and regularly followed up with the civic body,‚Äù he said. BMC officials said owing to concerns about a second wave, there was no official function when the ward office was relocated in May. Speaking at the inauguration, the CM said, ‚ÄúOften there are complaints that people do not want to go to civic buildings, but looking at this place, I feel people may come just to see it.‚Äù The six-storey office is spread across more than 59,000 sq ft, while the old three-storey office occupied 8,880 sq ft. The parking lot can accommodate 107 vehicles as compared to just four at the old office. The building also has a rainwater harvesting system. A tank with a capacity of 20,000 litres has been constructed under the building to store rain water, which will be used for various purposes in the office. There is also a gym located on the fifth floor of the building for the employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-inaugurates-new-six-storey-ward-office-in-khar-bjp-mla-cries-foul/articleshow/85086402.cms||Richa Pinto

The expert committee has decided that the gap between two doses of Covishield be reduced to six weeks from the current 84 days. ‚ÄúAll the members agreed that tourism can‚Äôt be allowed when we don‚Äôt know when the third wave will hit us, though we expect its impact to be less severe,‚Äù an expert committee member, without wanting to be named, told TOI. The expert committee, comprising doctors, will submit its suggestions to the government on Covid management shortly. Considering that the possible third wave may show its presence either this month or next, the expert committee was of the opinion that shortening breaks between the two doses was necessary so that a larger section of the population is fully vaccinated . As of Wednesday, over 10 lakh people have been vaccinated, but those who have been fully vaccinated are 2,80,695. The vaccination of the larger number of people, a target population of about 6.5 lakh in the age bracket of 18 to 44 years, started by mid-May in Goa. With the gap between two doses of Covishield ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, it will be October -November by the time the majority of the population is fully vaccinated. ‚ÄúSince there is an availability of vaccine stock, the second dose can be administered after six weeks so that a larger section of the population is protected, we decided,‚Äù he said. The expert committee also recommended that not just teachers, but other school staff, including clerical, bell-boy, peon and school bus drivers must be vaccinated and if not, they must not be allowed entry into a school. ‚ÄúWhen schools reopen, all the staff have to be vaccinated,‚Äù he said. As for Goans who regularly cross the border, they can be allowed if they are fully vaccinated and they need not be asked to show Covid-19 negative certificate, provided they don‚Äôt have any symptoms of the virus, the expert committee member said. ‚ÄúIf they have taken both doses of the vaccine, and if they are asymptomatic, they should be excused from producing a Covid-19 negative certificate,‚Äù he said. Currently, people travelling to Goa for business and students are exempted from producing Covid-19 negative certificates provided they are fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-open-up-tourism-in-state-so-soon-says-expert-panel/articleshow/85085624.cms||Bindiya Chari

The group, which owns four captive port facilities in the country for handling coal and iron ore required to run its steel plants, has been looking to develop a commercial port for quite some time now, said an industry official in the know of the matter. Officials of JSW Infrastructure have shown interest in the project by joining the second round of the pre-bid meeting called by Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), the state‚Äôs maritime regulator on Thursday. On offer is the development the greenfield port of Nargol for an estimated cost of Rs 3,800 crore over a five-year period. The company operates seven port facilities in Maharashtra, Goa, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. JSW Infra also operates a terminal in at Fujairah, UAE. Its ports and terminals have an operational capacity of 113 million tonnes per annum and it aims to double it in the next two years by way of greenfield and brownfield expansions, according to the industry official quoted earlier.  An official spokesperson of JSW Group declined to comment on the matter. The second pre-bid meet was held following concerns that the stakeholders were not satisfied with the first round of meeting held on July 22. Developers including Dubai based D P World, APSEZ, Essar Ports and J M Baxi Group have together submitted over 200 queries to the regulator. Officials at GMB claimed that the second round of pre-bid meeting went well, as senior government officials responded to some of the key queries raised by developers including finance related questions and the fate of the project on completion of 50 years of concession period. The bidder queries were raised from the request for proposal (RFP) document for development of greenfield port at Nargol on BOOT (Build, Operate, Own and Transfer) basis. As a special case for Nargol port, the state government has granted discount of 20% on the waterfront royalty for bidding process. Also, the government has granted longer 50-year concession period of a single block period without compensation. The option of discount will lead to better feasibility parameters and shall facilitate the developer in raising capital at a lower cost, said a GMB official. The existing port policy in Gujarat allows the concession period for development for 30 years that can be extendable up to further 20 years with no compensation payable at the end of 50 years. An official working with a port development company and who participated in the Thursday‚Äôs meet said that the meeting was satisfactory however one needs to wait for a week till GMB responds to all their queries in writing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jsw-infra-set-to-join-race-for-nargol-port-development/articleshow/85080321.cms||Maulik Pathak

Though inflammation (granuloma) of the brain by Aspergillus is common, doctors rarely come across cases of white fungus forming an abscess. This is particularly rare in Covid-19 patients. The patient from the Old City had recovered from Covid-19 in May this year and post recovery developed weakness of limbs and speech difficulty. A scan of the brain revealed clot-like formations that did not subside after medication. On surgery it was found that white fungus had formed an abscess in the brain. The patient is non-diabetic but had high blood pressure.  ‚ÄúThis case is unique as there is an abscess formed by white fungus in the brain. The infection is post-recovery from Covid-19. Generally, fungal infections in Covid-19 patients are found if they are diabetic. The patient is non-diabetic. The paranasal sinuses are clear indicating that white fungus had not entered the brain through the nose unlike black fungus,‚Äù said Dr P Ranganadham, senior neurosurgeon, Sunshine Hospitals, Gachibowli. Dr Ranganadham, who performed the surgery, said the patient complained of weakness of limbs and difficulty in speaking on the sixth day of hospitalisation for Covid-19 when the second wave was at its peak. An MRI of the brain revealed a large lesion in the left part along with two small lesions in different areas. Initially, the patient was treated for haematoma, a possible Covid-19 sequalae. ‚ÄúAs the patient was becoming further symptomatic, in course of time a repeat brain MRI with contrast showed that the lesion had increased in size with dense and well-defined margins. The smaller lesions remained unchanged. When operated, we found a well encapsulated abscess containing soft necrotic material, separate from normal brain,‚Äù Dr Ranganadham told TOI. He said pathological analysis of the abscess showed that it was a case of white fungus infection, technically called Aspergillosis. He said Aspergillosis of the central nervous system is a result of the invasion of the brain blood vessels by white fungus. The fungus can enter the brain either through inhalation of spores into the lungs from where they enter the blood stream, or directly through nose to the brain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/white-fungus-abscess-found-in-recovered-covid-patients-brain/articleshow/85081074.cms||Syed Akbar

The submissions were made before Civil Judge Deeksha Rao in reply to the suit filed against Jayalal, IMA and its general secretary Jayesh Lele. The suit has sought a public apology and court‚Äôs direction to prevent Jayalal and others from making derogatory statements against ayurveda and hurting the sentiments of its believers. Jayalal, IMA and Lele, in their reply, said the suit was ‚Äúbald‚Äù, ‚Äúunsubstantiated‚Äù and not maintainable in law. ‚ÄúThe suit is only an attempt to threaten/intimidate the Indian Medical Association being a private association of allopathic doctors from acting in furtherance of its objectives, and prevent the association and its office bearers from exercising their fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution‚Ä¶ It is an elaborate design orchestrated by a certain group of individuals against the IMA and its office-bearers,‚Äù their reply said. It further claimed that the allegations made in the suit are primarily on the basis of the screenshot of the fake news article, whose contents are absolutely false and no such interview was ever given by Jayalal to the online portal. ‚ÄúThere is no public interest whatsoever in the suit,‚Äù the reply claimed, and added that the suit deserves to be rejected by the court with a cost. It further said that the suit had been filed by people who were avid believers of the ayurvedic system of medicine and hence, did not agree with the views of IMA. ‚ÄúIt is specifically denied that there is any campaign started by any of the defendants against Hinduism or for promoting Christianity in India,‚Äù the reply stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ayurveda-suit-filed-to-threaten-ima-says-chief/articleshow/85083552.cms||Usha Das

The risk of contracting diseases and working in highly stressful situations, including threat to their safety, has led to high levels of depression among doctors. Apart from a massive jump in stress levels, huge workload and factors like job insecurity add to the woes of the medical professionals. ‚ÄúStress, burnout and depression are common among doctors. The doctor-patient ratio is one of the biggest reasons for prolonged working hours. Lack of infrastructure in government hospitals and business management graduates dictating terms in corporate hospitals, leaving doctors without a free hand to work, makes them depressed too,‚Äù Manasa Hospital director and consultant psychiatrist Dr Virinchi Sharma said. At least 10 doctors, including three at state-run Chest Hospital, Erragadda, had contracted TB in the last two years. The number of doctors infected with Covid-19, meanwhile, crossed 3,000, while 30 died of the deadly infection in the state during the pandemic. ‚ÄúThe situation in which doctors are working is highly challenging. Often, doctors are exposed to various infections and pathogens like HIV and TB. In the last few years, many doctors had contracted TB and the number of doctors who got Covid-19 is huge. These and other factors like threat of assaults have increased the stress level among doctors,‚Äù Telangana Junior Doctors‚Äô Association (TJUDA) president Dr Sagar Dharmula told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/docs-not-immune-to-depression-suicidal-thoughts-finds-study/articleshow/85081092.cms||Amrita Didyala

The report will then be cross verified by municipal councilors in their areas. Suryan said that the meeting was held to increase the awareness of councilors and other stakeholders about the new mobile tower installation policy. ‚ÄúWe are facing revenue losses due to unauthorised towers and action will be taken to bring all such installations under the purview of the corporation,‚Äù he added. The mayor said that in the coming days, there will be an increased focus on technology and improved signal connectivity will be the backbone of all digital India initiatives. ‚ÄúThe use of technology is only going to increase and so will the use of towers.

The state is also seeing a slow flow of tourists even as nightlife is still closed and curfew conditions stand. Probably, Covid fatigue has set in, and though Goa‚Äôs cases have plateaued with the danger of the third wave still lingering, there is no scope to skip Covid-appropriate behaviour, said a city doctor, who did not want to be named. ‚ÄúNot only tourists, but locals too have started socialising with many giving a skip to Covid-appropriate behaviour. I saw it at a starred hotel in South Goa. The hotel was full,‚Äù the doctor said. A tourism stakeholder, Savio Messias said that the restrictions are not being fully implemented. A few days ago, Messiss said, he dined at a hotel in Calangute beach. ‚ÄúThough the hotel was required to bring down its shutters at 9pm, we saw guests walking in even after 9pm. The owner said they close late,‚Äù he said. Viraj Naik from Panaji said that though he understands that fatigue has set in pushing some people to behave recklessly, the virus hasn‚Äôt tired. ‚ÄúI get worried when I see tourists clustering in the city, though I know they must have been allowed in after producing a Covid-19 negative certificate. But, I can‚Äôt forget what we went through in April-May when all of us lost so many people close to us,‚Äù he said. With Covid-19 hanging over our heads like a sword of Damocles, Naik said, he can‚Äôt be blamed if he looks at tourists suspiciously. While tourists alone can‚Äôt be blamed for the spread of Covid-19, Messais said, he did see some being very careful when in the public, but most are not. Medical officer at the Candolim primary health centre, Dr Roshan Nazareth, who oversaw the Covid-19 management when the Calangute-Candolim belt turned into a hotspot in April-May, said people under its jurisdiction are still scared after going through the worst ever period of the pandemic. ‚ÄúPeople are scared and adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/people-bypassing-covid-protocols-in-haste-to-return-to-normalcy-doctors/articleshow/85083572.cms||Bindiya Chari

The Startup Promotion Cell took up 12 applications from startups and cleared incentives for nine startups. Sawant said that all the startups are headed by Goans or have been co-founded with a Goan partner. ‚ÄúThere were around 12 startups of which only about two or three were deferred and all the other proposals were cleared. They will get the money in three instalments of 40%, 30% and 30%,‚Äù said Sawant while speaking to reporters after the meeting. Many of the certified startups, which sought financial assistance from the state, have been waiting for over 14 months for what was promised. Startups that were certified by the Start-up Promotion Cell (SPC) with valid start-up certificate numbers have begun to scale down operations. At a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has hurt startups, the delay in disbursement has added to their woes. ‚ÄúThe startup cell committee has recommended to release the first instalment, which will be done. Almost all are Goans except in one case where the promoter has tied up with a local Goan. At least four of them are women entrepreneurs in the pharmacy and IT field,‚Äù said Sawant. Since the launch of the Goa Startup Policy ‚Äì 2017, the state government has repeatedly promised to make Goa one of the top 25 startup destinations in Asia. The department of Information and technology has certified at least 110 startups, however, disbursal of funds to these startups has been slow. The state high powered committee was scheduled to meet in May, but the meeting was cancelled due to the second Covid-19 wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-led-meet-clears-incentives-for-nine-startups/articleshow/85083622.cms||‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï

He was arrested under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act from Kanjoor near Kalady. The arrested person has been identified as Ratheesh Chandran, 40, of Kanjoor. According to police, the man used to run a mobile tyre puncture repair unit and was at the locality near the girl‚Äôs house when the offence took place. Chandran is also a folk singer. Police said that the man was repairing the girl‚Äôs bicycle when he asked the girl to pump air into the cycle tyre. The girl then noticed his phone placed on the ground and realized that he was trying to record her visuals from that position. The girl then grabbed the phone from him, pushed him away and rushed to her relatives who in turn alerted the police, said an officer. A senior officer with Nedumbassery police said that other than visuals relating to the crime, no other such visuals were present in the phone. Police will send the phone for forensic analysis to see if any such visuals had been deleted from the phone by the accused. Police said that the man was arrested on Monday and was remanded in judicial custody subsequently. A team of officers including SHO P M Baiju, SI Aneesh K Das, ASI Balachandran and SCPO O Leela were part of the investigation team.

Koshyari was in Nanded on Thursday. He will be in Hingoli on Friday and in Parbhani on Saturday. Malik and Chavan confirmed to TOI that they will not be attending Koshyari‚Äôs programmes. ‚ÄúI am supervising key repair and reconstruction work of roads and bridges, which have been washed away. It was not possible for me to attend Koshyari‚Äôs events in Nanded,‚Äù Chavan said. Nanded is Chavan‚Äôs hometown. Malik said it is not mandatory for the guardian minister or chief minister to remain present during the governor‚Äôs visit to a district. ‚ÄúThough the guardian ministers will not be attending, routine protocol will be followed. All officers whose presence is mandatory during the governor‚Äôs visit will remain present,‚Äù he said. According to the travel schedule released by the Raj Bhavan on Monday, Koshyari was to visit Nanded for the inauguration of a hostel for minority girls and boys and review the Covid-19 preparations there. In Hingoli and Parbhani, Koshyari was expected to visit the agriculture universities and review the Covid situation with the district officials. However, following the objection lodged by the state cabinet on Tuesday, the travel plan was altered to state that the hostel has already been operational for three to four years, so the governor will only visit it. Further, it stated that he will not take review meetings with the district administration, instead a section of senior bureaucrats will make presentations before him on the prevailing Covid situation. At Tuesday‚Äôs weekly cabinet meeting, most of the members expressed strong displeasure over Koshyari‚Äôs decision to undertake an extensive tour of the three districts in Marathwada. ‚ÄúThe governor is exceeding his brief. We are in a democratic set-up, the governor can‚Äôt take over the functions of the chief minister. If he needs information, he can always summon the chief secretary. It‚Äôs a new trend of governors assuming the role of the CM, particularly in non-BJP ruled states,‚Äù Malik said. On Wednesday, a Raj Bhavan official had told TOI that there is no question of the governor taking over the functions of the CM. ‚ÄúThe governor is not holding a review meeting; a few bureaucrats have expressed their desire to make a presentation before him,‚Äù the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-guardian-ministers-of-3-mwada-dists-boycott-guvs-review-tour/articleshow/85086430.cms||---

The ABVP members even locked the gates of the council. ABVP member Rahul Sahu said, ‚ÄúWe locked the JAC gates and staged a dharna from 9am to 3pm. Two of our members even fainted during the protest and were sent to hospital.‚Äù Sahu said that neither the government nor the JAC officials came to meet them. Meanwhile, a JAC officer on condition of anonymity said that the protest did not affect the daily functioning of the office. A few days ago, ABVP had staged a dharna near state education minister Jagannath Mahto‚Äôs residence in Doranda and submitted a memorandum, requesting him to declare all students as passed. In Dhanbad, the students of St Mary Day School blocked the rail overbridge near Gomoh for nearly an hour to protest the awarding of low marks in their JAC board exams. Students Sumer Raj and Tripti Kumari claimed that they got 90% each in their pre-board exam but they have been awarded just 58% and 56%, respectively, in their board exams. The blockade was lifted only after Topchanchi circle officer Vikash Trivedi intervened and assured the students of resolving their problem. Trivedi said that a five-member committee of guardians will be formed which will speak to the school management in this regard. Earlier, the students had entered the school by jumping over the locked gate and created a ruckus inside. On Wednesday, Sujit Chakrabarty, who is the principal in-charge of Guru Nanak Public School at Loco Bazar in Gomoh, was assaulted by a group of students and guardians since the former were awarded less marks in science and mathematics because ‚Äòthey did not take tuition from the school teachers‚Äô.

And as he watched Manpreet Singh‚Äôs lads locked horns with the mighty Germans for a third spot in the ongoing Tokyo Olympic Games, memories from 41 years ago came flooding back. He hopes the women‚Äôs team also brings home the bronze medal by beating Britain on Friday morning. Recalling the gold-medal moment 41 years ago, Dungdung, said, ‚ÄúI was playing as the right back in the final match. My memory is failing me and I cannot remember who our opponent was but they had come back from behind and equalized. In the dying moments of the game, I received the ball in our half and dribbled past their players and pushed it to Surender Sodhi, who placed it at the back of the net.‚Äù In the Moscow Games, the Indian team led by V Baskaran clinched the gold after beating Spain 4-3. Dressed in a Tee shirt, Dungdung looked cheerful though he faces some health issues including loss of hearing after a road accident last year. A Dhayanchand award recipient and former Indian Army man, Dungdung said India‚Äôs bronze medal win will prove to be a moment for the resurrection of the national sport. He said, ‚ÄúHumko bahut khushi hua. Humara ladka log Germany ko itna zor se patka ki wo log zameen par lot pot ho gaya (I am very happy. Our boys beat the German players so much that they started rolling on the pitch in exasperation).‚Äù ‚ÄúWe won an Olympic medal after 41 years. Now, it will be a double delight if our girls bring home another bronze medal. I hope this is the beginning and our teams reclaim their old status as global superpowers of hockey again,‚Äù added Dungdung, who inspired a generation of hockey players in Jharkhand. Another hockey Olympian from the state, Manohar Topno, (1984, Los Angeles), still repents missing out on the semifinal berth by a whisker. ‚ÄúThe current Indian squad has talented players. It has a heady mix of penalty specialists, forwards and good defenders. Goalkeeper P Sreejesh has been a delight to watch,‚Äù Topno, a Gumla resident, told TOI. He said India‚Äôs bronze medal win will enthuse confidence and put them in contention for a podium finish at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Ajit Lakra, another player from Jharkhand (then undivided Bihar) who was part of the Indian men‚Äôs hockey team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, said India‚Äôs transition from the masters of grass to champions of astroturf is now complete with the bronze medal victory. ‚ÄúWe played in the grass while the game progressed rapidly after the turfs came in. New rules were introduced to benefit the European teams and speed became the key. We took time to adapt to such conditions and rules. Now, our infrastructure is being made ready.

Virendra Kumar, the joint secretary of the department of excise and prohibitions, in his letter to energy secretary on July 27, has pointed out that the office space located on the second floor of Block B of Utpad Bhawan in Kanke‚Äôs Police Lines has now been allotted to the state commercial taxes department. The office space was used by JSERC till that point. The JSERC had been allotted five rooms in the building‚Äôs second floor in 2019 to house its offices. ‚ÄúIt is therefore requested that the offices of JSERC be shifted to another location,‚Äù the letter added. Kumar, in another letter, wrote to secretary of the state commercial taxes department that the office space, which was being used by JSERC, will now be handed over to the commercial taxes department. All expense on upkeep, electricity bills and others would have to be borne by the commercial taxes department, the letter stated. Set up in 2002, JSERC began functioning from a rented office space at Sainik Bhawan in Ranchi. In 2019, it was shifted to Utpad Bhawan at New Police Lines, Kanke Road, Ranchi, where it was allotted five rooms on the second floor of the building.  JSERC is the state electricity regulatory authority and is responsible for determining tariff for generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, regulate intra-state power transmission and power purchase, issue licenses to companies seeking to generate, transmit and distribute power and promote generation of electricity from renewable sources, among others. ‚ÄúNo alternate arrangement has been made for JSERC, which is currently without a chairman . No members either exist at JSERC. We cannot shift till some alternate office space is allotted to us‚Äù Rajendra Prasad Nayak, the secretary-cum-law officer of JSERC told TOI. Nayak said that JSERC has written to the state energy department seeking directions on the matter. Excise officials did not respond when contacted. JSERC has been without a chairman over the past one year after its then incumbent, Arbind Prasad, resigned on June 12,2020. Since then, the commission has been functioning with only two of its members ‚Äî Rabindra Narayan Singh and Pravas Kumar Singh. However, Rabindra Narayan Singh retired on January 9, 2021 whilst Pravas Kumar Singh, retired on February 19 this year, leaving JSERC absolutely rudderless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/defunct-jserc-now-left-without-a-roof-over-its-head/articleshow/85081528.cms||Tapas Biswas

On the first day, the team reviewed the aspects of the case and the probe done so far by the state police. The SIT, which was constituted on the orders of the Jharkhand high court along with Dhanbad city SP R Ramkumar and the investigating officer of the case, Inspector Vinay Kumar, briefed the central agency and provided all necessary documents related to the case. Dhanbad SSP Sanjiv Kumar confirmed that the CBI has formally taken over the investigation of the case and the process for handing over the related documents and reports prepared by the police so far was underway till Thursday evening. According to the police, hundreds of persons with criminal antecedents, including those lodged in Dhanbad jail like Vikash Singh, Raunak Gupta, Ravi Thakur and Chandan Yadav were interrogated in connection with the case. The police have also interrogated a professional shooter from UP, Aman Singh, who is the prime accused in the Neeraj Singh murder case and languishing in Hotwar Jail of Ranchi. Neeraj Singh was the husband of Congress MLA from Jhaira, Purnima Singh, and was killed in March 2017. Notably, Anand, who was hit by an autorickshaw on July 28, had reportedly denied the bail petition of a gangster, who is an aide to shooter Aman Singh. Anand was also handling some more sensitive cases and it was believed he was killed in connection with those cases. However, police had said it if Anand‚Äôs killing was related to the cases he was handling or a road rage incident is yet to be ascertained. Lakhan Verma, the autorickshaw driver and Rahul Verma, who is allegedly Lakhan‚Äôs accomplice, were caught and they have confessed to police that they hit Anand in an inebriated condition. The high court had also granted the request of the police to conduct a narco analysis and brain mapping of the duo. Anand‚Äôs post mortem report said head and jaw injuries caused by a blunt object had caused his death. The report has been sent to different laboratories for verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cbi-takes-over-dhanbad-judge-death-probe/articleshow/85081465.cms||Anil Ashutosh
---||Ranchi||HC stays demolition of NMSS hosp||Ranchi: The demolition notice issued by the Ranchi Municipal Corporation to Nagarmal Modi Seva Sadan Hospital was stayed by the Jharkhand high court here on Thursday. A division bench of the high court clamped the stay on the demolition allowing the hospital to appeal against the order before the appropriate forum. The bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad was hearing an application filed by the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) challenging the notice issued by the civic body for demolishing the hospital situated in the heart of the city. The court while hearing the petition was informed that the Corporation in the garb of an earlier order passed by the high court to demolish unauthorized constructions has issued demolition notices to several buildings including the hospital. The bench said that the Corporation needs to proceed in the matter on its own and should not use the order of the high court as crutches. The issue surfaced when the RMC served a notice upon the hospital run by a charitable trust for demolition as its construction was not according to proper plans sanctioned by the civic body. The hospital which was established about six decades ago has 200 beds with about 550 employees and a dedicated team of doctors and specialists. Natural justice should prevail and all such buildings which are found to be constructed without proper authorization ought to be given a chance to challenge the order of demolition before the appellate authority of the Corporation, the court observed. The bench also directed the Ranchi SSP to ensure smooth flow of traffic in the Upper Bazar area of the capital. The roads are meant for commuting and not for parking vehicles, the court observed. The SSP while appearing the proceedings online assured the bench that steps are being taken to decongest Upper Bazar for smooth flow of traffic. The judges, while hearing the petition, also observed that the high court passes orders for the betterment of people in the state. The RMC is empowered by the law to demolish unauthorized constructions. However, law also demands that the civic body should analyse all documents and give proper opportunity to the aggrieved persons to seek appropriate remedy thereof, the bench observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-stays-demolition-of-nmss-hosp/articleshow/85081083.cms||---

The accused would activate two SIM cards using identity papers of any customer who came to buy one card. Later the pre-activated card was sold to other customers who would want to purchase a SIM without valid identity papers. Police recovered a total 10 pre-activated SIM cards from the accused. Police arrested Anand Gaud, a resident of Bhestan, from Bhestan Tran Rasta in Pandesara. Police booked Rushikesh Baviskar who supplied three SIM cards to Gaud. Baviskar is yet to get arrested. The accused have been arrested for criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery, forgery for cheating and using forged documents as original. Gaud used to work as an agent for a mobile service provider and earned a Rs 10,000 salary. To earn some extra money he started selling pre-activated cards which he sold for Rs 300 per card. Gaud would sit on the road near Bhestan Tran Rasta for selling the cards. Cops sent a dummy buyer to nab Gaur who agreed to sell a pre-activated card. Accused would click photos of people who came to him to buy a SIM and utilized their identity to activate cards clandestinely. A SIM card can be activated only after submitting valid document details on the authorised mobile application and by an authorised agent only. ‚ÄúGaud activated two SIM cards from one buyer and keep one with him which he would sell later to another customer,‚Äù said a police officer. Gaud confessed of getting three of the 10 SIM cards from his friend Baviskar, who too activated SIMs using similar method. ‚ÄúPeople should not allow clicking of photos on the phone by the seller of any product. Only the number of ID cards should be shared and if necessary a photo should be allowed only to be clicked through the authorised application,‚Äù said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/one-arrested-for-selling-pre-activated-sim-cards/articleshow/85078734.cms||---

The city police had detained Krunal Patel under PASA on July 1 after he got bail in an offence registered against him. Patel was arrested by the prevention of crime branch (PCB) on April 11 after they busted an alleged racket of selling remdesivir illegally at a higher price. Patel, who worked as a male nurse in a private hospital, was accused of selling remdesivir to the other two key accused when the drug was in high demand during the second wave of Covid. ‚ÄúPatel was given bail by the Gujarat high court on June 25 and he was released from judicial custody on June 30. But the cops immediately detained him under PASA. I had filed a petition in the high court and challenged the PASA order,‚Äù said advocate Anant Christian who represents Patel. ‚ÄúThe cops called him a drug offender but remdesivir doesn‚Äôt fall under the NDPS Act. Also, there is no other offence registered against Patel and he has no criminal history. There was no reason to invoke PASA against Patel after just one FIR,‚Äù Christian added. The court observed that the detaining authority fell in error in treating the activities of the petitioner as prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order. The court also said that the detaining authority has recorded that the activities of the petitioner create a sense of alarm and feeling of insecurity in the minds of the public at large. ‚ÄòHowever, vis-√†-vis the material on record, this court finds that the citation of such words is more in the nature of rituals than with any significance to the alleged activities of the petitioner,‚Äô the court observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hc-quashes-pasa-against-male-nurse/articleshow/85078308.cms||Tushar Tere

Located 55km from here, Pipra Tarn police station limits is a hotbed of CPI (Maoists) operatives for years now. The broken road makes motorized journey into Pipra Tarn discomfortingly long and arduous. Though the place wore a festive look with the stage decorated with festoons and placards, less than a dozen locals turned up for the inauguration. Deputy commissioner Shashi Ranjan, superintendent of police Chandan Kumar Jha and Palamu DIG Raj Kumar Lakra and other senior police officers were present at the event. Dazed by the low turnout, the administrative officials suspected that locals may have abstained from the function fearing retribution from the Maoists. ‚ÄúThere were just a handful of people at the inauguration,‚Äù Ranjan told TOI. ‚ÄúIt has rained heavily in the past few days and the locals may have been busy working in their fields and sowing paddy. It may have nothing to do with fear of Maoists,‚Äù a senior official present at the event said. Lakra also seconded the theory. Asked whether the police were falling behind on people connect, Lakra said: ‚ÄúWe cannot go telling everyone about the inauguration. It is up to the people whether they want to visit.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/locals-skip-police-stn-inauguration-in-maoist-prone-zone/articleshow/85081629.cms||M F AHMED
---||India||Facing crunch, Congress issues austerity notice||NEW DELHI: As part of steps to boost its kitty amid reports of a cash crunch, Congress has asked its parliamentarians to ensure payment of their contributions to the party fund and has also issued strict austerity directives for its office-bearers. Well-placed sources said AICC this week sent a reminder to its MPs in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha that they should make their annual payments regularly. What seems to have created a problem is that Congress has a large number of new members of Parliament who are not aware of their contribution obligations. This has led to a big outstanding. Adding to the problem is the fact that the number of Congress MPs in both Houses has badly dwindled since the ouster of the UPA government from power in 2014. According to the norms set on the basis of the Manmohan Singh committee on party funding, every MP has to make an annual payment of Rs 50,000 besides getting two sympathisers to contribute Rs 2,000 each. The AICC has also sent out a set of austerity measures to party office-bearers on travel and lodging, while also asking its own staff to cut down on spending. In a bid to curtail travel expenditure, AICC secretaries, who are adjuncts to the general secretaries, have been asked to spend at least 15-20 days per month in the states they have been assigned to. The states have been designated as their headquarters in place of the AICC. Up to a distance of 1,400 km, AICC secretaries will have to travel by train. They can avail air travel for distances beyond 1,400km, and that too only for two times in a month. The AICC secretaries can only travel by train for a distance up to 1400 km and can use air travel only beyond that, and that too only twice in a month. Interestingly, the general secretaries who are also MPs have been asked to make their own arrangements for air travel. The AICC office-bearers have been asked to curtail expenses on peripherals like canteen, stationery, electricity by adopting suitable measures and oversight through the staff. Sources said the austerity measures were issued in 2018, but required reiteration by AICC treasurer Pavan Bansal this week in view of lax adherence by party members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/facing-crunch-congress-issues-austerity-notice/articleshow/85087647.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Cuttack||Naveen Patnaik: The silent custodian of Indian hockey||BHUBANESWAR: If P R Sreejesh shielded the goal with his life during India's bronze medal-winning match against Germany, there's another man who has played a silent role in guarding hockey's interests in the country. Naveen Patnaik, the Odisha chief minister, patronised hockey at a time the game needed it the most. Naveen had been a goalkeeper for his Doon School hockey team. It is that early love that led to his support for the game, which sees Odisha sponsor the teams right from the junior to the senior levels, both men and women. In 2018, when Sahara withdrew, Odisha signed a Rs 140-crore deal with Hockey India to sponsor the men's and women's teams for five years. That was also the year Odisha hosted the men's hockey World Cup, which it will again host in 2023 in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela, where the state government is building India's largest hockey stadium for an estimated Rs 120 crore. Moments after India's historic win, Naveen spoke to some of the players in Tokyo over a video link. "Many congratulations to our hockey team. India is so excited, as is Odisha, of course. We are all behind you and wish you the very best," Naveen told them. While Naveen earned plaudits for supporting hockey, nothing would have been more special than the appreciation he got from skipper Manpreet Singh. "It's a special moment for all of us. We have finally achieved our dream of winning an Olympic medal. On this special occasion, I would like to express our special thanks to the honourable chief minister of Odisha, Shri Naveen Patnaik ji, who has supported us in this journey," Manpreet said. "While everyone was supporting cricket, the honourable CM chose hockey, and today you can see the result. I would like to say thank you so much, sir," the captain said. Odisha sports secretary R Vineel Krishna felt Naveen's decision is both personal as well as a result of his assessment of what hockey means to the state. "The CM played hockey in school. That's how his love for hockey developed. He has been following the game ever since. But, more than that, the CM is moved by the love the people of Odisha have for hockey. This is what inspired him to promote the game," Krishna said.

The raids began around 5am at 10 places and concluded around 8pm. According to sources, the raids were allegedly linked with the I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) scam, in which founder Mansoor Ali Khan is facing charges of duping 65,000 investors of at least Rs 2,600 crore, as well as other suspected financial irregularities. The ED officials were assisted by over 100 armed personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force and a local police contingent. Raids on Zameer Khan were carried at nine places, including his palatial bungalow in Bamboo Bazar, near Cantonment railway station, an old house in Vasanthnagar, a guest house in Sadashivnagar, a house in Benson Town, a flat in a private apartment off MG Road, offices of National Travels in Kalasipalyam here apart from offices in Mumbai and Delhi. The residence of a close aide of Khan in Sadashivnagar was also raided. By Thursday evening, cars carrying seized documents and other materials left Zameer‚Äôs houses and offices. Meanwhile, Baig‚Äôs residence on Cleveland Road, Fraser Town was raided. In July this year, the Karnataka government had issued a notification attaching his properties in connection with the IMA scam. The Central Bureau of Investigation probing this scam had, in November 2020, arrested Baig. He was granted bail after two weeks in judicial custody at Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara.

Faleiro has also demanded an explanation from the three MPs of Goa, including South Goa Congress MP Francisco Sardinha, on why they did not object to the Major Ports Authorities Act before it was passed in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The act was notified in February. ‚ÄúI appeal to the Union minister of state for shipping, who is the North Goa MP, and the chief minister, if they feel they are impotent and can‚Äôt do anything, to lead an all-party delegation to the Centre to get this law repealed,‚Äù said Faleiro. Faleiro said that the Major Ports Authorities Act is draconian and usurps the powers of the state and local governing bodies. He has demanded that the act, which was notified in February, be repealed. The former president of the state Congress unit said that the state government, particularly town and country planning minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, has admitted that the act could supersede local laws and powers of the panchayats and municipal bodies. ‚ÄúTo add insult to injury, the minister of town and country planning says that the state government has written to the Centre and Delhi has not replied to the letter. This is an insult for Goans. It shows that the Centre is looking at Goa as a colony, as second class citizens,‚Äù said Faleiro. Faleiro has accused the state government of selling Goa to the Centre and BJP. ‚ÄúMy first demand to all the three members of Parliament, since this law is bad for Goa‚Äôs identity and environment, tell us what is their role, and immediately get this Act cancelled. They must ensure that this law is rescinded,‚Äù he said. He has also appealed to all village panchayats to convene gram sabha meetings to oppose the ‚Äúdraconian law‚Äù introduced by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lead-all-party-delegation-to-centre-to-get-ports-law-repealed-luizinho-to-sawant/articleshow/85082414.cms||---

Charging the government with passing the bills with an intent to regularise encroachments on comunidade land, they demanded an apology from chief minister Pramod Sawant for ‚Äúinsulting and undermining‚Äù the true bhumiputras of Goa and that the act be ‚Äúwithdrawn and scrapped in totality.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe chief minister‚Äôs statement (that the term ‚Äòbhumiputra‚Äô will be removed from the title of the Bill) is an attempt to hoodwink the true sons of the soil,‚Äù architect Tulio D‚ÄôSouza, president of Comunidade of Guirim and former member of Comunidades Commission said. ‚ÄúThe proposed legislations are nothing but a blatant and open attempt to demean the true bhumiputras and give recognition to migrants by giving a new definition for bhumiputra. Goa‚Äôs identity and heritage is being sacrificed at the altar of appeasement of the migrant vote bank,‚Äù he said. The comunidade stakeholders also condemned the CM‚Äôs statement that the comunidades or gaunkaries were to be blamed for permitting encroachments on their lands. Stating that the comunidades have been fighting relentlessly the encroachments on their land before various courts and authorities for several decades and that they have even obtained favourable orders including from the high court. They said that political interference has put paid to their efforts. ‚ÄúMany of these demolition orders have remained on paper due to the lackadaisical attitude and incompetence of the respective administrators of comunidades coupled with rampant political interference. We would have hoped that the chief minister had directed concerned authorities to furnish such data,‚Äù Franky Monteiro, president, South Goa Comunidades Forum, Margao, said. The have urged the government to refrain from passing legislations regularising encroachments/illegal constructions in communidade lands. Pointing out that the Goa Land (Prohibition on Construction) Act, 1995, provides for prohibition on construction of a building, structure, etc, on government and comunidade lands, and that the amendment to this act in 2013 made by the BJP government enhanced the punishment provided in it, Monteiro said that the bhumiputra bill effectively rewards illegal encroachers and squatters on government and comunidade lands. D‚ÄôSouza termed the bill a ‚Äúmyopic, shortsighted, and symptomatic‚Äù legislation and demanded its immediate withdrawal.

The coaches told Modi that his talk motivated the team to perform well. Exactly 85 years ago in the month of August, the Indian hockey team led by Major Dhyanchand too was in need of motivation while taking on Germany in the finals of hockey at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. And, it was Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad of Baroda state, whose pep talk lifted the morale of the team during the halftime. Historian and art curator Chandrashekhar Patil said, ‚ÄúMaharaja Sayajirao had gone to Germany in 1936 to watch the Berlin Olympics. He watched the hockey finals between India and Germany from the stadium pavilion where Adolf Hitler too was present.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the first half, the Indian team could score just one goal and Sayajirao noticed that the players were struggling. So, he decided to meet the players at halftime. The players told him that they were struggling to play properly in shoes as they are used to playing bare feet. Sayajirao had given them shoes for playing in the finals,‚Äù Patil told TOI. ‚ÄúThe king immediately asked them to remove their shoes and play their natural game. The team was a bit nervous as it was playing against the Germans in Germany. Sayajirao gave a pep talk to Major Dhyanchand and the team, and asked them to win the finals,‚Äù Patil added.

Stating that Mahalasa is his ‚Äòkuladevi‚Äô (family goddess), Dhavalikar, however, suggested that the government reconstruct the houses on priority. He said that he shouldn‚Äôt be misunderstood as opposing the work of the Mahalsa temple but that the first priority should be reconstructing the houses of the real bhumiputras who lost their shelter in the floods. He has also warned the government that the flood-hit people may come out on the streets if the government failed to reconstruct their houses at the earliest, while threatening to support them if this happened.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: New ministers eye plum portfolios, CM Basavaraj Bommai may retain irrigation & finance||BENGALURU: Allocation of portfolios is another tough challenge for chief minister Basavaraj Bommai with newly sworn-in ministers lobbying hard for key posts. Bommai has said he would finalise it on Friday, but sources feel he may take one or two more days, given all the 29 ministers vying for coveted departments. With the BJP leadership having the final say, even the CM is reportedly trying to convince party functionaries to allow him to keep portfolios of his choice. However, the CM said it would be his prerogative to distribute portfolios. ‚ÄúThe high command has given me a free hand and I‚Äôll decide on the allocation of ministries. No minister has asked for any particular post and there is no pressure on me as such. I will announce it on Friday,‚Äù he said. Bommai was in fact sulking during the BS Yediyurappa regime as he was not given his favourite water resources ministry. While he had to settle for home in the beginning, the way he rose to prominence in the government was dramatic. In recognition of his command over a range of subjects, Yediyurappa allocated him additional portfolios of law and parliamentary affairs apart from authorising him to represent Karnataka in the GST Council. Yet, the water resources portfolio remained elusive till the end of Yediyurappa‚Äôs tenure. With an experience of handling it for five years from 2008, he now wants to retain the irrigation ministry. He also wants to keep finance as it has been the convention that the portfolio is attached to the chief minister. Energy is another significant portfolio the ministers eyeing, but the CM wants to retain that too. Irrigation ministry:At least half a dozen ministers want the irrigation portfolio and those in the race include KS Eshwarappa, who was irrigation minister in JD (S)-BJP coalition government in 2006-07, CN Ashwath Narayan, B Sriramulu, R Ashoka, Govind Karjol and JC Madhuswamy. What most of them want:Bengaluru development along with urban development, Industries, public works department, rural development and panchayat raj, revenue and health are among other portfolios which the ministers are racing for. While Ashoka and V Somanna are vying for Bengaluru development, Ashwath Narayan has emerged as the third contender. Somanna, who was housing minister in Yediyurappa‚Äôs cabinet, is desperately seeking for a better portfolio that suits his seniority. ‚ÄúI hope the CM will make the best use of my experience. I'll deliver if portfolios like revenue and urban development, if not Bengaluru development, are given to me,‚Äù said Somanna. The race is between Murugesh Nirani and Eshwarappa for industries, while Umesh Katti is also aspiring for it. Sources said senior ministers are likely to retain the portfolios they held in the Yediyurappa cabinet. The leadership is also looking to allocate significant portfolios to younger ministers, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-new-ministers-eye-plum-portfolios-cm-basavaraj-bommai-may-retain-irrigation-finance/articleshow/85087777.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Addressing reporters on Thursday, Auda Viegas of Bailancho Ekvott demanded that a woman police inspector be immediately posted at the South Goa district headquarters, Margao, ‚Äúas certain sections of the law can only be investigated by a woman police inspector‚Äù. Viegas also demanded upgradation of the women and child protection unit at Margao to a full-fledged police station so that women survivors of violence could be ably assisted by police. The women‚Äôs right activist also demanded deployment of more vehicles at all police stations for ensuring quick response by police in emergencies. Viegas also demanded increased surveillance and patrolling by police on beaches to ensure safety of women and children. She also underscored the need for sensitisation of stakeholders ‚Äî police, doctors and legal fraternity ‚Äî while dealing with victims of crimes against women. In the last 30 days, the state has seen three rape incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fast-track-rape-cases-womens-group/articleshow/85082765.cms||---
---||India||Tokyo turnaround: A bronze that heralds hope for a new golden age||Remember the day. The bronze that Indian men's hockey team won with a fighting, brave, heart-stopping 5-4 win over Germany will resonate in the annals of Indian hockey - no, Indian sport - for a long time to come. It will speak of not just turning a corner, but of a lifetime rolling over, as if in deep slumber all these four decades. What Manpreet Singh and his gritty men achieved on a muggy morning at the Oi stadium in Tokyo was not just to correct years of dejection by finally capturing an elusive medal at the Olympics. Crucially, what they were achieving was the affirmation of why hockey is still the national sport of the country. What's all the fuss about, the millennial Indian might ask? After all, over 70% of the country's population wasn't even born when India last stood on the hockey podium - Moscow 1980, for gold. Truth is, the game has changed in the last four decades, completely unrecognizable from when we were lords and masters of a sport that demanded grace and oozed class. On Thursday, we were winning bronze in Tokyo, in a new sport wrapped in an older idea. It was a medal as much needed to rejuvenate a sport as it was perhaps to shake off perceptions of old. But we can be allowed to rejoice like we are doing at the moment. Hockey was always India's first love, nothing united us diverse people like this sport of sticks and guile. Maybe it was its inherent trickery, the accent on control, speed and skill and the accompanying egalitarian ethos that won over everybody ‚Äì the Sikh, the north-easterner, Anglo-Indian, south Indian, Adivasi, and north Indian, all nurtured a soft spot for the sport and that‚Äôs why the disappointments of the past 40 years always hurt so much more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tokyo-turnaround-a-bronze-that-heralds-hope-for-a-new-golden-age/articleshow/85087790.cms||Manuja Veerappa
---||Bengaluru||No compromise on Mekedatu water project, says Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai||BENGALURU: Notwithstanding the protest by Tamil Nadu‚Äôs BJP unit, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday asserted there will be no ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù on Mekedatu project, which the state wants to undertake across Cauvery river. He said neighbouring Tamil Nadu is opposing it for the sake of politics. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care who goes on strike. They are playing politics for the sake of politics on this issue. Be it DMK, AIADMK or even my own party (BJP), there is no compromise on the construction of Mekedatu reservoir as it‚Äôs well within our right and we will go ahead with the project,‚Äù Bommai told reporters. The CM‚Äôs comments came on a day when the TN unit of BJP led by its president K Annamalai, a former Karnataka-cadre IPS officer, staged a hunger strike in Thanjavur against Karnataka‚Äôs move to build a reservoir on the Cauvery at Mekedatu. Thanjavur, a fertile Cauvery delta region, is described as Tamil Nadu‚Äôs ‚Äúrice bowl‚Äù. Bommai said everyone is aware the project is for drinking water, power generation and sharing of water during distress period, and referred to his meeting with Union jal shakti minister along with a delegation of MPs from the state on this. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident the DPR will be approved at the earliest. We will also get other clearances... If anyone is protesting, we have nothing to do with it. It is being done for politics, we will not take it into account,‚Äù he added. Addressing the protesters at Thanjavur, Annamalai claimed the law was clearly in favour of the lower riparian state (TN) and that Karnataka could not go ahead with the project without its consent. ‚ÄúThe Inter-State River Water Disputes Act is clear. You cannot build the dam without the consent of the lower riparian state. BJP always stands for the well-being of farmers and it will not allow the construction of Mekedatu reservoir,‚Äù he asserted. Mekedatu is a multipurpose project, which involves building a balancing reservoir near Kanakapura in Ramanagara district. Karnataka farmers want to ‚Äòeducate‚Äô Tamil Nadu counterparts:Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Badagalapura Nagendra on Thursday said farmers will ‚Äúeducate their Tamil Nadu counterparts about the benefits of Mekedatu project‚Äù during the protest against the Centre‚Äôs farm laws scheduled on August 21-22. Burning issue: A file photo of various pro-Kannada activists protesting Tamil Nadu's opposition to Mekedatu drinking water projectHe said Tamil Nadu farmers are protesting against the three farm laws and have invited the farming community in Karnataka to join them. ‚ÄúFarmers in the neighbouring state have been misled about the Mekedatu project by politicians who are spreading false information that they would be inconvenienced,‚Äù Nagendra alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-compromise-on-mekedatu-water-project-says-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai/articleshow/85087813.cms||---
---||Chennai||AIADMK presidium chief E Madhusudhanan dies in Chennai hospital at 81||CHENNAI: Former minister and AIADMK presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan died at a private hospital in Chennai on Thursday. He was 81. He was admitted to the hospital with multi-organ dysfunction in July and was treated in the critical care unit by a medical team. Madhusudhanan‚Äôs wife C Jeeva passed away in April due to Covid-19. The couple didn‚Äôt have any children, reports Julie Mariappan. AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami condoled the death and the party has announced three-day mourning. E Madhusudhanan flanked by Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam at a party meetingAn ardent loyalist of MGR and J Jayalalithaa, Madhusudhanan had been the presidium chairman of the party since 2007. He was one of the four officebearers who won the two-leaves symbol case in the EC in November 2017 which helped the unified party successfully complete its consecutive term in office. MGR nominated Madhusudhanan to the Madras Legislative Council in 1984. Elected for the first time as an MLA from Dr Radhakrishnan Nagar, Madhusudhanan was inducted into J Jayalalithaa‚Äôs first cabinet in 1991 as minister of handlooms and textiles. Madhusudhanan remained staunch loyalist of MGR, JayaChennai: AIADMK leader E Madhusudhanan, who had been the presidium chairman of the party since 2007, remained a staunch loyalist of party founder M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa till his end. This was reiterated by Jayalalithaa aide V K Sasikala when she visited the ailing leader at a city hospital recently. Madhusudhanan held the second most powerful position in the party and was one of the four office-bearers, besides O Panneerselvam, S Semmalai and Edappadi K Palaniswami, who won the two-leaves symbol case before the election commission in November 2017. This helped the unified party successfully complete its consecutive term after former chief minister Jayalalithaa‚Äôs death in 2016. Sasikala has challenged her removal from the post of general secretary at a general council meeting chaired by Madhusudhanan. His alliance with Dravidian leaders began when he started an MGR fan club in 1953 in his early teens. The bitter rivalry between him and then ADMK‚Äôs Chennai district secretary Jeppiyar had MGR appointing him as district secretary of MGR Mandram. He lost to Jeppiar in the party organization election in 1981. MGR nominated him to the Madras Legislative Council as a member three years later. Siding with Jayalalithaa at a crucial juncture after MGR‚Äôs death won him the post of Chennai district secretary in the Jayalalithaa faction of AIADMK, a post which he continued to hold until 1994 even after the merger of the two factions. Madhusudhanan had a tight grip on North Chennai all his life. ‚ÄúIt was Amma (Jayalalithaa), who got Thalaivar (MGR) to preside over Madhusudhanan‚Äôs wedding in 1984, when she was propaganda secretary of the party,‚Äù a close associate said. Madhusudhanan as first-time MLA from Dr Radhakrishnan Nagar in North Chennai, was inducted into Jayalalithaa‚Äôs first cabinet in 1991 as minister of handlooms and textiles minister. He was arrested during DMK government in the ‚Äòfree dhotisaree‚Äô scam, and the trial court in 2000 sentenced him to two years rigorous imprisonment. The Madras high court acquitted Madhushudanan and others in 2009. Madhusudhanan was also briefly in CBI custody during the DMK regime in a case relating to acid attack on former bureaucrat-cum-politician V S Chandralekha in 1992. He sided with O Panneerselvam when the latter began a dharmayudh against Sasikala clan in 2017, despite being one of the first leaders to persuade her to take over the party reins as general secretary after Jayalalithaa‚Äôs death. A day later Sasikala expelled him from the party. ‚ÄúShe cannot expel me since I have already expelled her from the AIADMK,‚Äù Madhusudanan told this correspondent then. In 2017, the AIADMK fielded him in the bypoll to Dr Radhakrishnan Nagar assembly seat. He lost the seat to Sasikala‚Äôs nephew T T V Dhinakaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-presidium-chief-e-madhusudhanan-dies-in-chennai-hospital-at-81/articleshow/85087801.cms||Julie Mariappan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai University cuts campus service fees for both UG & PG students||MUMBAI: Students seeking admission in undergraduate colleges across Mumbai University will benefit by around Rs 1,700 as fees and charges for various campus services have been reduced for 2021-22. Meanwhile, the university has announced 100% fee waiver for students who have lost either parent or both due to Covid-19. A total of 52,040 applicants registered at the university on Day One of admissions on Thursday. While tuition of Rs 800 for aided colleges and Rs 3,000-6,000 for unaided programmes has not been touched, ancillary charges have been drastically slashed. The circular follows an announcement made by higher and technical education minister Uday Samant who had directed universities to cut fees as people were financially affected by the Covid pandemic. Additionally, colleges have been told to accept fees in instalments, said T A Shiware, chairman, Association of Non-Government Colleges. Other than tuition fees, all other charges have been slashed. For instance, the MU has asked for 100% reduction of caution fee, library deposit, laboratory deposit, industrial visit, magazine fee and student welfare fund. Similarly, under Slab 2, it has stated that 50% fees have to be reduced for library, laboratory, gymkhana, extra-curricular, and 25% exam fees must be cut too (see box). In case of extra-curricular activities, colleges which have conducted the exercises should collect 50% of the specific fees and those colleges that have not conducted any extra-curricular activities should not charge any amount under this head. Similarly, colleges which have published online magazines will collect 25% of the magazine fees and those that have not published any have been directed to not charge any fee for the same. If the pandemic situation normalizes in future and students are allowed to attend colleges physically, the proportionate fee component under different heads, including hostel fees, may be charged separately to students of undergraduate and post-graduate courses and programs of arts, science and commerce streams across colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai, the circular clarified. MU has also decided to give free-of-cost marksheets, convocation certificates and other documents to students who may have lost these during the floods in Mahad, Chiplun and other regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-cuts-campus-service-fees-for-both-ug-pg-students/articleshow/85087847.cms||---

A senior fisheries department official said the auctions, generally held when the catch arrives, will now be allowed only between 10pm and 5am at the wharf on the eastern side of the harbour. The auction area will be cordoned off and only the regular participants, who have been issued identity cards by the fisheries department, will be allowed in after presenting the cards to the officials at the entrance. People wanting to buy fish will be allowed in only after 6am, a move aimed at dispersing people from congregating in large numbers at a time in one place. During past weekends, participants in auctions and fish buyers mingled freely and the harbour area wore a crowded look, the official said. The new plan is the combined effort of Greater Chennai Corporation, the fisheries department and police to prevent crowding at the city‚Äôs biggest fish landing centre and retail market. On Thursday, a meeting was conducted by the fisheries department with representatives of various government departments, the fishermen‚Äôs association, boat owners and police. Sea faring fishermen, boat owners, drivers, men and women involved in the auctioneering and those involved in the retail trade have been advised to take the vaccine. A couple of special camps have been held so far and a sizeable number of fishermen administered the vaccine. A similar programme is being planned soon, the official said. The new arrangements will come into force this weekend on a trial basis. Depending upon the outcome, the department will decide on continuing it. The department has no proposal to shift the auction centre or the market as there is no space available elsewhere, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-new-rules-for-auction-fish-sale-at-kasimedu/articleshow/85087855.cms||P Oppili

The state reported 33 deaths and discharged 1,943 patients, leaving 20,188 patients on the active registry, a rise from 20,117 patients on Wednesday. With 220 new cases Coimbatore retained its tag as district with most daily cases, but it recorded a slight dip from the 226 cases on Wednesday. After Coimbatore, Chennai reported 196 cases compared to 189 on Wednesday. Neighbouring Chengalpet, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram also reported an increase in cases with the highest increase reported in Tiruvannamalai, where cases went up from 37 on Wednesday to 64 on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe have enhanced testing in all districts and we are tracking contacts meticulously,‚Äù said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. ‚ÄúWe have told all districts that the risk is still high because we reported at least 1,700 cases on average and new cases reported every day continue to remain erratic.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC raps ‚Äòyoung‚Äô VVMC over 9,000 illegal structures||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the administrator of the Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC), who is the civic chief, to take appropriate action against the 9,000-odd illegal constructions in its jurisdiction. ‚ÄúSuch a young municipal corporation and this is happening! What will happen after a few years? It will become like Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli and Ulhasnagar. People are dying (in illegal building crashes),‚Äô‚Äô the HC said while hearing a plea filed last year seeking the demolition of all illegal structures in Vasai-Virar. TimesViewThe entire Vasai-Virar belt has become a hub for unauthorised buildings, including many seaside resorts which have come up in flagrant violation of coastal regulations. The court has rightly questioned the local corporation for failing to act against illegal constructions, which could pose a grave risk to people residing in such structures.Don‚Äôt indulge in blame game, HC tells VVMCAn HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni slammed the Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) over illegal constructions in the area while hearing a PIL by Nalasopara resident Terrence Hendriques. When VVMC‚Äôs advocate Swati Sagwekar informed the court that 9,000 illegal structures had been identified, the CJ asked: ‚ÄúWhat action have you taken? You are acknowledging what is in the petition.‚Äô‚Äô On being informed that the VVMC was formed in 2011, Justice Kulkarni said: ‚ÄúNine years and 9,000 illegal constructions.‚Äù On Sagwekar‚Äôs reply that they had come up when Cidco was in charge, Justice Kulkarni shot back: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt indulge in blame game. You have to take action. We see the failure of corporations in the entire state. This is causing agony and pain to citizens.‚Äù Disputing VVMC‚Äôs data, Hendriques‚Äôs advocate Ajay Jaiswal claimed there are around 12,000 illegal structures. ‚ÄúThere is open construction in front of their eyes,‚Äô‚Äô he added. The judges said if VVMC is in no position to function in accordance with law, they will direct it to be dissolved and appoint an administrator. Sagwekar informed the HC that the VVMC had already been dissolved in June 2020 and an administrator appointed because elections could not be held due to the pandemic. In their order, the judges said they expect the administrator, who is the municipal chief, ‚Äúto proceed in accordance with law and take appropriate action‚Äô‚Äô against the unauthorised constructions and for this purpose he can move HC. After two weeks, he has to place on record his ‚Äúfuture course of action‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-raps-young-vvmc-over-9000-illegal-structures/articleshow/85087885.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Amritsar||Punjab: Will nullify PPAs, Centre‚Äôs three farm laws in upcoming assembly session, says Navjot Singh Sidhu||BATHINDA: Newly-elected president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, Navjot Singh Sidhu has assured that power purchase agreements (PPAs) and ‚Äòblack farm laws‚Äô, which have broken the backbone of the state‚Äôs economy, would be repealed in the next assembly session. Sidhu made the announcement on Thursday, while virtually kickstarting the campaign for the next assembly elections in small rallies at Moga and Faridkot, though these were referred to as meetings of party workers. Addressing the packed gatherings, Sidhu said the previous SAD-BJP government had entered into power deals to protect their own interests. Similarly, the three black laws implemented by the Union government were a ploy to break the backbone of Punjab and these would be repealed in the next Punjab assembly session. He said Punjab did not need any Delhi model as it will be a model in itself. Similarly, as Punjab is capable of making its own laws, the state does not need those imposed by the Centre, he said. Describing SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal‚Äôs 13-point programme as ‚Äúnew lollipop‚Äù, the PCC chief said he (Sukhbir) should reveal the resources to make this programme a reality. The SAD-BJP government had plunged Punjab into a debt of Rs. 1.5 lakh crore, which is rising further, he said. ‚ÄúToday, we need to think about how to fill the Punjab coffers,‚Äù he added. Accusing the previous government in state of plundering the natural resources of Punjab, he said the state has an area of 1,100 km of rivers but it used to deposit only Rs 3 crore per month in the exchequer as sand revenue, which has now increased to Rs 300 crore under Congress government. Punjab was dominated by cable mafia, sand mafia, transport mafia and other mafias which are slowly being eradicated, he claimed. He denied any factionalism in Punjab Congress. He also announced to start constituency-wise rallies after August 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/will-nullify-ppas-centres-3-farm-laws-in-upcoming-assembly-session-sidhu/articleshow/85085560.cms||Neel Kamal

The northern Maharashtra city has a population of 3.75 lakh. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate confirmed to TOI that Dhule is the only city in the state where there are no active cases. ‚ÄúIn many other cities, the active cases are constantly declining but they are yet to come to nought,‚Äù he added. Dr Vishal Patil, Dhule district Covid-19 coordinator, told TOI that there have been no active cases within the limits of the Dhule Municipal Corporation since August 3. ‚ÄúThe city was one of the Covid hotspots in the district during the second wave of the pandemic. Although there were fewer deaths during the second wave, the total number of people who tested positive in Dhule city was much higher than in the first wave,‚Äù said Patil. During the second wave, Dhule city registered 11,053 positive cases as against 7,116 in the first wave. While 88 Covid patients succumbed in the city during the second wave, there were 173 deaths in the first wave. Dr Mahesh More, chief medical officer of the Dhule Municipal Corporation, said the city had single-digit active cases for the last few weeks. ‚ÄúBut we continue to conduct 300-500 tests daily,‚Äù he added. Overall, there are four active cases in Dhule district, all from Sikri, three of whom are under home isolation. Overall, the state had 72,810 active cases on Wednesday night. Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Satara Solapur, Ahmednagar districts have more than 5,000 active cases. As against this, Gadchiroli, Gondia, Washim, Amravati and Hingoli districts have less than 100 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dhule-first-city-in-maharashtra-to-get-covid-free-tag/articleshow/85087887.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Chandigarh||SAD demands CBI probe into Mohali shamlat land ‚Äòscam‚Äô||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday demanded a CBI probe into the alleged shamlat land ‚Äòscam‚Äô in Balongi village of Mohali district, stating that health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu has usurped prime land worth Rs 100 crore in the name of a trust headed by him. Demanding immediate cancellation of the trust deed, SAD MLA Bikram Singh Majithia demanded a probe into the allotment of the land in Mohali to the trust by rural development and panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. He said it was condemnable that even though the panchayats department had allowed the lease of 10.4 acres for the Bal Gopal Gau Basera society headed by the health minister ostensibly to run a ‚Äògaushala‚Äô, it had also allowed construction of a banquet hall and a diagnostic centre on the same land. ‚ÄúThis makes it clear that the lease deed was not made in good faith. The entire process smells of a scam. The government should register a case of cheating against the health minister and members of the trust as well as officials of the panchayats department responsible for this illegality,‚Äù he said. Majithia added that one Paras Mahajan, who was involved in the transfer of shamlat land at Darri village, is also a member of the Gaushala Trust floated by the minister. Stating that the SAD would move the court in case the government did not cancel the lease deed, the SAD MLA said that earlier also the high court had prevented the minister from usurping land at Darri on the airport road in Mohali. ‚ÄúSidhu was successful in taking over four acres of land at Darri worth Rs 10 crore per acre from the village panchayat by giving it (panchayat) possession of a similar amount of land worth peanuts near a nullah. The high court, however, overturned the government‚Äôs decision,‚Äù said the SAD leader. Even in the present case involving taking over 10.4 acres of prime land in Balongi, due process was not followed and Sidhu was allotted land at a throwaway lease price of Rs 25,000 per acre, he said. The MLA added this was done despite the land not being suitable for establishment of a ‚Äògaushala‚Äô, which villagers felt should be closer to the village. ‚ÄúMoreover this same piece of land was earlier in the possession of the small scale industries department on lease. It is most suited for a mega project or a public facility like a park which was the demand of the people of Balongi. The village panchayat could have also earned a handsome profit by leasing out the land for commercial purposes,‚Äù said Majithia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-demands-cbi-probe-into-mohali-shamlat-land-scam/articleshow/85085601.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP to roll out vax drive for ‚Äòdeprived‚Äô villagers||KOLKATA: The BJP in Bengal has decided to launch a vaccination programme for those ‚Äúdeprived‚Äù by the state immunisation drive against Covid-19. The party held a health workshop at its Hastings office on Thursday with the aim to enrol two volunteers from each village who will identify beneficiaries and take them to hospitals under central institutions/schemes such as the Indian Railways, the port authorities and the ESI. National general secretary of BJP D Purandeswari released the health manual for volunteers. Trained by a team of doctors led by Indranil Khan, these volunteers will arrange for Covid tests of families whose one member has contracted the virus. The state BJP unit will facilitate the tests at NICED and private laboratories. Leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari, while inaugurating Thursday‚Äôs health workshop, targeted the ruling Trinamool Congress over what he labelled as ‚Äúvaccination politics‚Äù in Bengal. ‚ÄúThousands of BJP supporters and their families, rendered homeless in post-poll violence, have been denied the jab. Our volunteers will reach out to villages in Canning, Gosaba and Jhargram (among others) and draw up a list of names for Covid tests at NICED and vaccination at central institutions,‚Äù he said. Adhikari said he had urged the Union health minister to send vaccine doses directly to central institutions ‚Äúto reduce dependence on the state government‚Äù. He seized the opportunity to ‚Äúcall the bluff‚Äù of the state government over vaccine procurement from the market. ‚ÄúThe CM, who is also the health minister, promised the people of Bengal on May 5 that her government will arrange for free vaccination. She took a 180-degree turn later and said it was not possible for the state to procure vaccines from the manufacturer. Of the 2.6 crore people who have received their first doses and some their second, only 18 lakh were purchased by the state,‚Äù he said. The BJP leader further accused the state of ‚Äúbad management‚Äù of vaccination centres. ‚ÄúThe number of vaccination centres in Bengal is the lowest in the country. We also came to know about fake camps run by an impostor IAS officer close to Trinamool ministers and leaders. The state doesn‚Äôt even have a basic cold chain facility to dispatch vaccines to centres. As a result, nine lakh doses were wasted during initial days,‚Äù he said. Adhikari claimed the state was not encouraging Covid tests ‚Äúout of fear‚Äù, as a high number of positive cases might delay the assembly bypolls that ‚Äúthe non-MLA CM needs badly‚Äù to continue in her chair. ‚ÄúI say with responsibility that state-run centres have been asked not to conduct more than 20 Covid tests a day. Our health volunteers will make it their ‚Äòseva mission‚Äô to arrange for necessary tests,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-to-roll-out-vax-drive-for-deprived-villagers/articleshow/85084593.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Vadodara||Reviving Vishwamitri isn‚Äôt impossible||Vadodara: Every time a layman talks about Vishwamitri river, it is either about its waters flooding the city or crocodiles popping out from its nooks and corners. For years, it has been said that concretizing its banks on the lines of the Sabarmati river isn‚Äôt an option. So, what are the ways to restore, rejuvenate and revive the ancient Vishwamitri that had ghats dotting on its banks. Champions of the ‚ÄòVaho Vishwamitri Abhiyan‚Äô for over a decade have been suggesting that the river can be revived through a scientifically planned and ecologically sustainable bio-shield. M S University too has converted a stretch of Bhukhi Nullah, a tributary of the river that passes from its campus into an ecological experimental zone. Instead of treating it as yet another riverfront project, the river can be revived as a bio-zone ‚Äî right from its origin from Pavagadh to the sea. The Vaho Vishwamitri project divides the river into three zones ‚Äî one from Pavagadh hilltop from where the river originates to Halol, second from Vadodara city and third from Vadodara to the end at the Gulf of Cambay where it meets the sea. ‚ÄúOur three focus areas as part of the movement include waste management, waste water management and bio-shield. In order to ensure a consistent flow of the river surrounded by green banks, we will work towards creating a bio-shield wherein every tree planted will act as a micro-check dam that will support the local flora and fauna leading to a cleaner and greener environment,‚Äù says Dr M H Mehta, former vice-chancellor of Gujarat Agriculture University. In March this year, MSU started pilot for eco-restoration of the Bhukhi stream. The project initiated by joint efforts of departments of botany, environmental science, architecture faculty and construction division of MSU, is to set an example of stabilizing bank of the stream. First, the bank site that falls in the backyard of the botanical garden was cleaned and cleared, levelled with fertilized soil and then covered with sheets of jute bags. Around 500 plants have been planted at this place by making holes on this sheet. The trees have been planted depending on their root properties and structures. The students and teachers are now planning experiments by creating no disturbance zones. ‚ÄúThis is to understand how the habitat rejuvenation occurs and how the carrying capacity of the ecosystem is improved. Of course, it will require few years to reach to any conclusion but we will be able to recognize the trends,‚Äù said a teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/reviving-vishwamitri-isnt-impossible/articleshow/85077866.cms||Prashant Rupera

The primary health centre at Ashokenagar-Kalyangarh had arranged for vaccine doses for 200 people who had submitted their ID proof earlier. However, the queue strength was way more when the centre opened for the day‚Äôs immunisation drive. Those who were denied vaccines set up a roadblock, prompting police intervention. As the situation snowballed, cops had to use force. At least four persons, including an elderly couple, were injured in the lathi-charge. ‚ÄúWe had stocked up 200 doses for the day. Trouble started when more people, who had booked slots on CoWin, joined the queue. They blocked Ashokenagar-Naihati road when refused the jab owing to limited stock,‚Äù a municipal health officer said. Siliguri witnessed similar chaos after people waiting in a queue outside a vaccination centre since Wednesday night were asked by police to leave. Local residents said the scuffle followed a heated argument between cops trying to enforce night curfew and beneficiaries refusing to budge. The situation was brought under control later in the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scuffle-chaos-at-vax-centres-in-north-24-parganas-siliguri/articleshow/85084401.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Bengal‚Äôs educational campuses may open post-Pujas: CM||KOLKATA: Bengal is considering reopening schools and colleges on alternate days sometime after the Durga Puja vacations, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday after the 66th meeting of the state‚Äôs Covid Global Advisory Board attended by, among others, 2019 economics Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee. The CM did not give out any definite timeline, indicating that ‚Äúmany factors‚Äù had to be weighed in, but left enough indications that the reopening may be allowed if the state‚Äôs Covid graph kept sliding further. The Nobel laureate said Thursday‚Äôs meeting was held to primarily discuss preparations for the third wave of the pandemic. And though he did not answer directly when questioned whether the Centre was discriminating against Bengal in vaccine distribution, he said the Centre was ‚Äúnot capable of generating enough vaccines for the entire country‚Äù, praising the state for being the ‚Äúbest in the country in negative wastage‚Äù. Board member Swarup Sarkar, a former WHO director of communicable diseases, who also attended the meeting, explained the factors being weighed in by the experts. ‚ÄúBased on available research, unless 70% to 80% of the population is vaccinated, it is difficult to prevent subsequent waves. The numbers out in the public domain indicate that with the current pace of vaccination in India, this cannot be achieved before June 2022. The problem with partial vaccination is that it also gives rise to mutants,‚Äù he said. Considering the factors, the state was considering a November reopening of schools and colleges, said sources. Bengal is vaccinating around 3 lakh to 4 lakh people daily, the chief minister said, adding that three crore people in Bengal had received their first dose, of whom around 90 lakh had got both doses. At the current pace, the state hopes to double its vaccination numbers to six crore before Durga Puja in the second week of October. That would help it achieve the 80% vaccination target (at least one dose). The chief minister stressed, more than once, that the state needed more vaccines. ‚ÄúBengal has three international borders and is a gateway to the north-eastern states. The Delta variant is increasing. Save us from Delta,‚Äù she said, her comment directed at the Centre. Nobel laureate Banerjee, while praising the negative wastage, commented that the state had utilised ‚Äúwhatever it had been allotted, and more.‚Äù Asked whether the curbs will remain during Durga Puja, he said: ‚ÄúLast year, we had given a detailed guideline for the festivals. The government had carefully implemented it. I believe the (Calcutta) High Court had also said something. But this meeting was primarily to discuss the third wave. I would urge you (the media) to inform people not to delay treatment. There is enough oxygen, and people have been trained. If anyone feels any inconvenience, they must seek medical advice immediately. Delay in treatment is also leading to deaths.‚Äù Sarkar, however, indicated that the curbs should continue even during the festivals. Asked specifically on the economic fallouts of rising inflation and the price-hike on fuel and LPG, the economist said: ‚ÄúThe (Union) government has a fiscal problem, and it may have more faith in balancing the budget than free-spending policies. The government is trying to use the one instrument it has as other forms of tax collection are not necessarily keeping pace, given the economy is slow. It is using this to balance the budget. But this is not the direction the government should not have taken.... I think the government should have been more open-handed with spending. I have said this many, many times. I think the central government is too unwilling to do what US or European economies are doing ‚Äî printing money and spending. And I think that would have been a better policy in the present context. Inflation is already up due to the high fuel prices. I think there is a good case for being more open-handed. But to be fair, the central government has now moved towards that direction and announced several relaxations. I think being less mindful of the deficit might be the right strategy.‚Äù Specifically on Bengal, he said: ‚ÄúEconomy is integrated, and it is difficult for one state to do something different from the rest of the country. People work outside. Our produce is sold outside, we buy from others.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengals-edu-campuses-may-open-post-pujas-cm/articleshow/85083978.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee writes to PM Modi over short vax supply to Bengal||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Thursday saying Bengal stared at a grim situation if the Centre didn‚Äôt provide adequate vaccine supplies to the state, pointing out to the recent spike in Covid cases in Sikkim, Assam and the northeast. Questioning why less populated states were getting more vaccines, Banerjee argued that ‚Äúspecial precautionary measures‚Äù must be taken for Bengal since it shared three international borders and was a gateway to the Northeastern states. Bengal needed 14 crore doses and had received only 2.6 crore doses, the CM added. ‚ÄúI am sorry to say the central government is providing a larger number of vaccine doses to states like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka, which are BJP-ruled. I have no problem if they or any other state for that matter receives a higher number of vaccine doses, but I cannot remain a mute spectator to see Bengal deprived,‚Äù Banerjee wrote. The CM had raised this issue when she met the PM in New Delhi on July 27. In a reply to TMC MP Mala Roy, the Union health ministry had also informed in the Lok Sabha that Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Karnataka had received more vaccines than Bengal from January to June this year. As per the 2021 electoral roll data, Bengal has a 7.3 crore population above 18 years who are eligible for vaccination and hence the 14-crore dose sought by the CM. Banerjee added: ‚ÄúPresently, we are administering 4 lakh doses per day and are capable of giving 11 lakh doses per day. Yet, we are getting a much lower number of doses despite having a very high population density and a higher rate of urbanization.‚Äù The CM said Bengal has already administered 3 crore doses till date, of which 2.2 crore people have been administered the first dose and 88.9 lakh people with the second dose. ‚ÄúYou will be happy to note that Covid positivity rate in Bengal, which increased from 3% (March 2021) to 33% (April-May 2021) due to the prolonged 8-phase Assembly elections in the state has now come down to 1.5% due to our sustained efforts,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúEven after the devastation caused by the second wave, the Centre has not been augmenting supply of vaccines to the states on a war footing to combat future waves. As a result, thousands of innocent peop1e are still being affected every day,‚Äù Banerjee wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-writes-to-pm-over-vax-short-supply-to-bengal/articleshow/85084368.cms||---

A division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj, hearing several petitions on ‚ÄúCovid mismanagement‚Äù, made its observation while following in the footsteps of the Supreme Court, which recently pulled up the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on the same compensation issue. Acting CJ Bindal said: ‚ÄúAre you trying to break the (state) healthcare system? Why haven‚Äôt frontline Covid warriors been compensated till now?‚Äù The state said it would compensate frontline workers who had died of Covid or had battled the infection. The judge reiterated: ‚ÄúWill compensate is no logic... Why hasn‚Äôt it been done yet?‚Äù The HC then sought the state‚Äôs detailed response on compensation. ‚ÄúHow many have been compensated? How many haven‚Äôt been compensated? What are the reasons for the delay?‚Äù the bench said, seeking a reply by August 12. Bengal is among the few states that had announced a separate compensation scheme for frontline Covid workers. Initially, it covered healthcare professionals and police. Later, the state issued a health and death insurance scheme covering all those employed by it for Covid management. Under the scheme, the state pays Rs 10 lakh ex gratia to the kin of deceased Covid warriors while the benefit is Rs 1 lakh for treatment. During the assembly elections earlier this year, the scheme was also extended to central paramilitary personnel deployed in Bengal. According to the petitions filed, it is alleged that several applicants have not been paid the promised compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-seeks-bengal-govt-reply-on-covid-compensation-by-aug-12/articleshow/85084512.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Opposition throws weight behind Trinamool over MP suspensions||Kolkata: All opposition parties led by Congress threw their weight behind Trinamool Congress on Thursday after six of its MPs were suspended and a complaint was lodged by a Parliament Security Services (PSS) officer against TMC MP Arpita Ghosh. TMC had questioned the manner in which the MPs were stopped from entering the House to pick up their personal belongings even after it was adjourned. Rajya Sabha opposition leader Mallikarjun Kharge made a strong statement criticising the suspension of six TMC MPs and the subsequent events later. According to the complaint made, while trying to forcibly enter the chamber, Ghosh broke the glass pane of the wooden door by smashing her mobile phone, which caused ‚Äúminor bruises/abrasions‚Äù to an Assistant Section Officer (ASO). When the Rajya Sabha convened, TMC chief whip Sukhendu Sekhar Ray raised a point of order disputing the complaint. ‚ÄúThe MPs were supposed to come and take away their bags after the adjournment of the House. There was no meeting; the House was adjourned for the day, they were not allowed by security people and in the commotion the glass pane was broken. How come the responsibility lies on her (Ghosh)? And for that she will be suspended again today,‚Äù he said. It was on this that Kharge spoke out strongly before the House was adjourned again. TMC Rajya Sabha leader Derek O‚ÄôBrien tweeted the video of Kharge‚Äôs speech, dubbing it as a ‚Äúpowerful intervention on behalf of all Oppn supporting AITC MPs who were STOPPED from re-entering Rajya Sabha AFTER suspension was lifted. There's irrefutable video evidence.‚Äù He also showcased this as ‚Äúwhat a UNITED OPPOSITION looks like.‚Äù The six MPs ‚Äî Dola Sen, Md Nadimul Haque, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Shanta Chhetri, Ghosh and Mausam Noor ‚Äî were suspended for showing placards on the Pegasus issue. TMC Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra posted on Twitter, ‚ÄúSuspending Oppn members for showing placards is grossly unfair. No Pegasus debate, no placards, how should we question govt? Will probably get suspended today for this (tweet).‚Äù A senior party MP said, ‚ÄúLater in the day, efforts were made to reach out to leaders of all political parties to break the stand-off. However, no party went, which shows that the opposition is united on this issue too.‚Äù The TMC MP added: ‚ÄúMany had taken a strong exception to a tweet by a senior lawyer, now a RS member, who seemed to advocate an FIR under non-bailable sections against MP. He may have donned his lawyer‚Äôs hat, but there are also MP‚Äôs rights and privileges. The protests will continue till our demands for a structured discussion by the Prime Minister or the home minister on the Pegasus issue are met.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/opposition-throws-weight-behind-trinamool-over-mp-suspensions/articleshow/85084462.cms||---

A division bench of the HC led by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal will hear the matter on August 11. Youth Front has filed a PIL stating the agitation, that has been going on for some days inside hospital premises, is creating a disturbance for patients. The petition says both outpatients and those hospitalized are being inconvenienced, particularly at a time when patient pressure is huge because of the Covid-19 situation. The petitioner drew the court‚Äôs attention to the fact that hospital premises are considered an ‚Äúemergency area‚Äù and sought directions to the state government to control the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pil-in-hc-seeks-intervention-in-nurse-protests-hearing-next-wk/articleshow/85085633.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Army deployed to ramp up Khanakul flood relief||Hooghly/Midnapore/Howrah: The Army was deployed in Hooghly on Thursday to help the district administration carry out relief operations in parts of flood-hit Khanakul. With the Army‚Äôs help, dry food, water and fruits could be dispatched to people stranded in three relief camps. Hooghly DM Deepap Priya said IAF helicopters had helped rescue 31 people on Sunday. Army personnel and district officials took boats on the Mundeswari river to provide relief material to Jagatpur, Marokhana, Sabalsinghapur and Ghospur. The Army team also went to Ghospur with flattened rice, jaggery and water for over 100 people who have moved into the first floor of a school. Lack of drinking water and electricity has precipitated the crisis in Khanakul. Sandha Bauri, who is staying in a relief camp since her house was damaged, said the relief material had helped a lot. But she was uncertain of when she‚Äôd be able to return home. The people in the area are worried about release of water from DVC causing a fresh flood. Z Rizvi, SDO of Arambagh, also visited the flood-affected areas with the Army. Civil defence staff took stock of the condition in Khanakul Block II along with local BDO Sankha Bandyopadhyay. Boat dispensaries were arranged to help villagers, including pregnant women, as most health centres have gone underwater. A couple, Dulal Pal (65) and Sadhana Pal (60), died in West Midnapore‚Äôs Goaltore on Wednesday night as a mud wall collapsed on them due to heavy rain. Neighbours found their buried bodies, which were sent for autopsy. The toll in West Midnapore has now risen to 17, including deaths due to wall collapse, snake bite and drowning. The body of an elderly woman was spotted by NDRF in Howrah‚Äôs Sehagari. NDRF arranged for her cremation at Bauria in Uluberia. Tara Chakraborty (81), who died on Wednesday, had been suffering from age-related problems. Water flowed at a high levek in Bargachia in Jagatballavpur area of Howrah, where people are still awaiting relief. Water receded a bit in other parts of Udaynarayanpur, so the number of relief camps were reduced from 32 to 22. Submerged roads gradually started reappearing in Amta. Locals and irrigation staff repaired a breached embankment in Tajpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/army-deployed-to-ramp-up-khanakul-flood-relief/articleshow/85084997.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Kolkata||TMC murder case: Prime accused in net||Kolkata: CID has detained a resident of Guskara for his alleged involvement in the murder of 45-year-old Trinamool ‚Äúanchal president‚Äù Ashim Das in Mongolkote block of East Burdwan. Rafiq Khan‚Äôs detention came less than a month after the investigating agency took over the probe. Police said technical evidence had proved that the accused was present near the scene of the crime and made significant phone calls. They are ascertaining whether Khan himself had contacted the hired killers. ‚ÄúWe will take him in police custody as we have found inconsistencies in his statements. We also need to establish his exact motive,‚Äù said an officer. CID sources said Khan had realized after midnight that cops were after him. He leapt from one roof to another with police in hot pursuit before jumping into a pond filled with water hyacinths, believing he could hide there. CID personnel and local police surrounded the pond; some waded into the water to pull him out into a waiting jeep. CID took charge of the case on July 16, four days after Das‚Äôs murder. A six-member team from Bhawani Bhawan in Kolkata had met his family and visited the crime scene multiple times. Local police had already arrested six persons. Two of them happen to be Trinamool men. The party, however, has claimed the opposition has a role in the killing. The CID team from Bhawani Bhavan went through the report prepared by their local unit before detaining Khan, sources said. Das was a resident of Lakuria village. According to local sources, he was attacked near Siue bus stand while returning home on his bike from Godistha party office. The gunman apparently called out ‚ÄòDada‚Äô, prompting the Trinamool leader to stop and turn around. He was shot in the chest. Party colleagues rushed Das to the primary health centre, where he was declared dead. CID now believes the accused had been tracking the victim for a long time before targeting him in a deserted place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-murder-case-prime-accused-in-net/articleshow/85085445.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Business||Govt hopes to start on clean slate after retro tax changes||NEW DELHI: The government is hoping that the amendments to the retrospective taxation provision - which are aimed at ensuring prospective application of the provisions - will end a long-pending concern and help companies and the Centre make a fresh start once both parties end litigation. Top government sources told TOI that the amendments moved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday has sought to link the end of action by the tax authorities to withdrawal of all cases and doing away with any demand for interest on refunds to ensure that they can begin on a clean slate. "We are dealing with public money so we have also sought Parliamentary approval to refund the money as we want to make the amendment truly prospective. That is why we have suggested that there should be an undertaking to withdraw all litigations and agreements to ensure that only the principal is paid," a senior finance ministry official told TOI. Although many see the amendments as an outcome of the two adverse rulings by international tribunals, the government decision came as a surprise to most analysts. Government sources said Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted the legal process to play out and was clear that the issue needed to be addressed. In the past, former finance minister Arun Jaitley had described the retrospective amendments as erroneous. In fact, in 2014, while presenting his first Budget, Jaitley had assured investors that the Modi government "will not ordinarily bring about any change retrospectively, which creates a fresh liability", while pointing out that the cases would "reach their logical conclusion". The sources argued that with the arbitration awards the logical conclusion had been reached, which had prompted the government to move the amendments. "Ideally, the Congress should have corrected it but this government has to do it. This is a major decision of the PM," a top government functionary said. Tax experts have welcomed the move, saying it will provide much-needed relief and end litigation. "This clearly demonstrates the government's intent to shore-up India's positive investor-friendly image, continue the momentum towards creating India as an attractive investment destination, thereby promoting faster economic growth and employment," said Sanjay Tolia, a partner at consulting firm PW & Co.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-hopes-to-start-on-clean-slate-after-retro-tax-changes/articleshow/85087984.cms||Sidhartha

Oil refineries and fertiliser manufacturers will be asked to implement the policy immediately after the Cabinet approves the proposal, power and renewable energy minister R K Singh told in an interview. He said the renewable energy ministry has sent the proposal for Cabinet approval after discussing with pertinent ministries. The proposal, on the lines of renewable energy purchase obligation for electricity distribution companies, is at the centre of Singh's energy transition and carbon reduction blueprint. According to the policy, starting 2023-24, refineries will have to use green hydrogen for meeting 10% of their requirement. This will rise to 25% in five years. Fertiliser makers will start with 5% green hydrogen, which will go up to 20%. The proposal for the Cabinet also seeks approval to extend the policy to other industries at a later stage. The policy will be applied to industries such as steel and the transport sector gradually as the market evolves. "Currently refineries and other user industries produce grey hydrogen from natural gas. This method produces CO2. The policy will create a market for green hydrogen, which in turn will attract investments in its production," Singh said. "Today, wheeling of renewable energy is free. Companies can bring renewable energy from anywhere to produce green hydrogen. The cost impact will be negligible. Going by our estimates, India can be one of the largest producers of green hydrogen in the world," he added. Steel industry is likely to be brought under the policy's ambit in two years as major changes are required in their set up. But they will have to do it to reduce their carbon footprint and avoid carbon tax on exports to the developed economies, one official said. IndianOil, RIL, JSW and NTPC have made plans to set up green hydrogen facilities. Hydrogen has wide application in manufacturing and is now being looked at as a clean mobility solution. Green hydrogen is the cleanest fuel as it is produced through electrolysis using renewable energy. The colours denote the process through which it is obtained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/soon-green-h2-must-for-refineries/articleshow/85088069.cms||Sanjay Dutta

By-elections are due in Bhowanipore, from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to contest. The seat was contested and won by state agriculture minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay who stepped down to facilitate Banerjee‚Äôs re-election. Junior Union ministers Nisith Pramanik and Subhas Sarkar gave up their Dinhata and Shantipur assembly constituencies, respectively, to remain MPs. Hence, polls are due in these two seats. Gosaba MLA Jayanta Naskar died after winning his seat while Khardah MLA Kajal Sinha died before the poll results were out. Elections in Jangipur and Samsergunj were postponed following the death of candidates. On July 15, six senior Trinamool MPs had met an Election Commission full bench to push for the by-elections in Bengal. CM Banerjee said the party‚Äôs demand was ‚Äúconstitutional and legal‚Äù. She argued that the Covid positivity rate in the state had plummeted below 1.5% and the seven assembly segments were ‚Äúnot contiguous‚Äù.

"Having dominated Parliament for the longest time since 1947, it is ironic that Congress has the least respect for Parliamentary ethos and proceedings. The reason for that is the Congress functioning more like a private firm compared to a political party, where the sole aim is to safeguard the interests of one dynasty," Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad told a press conference. He said the conduct of Congress during the session stems out of two fears-inability to fathom repeated electoral defeats at the hands of the Modi-led BJP and the fear of being overshadowed by other opposition parties. Prasad said the Congress-orchestrated parliamentary suppression reached a peak in 1975 when Indira Gandhi's chair was under cloud, thanks to a court order, and she imposed Emergency. All shameful Parliamentary lows are linked to Congress, Prasad alleged, and cited the use of pepper spray by a Congress MP in Lok Sabha while protesting decisions taken by Congress governments at the Centre and Andhra. Prasad claimed that people who are "hostile" to the Modi government and has an obvious anti-Modi agenda are behind the Pegasus snooping controversy, and it was timed deliberately ahead of the beginning of Parliament's monsoon session. "Is there any prime facie evidence that (phone) numbers were indeed put under surveillance," Prasad asked? He said the Congress is facing such an existential crisis that its leadership is taking juvenile steps, which is reflected in their House conduct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-arrogance-delusion-to-blame-for-parliament-logjam-bjp/articleshow/85088180.cms||---

However, the restrictions will apply to international flyers. Airport Authority of India (AAI) has issued revised quarantine guidelines for Indore airport. The fresh instructions came a week after the negative RTPCR reports for Covid-19 were made mandatory for domestic flyers, along with on spot sampling and quarantine arrangements for passengers travelling without the report among other safety protocols. Airport sources said that there was a mistake or typing error in the previous quarantine guidelines issued by the AAI for different airports of Madhya Pradesh. ‚ÄúThe restrictions that were meant to be made compulsory for international passengers, were released wrongly for the domestic flyers,‚Äù they claimed. The quarantine guideline was released by AAI in the last week of July, and it created confusion among passengers who were preparing or scheduled to travel in flights in August. Indore airport officials were also getting several queries from passengers since they were asked to carry a negative RT-PCR test report along with them while flying in and out of Indore. Airport officiating director Prabodh Chandra Sharma said that a revised quarantine guideline has been released by AAI for Indore airport. ‚ÄúThere was a mistake in the previous guideline, and we had raised the matter with the AAI. A revised guideline has been released for Indore airport in which the compulsion regarding negative RT-PCR test report and quarantine restrictions have been revoked for domestic passengers,‚Äù said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/domestic-flyers-dont-need-rt-pcr-report-at-indore-airport/articleshow/85088140.cms||---

Reports reaching here say that one of the villages, Mewada Kotha, was razed to the ground. As many as half a dozen bridges on River Sindh and Seep have collapsed in the floods, some barely a few years old. Extensive damage to the bridges and roads was reported from Gwalior and Chambal regions. A large chunk of AB Road near Shivpuri has caved in. PWD minister Gopal Bhargawa told TOI, ‚ÄúI have constituted a committee of senior engineers to probe the collapse of the bridges. Five of them were on River Sindh in Datia and Bhind districts, while one was on Seep.‚Äù Heavy rainfall seems to be the main reason, he said. Four of the bridges that collapsed were built in the last 12 years, and a fifth (in Sheopur) was built just eight years ago. The oldest bridge to crumble dates back 20 years. Extensive damage was reported on the Kuno river in Sheopur connecting Shivpuri and Gwalior. ‚ÄúThere is a gap of over 5-6 feet between the connecting road and the bridge‚Äù, government sources said, adding that even the authorities haven‚Äôt been able to visit the site. There are also reports of breaches in bridges on Kwari river near Nepri village on NH552 and another bridge near Dimni, disrupting Morena‚Äôs connectivity with its tehsil towns of Sabalgarh, Dimni and Ambah. Heavy rainfall wreaked havoc in Sheopur. Two bridges on Seep river were wrecked. One of them, connecting Sawaimadhopur district of Rajasthan, was washed away. Another bridge on Seep, connecting Soikala, was damaged extensively. Sheopur is now connected only with Morena district, and cut off from the rest of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-8-year-old-dam-6-bridges-swept-away-in-floods-probe-ordered/articleshow/85088260.cms||Deshdeep Saxena
