BPCL will be supplying 10 to 15 tonnes per day of oxygen with 93% purity produced through the VPSA (vacuum pressure swing adsorption). The company will also donate one oxygen compressor with a motor and control system to MCGM. The company has laid a 1.5-Km-long pipeline for supplying oxygen from the refinery to the MCGM boundary limit. Mumbai was hit hard by the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in March, with the positivity rate in the city among the highest. The second wave across India saw the daily demand for medical oxygen rising to roughly 12 times from what was needed in the pre-COVID times, with a catastrophic impact during March, April and early May. The MCGM decentralized its central war room structure and created 24 peripheral control rooms in all the 24 wards for localized COVID-19 response. Patient admissions were mandated only through the war rooms, which enabled equitable access to hospital beds as per the availability in civic hospitals, dedicated COVID health centres and private hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bpcl-to-supply-medical-oxygen-to-greater-mumbai-civic-body/articleshow/85723745.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Four more districts were impacted with dams releasing water because of incessant rain in the upper reaches. About 1.33 lakh were either homeless or marooned in 11 districts as on Friday. According to the daily bulletin issued by the Assam State Disaster Management Agency (ASDMA) the districts affected by the current wave of the floods caused by incessant rain in the catchment areas are Baksa, Barpeta, Biswanath, Bongaigaon, Chirang, Dhemaji, Dibrugarh, Golaghat, Jorhat, Lakhimpur, Majuli, Morigaon, Sivasagar, Sonitpur and Tinsukia. ASDMA chief executive officer, Gyanendra Tripathi, said that though new districts have been inundated in the last 24 hours, the situation on Saturday was ‘under control’. He said the Brahmaputra waters were rising because of incessant rain in Arunachal Pradesh. However, he said no major embankments have been breached. “Damage of an embankment has been reported from Bongaigaon though,” he said. There have been, however, no loss of human or animal life reported so far, the bulletin said. Altogether 512 villages under 34 revenue circles have been affected so far by the floodwaters. The rivers in the state were maintaining a rising trend in most of the affected districts and also flowing above the danger mark in several places, an official said. The highest number of 91,437 people have been affected in Lakhimpur, followed by 47,752 in Majuli and 31,839 in Dhemaji. A total of 6898 people have fled thier homes and have taken shelter in 62 relief camps set up by the district administrations of Bongaigaon, Chirang, Dhemaji and Majuli while centres have been kept ready in Baksa, Dibrugarh and Jorhat for the affected people. Meanwhile, 20 people and 40 animals were evacuated to safety by boats on Saturday and six medical teams have been deployed so far, the bulletin added. A total of 1,33,907 animals, including 82,455 big, 29528 small and 21924 poultry have been affected by the current wave of floods.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/over-2l-people-hit-by-floods-in-15-assam-dists/articleshow/85724059.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

The latest charge sheet was filed in the special NIA court in Jammu on August 27, an agency spokesman said, adding that they had earlier charge-sheeted six other terrorists in the same case. The terrorists who have now been charge-sheeted are Showkat Salam Parray, Asif Gul, Altaf Ahmed Shah, Romesh Kumar, Mudasir Ahmed Dar, Amin Allai alias Hilal Mir and Abdul Rashid. Relevant section of NDPS Act, IPC and UAPA have been slapped on them, the spokesman said in a statement. The statement said that the case was initially registered in Handwara police station on June 11, 2020 after one Abdul Momin Peer was arrested. During checking of vehicles at Kairo Bridge in J&K’s Handwara, Peer was intercepted by police naka party while he was coming from Baramullah to Handwara in his Hyundai Creta vehicle. During search of his vehicle, Rs 20,01,000 in cash and 2kg of heroin were recovered and seized. Further interrogation of Peer led to recovery of 15kg heroin and Rs 1.15 crore cash. NIA had re-registered the case on June 26, 2020 and taken over the investigation. The statement further said investigation has established that above seven charge-sheeted accused were part of a deep-rooted conspiracy for procuring and selling narcotics drugs to generate funds in J&K and other parts of India in close association with Pakistan-based operatives of banned terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. The funds so generated were pumped in for furtherance of terrorist activities in J&K through a network of over ground workers (OGWs). NIA had earlier filed chargesheet against six accused, including Peer, in this case on December 5, 2020, the statement said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-charge-sheeted-by-nia-in-handwara-narco-terrorism-case/articleshow/85724563.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Many Afghans protest over closure of banks as mass evacuation continues||ISLAMABAD: Despite warnings of more terrorist attacks, thousands of Afghan people gathered outside Kabul airport on Saturday waiting for their evacuation to be processed in the hope of fleeing the country ahead of the expiry of the August 31 deadline that the US had set with the Taliban. While stringent security measures have been in place since Thursday’s blasts and the Taliban are barring people without documents from going to the airport, many still managed to make their way. At the airfield, the US has been continuing its evacuations at a fast pace and has warned its citizens to avoid the airport due to "specific, credible" threats of more attacks. In the centre of Kabul, dozens of people protested over the closure of banks and money exchanges while many government employees at the site were demanding their salaries, which they said had not been paid for the past three to four months. Many others had formed long lines at cash machines. The Bank of Afghanistan issued a letter to commercial banks on Saturday to reopen and allow individual account holders to withdraw $200 or 20,000 Afghanis per week. The central bank said that this is a temporary solution so that people can address their daily needs. The economic crisis in the country, observers believe, could give Western countries leverage as they urge Taliban to form a moderate, inclusive government and allow people to leave after the planned withdrawal of US forces on Tuesday. Afghanistan is heavily dependent on international aid, which, according to reports, covered around 75% of the previous US-backed government’s budget. Knowing about the country’s dependency on foreign financial support, the Taliban have been trying to assure the West that they have become moderate and would rule the country in a manner that would be acceptable to all. Many Afghans, however, are sceptical of the Taliban’s claims. Faced with the shortage of staff at hospitals, the Taliban have called on women who had worked for the health ministry in the past to return to their jobs. The group’s spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said on Twitter that female staff should "attend their regular duties" both in Kabul and other provinces. Many doctors, nurses and other health officials, unwilling to stay in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, have already departed for other destinations. Mujahid also issued a directive asking the people of Kabul to hand over vehicles, weapons, ammunition and other government assets within a week so that there should be no need for offenders to be prosecuted if they are discovered later. The militant group has also announced that former officials must vacate government properties. Meanwhile, talks between Afghan leaders and the Taliban for a caretaker government continue in Kabul. Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for Reconciliation, met with Taliban political office members, including Maulawi Shahabuddin Delawar, Abdul Salam Hanafi, Khairullah Khairkhwa and Abdul Rahman Feda. "Both sides exchanged views on the current security and political developments, and an inclusive political settlement for the future of the country," Abdullah’s office posted on Twitter. Karzai and Abdullah also met Abdul Rahman Mansour, the Taliban acting governor for Kabul, and discussed the volatile security situation in the capital city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/many-afghans-protest-over-closure-of-banks-as-mass-evacuation-continues/articleshow/85724669.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||India accused of derailing efforts made to protect stocks of Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna||LONDON: India has been accused of derailing efforts to protect Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna stocks after joining Oman and Indonesia in formally objecting to a conservation measure agreed at June’s Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) meeting. The measure aims to reduce the total allowable catch in order to protect the long-term health of the stock. The Global Tuna Alliance, made up of retailers and tuna suppliers, said: "At the IOTC meeting in June, scientific advice called for a catch below 403,000 mt to rebuild the stock. The IOTC reached an agreement to limit catch in 2022 to 401,011 mt. Three member states have now objected to the plan, forcing the sustainability of Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna back into the danger zone, and compromising the efforts made by the majority of nations willing to follow scientific advice." Since objecting member states will not have to implement the measure and instead be bound by previous catch limits, the alliance calculates they could increase the total 2022 catch by 48,140 mt if their 2022 catches equal their 2019 catches — far exceeding the scientific advice. In its letter of objection, India said: "Fisheries is a major source of employment and food security for four million Indian marine fisher populations, who undertake fishing by multi-gear and multi-species non-selective fisheries, mostly confined in near-shore coastal areas. Most of these small boats do not target tuna but tuna is recorded as bycatch." The letter, written by IA Siddiqui in the department of fisheries, said it was difficult to implement catch reductions for a non-targeted species in such small-scale fisheries. "India is of the opinion that large-scale industrial fishing fleets of developed and distant water fishing nations that are engaged in targeted fishing of yellowfin tuna are mainly responsible for the present status of stock of yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean, and such fleets shall bear the major responsibility by reducing their catch. Putting the burden of responsibility on small-scale fishers and impacting the livelihood of millions of resource-poor fishers may not be a wise decision," it said. The Global Tuna Alliance said: "It is just for this reason that the scientific advice for this iconic species must be adhered to. Local populations in nations like India will be hardest hit when their source of income and food is depleted by ongoing overfishing. It is about taking measures now, to protect livelihoods in the long term."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/india-accused-of-derailing-efforts-made-to-protect-stocks-of-indian-ocean-yellowfin-tuna/articleshow/85724744.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Biden warns of more attacks as military begins final pullout||WASHINGTON: On alert for more terrorist attacks, the US military has begun its final withdrawal from Afghanistan in the closing stages of a frantic airlift of Americans, Afghans and others desperate to escape Taliban rule before the evacuation shuts down. President Joe Biden said Saturday that commanders told him an attack was ``highly likely'' over the next 24 to 36 hours. The remains of 13 American troops killed in a suicide bomb attack Thursday by the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate, known as ISIS-K, were on their way to the United States, the Pentagon said. Their voyage marked a painful moment in a nearly 20-year American war that cost more than 2,400 US military lives and is ending with the return to power of a Taliban movement that was ousted when US forces invaded in October 2001. A US drone attack in response to the IS bombing killed two militants, the Pentagon said. ``This strike was not the last,'' Biden said in a statement after meeting with his national security team and military commanders. The Pentagon released the names of the 13 killed 11 Marines, one Navy sailor and one Army soldier. Twelve of them were in the 20s; some were born in 2001, the year America's longest war began. The oldest was 31. They were the first US service members killed in Afghanistan since February 2020, the month the Trump administration struck an agreement with the Taliban in which the militant group halted attacks on Americans in exchange for a US agreement to remove all troops and contractors by May 2021. Biden announced in April that the 2,500 to 3,000 troops who remained would be out by September, ending what he has called America's forever war. With Biden's approval, the Pentagon this month sent thousands of additional troops to the Kabul airport to provide security and to facilitate the State Department's chaotic effort to evacuate thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Afghans who had helped the United States during the war. The evacuation was marred by confusion and chaos as the US government was caught by surprise when the Afghan army collapsed and the Taliban swept to power Aug. 15. About 5,400 Americans have been evacuated from the country so far, including 300 in the last day. The State Department believes about 350 more want out; it said there are roughly 280 others who have said they are Americans but who have not told the State Department of their plans to leave the country, or who have said they plan to remain. Untold numbers of vulnerable Afghans, fearful of a return to the brutality of pre-2001 Taliban rule, are likely to be left behind. Biden and the leaders of other Western countries have said they would try to work with the Taliban to allow Afghans who had worked with them to leave after the US-led evacuation ends. The Pentagon said that about 6,800 people, mostly Afghans, were flown out in the 24 hours that ended Saturday morning, bringing to 117,00 the total number of people of all nationalities evacuated since the hurried exit was begun Aug. 14. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the US military force at the Kabul airport, which peaked at about 5,800, had begun its final withdrawal. The number had dropped below 4,000 on Saturday, according to a US official who discussed details not yet publicly released on condition of anonymity. Kirby said that for security reasons the Pentagon will not provide a day-by-day description of the final stages of the military's withdrawal, which includes flying home troops as well as equipment. The Pentagon said an airstrike early Saturday local time in the eastern province of Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan, killed two ISIS-K ``planners and facilitators.'' Biden said in his statement that commanders had told him that ``an attack is highly likely in the next 24-36 hours'' and Kirby said the drone strike had not ended the threat at the Kabul airport. ``They have lost some capability to plan and to conduct missions, but make no mistake, nobody's writing this off and saying, `Well, we got them. We don't have to worry about ISIS-K anymore.' Not the case,'' Kirby told a news conference. Biden also faces the problem over the longer term of containing an array of potential extremist threats based in Afghanistan, which will be harder with fewer US intelligence assets and no military presence in the nation. Critics say Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan leaves the door open for al-Qaida, ISIS-K and other extremist groups to grow and potentially threaten the United States. It was al-Qaida's use of Afghanistan as a base, with the Taliban's acquiescence, that prompted the United States to invade the country in October 2001, beginning the longest war in US history. Saturday's drone mission came less than two days after the Kabul attack and a public pledge by Biden that he would make ISIS-K ``pay'' for their suicide bomb attack. Officials made no claim that the two individuals killed played a direct role in Thursday's Kabul airport attack. Kirby declined to release the names and nationalities of the two killed. He said one other person was wounded in the strike. The speed with which the US retaliated reflected its close monitoring of IS and years of experience in targeting extremists in remote parts of the world. But it also shows the limits of US power to eliminate the threat from extremists, who some believe will have more freedom of movement in Afghanistan now that the Taliban is in power. Kirby said the US had ``the ability and the means to carry over-the-horizon counterterrorism capabilities and we're going to defend ourselves,'' referring to the military's use of aircraft based in the Persian Gulf area and elsewhere to carry out strikes in Afghanistan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/biden-warns-of-more-attacks-as-military-begins-final-pullout/articleshow/85725266.cms||---

Yogesh Saini, founder of Delhi Street Art, says, “Through this artwork, we wanted to salute our sports stars for their years of hard work, training and dedication. We wanted to create a larger-than-life portrait of the Olympics team so that people can see their names and faces from a distance while stuck in traffic. While for some Olympians, we have used their recent pictures, for others, we have used old photos. For instance, for Neeraj Chopra, we have used an old picture when he used to have long hair. We wanted to create portraits that have a striking resemblance with these Olympians.” A mural of Manpreet Singh, captain of the Indian men’s hockey teamArtists say that since these pillars are in the middle of a busy road, limited space was available. Moreover, these pillars were in bad shape so the artists had to first work on them. An artist from the group says, “It was quite a challenge, but it was done within a week and some of the members of the group even worked at night to complete the project.” The pillars also feature giant portraits of Olympic medallists (L-R) Saikhom Mirabai Chanu, Lovlina Borgohain and PV SindhuOlympic-themed street art at Ashok ViharThis is not the first street art of the city to salute the Olympics team. Before the Olympics started, artists of the group painted a range of portraits, including Mary Kom in Ashok Vihar to wish them luck. Yogesh adds, “We are discussing with authorities and we will be creating more such Olympic-themed street art at various locations across the capital.

---||India||Enforcement Directorate summons Abhishek, wife in laundering case||NEW DELHI/ KOLKATA: Enforcement Directorate has summoned Trinamool Congress’ second-in-command and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, and his wife Rujira to join investigations in the politically sensitive Rs 1,300 crore money laundering scam. Abhishek, a Lok Sabha MP and TMC’s national general secretary, has been asked by ED to appear for questioning on September 6 while his wife has been summoned on September 1. Some other close associates of Abhishek have also been summoned, though ED sources were tight-lipped about their identities. Vinay Mishra, a close associate of Abhishek in the youth wing of TMC, who was allegedly instrumental in arranging ‘proceeds of crime’ from illegal coal-mining in the state, has fled to Vanuatu and renounced his Indian citizenship to escape the agencies investigating the scam. ED summons evoked a strong response from the Bengal CM who described it as an attempt by BJP to “bulldoze and intimidate” them. “BJP and the Union government cannot fight us politically and are now using central agencies against our leaders,” she said and accused several BJP functionaries of having connections with the coal mafia. Rujira is facing serious money laundering charges with the agency having told a special PMLA court here earlier that ‘proceeds of crime’ from illegal coal mining to the tune of Rs 168 crore were allegedly sent out of the country through hawala channels to accounts controlled by her in Thailand and London. In April first week, ED had arrested Bankura (West Bengal) police station in-charge, inspector Ashok Kumar Mishra. In its remand application before a special court here, the agency had claimed that the officer was involved in collecting unaccounted cash from associates of a local coal mafia, Anup Majhi. Proceeds of crime to the tune of Rs 168 crore were sent out of the country to London and Thailand on instructions the officer had allegedly received from Vikas Mishra, brother of Vinay Mishra. “The transactions (of Thailand and London) were related to Rujira Banerjee,” ED had told the special court while seeking remand of Ashok Mishra. CBI, which had registered a case for illegal coal mining against some close associates of Abhishek in November last year, has already questioned Rujira in this case. Coal mafia Majhi is the prime suspect in the Rs 1,300 crore money laundering scam but the agency has been restrained by the Supreme Court from taking any “coercive” action against him. Addressing Trinamool Chhatra Parishad workers in Kolkata, Mamata called the Central government “demonic” and “inhuman”. Abhishek said he and TMC would meet the challenge head-on. “Browbeating us will not help. We will go to every state where BJP has stifled democracy. The battle has started in Tripura and Assam. Our leader, Mamata Banerjee, has not yet gone to Tripura. There will be an earthquake when she sets foot there,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-summons-abhishek-wife-in-laundering-case/articleshow/85725973.cms||---
---||India||Prime Minister Modi: India helps its people wherever they’re in trouble||AMRITSAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while dedicating the renovated Jallianwala Bagh memorial via video conference on Saturday evening, referred to the current crisis in Afghanistan and said that it was to help "our people" who fall victim to such circumstances that the government had enacted new laws. Modi said the Afghanistan crisis and the situation unfolding globally are reminders of the need for the country to be self-reliant and confident. "Today, anywhere in the world, if any Indian is in trouble, then India stands up to help with all its might. Be it the challenges of the corona(virus) period or the crisis of Afghanistan, the world has experienced it continuously. Hundreds of comrades from Afghanistan are being brought to India under Operation Devi Shakti. There are many challenges and the situation is difficult," he said. In what seemed like a strong defence of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019, Modi referred to his government’s effort to rescue Hindus and Sikhs along with Afghan allies after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. Without referring to the CAA directly, he said that the government, "inspired by the teachings of the Sikh gurus to help others, has promulgated new laws". However, it was clear that the "new laws" was a reference to the change in the citizenship law, which opens a pathway for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis, and Christian refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The PM said no country should forget its history, and whatever happened during and after Partition can be seen in every corner of the country, especially in Punjab. He pressed a button for the virtual inauguration of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial to the freedom struggle’s Baisakhi massacre of April 1919. A two-minute silence was observed to pay homage to the martyrs and then a bugle sounded the "Last Post". On April 13, 1919, Brigadier-General Reginald Edward Harry Dyer of the British Indian Army had ordered troops to open fire on a peaceful festival crowd gathered to oppose the Rowlatt Act, which allowed certain political cases to be tried without juries and permitted internment of suspects without trial. Officially, 379 people died and more than 1,000 were injured, though unofficial counts are way higher. Dyer is also called the "Butcher of Amritsar". Describing the renovated memorial as a symbol of inspiration to the youth, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said in his virtual address: "It is a reminder to the future generations of the people’s right to peaceful democratic protest." On August 14, Amarinder had dedicated the Jallianwala Bagh Centenary Memorial Park to all those who had died unknown in the massacre of 1919. On Saturday, he said: "The memorial, along with the centenary park inaugurated recently by the state government, will remind our leaders of the inalienable right of Indians to peaceful democratic protests, as the British also learned from the Jallianwala Bagh incident." Rajya Sabha member Shwet Malik, who is also on the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, participated in the inaugural online ceremony. He said: "The renovation and redevelopment work took more than a year, and for more than six months the memorial couldn’t be opened due to Covid-19 restrictions." The Jallianwala Bagh is one of the landmarks of Amritsar, to which the culture ministry has added light-and-sound shows to draw more people. Bring back Shaheed Udham Singh’s pistol: CM to ModiPunjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring back the pistol and personal diary of Shaheed Udham Singh from the United Kingdom. In London on March 13, 1940, Udham Singh had shot and killed Michael O'Dwyer, Punjab’s lieutenant governor at the time of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, to avenge the unprovoked killing of innocents. Amarinder said he had written to foreign minister S Jaishankar about the matter. During the trial, Udham Singh referred to himself as Ram Mohammed Singh Azad. He was hanged for shooting O’Dwyer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prime-minister-modi-india-helps-its-people-wherever-theyre-in-trouble/articleshow/85726659.cms||---

A manhunt is on for the remaining accused; one of those arrested is believed to be a juvenile. “He claims he is 17 years old. We are not sure... we are verifying it,” DGP Praveen Sood said at a press conference on Saturday. Sood had been tasked by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai to oversee the probe. “After the Nirbhaya incident (2012), there is a direction from the court to try even 16-year-olds involved in heinous crimes in regular courts like adults.” The arrests come four days after the MBA student was assaulted and her classmate thrashed in Lalithadripura. The DGP said the accused are daily-wage workers from Tiruppur and Erode districts of Tamil Nadu and are engaged in carpentry and wiring works; two of them are drivers. Police said the six accused were in Mysuru for work and followed the duo to the secluded stretch. DGP: Accused were partying when crime was committedThe drivers used to visit Mysuru frequently to transport vegetables and other commodities to the APMC yard, and often brought along friends. They camped in open spaces. “This time too, they had come to Mysuru and were partying together when the crime was committed,” Sood said, refusing to disclose their names since investigation is on. “It was not a pre-planned attack. On August 24, the accused, who were allegedly drunk, saw the couple go into the secluded area and followed them. They surrounded the couple and demanded Rs 3 lakh from them. When they refused to pay, the men beat the young woman’s friend. The crime took place between 7pm and 8pm,” Sood told mediapersons in Mysuru. The DGP said the survivor is in a state of shock and could not give a statement; her classmate gave some details though he was unconscious for some time during the crime. “The special teams managed to arrest the five accused, mostly relying on technical and scientific evidence, which included two bus tickets and liquor bottles,” he said. Home minister Araga Jnanendra has announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for the investigating team. The DGP said some of the accused have been previously booked in cases related to theft, among others, and it is not clear if they targeted other couples as well. “A lot of investigation needs to be done in the case. Police will file a chargesheet based on scientific and forensic evidence and will request the high court to expedite trial of the case and convict them at the earliest, on the lines of the Manipal and Nagarabhavi gang-rape cases.” The DGP added it is not clear yet if the accused filmed the crime and tried to extort money from the duo. Govt to VCs: Step up vigil on campusesIn the wake of the alleged gang rape of a student, the government on Saturday ordered vice-chancellors of all universities in the state to ensure safety on campuses by increasing measures. “Security personal must patrol campuses for proper monitoring. All VCs have been directed to take necessary actions to maintain law and order,” said higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan. “It is the responsibility of VCs to ensure safety within campuses. They should make use of available technology to step up surveillance,” the minister added.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka’s active caseload under 20,000 after 150 days||BENGALURU: The number of people under treatment for Covid-19 in Karnataka has dipped below 20,000 for the first time in about 150 days as fresh infections remain under 2,000. The last time active cases were lower than 20,000 was on March 26 (19,553). New Covid-19 cases began to increase in the last week of March and subsequently, active cases also spiked, breaching multiple unwanted milestones in April. By the end of that month, active cases stood at 3.8 lakh in the state and soon rose to 4 lakh. The figure crossed the 5-lakh mark and touched 6 lakh on May 16, when the second wave was at its peak. Active cases started to decrease in the last two weeks of May as more patients recovered and got discharged. The state ended May with a little more than 3 lakh active cases, which dropped to 76,505 as of June 30 and to only 23,796 on July 30. After being the state with the highest active Covid-19 cases for the most part of the second wave, Karnataka’s active infections remained stagnant in August and ended below 20,000 on August 24 (19,784). As of Friday night (August 27), the figure stood at 18,970. The improvements in July put Karnataka in the fourth position so far as active cases go. Though there has been a decline in its absolute numbers, it has again slipped to the third place because discharges have more consistently outnumbered fresh cases in some other states. Kerala tops the chart, followed by Maharashtra, while Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh occupy the fourth and fifth positions, respectively. These five states together have about 55 per cent — 1.4 crore of 3.2 crore — of the total infections. They accounted for 84 per cent of the 3.5 lakh active cases as of August 27. In Karnataka, Bengaluru Urban continued to be the worst-affected district, accounting for about 39 per cent (7,341) of the active cases. Dakshina Kannada with 14 per cent (2,675) and Udupi with around 9 per cent (1,687) occupied the second and third spots, respectively. Hassan (6 per cent or 1,130) and Mysuru (5 per cent or 994) also reported a high number of active cases. These five districts have 73 per cent (13,827) of the total active cases in the state. As of August 27, Karnataka’s total recoveries stood at 28.8 lakh out of the 29.4 lakh total infections, while 37,248 people have succumbed to Covid-19 so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/active-cases-lt-20k-in-ktaka-after-150-days/articleshow/85727109.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||India||Citizens can’t depend on governments alone for truth: Chandrachud||NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Judge D Y Chandrachud on Saturday said the courts can play the role of “Truth Commissions” at a time when falsehood and fake news circulation has increased manifold with proliferation of social media, and when citizens cannot depend solely on the government for ‘truth’ even in a democracy. Delivering the Justice M C Chagla Memorial Lecture, Justice Chandrachud said given the importance of truth in nation-building, many countries after independence from totalitarian regimes opt to establish "Truth Commissions", which "function to document, record and acknowledge the ‘truth’ of earlier regimes and violations for future generations, so as to not only provide catharsis to the survivors but also prevent any possibility of denial in the future”. “In a different context, this role can also be played by courts which have the ability to document information from all the parties involved, after due process has been followed. In the suo motu cognizance of the Covid-19 pandemic taken by our Supreme Court, we have acknowledged this very role in the context of the pandemic,” he said. One of the remedies is to strengthen public institutions, he said, adding that as citizens, “we must strive to ensure that we have a press that is free from influence of any kind, political or economic, which will provide us information in an unbiased manner... We also need to protect the integrity of our elections, and look upon voting not only as a right but also as a duty. To do this, we need to ensure that all citizens are given a basic education and truly understand the value of their vote”. Likening the relationship of truth with democracy as that of a sword and a shield, the SC judge said, “The scope for extensive deliberation, particularly in the age of social media, exposes multiple ‘truths’ so much so that it seems like we live in an ‘age of lies’, and that shakes the very foundation of a democracy.” “Democracy needs the power of truth to survive. But, ‘truth’ has its shades depending upon the societal values,” he said and gave the example of attitude of societies and democracies towards legalising gay sex. “While India is currently transitioning towards normalising same-sex relationships, more than 10 countries around the world still prescribe capital punishment for homosexuality. In considering another example, we can note that 40 years after India legalised abortion in 1971, most of the Latin American countries are yet to legalise it. Hence, while for one part of the world, the ‘truth’ would be that a fetus is regarded to possess a right to life, yet for another, this would be a ‘false’ assertion,” the judge said, who was part of the five-judge bench that legalized private consensual sexual relationship between adults belonging to LGBTQ communities. Justice Chandrachud said the state alone cannot be the determinant of truth even in democracies. He said it cannot be said that “the state cannot indulge in falsehood for political reasons, even in democracies”. “The role of the US in the Vietnam War did not see the daylight until the Pentagon papers were published. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we see that there is an increasing trend of countries across the world who are trying to manipulate data on the infection rate and deaths. Hence, once cannot only rely on the state to determine the ‘truth’,” he said. He said truth faces a tough time with proliferation of social media which exacerbates circulation of fake news. “It is undeniable that the phenomenon of ‘fake news’ is on the rise. A pertinent example of this is that the WHO recently termed the current Covid-19 pandemic as also being an ‘infodemic’, due to the overabundance of misinformation online. However, scholars have also noted that ‘fake news’ or false information is not a new phenomenon, having been in existence for as long as print media has existed. But the rapid advancement in technology and the spread of internet access has definitely exacerbated this problem.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citizens-cant-depend-on-governments-alone-for-truth-chandrachud/articleshow/85726995.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

She also accused the Narendra Modi government of trying to “bulldoze the federal structure” of the country and snatching away the rights of the states. A combative TMC boss also proposed a meeting of all CMs to fight the Centre’s “authoritarianism”. “BJP and the Union government can’t fight us politically. The party was defeated in the assembly polls, and now they are using central agencies against our leaders like Abhishek Banerjee and others. But let me tell them they can’t bulldoze or intimidate us with such threats. We will continue our fight against them,” she said. “If you show us (threaten us with) ED, we will also send proof against BJP leaders to the agency,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-in-cahoots-with-coal-mafia-mamata/articleshow/85727378.cms||---

The meeting to discuss strategy to be adopted for the yet-to-be-announced elections to Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local bodies in Haryana was attended by the CM, state BJP president OP Dhankhar, ministers Kanwar Pal Gujjar, Mool Chand Sharma, Kamlesh Dhanda, Sandeep Singh and several other MPs and MLAs. Thousands of farmers, carrying black and BKU flags, gathered at Bastara toll plaza from Saturday morning after a call was given to protest and show black flags to the state BJP leaders. At noon, when the protesters tried to head towards Karnal from the toll plaza, police stopped them. However, the farmers were adamant on moving towards Karnal and tried to block the National Highway 44, thereafter police used lathi charge to disperse them. Farm groups estimated around 10 farmers had been injured while Haryana police put the number at four. Haryana ADGP (law and order) Navdeep Singh Virk said 10 police officers had been injured. Police have detained several protesters, including BKU (Charuni) district president Jagdeep Singh Aulakh. CM Khattar defended police action and said it is not legitimate to block highways. He blamed the farmers for blocking the highway and pelting stones on police. Meanwhile, a viral video, whose authenticity could not be verified, showed Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha instructing officers to hit protesters on their heads if they tried to breach the barricades.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-lathicharge-protesting-farmers-on-way-to-bjp-meet/articleshow/85727425.cms||---
---||India||India to flag Afghan concerns with Russia, China in September||NEW DELHI: As it treads cautiously on Afghanistan, India will have back-to-back opportunities next month to engage on the evolving situation with Russia and China, two leading players in the war-ravaged country after the departure of the US. While the Brics summit will take place virtually on September 9, Tajikistan will host the SCO summit a week later on September 17. The Afghanistan security situation is likely to dominate the agenda for the SCO meet and also figure prominently in the Brics virtual meeting where the leaders are expected to express concern over the deteriorating security environment. India sees counter-terrorism as the key focus area for SCO and has used the forum to seek an end to terror-financing. Government sources said India will use both meetings to underscore its concerns about the use of Afghan territory as a launch pad for terrorist acts in the region. India believes terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed are active in Afghanistan with encouragement from Pakistan. SCO cooperation is seen as crucial for suppressing the spread of terrorist, separatist and extremism ideologies and also for reinforcing the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs of other countries. India sees engagement with Russia as important for dealing with security challenges emanating from Afghanistan, expecting its views to be given a receptive hearing. The two countries recently agreed to establish a mechanism for addressing the terror and drug threat from Afghanistan. While Russian special envoy for Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov has been quoted as saying India doesn’t enjoy any influence with the Taliban, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said it’s important to bring on board India and Iran in efforts to restore peace in Afghanistan. While both Russia and China seem keen to work with the Taliban in Afghanistan, the two have also expressed concerns similar to India’s on the issue of terrorism. In a phone conversation last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were reported to have expressed their readiness to step up efforts to combat threats of terrorism and drug trafficking coming from the Afghan territory. They also spoke of the “importance of establishing peace” in Afghanistan and “preventing the spread of instability to adjacent regions”. However, China’s concerns are related more to the activities of East Turkistan Islamic Movement that is active in Xinjiang.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-flag-afghan-concerns-with-russia-china-in-september/articleshow/85727512.cms||---
---||India||India’s first food park for tribals set to start in Bastar||JAGDALPUR: Amid concerns over unemployment in the ongoing pandemic, a first of its kind food park for tribals in Jagdalpur block of Bastar district in Chhatisgarh is all set to begin operations in the coming months. It is being cited as a move that will steer sustainable livelihood opportunities and check migration. Of the total population in Bastar, more than 40% belong to Gond, Maria, Muria, Dhruva, Bhatra and Halba Tribes. The idea of a processing and value addition facility for forest produce was first conceived by the Bastar district administration in the late 1990s and land was allotted for the same in 1999. However, the project never took off. Around two years ago Tribal Co-operative Marketing Development Federation (TRIFED) stepped in to revive the vision and the Food Park project was approved for the same 26 acres of land that was allotted almost 22 years ago. The project initiated by TRIFED is the first of eight that will be set up across states. The construction of the Food Park in Raigad in Maharashtra is also in progress. The other six states include Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajashtan, and Andhra Pradesh. Bastar district, which for decades has existed under the shadows of Naxalite unrest, will be the launchpad for putting to test a convergence model. Once the Food Park turns functional, it will enable thousands of forest produce gatherers to have direct access to tertiary level processing facilities for converting their produce, as wide-ranging as the traditionally dominant Imli (tamarind) to the new age Bastar coffee and VNR Ameena - a new hybrid papaya variety, into products that can get them the due market price.  The project is being implemented by TRIFED in convergence with the ministry of food processing Industries under Backward and Forward Linkage of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna and financial assistance from National Scheduled Tribes Finance Development Corporation and district administration, Bastar. TRIFED aims to set up 100 such Food Parks across the country. Union minister Arjun Munda said that the convergence model that puts tribals at the center of all planning will help them get the correct market price for their products. During a review of the project in Jagdalpur, Munda met the Self Help Group members, largely women steering the collection and processing of the forest produce in the district's value addition centers called the Van Dhan Vikas Kendras. Braving the rain, tribals from villages in and around Jagdalpur gathered at the Food Park complex setting up stalls of products as diverse as the mulsilk, metal craft to millets, black and red rice. Finely packed cashew and Imli bricks and candy displayed on counters reflected the journey of women steering SHGs from a time when they just collected the product and sold it to middlemen to a time when they are a trained workforce involved in the processing and marketing their produce at the Minimum Support Price. Basanti Kashyap from Dhura village told TOI that they were 10 women steering a self-help group that collects imli and is now trained to process it as candy and sauces. She joined the SHG about a month back as getting daily wage work was becoming difficult and she was struggling to make both ends meet. She now hopes to make a living with dignity. The story of the Food Park project also brings into focus the two-decade-long journey and struggle of tribals to overcome barter, exploitative middlemen, and the lack of resources and training to value add and market their produce. TRIFED Managing Director Pravir Krishna shared that as district collector of Bastar in the late 1990s, when it was a much larger district located in Madhya Pradesh, he saw that tribals were dependent on middlemen who bartered their forest produce like high-quality imli (tamarind) for cheap items of daily use that they needed.  "Immediate steps were taken to ban barter and funds were assigned to enable the forest gathered to experiment with value addition to imli and create procurement channels for the produce. The small experiment was referred to by villagers as "imli andolan," Krishna said. He added that land for a food processing and value addition facility was alloted in the Jagdalpur in 1999. However, the project never took off due to the change in administration boundaries after the formation of the new state of Chhatisgarh. Bastar became part of the new state. It was around two years back, that TRIFED stepped in to revive the vision and the Food Park project was approved for the same piece of land that was allotted 22 years ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-first-food-park-for-tribals-set-to-start-in-bastar/articleshow/85727563.cms||Ambika Pandit

Central Electricity Authority documents show five plants with ‘zero’ coal stock and running on daily supplies. Six plants have a day’s buffer stock, while 15 plants have inventories for three days, 13 plants for four days, four plants for five days, three stations for six days and two units have stocks to last a week. Industry executives blame the low fuel stocks on poor supply and lack of advance planning in anticipation of rising power demand. But Coal India Ltd, which accounts for 80% of domestic production, blamed the reduced inventories on generators failing to heed its advice given since October 2020 to stock up for summer and monsoon when electricity demand spikes. A CIL executive told TOI the company supplied 196.6 MT (million tonne) of coal to the power sector in the April-August period, or 6.5% more than 184 MT in the same period of pre-pandemic 2019. “Coal stock at power plants was 24 MT at the end of July, almost at par with stocks in the previous five years. It could have been higher if generators had not regulated offtake,” the executive said. The arguments indicate that no one prepared for the sharp rebound in power demand or put too much emphasis on renewables. Power demand rose at 8% and 12% in the third and fourth quarters of 2020-21 and continues, jumping 18% in July. As a result the average plant load factor of thermal plants too has risen above 60% from about 52% as hydel production came down. Power Secretary Alok Kumar set up a core management committee with representatives of the power ministry, CEA and CIL for daily monitoring of the situation. A ministry statement said power plants have been asked to send requests for priority loading or supply issues at a centralised email id so that they can be addressed promptly.

Though five of 15 states/Union Territories shortlisted for the Mission have achieved 100% of their target, three others — West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and J&K — have so far not come on board to improve the quality of green cover in the country. Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Karnataka and Sikkim have reached 100% of their respective five-year targets while others reported shortfall in varying degrees, shows the data shared by the environment ministry in response to information sought by Kerala-based RTI activist K Govindan Nampoothiry. The ministry’s data show that these 15 states/UTs together have brought qualitative change in forest/tree cover over an area of 1,17,507 hectares against their collective target of 1,67,151 hectares during the five-year period. The ministry has so far released over Rs 455 crore to states/UTs for the purpose. The Centre had started disbursing money to 15 states/UT for undertaking different afforestation activities under GIM in 2015-16. GIM was launched as one of the eight missions under the NAPCC for protecting, restoring and enhancing the country’s diminishing forest cover and responding to climate change by a combination of adaptation and mitigation measures. The Mission envisages a holistic view of greening and focuses on multiple ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and storage (in forests and other ecosystems), hydrological services and biodiversity along with provisioning services like fuel, fodder, and timber and non-timber forest produce. “This Mission has adopted an integrated cross-sectoral approach as it will be implemented on both public as well as private lands with a key role of the local communities in planning, decision-making, implementation and monitoring,” said the ministry in its note on GIM. Overall, the Mission has a goal to increase forest/tree cover to the extent of five million hectares and improve quality of forest/tree cover on another five million hectares of forest/non-forest lands in due course of time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/green-india-mission-falls-30-short-of-target-in-five-years/articleshow/85727609.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The court said primary evaluation of the material on record does not suggest the accused touched the minor’s cheeks with a sexual intent. “In consideration of these facts, in my view, a case is made out for releasing the applicant on bail,” the court said. The high court, though, clarified that observations made “be construed as expression of opinion for the purpose of bail only and the same shall not in any way influence the trial in other proceedings”. The accused was arrested in July 2020 after the eight-year-old girl’s mother lodged a complaint that the accused had touched her inappropriately when she went to his shop. Bail pleas of the accused were earlier rejected by the trial court. Advocate Ram Prasad Gupta appeared for the accused and submitted that the accused was falsely implicated by the complainant over a business rivalry. The defence said the accused was gainfully employed, had roots in society and had his family to look after. “Thus, there arises no question of the applicant’s absconding and not available for trial,” Gupta submitted. It was also submitted that the offence is not punishable with death or life imprisonment. It said that maximum punishment provided for the alleged offence is seven years’ jail. The FIR was lodged on July 29, 2020. It was alleged that at 1.30pm, the complainant, who lived in the neighbourhood, saw the accused signalling the girl to come to his shop. The girl went inside. It was alleged that after some time the accused came outside, looked around, went back in and pulled the shutter down. It was further alleged that when with the help of another person, the shutter was opened, the accused was found behaving inappropriately with the child. The complainant took the child and parents to the police station and complained. After completion of the investigation, police filed a chargesheet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/touching-kids-cheeks-not-sexual-assault-high-court/articleshow/85727686.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The observation by a bench comprising justices Indira Banerjee and V Ramasubramanian came while setting aside an externment order against a journalist and social worker issued by the district authorities in Amravati, Maharashtra. “A person cannot be denied his fundamental right to reside anywhere or to move freely throughout the country, on flimsy grounds,” the bench said. Externment orders prevent the movement of a person in certain areas. The Supreme Court said the drastic action of externment should only be taken in exceptional cases to maintain law and order. DCP, zone1, Amravati city, had passed the externment order under Maharashtra Police Act, 1951, directing journalist Rahmat Khan not to enter or return to Amravati city or Amravati rural district for one year from the date on which he leaves or is taken out. Khan had been filing applications under RTI, seeking information from authorities on alleged illegalities in the disbursement of funds to various madrassas.

But when compared to last August, bookings are significantly higher this year. While fares to destinations like Delhi, Goa, Cochin for October and November travel are currently cheap, those to Srinagar, Leh, Varanasi and Patna have begun their annual winter climb. “Pre-pandemic around this time, early birds would be booking holidays for next year summer. Diwali holiday bookings would be full, air fares would be high,’’ said Veena Patil of Veena World. “This year, we’ve been getting bookings for travel next week, next month but not beyond,’’ she said. Airfares reflect this trend, though with exceptions. For travel in November, during Diwali holidays, fares on flights from Mumbai to leisure destinations like Dehradun, Srinagar and Leh and then to high-demand ‘visiting family/friends’ destinations like Varanasi and Patna have begun a northward climb. But those to Delhi, Cochin and even Goa are cheap, said a low cost carrier official, “Airfares are typically capped for flights up to 30 days out. For cheaper fares, passengers have to book over a month before travel. For instance: Currently, Mumbai-Delhi cheapest return fare is Rs 12,000 for September, but only Rs 5,000 for October travel. In case of Diwali bookings, cheaper options may be available only with 45-60 days advance booking. The anxiety over Covid third wave has hit the pace of Diwali forward bookings.” Prahlad Krishnamurthi, chief business officer, Cleartrip, said forward booking trend was better than 2020, but significantly below 2019. “Bookings for travel in October-December this year are about 9% of overall bookings in August. This is higher than last year but lower than pre-Covid levels,” he said. In the last few weeks, consumers have been open to booking more than a month in advance and hence there’s a spike in October bookings, which is significantly higher than what was witnessed last year this time. Sabina Chopra, co-founder, yatra.com, said bookings for October-November-December increased by over 40% for leisure destinations. “In comparison to 2020, there has been an increase in queries by 25-30% during this time of the year for winter travel as well. As for 2019, the year had a much more early stimulus for travel during October-November-December,’’ Chopra said. MakeMyTrip data indicates a five-time increase in travel bookings this August, compared to last year’s, said COO Vipul Prakash. “Compared to bookings in the same period last year, hotel bookings for stays more than two days increased by 20%,’’ he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/advance-booking-for-diwali-air-travel-higher-this-august/articleshow/85727735.cms||Manju V

More dire is the prognosis in the party that if things are not reined in time, even the settled issue of leadership may come under question which, if stoked closer to polls, can sow confusion in the rank and file. At the heart of the problem seems to be the prevailing insecurity among some legislators that because of their political alignment against Amarinder Singh, they can be punished in the elections. The fear among the select band, a large number of whom recently held a meeting against CM Singh, is that they may not be renominated on the basis of a survey done by a known poll consultant, or they may face sabotage from within. Some are also worried about administrative vendetta against them. Congress believes that the CM should personally take the initiative to calm the nerves of the worried members so that they give up their “rebellion”. Singh’s camp though has been pointing out that interventions of the central leadership have not helped. There is a view in the party that the MLAs may continue to speak against the CM which would be a mask for their “personal insecurities”. “The onus of resolving these local differences lies with Amarinder Singh. He has to act, and it is in his own interest as well as of the party,” an AICC leader said. Party sources said to mend fences, AICC ceneral secretary Harish Rawat has been asked to visit Punjab early next week. He is likely to meet CM Singh as well as PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, to further narrow the gap between them as well as among the legislators. There is exasperation in the top party ranks that despite best attempts to placate factions, first by appointing Sidhu as PCC chief and then by declaring Amarinder Singh as the party face for polls, things have not settled as expected. The controversies are also said to be holding up the announcement of poll-related committees, as well as the cabinet rejig.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/eye-on-polls-congress-says-onus-on-captain-to-stamp-out-dissent/articleshow/85727807.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||India||Now, new vehicle series for easy state transfers||NEW DELHI: Come September 15, the government will allow registration of personal vehicles under a new “BH” series which will ensure seamless transfer across states and do away with the need for re-registration when the owner shifts from one state to another. To begin with, such registration will be allowed for people in transferable jobs such as in defence, central and state governments, PSUs and also in private sector companies which have offices in four or more states and UTs. The new regime of “Bharat” (BH) series of vehicles, notified by the road transport ministry, will be a voluntary scheme for the specific categories of vehicle owners. In the long run, the government aims to bring all vehicles under this series for uniformity and hassle-free transfer. The registration number of such vehicles will mention the year of registration, BH mark, numerical numbers and alphabets. Currently, a person is allowed to keep a vehicle for a maximum of 12 months in any state other than the state where it is registered. The owner has to get such vehicles re-registered within this deadline. TOI had on April 28 first reported this move to have one national registration series for such personal vehicles. The vehicle owners who opt for this scheme will have to pay road tax for two years or in multiples of two. “After completion of the 14th year, the motor vehicle tax or road tax shall be levied annually and it will be half of the amount which was charged earlier for that vehicle,” a ministry official said. The entire process will be made online to ensure there is no need to go to the RTOs. The ministry has fixed the road tax at 8% for vehicles costing up to Rs 10 lakh, 10% for those costing between Rs 10-20 lakh and 12% for vehicles costing over Rs 20 lakh. There will be 2% extra charge for diesel vehicles and electric vehicles shall be charged 2% less tax. As of now, while registering private vehicles, the owners pay 15 years’ road tax upfront. If they transfer their vehicles to any other state and go for re-registration, they need to pay the road tax for the remaining years such as 10 or 12 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-new-vehicle-series-for-easy-state-transfers/articleshow/85727858.cms||Dipak K Dash

I have asked all ministers, including the home minister, not to issue any statement on the Mysuru incident,” state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel said. He admitted the ‘insensitive’ statements had damaged the party’s image to an extent. Party sources said home minister Araga Jnanendra was scheduled to hold a press conference following the arrest of six accused, but DGP Praveen Sood was asked to do so instead. CM Basavaraj Bommai also asked his ministers to be careful while making statements on sensitive issues like the gang-rape incident. He told STOI he will raise the issue with this ministers at the next cabinet meeting. When some RSS functionaries, including its spokesperson, were asked about the ministers’ statements, they refused to comment saying, “The matter is in legal purview now.” But some women activists slammed the ministers, saying such statements reflect the sexism deep-rooted in society. “It is a typical mentality of a patriarchal society which always seeks to blame women and restrict their movements instead of caging perpetrators of such heinous crimes and instilling fear. This needs to be condemned strongly...,’’ said Sudeshna Mukherjee, associate professor at the Centre for Women’s Studies, Bangalore University. Tourism minister Anand Singh did a U-turn on Saturday and said: “Gang rape is a horrendous act, and those who indulge in it should be harshly punished. Our government is committed to curbing such acts. Women must be given rifle licences to safeguard themselves from such heinous incidents and for self-defence.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bjp-issues-gag-order-to-rein-in-mins/articleshow/85723334.cms||Anil Gejji

The findings are based on preliminary data and need to be confirmed with large-sized cohort studies, it said. The study assumes significance because if ICMR can validate the initial findings through a large-scale study, it can be instrumental in expediting the coverage. “This study offers evidence in support of public health-oriented and immunologically sustained vaccine strategies. If our preliminary findings are confirmed in large population studies, a single dose of BBV152 vaccine may be recommended to previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals so that the naïve individuals could attain the larger benefit of a limited vaccine supply,” says the short paper with the findings of the study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research. However, the authors underlined that both vaccine doses would be ideal even for previously infected individuals in the long run due to the occurrence of variants of concern. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is currently administered in a two-dose regimen with a gap of four to six weeks. The ICMR study was undertaken to examine SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody responses after day zero (baseline, before vaccination), Day 28 (month 1) and Day 56 post-first dose (month 2) of Covaxin in a group of healthcare professionals as well as front-line workers. The antibody response of individuals with confirmed pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection was compared with those individuals without prior evidence of infection.

The CM announced that the Covid review meeting which he had chaired earlier in the day had decided that night curfew would be enforced in the state from Monday (10pm to 6am) to prevent the spread of the virus. The Union home ministry on Thursday had suggested to the state during a review meeting that areas with high case positivity be placed under night curfew. There would be triple lockdown in local bodies where weekly infection population ratio (WIPR) is above 7% and senior IPS officers will be taking charge in each district from Monday to coordinate preventive measures, Vijayan said. The review meeting also decided that a meeting of health experts will be convened to discuss the state’s Covid situation on September 1. RT-PCR tests on all with Covid symptomsExperts from all government medical college hospitals and virology experts will be invited for this discussion. A meeting of all local body heads and secretaries will also be convened on the issue on September 3. Local bodies have also been asked to ensure that there is adequate stock of vaccines and people with comorbidities and senior citizens who test positive will be hospitalised, the CM revealed. The chief minister said RT-PCR tests would be conducted on all people with Covid symptoms. In districts where 80% vaccination has been achieved, 1,000 samples each will be collected for sentinel surveillance. In districts where the vaccination is less than 80%, 1,500 samples will be collected for sentinel surveillance. However, people who are fully vaccinated and those who have got the viral infection in the past one month would not be part of this study. All laboratories conducting antigen and RTPCR tests will be subjected to scrutiny to find out if any substandard kits are being used. The licences of labs using faulty kits will be cancelled, he warned. “The state could achieve a very low death rate due to the treatment facilities being offered here. No one in the state had to struggle to get admission in hospitals. But still there has been criticism from certain quarters,” the CM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/night-curfew-in-kerala-from-monday-amid-rise-in-cases/articleshow/85728522.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Taliban takeover cuts short rugby dreams for trouble-torn nation||KOLKATA: Rugby had taken Zaffar Khan back to his roots in Afghanistan. Born in India and raised in Kolkata, the 36-year-old rugby player of Afghan origin had helped Afghanistan set up its national rugby team. He had also been trying to help the Afghan rugby board set up a national team for girls since 2019. The pandemic and then the Taliban takeover have pulled the curtain down on Khan’s rugby mission in the war-torn country. “In Kabul, which is a more liberal and cosmopolitan city, parents had started sending their daughters to train for rugby. Women coaches were being appointed. If the situation had not changed this way, the dream of an Afghan national girls’ rugby team could have been achieved in a year or two. What is happening in that country is heart-breaking,” said Zaffar, who currently is based in Oman.  Khan’s parents migrated from the Paktia province to India in the 70s during the Soviet invasion. His parents lived in Bokaro for five years before moving to Bengal. A budding cricketer as a young boy, Khan had to leave cricket owing to a back injury. Former British diplomat Paul Walsh introduced him to rugby. As a teenager, Khan started playing rugby for Jungle Crows founded by Walsh. He later went on to play in the Indian national rugby team. He first visited Kabul in 2010 to spread awareness about the game and also visited his ancestral place in Paktia. “I had a scary encounter with the Taliban. Even though I speak Pashto, I am a Kolkata boy and my accident sounded different. They were suspicious and interrogated me for 45 minutes till my uncle came to my rescue,” Khan told TOI. A few months later, Abdul Khalil, who was working to set up the Afghan Rugby Federation, contacted Khan. He agreed to train Afghan youths. He has made several trips since then to coach and bring in more youths into the game. “Apart from the national men’s team, we could set up 17 rugby teams from different provinces,” said Khan.

---||Patna||Bihar: Maoist threat looms large in Jamui village||PATNA: Panic has gripped the residents of Barajor village under the Chakai police station area in Jamui district following threat to their lives from Maoists who had gunned down two members of a family on Wednesday night. A group of CPI (Maoist) activists had shot dead one Chatur alias Chapoy Hembram (60) and his son Arjun Hembram (28) after dragging them out of their house around 10pm on Wednesday. The Maoists had left a few handwritten pamphlets, threatening other residents of the village with dire consequences if they leaked information to the police about their activities in the area. The Maoists also asked the villagers not to attend the funeral of the deceased who they branded police informers. Station house officer (SHO) of Chakai police station Rajiv Kumar Tiwari said the police have received information about the visit of some Maoists to the village. “The Maoists had gone to the village on their motorcycle after the police returned after handing over the bodies of the father-son duo to the family on Friday morning. Raids are on to nab them,” the SHO said. The family members are apprehending a fresh attack as the red rebels have asked them not to give statement to the police against them. The group that carried out the operation on Wednesday was led by one Sunil Marandi. Additional SP (operation) Sudhanshu Kumar said the 20-member squad involved in Wednesday’s incident also had some women cadres. Altogether 15 empty cartridges and one live cartridge were recovered from the spot. The villagers are so frightened that they have stopped going outside the village. Chakai, which is close to the Jharkhand border, is considered to a safe zone of the red rebels due to its topography. The Tola Pahar Barajor village is about 60 km from the district headquarters and located on the hilly terrain. Lack of communication and basic infrastructure has made the entire region a safe hideout of the Maoists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/maoist-threat-looms-large-in-jamui-village/articleshow/85722754.cms||Ramashankar

He said agripreneurs would not only become employment generators but also put the nation on the growth path by serving the most deserving section of society—farmers. Addressing students at Vignan University convocation on Saturday, Chintala said agriculture has once again proved to be a saviour of the economy and the nation during its crisis. He said agriculture has cushioned the shock of Covid-19 as it created over 11.2 million additional jobs of the total 16 million jobs generated in July. He said a comfortable food stock was built through the toil of the agricultural community, which saved the nation from facing a grim situation during the pandemic. He, however, said that fragmentation of land, poor mechanisation, inadequate storage facilities, and low farmer education and awareness were some of the issues holding back Indian agriculture from achieving its potential. “The agri start-ups are the missing link between the farmers, input dealers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers, connecting each of them to each other and providing strong marketing linkages and quality products on time,” said Dr Chintala. Varsity vice-chairman, Lavu Srikrishna Devarayulu, said the class of 2021 was graduating when the nation was celebrating its 75th year of Independence. He said students should be equipped with the best fundamental knowledge, skills, and curiosity to learn new things.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/agri-sector-needs-start-ups-says-nabard-chair/articleshow/85722634.cms||Samdani MN

They observed that easy access to the legal system could allow women to safeguard their interests. Participating in a two-day national conference on ‘Women’s Access to Justice through Legal Aid’ organised by Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) and Bihar Legal Network, the experts maintained that judiciaries would have to find innovative ways of handling cases of domestic violence, rape, child custody, divorce, right to alimony and property. The dean of the law faculty in Barkatullah University, Mona Purohit, pointed out that women were often denied prompt justice due to various socio-economic and political barriers. She also pleaded for necessary changes in various sections of the IPC and the CrPC to minimise the gap between law and justice. A Supreme Court lawyer, Arvind Gupta, said, “We need to create a balance between legal aid and justice for establishing the people’s trust in the judiciary.” Sewali Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Sciences-Mumbai spoke elaborately on the rights of Dalit and Muslim women. “Women, who continue to face multiple forms of discrimination are often exposed to heightened risks of exclusion, violence, and abuse and do not receive adequate support,” she claimed. Vibha Tripathi and Mukesh Kumar Malviya of Banaras Hindu University also spoke on the occasion. “If we can worship goddesses like Saraswati, Durga and Lakshmi, why can’t we ensure justice to our women,” asked CUSB’s vice-chancellor, Kameshwar Nath Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/deliver-impartial-justice-to-women-in-need-say-experts/articleshow/85722429.cms||B K Mishra

According to Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh, 16 dengue cases have so far been recorded in the district. The state health department, on the other hand, has confirmed that 34 dengue cases have been registered in Bihar from July 1 to August 28. According to health officials, dengue cases have been reported in four districts – Patna, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur and Nalanda. Four confirmed cases of chikungunya have so far been recorded in the state. The district health officials have found larvae of aedes mosquitoes (the mosquito that can spread dengue) at 150 of 725 places in Patna during a survey. Dr Singh said cases of vector-borne diseases like dengue are usually reported between July and November. “The 16 dengue cases in Patna have been reported from 11 different areas where fumigation and anti-larvae medicine spray drives have been conducted. These places include, Nayatola, Kankarbagh, Dariyapur, Agamkuan, Gulzarbagh, Mahendru, Mithapur, Rupaspur, Rajendra Nagar and Shahjahanpur in Daniyawan,” she said, adding no dengue death has so far been reported in the city. Dr Divendu Bhushan of medicine department of All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) said the number of dengue cases reported this year was quite low. “Only 10 dengue patients (above 18 years of age) have so far received treatment at the AIIMS-P this year,” he added. Dr Chandra Mohan Kumar, additional professor of paediatrics department at AIIMS-P, said high fever, vomiting, extreme body pain, muscle ache, loss of appetite and redness in the eyes are some of the common symptoms of dengue. “So far, we have admitted less than 10 patients in the paediatric ward. Patients suffering from malaria are also visiting in the OPD,” he added. No case of dengue or chikungunya has been reported at PMCH so far. However, the hospital administration has prepared a 30-bed ward for dengue patients. Dr Kaushal Kishore, head of medicine department at PMCH, said the hospital had witnessed a large number of dengue cases in 2019. “We have been expecting spurt in dengue cases this year as well. It is the lead time for dengue cases. After Diwali, there will be no case of dengue. The hospital is prepared to tackle dengue cases and a 30-bed dengue ward has already been created,” he said. At NMCH-Patna, a dengue ward has been created in the paediatric department and 10-bed e-ward in medicine department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/16-dengue-cases-in-patna-set-alarm-bells-ringing/articleshow/85721611.cms||Faryal Rumi

The issues on which the bandh will be observed include withdrawal of the controversial three farm laws, proposed labour laws and the mega National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) of the Centre. “The SKM, trade unions and other organisations which participated in the two-day national convention held in Delhi from August 26 were unanimous that the three issues will disrupt the country’s economy. The Centre’s move will also hit the unorganised sector on a huge scale,” Bhattacharya said. State CPI(ML) secretary Kunal said the process to formally solicit the support of the Mahagathbandhan partners to the Bharat bandh has already been started. The Mahagathbandhan partners in the state are the RJD, Congress and the three Left parties, including the CPI and CPM. Bhattacharya and Kunal, along with other CPI(ML) functionaries, including Dhirendra Jha, were talking to media persons at the Chhajubag office of the party. Bhattacharya said even as the central government has been virtually selling the country’s public assets, it has called it the “monetisation” plan to cover the public outrage that the move has already started evoking. “The central government says that it will merely lease out the public assets to the private players to raise Rs 6 lakh crore in the next four years, but it amounts to selling them,” Bhattacharya said. Describing the collateral damage it will cause to the unorganized sector, Bhattacharya said the small outlets providing services to the travellers and vehicle drivers along the leased out national highways will be simply ordered to close to make way for the bigger outlets. Similarly, the small outlets on the railway platforms will also be asked to wind up and close their services and they will be replaced by costly service providers like at the airports, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/national-monetisation-pipeline-to-hurt-countrys-economy-ml/articleshow/85723507.cms||Abhay Singh

The decision was taken in a recent meeting as the drive had stopped because of Covid-19. The aim of the drive will be to make the city free of single-use plastic. To preserve the environment and make Chandigarh plastic-free, the administration has already banned single-use plastic. For better enforcement of the plastic ban, the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) had recently organised an interactive meet of stakeholders, including the CPCC, the municipal corporation and law enforcement agencies involved in enforcement and regulation of the PWM Rules. The stakeholders were updated with the recent amendments, present status and areas for improvement. The chief sanitary inspector and sanitary inspectors were briefed on ways to wriggle out of the confrontation and challan procedure with non-compliant/defaulting units for smoother implementation of the PWM Rules. TimesViewIf a ban on single-use plastic items has to be successful, awareness has to be created on what are the single-use plastic items that are not to be used. Then, thought has to be given on what can be the alternative to these. The whole process should not be hurried through but undertaken in a phased manner keeping in mind the economic fallout of the pandemicTo sensitise the health superintendent, the chief sanitary inspector and the sanitary inspectors, the notification of the administration issued on September 27, 2019, and its amendments on complete ban of identified single-use plastic/thermocol items were discussed at length and queries addressed. The authorities requested the public to refrain from using any of the banned single-use plastic items.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/from-next-week-ut-to-restart-drive-to-make-city-free-of-single-use-plastic/articleshow/85721923.cms||---

Indian women athletes have started proving that they play to win. From Rani Rampal, captain of the Indian women’s hockey team to badminton player P V Sindhu, everyone has crossed the social and gender hurdles by their fighting spirit. Their achievements have inspired women athletes in Bihar as well, but they continue to rue many obstacles on their way. Muskan Singh (15), an Indian player in junior NBA (National Basketball Association), a basketball league in North America, said, “I am unwell right now, but I want to be the voice of women athletes in the state. I have heard a lot of comments about wearing sleeveless clothes. In my state, Bihar, a lot of girls start playing at a young age. However, when these girls grow up, they do not get the desired support from family and society. I don’t let this mentality bother me and keep on hustling.” Muskan, who hails from Patna, is a student of Corvuss American Academy, Maharashtra. Mamta, a member of the Bihar volleyball team, said, “I was passionate about volleyball since childhood and started playing when I was in Class VI. Though my family did not want me to pursue career in sports, I always believed in myself and dropped out of college to play volleyball. I played with national players and made my state proud several times.” Ojaswini Sharma, captain of women’s volleyball team at St Xavier’s College of Management & Technology, Patna, said, “Whenever a woman athlete achieves something, it encourages me. However, it is still very difficult to convince parents to let me take up sports as full-time career option.” Meanwhile, several good Samaritans are taking initiatives for supporting sports in the state. For instance, Patna-based Dr Arvind Prasad Gupta has decided to organise a felicitation ceremony for sportspersons on the occasion of National Sports Day on Sunday. Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad will inaugurate the event. “The sportspersons to be felicitated by us were injured at some point of time, but they got recovered in six to eight months and played at national and international levels thereafter,” Dr Gupta said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bihars-women-athletes-vow-to-beat-stereotypes/articleshow/85721816.cms||---

The State School Education Department issued GO.no: 55 reintroducing the old system for identifying merit and admission into further courses. With unhealthy competition among the students created by corporate institutions, the government in 2009 had introduced the relative grading system for SSC students. Only grades were given in the marks memo and no marks were revealed. Later in 2011 the government introduced an absolute grading system in place of the relative grading system. Since the SSC examinations were canceled in the academic year 2019-20 and 2020-21 the high power committee was constituted to award the grades. Later officials informed the government that the grading system was causing problems to identify the merit and admission into various courses. The government after a high-level meeting took a decision to reintroduce awarding marks from the academic year 2020-21. Meanwhile, student associations and patents expressed dissatisfaction over the decision. They said that private institutions will put pressure on students for ranks and maximum marks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/marks-system-to-replace-grading-in-aps-schools/articleshow/85722462.cms||Venu Lanka

Pitripaksha and the tourism in Bodh Gaya have close connection. It is considered to be beginning of tourist season in Bodh Gaya. The devotees who reach Gaya from across the country to perform pindadaan also visit Mahabodhi Mahavihara. Also, there is a pind vedi at Dharmaranya in Bodh Gaya where devotees perform pindadaan. However, as per the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued earlier by the state home department, no religious function can be organised without permission of the district magistrate concerned. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said, “No one from Gayapal Panda Samaj or the Vishnupad Temple Management Committee has approached us so far for Pitripaksha Mela.” Tourist Guide Association of Bihar president Rakesh Kumar said, “It is a welcome decision of the state government to open Vishnupad temple and the Mahabodhi Mahavihara. Other states had already opened the tourist places. After opening of Mahabodhi Mahavihara, the stakeholders, including hoteliers, tour and travel operators and footpath vendors can expect the footfall of tourists. Although international tourists are not expected to reach here in absence of international flights, domestic tourists, especially those performing pindadaan, will definitely come.” Kumar said the state government should take a decision to allow tourists in Bodh Gaya. “Vaccinated tourists should be allowed. Physical distancing should be maintained and other measures like use of sanitizer, hand wash and mask be followed,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/mahabodhi-temple-reopening-enthuses-tourism-industry/articleshow/85722857.cms||---

Across the globe, majority countries have small but significant communities with their roots in the state. The case of Raju Karavadra, 37, is a perfect example of this unfailing Gujju spirit to settle abroad – he had failed his class X exams, did not know English well or had money to get a toehold in foreign land but going abroad was his life's mission! But since he left home in 2009, Raju has worked in Israel, settled in Italy and has so far travelled to 18 countries. He has got married to an Italian woman and is now working in a production unit in Liguria province in north-west Italy. Born in Mer community at Sodhana village near Porbandar, Karavadra went to a nearby village to attend school. From the family of modest means, it was his dream to see the world. “But what would I do? I did not have money or contacts. I did all I could – doing domestic chores, driving vehicles or running errands for others. I got a stable job as a driver in 2008 when I started saving,” recounts Raju. “I also gave my share of land and in all raised Rs 5 lakh.” Today Raju works at a local manufacturing unit and also cultivates the land for fruits. Today however he’s more famous for his Gujarati YouTube videos and Facebook live sessions with over 60,000 followers. Based on a few friends’ suggestions, he targeted Israel to get a work permit. “I had run out of money after waiting for 15 days. I had no other option but to go forward. I finally got a visa – and a ticket to a new life. I lived in kibbutz and worked as a caretaker for the elderly even as I had no knowledge of Hebrew. I made a few friends through whom I eventually met Hila, my wife,” says Raju. Hila, now 48, is an Italian national and physiotherapist by profession. She was on visit to her relatives when the duo met. She also has a 10-year-old girl from her previous marriage. The couple tied the knot in Cyprus and went to Italy. “I worked and worked – in India or abroad. It not only earned me friends, but also respect. Even in Italy, an elderly for whom I’m caring has given me the land to cultivate. It’s a hilly region and the village I’m living in has just 35 residents,” he says. The countries he has visited include France, Switzerland, the UK and Monaco among others for which he has shot elaborate videos and have posted them on his page.Today Raju works at a local manufacturing unit and also cultivates the land for fruits. Today however he’s more famous for his Gujarati YouTube videos and Facebook live sessions with over 60,000 followers. He gives his reflection on the place and life in general in his typical coastal Saurashtra twang. The viewers from Gujarat and elsewhere go on virtual tours with him in Italian countryside and Europe as he even talks about Covid conditions and work suggestions for aspirant immigrants. “It wouldn’t have been possible without the blessings of Lord Dwarkadheesh and my parents. They gave me all they had so that I can progress in life. I have always believed and lived by the adage – where there’s a will there’s a way. I have learnt functional languages ranging from Hebrew and Italian. My wife understands my Gujarati even as she can’t speak it as yet,” chuckles Raju. She had also lived in Porbandar for a month after the wedding. The countries he has visited include France, Switzerland, the UK and Monaco among others for which he has shot elaborate videos and have posted them on his page. He gets incessant responses from Guaratis jealous of his ‘rural life in Italy.’ “But I tell them that it’s all luck, hard work and will to survive,” says Raju.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/aavi-rite-jaish-youth-served-as-domestic-help-driver-to-save-for-going-abroad/articleshow/85723878.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Though the floodwaters of the Gandak and other hilly rivers in West Champaran were receding gradually and the water discharge through the Gandak has also fallen, a large number of villages and schools are still under knee to thigh-deep water in at least six blocks of the district. The worst-affected blocks in West Champaran are Bagaha, Piparasi, Madhubani, Bhitaha, Thakaraha and Jogaptti. Around 50,000 people are affected. Reports said houses have also been damaged. The water discharge through Valmiki Nagar barrage across the Gandak was recorded at 2.57 lakh cusecs at 5pm on Saturday. In the morning, the water discharge was 3 lakh cusecs and it fell to 2.64 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. The river was flowing above the danger level at Chatia, Dumariaghat, Rewa Ghat and Hajipur. As far as the Kosi is concerned, the water discharge through the Birpur barrage in Supaul district was 1.91 lakh cusecs in the morning, but it increased to 2.14 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. It was flowing above the danger level at Baltara and Kursela in Katihar district. Fortunately, even as the Bagmati was flowing more than 1 metre above the danger level at a couple of places along its downstream, its water level was falling. Similarly, the water level in the Kamla was 3.20 metres above the danger level at Jhanjharpur in its downstream and 85cm at Jainagar in its upstream.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/50k-hit-as-gandak-continues-to-wreak-havoc-in-w-champaran/articleshow/85723297.cms||Abhay Singh

Addressing a symposium on ‘Role of robotic surgery in weight reduction’ on Saturday, IGIMS director Dr N R Biswas said a separate operation theatre for robotic surgery was being developed at the hospital. Dr Biswas and head of surgical gastroenterology department, Dr Manish Mandal, said one the six operation theatres under construction was being designed as per specifications for robotic surgery and would be available for all departments like neurosurgery, paediatrics and gastroenterology. He said training for robotic surgery, the first in any government hospital in the state, would be imparted to doctors and other staff within few months. Discussing the issue of obesity, Dr Mandal said weight gain is a major health concern in Bihar where 25 to 30% people of all ages are suffering from it. “What concerns more is the fact that even schoolchildren are fast getting excess weight unconcerned about its adverse effects. Obesity causes problems of blood pressure, blood sugar, asthma, thyroid and many other diseases,” he said. “Bad lifestyle, junk food and lack of physical exercise are the main reasons for obesity specially in urban people. While many patients visiting the OPD of the hospital are suggested medicines and exercises to reduce weight, some in advance stages are operated through laparoscopy,” Dr Mandal added. Dr Sharique Nazir of NYU Langone Medical Centre, USA, said slim gastrectomy with help of robotic surgery was very effective to reduce weight at less time. “It also helps people recover fast and control their other problems like blood pressure and blood sugar,” he said. Dr Barnwal, head of the Bihar chapter of Association of Surgeons of India, Dr A A Hai and other medical experts joined the symposium.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/robotic-surgery-at-igims-soon/articleshow/85723218.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Now, a registry to keep a tab on sex offenders||VIJAYAWADA: As part of measures to prevent crimes against women (CAW), the AP police came up with the idea to open history sheets against sexual offenders to keep their actions in check. So far, 2,017 sheets have been opened against sexual offenders across the state. Apart from this, cops also created a database of over 2.1 lakh sexual offenders—both convicts and habitual offenders—in the state. With this database, cops also geotagged sexual offenders and vulnerability mapping. The vulnerability mapping is aimed at providing information to the concerned beat or patrol officers to keep track of offenders whenever a crime takes place in the area. Officials also explained that they had produced a similar surveillance initiative—the cyberbully sheets—to tackle online harassment of women. The cybercrime wing of the Crime Investigation Department (CID) opened 1,531 cyberbully sheets against those found harassing, abusing, and intimidating women online. The cyber bullies’ online activity across social media platforms are tracked and recorded and whenever a complaint is lodged against them, the cyberbully sheet would stand as an important document during prosecution. Cops point out that since the government’s prioritisation on crimes against women under Disha came to the fore, surveillance and digital measures taken to prevent sexual offences have come in handy in saving several women’s lives. A majority of the sexual offenders who have had sheets opened against them have been booked for sexual harassment, followed by molestation, and then rape. “No other state has such an initiative to keep an accessible database on sexual offenders. Such sheets have helped in identifying the accused and the recent Seethanagaram incident stands as a case-in-point,” a senior CID official told STOI. Cops have also reduced the average time taken to complete an investigation of crimes against women from over three-and-a-half months to 86 days in 2020 and 42 days in 2021. The investigation compliance rate in sexual offences for the current year holds a national record of 90% in Andhra Pradesh while the national average stands at 35%. Cops point out that the launch of Disha Command Control Rooms and the Disha app, equipped with the database of sexual offenders, has empowered the police in reaching the target of completing investigations and arrests in a time-bound manner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/now-a-registry-to-keep-a-tab-on-sex-offenders/articleshow/85722186.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Used to moving around with paraphernalia and addressing gatherings, tformer and present ministers, legislators and other leadersnow have to visit families with just a handful of supporters. Former minister R V Deshpande who visited Dharwad on Friday had to visit few families with a handful of Congress workers accompanying him to campaign for the party’s candidate. For some senior leaders of the party who played an important role in the selection of candidates, the Covid-19 restrictions have come in handy to avoid campaigning. “There are 82 wards in the HDMC and with just 10 days left for campaigning after the deadline for filing nomination ended, it will not be possible to campaign in all wards. We can’t address public meetings either as SEC has banned them,” said an MLA. For the candidates who are greenhorns, the restrictions have come as major hurdle as they are finding it difficult to visit all the areas in their ward and go for door-to-door campaigning. While the former corporators who are in the fray are known faces, voters have not seen several new comers representing national parties. There are good number of candidates in BJP, Congress and Janata Dal(S) who are newcomers. As many as 122 candidates are in the fray as Independents. In the absence of permission to use vehicles for campaigning, covering all areas in the ward on foot has become difficult for candidates, particularly Independents. “I was representing a different ward last time but now I have been forced by the party to shift to another ward following change in reservation. I am finding it difficult to meet all the people personally in the ward from where I am now contesting,” said a Congress candidate.  Many candidates are resorting to social media, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram and voice recorded messages on cellphones to reach out to voters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/amid-covid-curbs-political-greenhorns-struggle-to-woo-electorate/articleshow/85722139.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The tourism department has forwarded the dossier to the central government, which will recommend it to Unesco as an entry from India. The government had already applied in 2019, but the process could not be completed due to the pandemic breaking out across the world in the beginning of 2020. “Durga Puja is the best instance of the public performance of religion and art in the city. It witnesses a celebration of craftsmanship, cross-cultural transactions and cross-community revelry,” said a senior official of the tourism department in the state. Camel racing in UAE, the Rio festival in Brazil, handmade weaving in Egypt, Kumbh Mela, Buddhist chanting and Chhau dance in India are some of the intangible cultural heritages that have already made it on Unesco’s list. In 2019, the entire presentation for enlisting of Durga Puja on the Unesco Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage, highlighting the history, socio-cultural context and inclusivity, was prepared by Tapati Guha Thakurta, a professor of history with the Centre for Study in Social Sciences in Kolkata. She, along with her team, prepared the elaborate dossier for the Union ministry of culture. The state gave a letter of endorsement. “The state has again proposed to nominate the festival of Durga Puja for Unesco’s Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. We have also shared our input with the government on this,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary of Forum for Durgotsab. “Durga Puja is a perfect embodiment of the diverse culture in the state and how it brings together different strata of the society to celebrate this festival,” he said. Durga Puja marks the 10-day worship of Durga, who appears in her divine incarnation as Mahishasurmardini. Traditional families have been organising Durga Puja for over 300 years and Barowari or community pujas are organised by clubs. In the past few years, even gated communities and housing complexes have started organising their own Durga Pujas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-pushes-for-unesco-tag-for-its-biggest-festival/articleshow/85725047.cms||Zeeshan Javed

He was relieved to come out of the situation but, at the same time, it was painful to leave behind people who had believed in him. “On one hand, my parents were waiting for my return and on the other, I was leaving behind dreams, hopes and aspirations of the people. A part of me is guilty about leaving but I had no choice,” Haque told TOI after reaching Delhi from Almaty via Sharjah on Friday. One of the last Kolkata residents to return from Afghanistan, the LSE alumni now wants to work for Afghans stranded with their families in Afghanistan. He will be back at his Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road address by Monday after travelling through four countries. Haque hopes that he will be able to help the Afghan community from India.“I lived with the people for 25 months, rarely came back to India. It was with them I shared my joys and sorrows. It was very difficult to leave everything behind. I had plans of doing something concrete, building a youth-led organisation, empowering the children at refugee camps, starting different sports activities and expanding the education sector but all these seem a distant dream now,” said Haque. Since he has moved out of the situation, he feels it is more of his responsibility now to speak for the Afghan people and seek support for them. Haque hopes that he will be able to help the Afghan community from India. “There has been a havoc, people have lost their jobs, there is a problem of food, shelter and clothing. We are trying to support food security and provide them with basic necessities in whatever way we can,” said the Kolkatan. He feels that the support from the international community, various governments and individuals who have felt for Afghanistan should not stop. TOI has tracked Haque’s work and travails in Afghanistan since July 17What hurts him more are the messages seeking help because he can understand what the common people are undergoing. “Even if they wish to come out of the situation, they can’t. It is a horrible situation to be in when you don’t know what is going to unfold the next day. I was shocked when we heard about the blast in the Kabul airport. The situation was already bad around the airport where thousands of people were waiting, and such an incident would add more misery.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-man-escapes-war-zone-now-wants-to-work-for-people-stuck-in-af/articleshow/85724901.cms||Dipawali Mitra

The flight left for New Delhi without any passenger at 3pm, airport sources said. Around 120 passengers on board the IndiGo flight had a narrow escape when it suffered a bird hit around 11.15am on Friday. The plane shuddered after the bird hit and the pilot made an emergency landing at Patna airport at 11.30am. The plane was at an altitude of 900 feet at the time when the accident occurred. After landing, the passengers de-boarded the flight and were later accommodated on another two aircraft. During an inspection carried out by the technical team of the airlines, it was revealed that few engine blades had been damaged after the bird strike. Though bird hits were common at the city airport earlier, such incidents had come down in recent years. It was probably second such incident this year after Bengaluru-bound Vistara flight which had suffered a bird hit during landing at the city airport last January. Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, who is also the chairperson of Airport Environment Management Committee, said instructions have been issued to remove fish and meat shops from the vicinity of the airport. “Trees on the premises of Patna zoo and other nearby areas are being pruned,” he added. The city airport has 10 bird scarers, two six-shot launchers and seven zone guns among other tools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/grounded-indigo-flight-leaves-airport/articleshow/85721712.cms||---

Presiding over a meeting of JD(U)’s national office-bearers here, Singh said, “We have to work unitedly with full dedication and vigour to fulfil Nitish’s dream of making the JD(U) a national party. To achieve this goal, it is necessary that apart from the booth-level office-bearers, each and every worker of the party ensures his/her full participation in the mission.” Currently, the JD(U) has the status of a ‘state party’ in Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh. It requires to achieve the status of ‘state party’ in two more states to become a national party. The party requires to bag at least 6% of the total polled votes in assembly polls in two more states to achieve the status of a national party. To achieve this goal, the JD(U) has already announced its desire to contest forthcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and Manipur. Addressing the meeting, Singh asked the party leaders to work hard to take a good message about the works done by Nitish up to the house of last person of the society. “Nitish has done tremendous work in the field of development and social reforms. We have to inform and educate people about his good works,” the JD(U) chief said.

The study, conducted on 114 healthcare professionals and frontline workers who received Covaxin from February to May 2021, found that those who were infected with Covid-19 and took one dose of Covaxin showed a similar immune response as Covid-19 infection-naïve participants who received two doses of the vaccine. “Our preliminary data suggested that a single dose of BBV152-induced humoral immunity in previously infected individuals was equivalent to two doses of the vaccine in infection-naïve individuals,” said the study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR). The ICMR researchers pointed out that “participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, after a single vaccine (BBV152) dose elicited IgG (N) and IgG (S) antibody levels along with NAb binding inhibition responses levels that were similar to infection-naïve vaccinated participants who had taken two doses of vaccine”. According to ICMR, the findings of the study, titled ‘Antibody responses to the BBV152 vaccine in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2: A pilot study’, offers evidence in support of public health-oriented and immunologically sustained vaccine strategies that could include recommending a one-dose regimen for those already infected by Covid-19. However, it said these findings will need to be confirmed with large-sized cohort studies. “If our preliminary findings are confirmed in large population studies, a single dose of BBV152 vaccine may be recommended to previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals so that naïve individuals could attain the larger benefit of a limited vaccine supply,” ICMR said. ICMR, however, added that both vaccine doses would be ideal even for previously infected individuals in the long run due to the occurance of variants of concern||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/1-dose-covaxin-enough-for-covid-hit-icmr/articleshow/85725644.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Allahabad||Elderly woman tricked into getting gold loan, murdered||Prayagraj: An elderly woman was tricked into getting a gold loan and later killed for usurping Rs 2 lakh received as loan and another Rs 4.5 lakh from her bank account by three youths including her nephew in Prayagraj. The trio buried the body near her ancestral house in Soraon. A police team managed to nab her nephew and one of his accomplices and recover the body on late on Friday evening. The woman’s son lodged a complaint on August 19 two days after she went missing on August 17. Efforts to nab the third accused are underway, police said. According to SP (City) Dinesh Singh, Vidyawati Kesarwani (70) — a resident of Old Katra — lived alone in her house after the death of her husband Ganesh Prasad. Her three sons Arun, Luvkush and Sanjay lived separately. On August 17, she mysteriously disappeared from the house. After failing to locate her, Arun lodged a complaint with the Colonelganj police. Investigation by the police revealed that her nephew Dheeraj Gupta, a resident of Old Katra used to frequently visit the woman. “Police detained the youth and questioned him. He confessed to killing the woman with the help of two of his friends, including Rinku Jaiswal of Old Katra and one Siddhu Yadav, also a resident of the same locality. Police then nabbed Siddhu. During the interrogation, they confessed to have taken the woman to Hajiganj village in Soraon and buried her at a lonely place near her ancestral house after killing her on August 17. A police team then managed to find the body on August 27 and send it for a postmortem examination.” Dheeraj informed the police that he was aware of the woman having gold jewellery and cash worth lakhs. During a period of seven months, he convinced her to avail a gold loan of Rs 2 lakh. He also withdrew Rs 4.5 lakh from her bank account on different dates. When the woman started demanding the money back, he decided to kill her with the help of his friends.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/elderly-woman-tricked-into-getting-gold-loan-murdered/articleshow/85725750.cms||---

The girl, Pornima Madke, has suffered injuries to her legs. She was admitted to the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital for treatment, the fire brigade officials said. Fire officer Hrishikant Chipade said, “The walls and roof of the house collapsed around 8am. The fire brigade received the emergency call stating that a two-year-old girl and a 13-year-old girl were trapped under the debris of the collapsed house”. A local shopkeeper, Mayur Pande, heard a loud noise and rushed to the spot. He saw a woman and a two yearold girl inside the collapsed house, following which he entered the house and took out the girl and her mother safely. Pornima, however, had gone to the bathroom and a portion of the wall fell on her. She was trapped under the debris of the wall. Local residents also attempted to enter the house but fear of the entire structure collapsing kept them away. All this while, the girl kept screaming for help. The fire brigade officials dug up the debris for three hours with small equipment, ensuring that the girl was not harmed in the search operation. The debris of the house kept on falling when the rescue teams were in action. The old two-storey house was constructed about 50 years ago and it was constructed with the help of wooden logs, mud, and bricks. The wooden logs, mud and bricks fell down on Saturday morning. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation authorities said the old structure was weak and caved-in.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/girl-trapped-under-debris-rescued/articleshow/85723644.cms||---

However, since there is no possibility of getting a hostel on arrival, students will have to make their own arrangements. According to Covid guidelines, the university has only up to 1,700 rooms to give and already about 1,000 research scholars are living in the rooms. In such a situation, final year students will not be able to get more than 800 rooms. Due to Covid situation, only one student can stay in a room. A few rooms in every hostel have to be left vacant for isolation. There are a total of 2,200 rooms. Before the Covid pandemic, about 6,000 students were living in hostels. Now, their number cannot exceed 2,000. Dean, University Instruction Prof R K Sinha presided over the meeting, which was attended by registrar Vikram Nayar, DSW Prof S K Tomar, DSW, women Prof Meena Sharma, secretary to vice-chancellor Prof Devendra Singh, controller of examinations Dr Jagat Bhushan, chief of university security Vikram Singh and CMO.

Commuters said that the Mundhwa chowk remains choc-a-bloc with vehicles throughout the day, leading to traffic snarls. Local residents said that potholes and poor condition of the road has slowed down traffic. Manohar Bhalekar, a regular traveller on Kharadi-Mundhwa stretch, said, “After crossing the bridge from the Kharadi side the road becomes narrow ahead of Mundhwa chowk, leaving little space for vehicles. Also, many bikers indulge in wrong-side driving, which is dangerous. There is a need to streamline traffic in the area.” Kharadi-Mundhwa is a key road link between Ahmednagar Road and Solapur Road. The road stretch is also used by heavy vehicles, besides private cars, bikes and buses. Arpit Sharma, a local resident, said, Though the traffic chaos on the bridge has reduced to some extent, it has now moved ahead towards the chowk. The civic administration and traffic police need to clear the encroachment at the chowk, which will help widen the road and reduce traffic congestion. Long queues of vehicles reach up to the middle of the bridge during rush hours. Motorists take more than 15 minutes to cross the chowk.” Ajay Agarwal, a regular traveller, said, “The traffic police needs to deploy more men at both ends of the bridge so that riders can be stopped from indulging in wrongside driving. Repeated actions may prove a deterrent. The administration should install a board warning riders against travelling on the wrong side.” Motorists, particularly those on two-wheelers, are frequently seen driving on the wrong side of the road, further worsening the situationMeanwhile, the civic administration on Tuesday repaired potholes between the bridge and the Mundhwa chowk. The traffic police department has deployed more staffers at the chowk to manage the traffic flow. An official from the traffic police department said, “The movement of vehicles had slowed down at the chowk because of potholes. Also, the carriageway is narrower near the chowk, leading to queues of vehicles. The potholes have been repaired to a large extent, which will help reduce the congestion. On Tuesday, the congestion was reduced to some extent and the traffic moved smoothly,” an official added. An official said that the civic administration should consider a proposal to close the road-divider puncture, which will reduce wrong-side driving.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/wrong-side-driving-potholes-spark-traffic-chaos-at-mundhwa-chowk/articleshow/85723679.cms||Sarang Dastane

Worse, while the tantric charade was playing out, the woman married another man. The victim, Ajay (name changed) is 28 years old. He was upset when his girlfriend stopped talking to him. So he sought the tantric route which led to a dead end and financial ruin. Ajay on Friday submitted a complaint to Sarkhej police, which was later transferred to Ghatlodia police. Ajay stated that in 2020 he came in contact with Anil Joshi, who identified himself as a mediaperson and astrologer. Joshi told Ajay that someone had performed tantric tricks on his girlfriend and counter-rituals were necessary. Ajay paid Joshi Rs 11,400 and later Rs 21,000. Ajay told police that Joshi subsequently called to say that someone else was conducting parallel rituals and to allay their influence a tantric procedure costing Rs 72,000 was required. Ajay paid that too but no change was evident for long. This time Joshi explained that the challenge was onerous and complicated rituals would have to be performed. The new demand was for Rs 1.25 lakh to undo the tantric effects of Ajay’s enemy plus another Rs 11,000. The complex tantric therapy did not work either. When Ajay protested, Joshi told him to get two mobile phones where all his negative energies will be transferred. Ajay got the two mobiles for Rs 75,000 and gave them to Joshi’s wife who asked him to pay Rs 10,000 extra. In fact, the demand for extra money never ceased and Ajay ended up emptying his account. Later, Joshi informed Ajay that the priest conducting the rituals had fallen sick because of the rites performed by the opposing side. Joshi said he will have to call his guru from Ujjain. So Joshi got someone he called Guru Dharam to Ajay’s house. The duo said that there was hidden treasure in Ajay’s house and brought out a small earthen pot. The duo said the pot would yield untold riches once it was purified for Rs 15 lakh. Ajay said that he closed his father’s savings account and borrowed money from his relative for the pot purification. In the end, Ajay got neither wealth nor love. For his part, Joshi became belligerent. Joshi said since he was a mediaperson he had friends in the police force. Joshi threatened Ajay of dire consequences unless he forgot about the Rs 43.60 lakh he had paid overall. Ajay finally realized that Joshi had no real power and went to the cops. Police have filed a case under the Indian Penal Code’s sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 506-1 (criminal intimidation), and 120B (criminal conspiracy).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/tantra-cant-buy-me-love-dumped-man-loses-rs-44l/articleshow/85727541.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Electricity distribution to be revamped in the city||Prayagraj: To prevent power theft in the district, the power department has decided to lay the Low- tension (LT) line, the power line which supplies electricity to every household, underground in the city. This follows the successful completion of the laying of all the high-tension lines below the ground in the city. The electricity department is preparing to undertake the exercise in the localities where cases of power theft are reported the most. The survey of such localities, where the LT line would be laid underground under the revamped scheme, has already been done. Under the revamped scheme of the Central Government, a plan has been made to install aerial bunch conductors to prevent theft of electricity even in villages having a population of less than one thousand. At present, the electricity department was installing a special type of conductor in villages with a population of more than one thousand. The power department may also start the work of installing smart meters in urban homes. Superintending engineer Ashutosh Srivastav has been made the nodal officer for preparing this plan. Vinod Kumar, chief engineer (Prayagraj Division) of Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited said that a proposal to prevent theft of electricity would be prepared and sent to the Center through the state government following the work would commence after getting the approval. “All the attempts are being made to minimise the loss of power—12% in urban and 15% in rural areas—so that the consumers get uninterrupted power supply. For this, the entire set up, from the substation to wires, transformers etc., would be revamped so that there is a minimum flaw in the powerline and the work would be completed within 2025”, said the chief engineer. Under the revamped scheme of the central government, suggestions were sought from MPs, MLAs, village heads to prevent and improve electricity theft. OP Dixit, Director (Commercial) of Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited had sought suggestions along with public representatives and people. In this, suggestions were given by engineers of the electricity department to the lineman. Planning is being done based on everyone’s suggestions. Besides, setting up of new sub-stations of 33 KV is also proposed and a dual supply system in every part of the city would be done. Even in villages, with less than one thousand of population, electricity will be supplied from aerial bunch conductors. Under the revamped scheme, a blueprint is being prepared to stop electricity theft in the city and villages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/electricity-distribution-to-be-revamped-in-the-city/articleshow/85725791.cms||---

If not repaired, Congress has warned of protest. Congress activists led by GPCC general secretary Janardhan Bhandari met the officials of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and informed them about the potholes developed on the bypass road. They said that the dilapidated state of the road has led to several accidents in the last few months and that about 23 cattle have died. “It is shocking that in less than two years the bypass road has developed deep depressions. Several street lights along this route are also not functioning,” Bhandari told TOI. The work of the road was completed in a haphazard manner, so it was not surprising that it has deteriorated so fast, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fix-canacona-bypass-road-or-face-protest-cong/articleshow/85725796.cms||---

The arrested person has been identified as Thwaiba Ouladi of Thiruvalla. She was summoned by the probe team which interrogated her and later recorded her arrest. Official sources said that preliminary evidence collected by the investigation team suggested that Thwaiba was also part of the gang from which the drug was seized. “The accused including Sreemon, Muhammad Favas, his wife Shabna, Manoj and Thwaiba together reached the Marhaba Apartment on August 18. Investigations suggest that four of them had travelled to Chennai and Pondicherry to procure large amounts of MDMA. Three Rottweilers and Dobermans, trained by Favas, were also with them. The accused also stayed at two other apartments in Padamugal and Palachuvadu areas,” said an official source. Thwaiba was produced before the magistrate court and was remanded in judicial custody. The decision of the excise team which seized the drug to not arraign Thwaiba as an accused had kicked up a controversy about mishandling of the case by the officials. A subsequent internal inquiry by an officer in the rank of additional excise commissioner had found that there were lapse on the part of the officials. Later, the excise inspector who first probed the case was suspended and four other officers were transferred as part of disciplinary proceedings. The five arrested persons were taken to various locations in the city on Saturday evening, as part of evidence collection. The probe team will question a Kasaragod native who was also part of the gang but was not arraigned as an accused in the case on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/mdma-case-woman-let-off-earlier-taken-into-custody/articleshow/85723711.cms||---

The state government only recently permitted fully vaccinated travellers to board local trains, which had till then been limited to only those involved in essential services. “A total fine of Rs. 9.76 lakh was collected from the offenders during inspections by ticket checkers on the trains. Permission the fully vaccinated to travel was given just last week and special passes were issued only from August 18,” a Pune railways official said. Right now, of 42 local trains connecting Pune to various places, only four are operational between the city and Lonavla. Till last week, only essential service providers were given a special pass imprinted with a QR code by the district administration, which was the only way they could travel. “There 14 railway stations between Pune and Lonavala. While we have presence in all the stations, it is not always possible to keep an eye on the smaller stations, and the unauthorized travellers were able to board trains,” the official pointed out. So far, 50 passes have been issued to the fully vaccinated at Pune station (till 1pm on Tuesday) and 97 at the Shivajinagar station. These passes will allow the traveller to get a monthly pass. The universal travel pass issued by the state is also valid for travel on local trains, authorities said. “If so many people were able to travel illegally in local trains when stringent restrictions were in place, what then is the guarantee — now that travel has opened up a little bit — that more such people will not get on the trains? They pose a danger to travellers and the authorities need to come up with a foolproof system to prevent this from repeating in the future,” Railway Pravasi Group chairman Harsha Shah told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/in-3-months-3200-illegal-travellers-on-local-trains/articleshow/85723714.cms||Joy Sengupta

Yuvrajsinh Rathod issued the legal notice under provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, through the Consumer Protection Grahak Satyagrah, to Eight Fitness Club, demanding gym services be extended till November. Rathod had paid Rs 8,000 in January 2020 for a 15-month membership and services from the gymnasium, but gyms were shut after the lockdown. Rathod claimed that since January 2020, he has been able to use the services of the gym for nine months and 20 days only, because the gym remained closed for more than five months. Hence he should get services for the remaining five months and 10 days without extra payment. Rathod’s notice was prompted by an appeal by the gym management seeking support from its members saying, “As giving extension to our members for the lockdown period would be back-breaking for us, all UFSF (United Fitness & Sports Federation) gyms have decided not to provide extension. All gyms of Ahmedabad are members of UFSF and are going to apply this policy together.” Rathod requested the gym management to extend his service period or he would be constrained to drag it to the consumer court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/notice-to-gym-for-not-making-up-for-closures/articleshow/85727533.cms||---

---||Allahabad||POS machines, QR scanning to eliminate threat of spurious liquor across state||Prayagraj: In the backdrop of instances of deaths in the state caused by consuming spurious liquor, the excise department would soon be installing point of sale machines in liquor shops of the state. The preparations in this regard have been completed by the department. To implement the ambitious project, the department has chosen beer shops as a pilot project in the first phase. The system would be installed in about 7500 beer shops across the state in the next two months. Once installed, each bottle of beer—and in a later stage the liquor being sold from the liquor shops—would be scanned through the POS machine installed at the shop concerned. As soon as the Quick Response (QR) code is scanned by the machine, all the details about the bottle concerned would be transferred to the server of the excise department. “Every bottle of beer, produced in the state comes with the QR code and now when the sale would be possible only after scanning the bottle under POS machine, there would be no chance of sale of spurious liquor. At the same time, the department would be getting the exact information of the liquor, right from the production and up to the sale to the consumer”, said district excise officer (DEO), Jitendra Singh, while talking to TOI. In the last few years, many people have lost their lives by drinking spurious liquor. To prevent this, there was talk of installing POS machines at liquor shops. However, because of some technical hurdles, the same could not be installed. The excise department has now decided to implement it in a phased manner. Beer shops are relatively few in numbers and as such the department has opted to install the POS machine in the first phase at beer selling shops of the state. In the second phase, it will be installed at liquor shops and in the third phase at country liquor shops too. After installing the machine, it will be mandatory for the shopkeeper to scan and sell the liquor bottle from the machine. As soon as it is scanned, the full details of its sale along with the name of the shop, bottle make, its serial number etc would be transferred to the data bank of the department. Apart from checking the sale of spurious liquor, the system is so designed that liquor, allotted for sale from one shop, could not be sold from another shop. As soon as the QR code is scanned, the department would come to know for which shop the liquor was allotted from the warehouse. If the sale is done to another shop, then action can be taken against the shopkeeper.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/pos-machines-qr-scanning-to-eliminate-threat-of-spurious-liquor-across-state/articleshow/85725843.cms||---

Following a tip-off, Karnataka police rushed to different states, and managed to nab the accused within 96 hours.Murdered customer was a masonOn the evening of August 23, a four-member armed gang looted the jewellery store, and while fleeing the spot, shot 22-year-old Chandru, a customer at the store, who was declared brought dead when he was rushed to the hospital. Chandru, a resident of Dadadahalli, was a mason who had come to the store to purchase an ear stud, said his friend Ranjith. “When the shutter was opened by the gang inside, Chandru tried to enter the shop, but was shot,” said Ranjith. The heist and murder understandably raised the hackles of Mysuru residents, considering that the crime was reported in a locality very close to the heart of the city.‘It was a challenging case’Solving the case of dacoity and murder that was reported in Mysuru was a big challenge, particularly since those involved in it were from other states.

The ASI report said, “The building is a heritage structure and can be conserved and preserved in the same form without changing the original architecture.” “The court building functions as a munsiff and sub-court and is a two-tiered building constructed in the colonial style architecture with indigenous architectural elements. The existence of the court is specifically mentioned in the Malabar Gazetteer, compiled in 1904-05 and published in 1908 Sir Charles Alexander Innes, settlement officer of the British government. The court building is extended over a large area and many old colonial style buildings could be seen attached and closer to this heritage building,” the report added. The report by ASI, Thrissur unit, is in light of the controversy on the move to demolish the old building to construct an office complex. A complaint against the demolition was filed by Boban Mattumantha, president, History Club of Palakkad. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/asi-calls-for-preserving-ottapalam-court-complex/articleshow/85723779.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The petitioner had sought directions to the state government to permit her to terminate her undesirable pregnancy, stating, “The pregnancy has resulted in such extreme anguish to her that it constituted grave injury to her mental health.” The division bench comprising Justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and Justice Deepak Verma passed the order on the petition filed by a minor rape survivor. The court has fixed September 3, 2021, as the next date of hearing. The petitioner said her medical examination at Government Hospital, Bulandshahr in July revealed the fetus was about 14 weeks then, meaning thereby that as of date the pregnancy was of about 19 weeks. The court directed the principal of Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut, to constitute a board of experts from gynecology, psychiatry, radiology and pediatrics for medical examination of the petitioner, and submit its recommendations in sealed cover to the Additional District Judge, First, Meerut, who shall act as a member-cum-coordinator of the medical board. The Additional District Judge, First, Meerut has been asked to pass on the report to the high court positively by September 2, 2021. The court also directed the petitioner to approach the Medical Board for medical examination. The court also directed the state counsel to communicate its order to senior superintendent of police, Bulandshahr, for providing security cover to the petitioner and a person accompanying her to medical college for medical examination. As per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, the limit for permitting abortion has been increased to 24 weeks for certain categories of women, including a rape survivor. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act permits termination of pregnancy in rape cases by raising a presumption that the anguish caused by pregnancy in such cases causes grave injury to mental health. The court issued these directives on August 27.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hc-seeks-med-board-report-forminor-rape-survivors-abortion/articleshow/85725620.cms||---

---||Nagpur||MHT-CET dates to be declared in 4 days: Maharashtra higher education minister Uday Samant||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra higher education minister Uday Samant on Saturday said the MHT-CET dates would be declared within two to four days. The minister said that the exam, which is usually held in June, has been delayed as the number of exam centres had to be increased from 194 to 350 to maintain Covid distancing norms. Speaking to the media here, Samant also declared the setting up of a dedicated university offering Marathi language courses. Senior Shiv Sena leader Diwakar Raote had raised this demand in the last assembly session. “A panel, to be set up in the next 8-10 days, will submit a report,” he said. Reiterating that the government was in no mood to reopen colleges in view of the Covid-19 third wave threat, Samant said all stakeholders have been instructed to get vaccinated at the earliest. “We also need to check the status of university hostels which were converted to Covid isolation centres,” he said. The minister said the government colleges of engineering had decreased fees by Rs 16,250, while state-run colleges like Vasantrao Naik Government Institute of Arts and Social Sciences (VNGIASS) and Institute of Forensic Science have slashed it by Rs1,000 and Rs 2,000, approximately. “For private colleges, the panel under IAS officer Chintaman Joshi would be suggesting a formula for reducing fees within 15 days. We have also released scholarship dues of Rs 301 crore to colleges, but I can’t comment on other departments like social welfare and OBC,” said Samant. Samant added that his department would provide Rs49 lakh to VNGIASS and Rs 1 crore to Government Institute of Science from district planning committee (DPC) funds. Reaction would follow action, Samant warns Rane On Union minister Narayan Rane’s arrest controversy, Uday Samant said any action by “them (Rane) would be followed by equal reaction everywhere”. “Shiv Sena will not tolerate attacks on CM Uddhav Thackeray. The entire state witnessed angry reactions when anyone disrespects the CM. Rane’s remarks would affect the CM and Sena, and it would grow in Konkan,” he said. On speculations about BJP-Sena coming together after opposition Devendra Fadnavis met Thackeray behind closed doors, the minister said they abide by their head’s decisions. “They are likely to have discussed the current pandemic situation and reservation issue of OBCs and Marathas,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/mht-cet-dates-to-be-declared-in-4-days-samant/articleshow/85723776.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The state continued to add under 5,000 cases, while the city added nearly 400 cases. The state counted 4,831 new cases and 126 deaths, taking the total cases to 64.52 lakh and the death toll to 1,37,026 since the arrival of the novel coronavirus in March last year. Cases in the city continued to rise for the fourth consecutive day, with 391 new cases registered. The test positivity rate stood at 1% after several weeks of ranging between 0.7% and 0.9%. “We are still doing a sizable number of Covid-19 tests daily. But the rise could just be the result of reducing the restrictions,” BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said. The average number of Covid-19 tests in the city has been 35,000 per day, with the BMC stepping up testing on certain days to take it to around 50,000. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government task force on Covid-19, said that genomic surveillance in the city had shown that there were only three main strains in circulation here, namely, Delta, Kappa and Delta-plus. “There is no novel strain that could pose a big threat right now. However, we do need to be on our guard and avoid visiting all crowded places, and observe behaviour that is Covid-appropriate,’’ Dr Joshi said. Four new Covid-19 deaths were registered in the city, taking the death toll to 15,972 since the beginning of the pandemic here. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said that the slight rise in cases in some of the districts was concerning and it was feared that this increase would intensify and turn into a third wave. He appealed to the public to follow all Covid-19 protocols during the festive season. He directed the administration not to let its guard down and to take preventive steps to reduce the severity of the third wave. Active cases in the state and city increased slightly. The total active cases in the state rose to 51,821, of which 3,406 were in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-new-cases-remain-under-5000-in-state-and-400-in-city-amid-uptick/articleshow/85725965.cms||---
---||Trichy||Trichy bus terminus estimated to cost Rs 460cr||Trichy: Trichy corporation has estimated the approximate cost of the integrated bus terminus project (IBT) proposed for the city in the recently tabled revised state budget at Rs 460 crore. The urban local body has finalised about 115.68 acres of the corporation’s land in two revenue villages of Panjappur locality on Trichy-Madurai national highway for the project. A truck terminal is most likely to be included in the project making use of the ample land available.Official sources said that out of the 575 acres of its own land available at Panjappur, the city corporation has okayed a portion adjacent to the Trichy-Madurai NH falling under four different survey numbers in K Sathanur and Pirattiyur (East) villages. The integrated terminus will have separate space to halt city buses and long-distance SETC and omnibuses. A truck terminal, which was a long-pending demand of the city, is likely to be incorporated in the IBT. As a network of highways including Trichy-Pudukottai, Trichy-Dindigul and Trichy-Chennai are accessible from the proposed site, the civic body said that the vast area available was ideal for a truck terminal. According to a study conducted by Trichy corporation, around 15,000 trucks enter Trichy every day to reach various districts in the state. It also found that the existing Central bus stand was estimated to handle 2,245 buses and 7,975 services a day and caters to over a lakh floating population. Spread over 6.6 acres, it was last expanded in 2006 and now reels under space crunch.Taking such data into account, the proposed IBT will have a commercial complex, two-wheeler and four-wheeler parking lot beside adequate bus bays. A fuel station and cold storage facility were additionally proposed as the truck terminal is planned. Corporation sources said that the area earmarked was selected considering future expansion needs as the city’s population is growing at 11.45% per decade. Administrative offices and supportive infrastructure including a police station, fire service station and post office were among the infrastructure planned alongside IBT at Panjappur. With the initial investment estimated at Rs 460 crores and an area of over 100 acres, IBT will be the most expensive and largest project taken up by Trichy corporation. “We are exploring multiple opportunities available to implement the bus stand proposal in the best possible way,” corporation commissioner P M N Mujibur Rahuman told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/trichy-bus-terminus-estimated-to-cost-rs-460cr/articleshow/85725895.cms||Deepak Karthik

As per the figures, the department has earned a revenue of Rs 4,685 crore between April and August. This is Rs 1,374 crore higher than the previous fiscal year 2020-21 and Rs 1,031 crore higher than 2019-2000. In April, the department earned highest revenue of Rs 1,156 crore. Excise commissioner Joga Ram said, “Keeping a check on illegal sale of liquor from other states, including Haryana, is one of the major reasons to boost revenue. Providing incentives to the shopkeepers and reducing beer prices were also few factors.” The highest revenue of Rs 461 crore was recorded in Jaipur city. Surprisingly, Alwar surpassed the revenue of many tourist cities and earned second highest revenue of Rs 296 crore. Jodhpur and Udaipur managed to earn the revenue of Rs 274 crore and Rs 228 crore, respectively. Similarly, Jaipur division too tops the chart in the state after earning a revenue of Rs 1,293 crore. It was followed by Jodhpur division, where revenue of Rs 912 crore was earned. Ajmer division earned Rs 611 crore and stood third. After making amendments in the policy (2021- 2022), the excise department organised the e-auction for the first time, instead of allotting shops through lottery. Under the new policy, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and country-made liquor both are being sold in the same shop. In phase-1 on Wednesday, 3,262 bidders participated to bid for 1,669 shops including 81 from Jaipur. There are a total of 7,665 liquor stores in the state. The state government had expected to earn Rs 13,000 revenue in financial year 2021-2022. The department is hopeful it will surpass the target revenue. “Despite carrying out auction in 10 – phases, the department failed to attract buyers for 70 liquor shops.

---||Nagpur||Two scientists awarded patent for invention||Amravati: Dr Neeraj Ghanwate and Dr Prashant Thakare, a scientist duo from department of microbiology and department of biotechnology, respectively, of Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University have been awarded Indian patent for their invention. The method for rapid detection of Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) of antibiotics against bacterial pathogens earned them the Indian patent. Dr Thakare told TOI that the invention is related to colorimetric method for detection of MBEC of selected antibiotics against bacterial pathogens. “The method delivers quick result in 48 hours as against 66 to 120 hours taken by other methods,” he said, adding it gives 98% accurate results. A biofilm is an architectural colony of microorganisms, within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substance that they produce. Biofilm contains microbial cells adherent to one-another and to a static surface (living or non-living). Bacterial biofilms are usually pathogenic in nature and can cause hospital-acquired infections. According to experts, among all microbial and chronic infections, 65% and 80%, respectively, are associated with biofilm formation. Biofilm formation consists of many steps which start with attachment to a living or non-living surface that will lead to formation of micro-colony, giving rise to three-dimensional structures and ending up, after maturation, with detachment. The understanding of bacterial biofilm is important to manage and/or to eradicate biofilm-related diseases. For this, proper dose of antibiotic is required to be administered to patient and the invention of Amravati scientists will help in this. While Dr Ghanwate is assistant professor in microbiology department, Dr Thakare is associate professor in biotechnology department. Both are working at Covid-19 molecular diagnostic lab at the university and have tested to date over 4 lakh samples. Both are working on various research projects funded by Rajiv Gandhi Science and Technology Commission, Mumbai, and other funding agencies. Their research papers are published in reputed journals of Nature Publishing Group.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/two-scientists-awarded-patent-for-invention/articleshow/85723837.cms||---

This is Rs 1,374 crore higher than the previous fiscal year 2020-21 and Rs 1,031 crore higher than 2019-2000. In April, the department earned highest revenue of Rs 1,156 crore. Excise commissioner Joga Ram said, “Keeping a check on illegal sale of liquor from other states, including Haryana, is one of the major reasons to boost revenue. Providing incentives to the shopkeepers and reducing beer prices were also few factors.” The highest revenue of Rs 461 crore was recorded in Jaipur city. Surprisingly, Alwar surpassed the revenue of many tourist cities and earned second highest revenue of Rs 296 crore. Jodhpur and Udaipur managed to earn the revenue of Rs 274 crore and Rs 228 crore, respectively. Similarly, Jaipur division too tops the chart in the state after earning a revenue of Rs 1,293 crore. It was followed by Jodhpur division, where revenue of Rs 912 crore was earned. Ajmer division earned Rs 611 crore and stood third. After making amendments in the policy (2021- 2022), the excise department organised the e-auction for the first time, instead of allotting shops through lottery. Under the new policy, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and country-made liquor both are being sold in the same shop. In phase-1 on Wednesday, 3,262 bidders participated to bid for 1,669 shops including 81 from Jaipur. There are a total of 7,665 liquor stores in the state. The state government had expected to earn Rs 13,000 revenue in financial year 2021-2022. The department is hopeful it will surpass the target revenue. “Despite carrying out auction in 10 – phases, the department failed to attract buyers for 70 liquor shops. Soon, auction in 11 phases will begin and revenue will increase once these shops are sold out too,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/excise-dept-earns-rs-4685-crore-in-5-months-of-fy22/articleshow/85729580.cms||---

The murder took place on Wednesday and the accused, Rishi Raj Sharma, was arrested on Friday. Police said Sharma had fled his Baldev Marg flat immediately after the crime as Shikha Sharma (32) lay motionless on the bed. To evade arrest he gave nearly 25 missed calls on Shikha’s phone as he moved around on Vatika Road, Narayan Vihar and Vande Mataram Road. According to sub-inspector Vandana Narula, Sharma then called up his father-in-law to say Shikha was not picking up his calls and requested him to check on her. Shikha’s worried parents arrived at her apartment and found her unconscious. They called up Sharma to come home immediately. The accused then staged a drama before his in-laws showing concern over his wife’s condition.The family first took Shikha to a nearby hospital in Mansarover where they refused to admit her. She was then taken to SMS Hospital where a medical expert hinted at suspected foul play. The expert suggested that someone had strangulated Shikha twice and ruled out the possibility of hanging. Police then turned their gaze on the victim’s husband. A medical examination revealed wire marks on his hands. A team including assistant sub-inspector Pooran Singh and constable Chandrapal Choudhary were roped in to investigate the matter and were sent to examine the crime scene. After cops confronted him, he began to reveal what had transpired on Wednesday evening. Sharma told police he had a heated argument with Shikha when she asked him to use a sanitiser. A few minutes later, Sharma allegedly pulled out a wire hanging in the room for drying clothes. When Shikha asked him what he was doing, he said the wire did not look good. When she resumed sewing her dress, the accused came from behind and strangulated her.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/trader-kills-wife-after-she-insists-he-sanitise-hands/articleshow/85725907.cms||---

With the carriageway already narrow, illegally parked vehicles along the road add to the problems of drivers. Rahul Jain, a resident of a housing society on Baner-Pashan Link Road, said the road was dug up a few months to lay pipelines. “After completing the work, the road was never properly restored. Only patch work was carried out and there are many spots where even that has not been done,” said Jain. Residents said that the entire road needs to be re-laid to ensure there are no uneven patches while fines must be imposed for illegal parking. Some people have also demanded increasing the width of the road from 9m to 18m in view of the heavy traffic on the stretch. Jain said the road is in terrible condition during heavy rain and two-wheelers can easily skid due to the uneven patches. “Regular travellers know where the speed breakers are but others may will find it hard to navigate because none of the speed bumps have markings,” said Jain. Rajendra Chutar, president of the Baner Pashan Link Road Residents Welfare Association, said there has been response despite repeated complaints to the PMC. “There have been cases of two-wheeler riders slipping and falling due to the poor patchwork,” said Chutar. He further said that the footpath along the road is broken while many streetlights are also not working, making it dangerous for pedestrians. “There are drainage covers that are broken as well. About 25 societies are there along the road, which connects two major areas — Baner to Pashan-Sus road — which means there is always heavy traffic,” said Chutar. Sandip Khalate, assistant municipal commissioaner of the Aundh Baner ward office, said that road work falls under the jurisdiction of the PMC headquarters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/driving-woes-galore-on-baner-pashan-link-road/articleshow/85723845.cms||Ardhra Nair

The protesters, who were former owners of the land, claimed that they are not willing to cede their property to the government which has planned to utilise the land for awarding free house site pattas to Adi Dravida community people from the adjoining villages.Police sources said that the state government a couple of decades ago had acquired around 2 acres of land from families residing in Adichanur village and compensation was transferred to the owners. However, the site was left unutilised by the authorities over the years. The revenue department officials were attempting to survey the land for utilising it to distribute free house site pattas. However, the land owners resisted by demanding higher compensation as per present day’s market value or preferred not to cede the land. On Saturday, as surveyors again approached the site with Udayarpalayam police, a section of villagers including four women identified as T Mekala, S Meenakshi, V Priya and K Vembu prevented the officials from entering the land. The women also attempted to immolate self, but they were secured by the police and sent to Ariyalur GH. Police said that the officials had completed the survey and pattas are likely to be awarded to the people soon. Officials added that the protesters had approached the court to annul the land acquisition, however, the court ruled in favour of the district administration a few years back.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/villagers-protest-against-land-survey-in-ariyalur/articleshow/85725913.cms||---

She said that the state’s biggest Suratgarh power plant has been closed along with six other power plants of 240 megawatts each. “These power plants are not receiving coal due to non-payment of dues by the government. The gross mismanagement is costing dearly to the citizens at several districts which are facing sudden power cuts along with farmers,” said Raje. Recalling the situation during her tenure, Raje says, “Never in my tenure, we faced the shortage of power supply in the state since we made all payments on time.” She said the state of increasing the energy and permanent charge but has not improved the condition. “Consumers are getting bills on the basis of average consumption rather than the reading. “Barring the technical issues, during my government, we were providing 24 hours power supply to almost all places including villages,” said Raje. Meanwhile, Raje paid a tribute to the former governor Kalyan Singh by visiting his native home in Aligarh earlier in the day. Raje said, “I was fortunate that during my government, Kalyan Singhji was the governor of the state and I consider myself fortunate to have worked under his guidance.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/power-mess-gross-mismanagement-by-govt-says-raje/articleshow/85725974.cms||---
---||Kochi||Local bodies moot revival of child protection panels||KOCHI: In the wake of various issues that exposed the vulnerability of children caught in difficult circumstances, authorities are mulling to revive child protection committees (CPC) set up at the local body levels. The focus is more at the panchayat and block panchayat level as several incidents involving children are being reported from the rural areas. On paper, the CPC has been constituted in 920 of the total 941 panchayats, but officials explain only 30% of these committees are active. With the amendment of the Juvenile Justice Act which also talks of the need for CPCs, these bodies are also expected to play the role of regulator. The committees will function under the integrated child development services (ICDS) with the panchayat president as chairperson and standing committee chairperson as vice-president. The ICDS supervisor will be the member secretary. But the highlight will be the presence of two child members in the 10-member committee. According to the officials, it is the mandate of the committee to do the vulnerability mapping of children in need of help and protection. The committee should also ensure that child rights are protected and information of related programmes and projects of the government are passed on to the people. They should ensure that child-friendly programmes are incorporated in the local budget. This will be duplicated in the block, municipalities and at the district level which will be headed by the collector. Officials said incidents of child abuse and suicides apart from instances of children being forced to drop out of schools for want of gadgets or internet connectivity due to the current online education system will come to the fore faster as all ward members would be made aware of the committee and its mandate. The plan is to ensure that people in the panchayat know who the members are so that it would work as an alert system. Complaint boxes would be set up in schools with the help of PTAs so that children can put in their issues without their identity being revealed in public. All issues will have to be reported to the child protection officers or district women and child department officers. The revival of CPCs is expected to tighten the several loopholes in the society which make children vulnerable to all kinds of abuse as well as enticing them into different acts of crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/local-bodies-moot-revival-of-child-protection-panels/articleshow/85723875.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Pune||Agharkar institute, lab to tap agri residue||Pune: Research and development start-up Sentient Labs has teamed up with city-based Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) to develop a technology to extract hydrogen from agricultural residues. “This breakthrough of generating hydrogen from unutilised agricultural residue will help us to become self-reliant on energy resources. It will also add a major stream of revenue to the farmer community,” said Ravi Pandit, chairman, Sentient Labs. The developers of the technology explained that the hydrogen fuel generation process comprises the use of cellulose and hemicellulose-rich agricultural residue, such as those of paddy, wheat, or maize, with microbial cultures, generating hydrogen directly from the residues. The methane generated in the process can also be used to generate additional hydrogen, they added. “Our technology is 25% more efficient as compared to conventional anaerobic digestion processes used today. The two-stage process eliminates the pre-treatment of biomass, thus making the process economical and environment friendly. This process generates digestate rich in nutrients which can be used as fertilizer,” said Prashant Dhakephalkar, director of the ARI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/agharkar-institute-lab-to-tap-agri-residue/articleshow/85723828.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Officials said the accident happened due to a technical snag in the hydraulic jack when construction workers were lifting a girder (precast concrete block) between the pillars. The flyover is being constructed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The incident happened around 4.30pm when workers were in the process of interlocking the I-girder on top of the flyover. Only two workers — Akash Singh and Saroj Kumar — were engaged in the task of handling the hydraulic jack and lift used for lifting the girder. Saroj Kumar was on the road operating the jack while Akash Singh was standing atop the concrete structure. There was an unexpected oil leak in the pipe connecting the hydraulic jack below and the lift on the top, resulting in inconsistency in the oil pressure in the machine. Soon, one side of the girder tilted and fell due to the imbalance, resulting in the huge structure coming crashing down. Akash’s hand got stuck in it and was severed as he also plunged down. He suffered multiple fractures and was rushed to Government Rajaji Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Saroj had a narrow escape as he managed to move away. The portion that collapsed was part of the flyover’s arm connecting the service road. No damage was caused to the main flyover. Since vehicle movement where the accident took place was blocked with construction materials, there was no other incidents. The 7.3-km-long flyover is part of the Rs 1,200 crore Madurai-Natham four-lane highway which will reduce the distance between Madurai and Trichy and Chennai by 22 kms. Construction of the flyover at Rs 694crore began in November 2018 and was to be completed by November 2020 but the pandemic is among the reasons cited for the delay in completion. Finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan dismissed rumours that the bridge collapsed. “It is a workplace accident that unexpectedly took place at the construction site,” he told reporters and added that it was due to a broken hydraulic jack. Madurai city police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha said a case will be registered under section 304A of IPC for causing death due to negligence and they are investigating. “GMC has taken the contract. We are conducting inquiries with the immediate field supervisor and project manager,” he told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/1-dies-as-part-of-a-flyover-under-construction-in-madurai-crashes/articleshow/85723851.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Bhavina Patel, the middle child of Hasmukh Patel, a utensil shop owner in Mehsana, made history by becoming the first para paddler from India to secure a medal at the Summer Paralympics. “We are proud of her achievements. We were hooked to the results and when we got to know that she had won, it was an exhilarating feeling. We know that she’ll bring Gold with her never-say-die attitude,” said the proud father. Tejal Lakhia, her mentor at BPA during her formative years, echoed the sentiment. “I had a word with her after the game. She was exhausted, but excited. She had a cold, but said she would give her 100% and would surely win. That’s her strength – she will find a way to change the game,” she said. All the laurels didn’t come easy for Bhavina. She was diagnosed with polio at about 18 months old and needed crutches to walk. In fact, she started getting independent once she got enrolled at ITI for a diploma in computer applications at BPA in Ahmedabad. She also did several jobs while studying to sustain herself and not burden her family. “She had taken up TT as a co-curricular activity as she had no prior experience of any game. But winning bronze in her very first tournament in 2008 became a huge confidence booster for her and she never looked back,” said Lakhia, principal of ITI. Bhavina was showered with compliments from almost all Union ministers, politicians, sportspersons and celebrities after her historic win on Saturday. Married to a para cricketer from Gujarat, Bhavina will usher in an era of para sports, players and coaches believe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/her-golden-day-bhavina-patels-journey-from-mehsana-to-tokyo/articleshow/85727560.cms||Parth Shastri

Tejal Lakhia, the principal of the ITI at Blind People’s Association (BPA), said that such wheelchairs need to be agile and lighter compared to the standard ones. “While she’s using a foreign-made wheelchair now, the earlier wheelchairs for both the players were designed right at BPA based on the design details available,” she said. She also remembered the blessings given by the then CM Narendra Modi in 2009 to the girls after their selection for Commonwealth Games 2010. Dinesh Bahl, coordinator at BPA, said that Sunil Parmar, the workshop designer at BPA, had made the wheelchairs which would otherwise cost lakhs of rupees. “The chairs need to be below the table-tennis table, but the height must be such that the chairs don’t touch the table,” he said. “Thus, a table was set up at one of the buildings based on international requirements.” On Saturday, the entire BPA community erupted in joy when it became apparent that Bhavina would play the final on Sunday. The officials said that BPA managed to find donors and sponsors over the year so that both the players could participate in open challenges and improve their rankings. Sonal will join Bhavina for the doubles competition soon and the duo is confident of winning in the category too. “Hopefully Patel’s medal on Sunday will change society’s attitude towards para games and more funding and infrastructure will be available to the players,” said a para athlete from the city. Congratulations Bhavina Patel! You played excellently. The entire nation is praying for your success and will be cheering for you... Give your best and play without any pressure. Your accomplishments inspire the entire nation. PM Narendra Modi Bhavina Patel from Mehsana has entered the finals in Tokyo Paralympics.

---||Mumbai||Govt school teachers are the unsung warriors of this pandemic||With his primary role as a school teacher set aside, Praveen Yadav from Nalaspora, buckling under the pressure of balancing online classes with frontline work through the pandemic, does not want his vocation to be celebrated on September 5, a day to honour teachers. “If the teaching fraternity has to tackle mistrust, allegations, harsh treatment and punishment while serving at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19, then what is it that we are celebrating?” he asks. Like every war that has its unsung heroes, government school teachers in the state see themselves as the unsung ‘Covid warriors’ of the raging pandemic even as warlike metaphors became a compelling tool for the government to marshal them at the frontlines to fight an unseen enemy. While more than 25,000 teachers from civic and government-aided schools in the state have been shouldering as much responsibility as frontline workers through the Covid waves — fielding calls at war rooms, enforcing protocol in containment zones, going door-to-door to identify Covid infected patients, manning quarantine centres in prison, controlling liquor shop rush and currently stationed at railway kiosks to verify vaccine certificates of train travellers — their role as a frontliner are getting short shrift. Since July last year — as the coronavirus continued to course through the city and people worked from their safe bubbles — Hema Makwana, teacher at a municipal school in Jogeshwari has filled a number of roles alongside her teaching duties. First, keeping track of infected families at a quarantine centre in Andheri, next screening oxygen and temperature levels of residents as part of BMC’s ‘My Family My Responsibility’ initiative before attending SOS calls at a war room. “Teachers are assigned these tasks probably because they’re seen as perfectionists. To serve my nation in crisis is important to me, too. Yet why are we being threatened and penalised?” asks Makwana describing the time when her 75-year-old father had taken ill and she had pleaded for leave. “As the only caregiver for my parents I requested that I be allowed to resume duties as soon as my father recovers but was told that I’d be served a ‘leave without pay’ notice and might even be suspended. They call us nation builders but don’t give us the respect or recognition.” The Disaster Management Act (DDMA) 2005, authorises the government to deploy its teaching personnel on various administrative duties. But the state’s efforts to mitigate the Covid crisis and make up for staffing shortage by roping in a readymade army of teachers that government schools easily provide has underlined the reduced status of teachers who were sent to Covid frontlines — without training, protective equipment or pay — and penalised, suspended or handed show cause notices warning disciplinary action under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, DDMA Act, 2005, and the Indian Penal Code for failing to show up at duty. “At least 90 municipal teachers were served ‘leave without pay’ notices and their salaries deducted and around 50 were suspended. Among them were many who had gone back to their hometowns after lockdown and were unable to return due to non-availability of public transport. The punitive actions were cruel and unjust,” stressed KK Singh, general secretary of the BMC Shikshak Sabha that made several appeals to the BMC education officer following which suspended teachers were reinstated but not their salary subtractions. “Covid duties were arbitrarily imposed on teachers, sometimes for 12 hours at a stretch with no weekly holidays. Even when someone asked for leave on human grounds, they were disregarded and teachers above 50 were not exempt despite medical problems. Isn’t this an abuse of their position?” *Akram Shaikh is one such teacher at an Urdu school in Byculla who was denied 15 days salary for not reporting at a war room assigned to him last year when he was 500 kms away from home in Buldhana taking care of his ailing grandmother. “I told the ward office to postpone my duty by a few days, not cancel it. Yet they ignored my plea and cut my pay.” For a year now, teachers’ unions in the state have been demanding that those actively involved in Covid-related duty be categorised as front line workers, granted vaccine priority and medical benefits but to no avail. “Till December 2020 teachers on Covid duty were paid Rs 300 per day but that too was discontinued. In around 25 schools in the West, North and South divisions of Mumbai, teacher salaries were deferred by two months. Many of these teachers were not only risking infection but also spending from their own pockets to commute, keep themselves safe and perform services to deal with the pandemic,” informed Shivnath Darade, general secretary of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad. “Instead of appealing to our sense of solidarity, they’re browbeating us into submission,” rues *Anand Bhide, a teacher living in Tiwala who was served a show cause notice earlier this month after he failed to respond to a call at night asking him to report at Ghatkopar railway station for vaccine verification duty at 7am the next morning. “Since I hadn’t received a written order, our headmaster asked me to wait for his confirmation the next morning. By afternoon, I was sent a memo warning disciplinary action for violating municipal service rules.” Even before the pandemic, government school teachers were battling lack of basic infrastructure and government apathy. Following digital transition — which was especially challenging for public schools — teachers being called away repeatedly, without warning and for long spells, has meant that they’re unable to schedule lessons or maintain continuity for the few students that manage to log in. “If we don’t do school work, the headmaster is angry. If we don’t report for duty, we’re penalised. It’s humiliating,” says Makwana. Some complained of the sheer stress of balancing online classes before and after long Covid duty hours. For Bhide the “constant anxiety” of managing a health crisis while keeping himself and his family virus free affected his ability to teach. “How long can a teacher do jobs other than teaching?” he asks. “As government servants we’re in the habit of saying ‘it’s okay’ to everything,” says Makwana. “But are we okay?” (* Names changed on request)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/govt-school-teachers-are-the-unsung-warriors-of-this-pandemic-in-mumbai/articleshow/85727562.cms||Mohua Das

---||Hyderabad||After Ramappa, eyes on Deccan Sultanate for heritage tag||Hyderabad: Eleven years ago, the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh government had submitted a proposal before the International Council for Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) of the Unesco seeking the world heritage tag for Hyderabad’s Qutub Shahi monuments – the Charminar, Golconda Fort and Qutub Shahi tombs. This was sent on September 10, 2010 under the “cultural” category; four years before the draft dossier of Ramappa Temple was prepared. But while Ramappa’s case was vigorously pursured, thereafter, the Hyderabad file was left to gather dust. Unsuccessful, four years later in 2014 – only months before Telangana was formed -- the government opted for a broader tag covering the Deccan Sultanate. Of the five that comprise the Deccan Sultanate two are in Karnataka (Bijapur and Bidar), one in Telangana (Golconda-Hyderabad) and two in Maharashtra (Ahmednagar and Berar). But as the state government joined hands with Karnataka, the monuments in Maharashtra were left out. Though the proposal was floated, this time too, the government did not make any attempt at pushing the case. Also, strangely, while it argued in 2010 that the monuments of Hyderabad meet at least four of the 10 criteria listed by Unesco for the heritage tag, it had settled for only two criteria when it included the monuments of Karnataka. The 2010 proposal was in detail, while the one submitted in 2014 was brief. Six years on, heritage activists are skeptical about the broader tag for Deccan Sultanate becoming a frontrunner owing change in government in Karnataka. They argue that given the stance of the neighbouring state on Tipu Sultan, Telangana government may find it hard to convince it on the monuments of Barid Shahi and Adil Shahi dynasties. It’s prudent for Telangana to go for it, alone. “Hyderabad has everything that the Unesco requires to grant the heritage tag. What the city lacks is a scientific conservation plan and proper lobbying. Hyderabad is as vibrant as it was in the past. The city’s heritage is not just about its monuments. It has a glorious heritage of cuisine, fabrics, arts, music, architecture, and military fortification. Its antiquarian, botanical, aquatic and cultural heritage is second to none,” says INTACH city convener P Anuradha Reddy. The government also needs lobby more aggressively with ICOMOS officials and member countries to get the heritage tag, adds city historian Mohammad Safiullah. "The monuments in Hyderabad are in bad shape. They require scientific conservation and international facelift. All the encroachments should be removed, and buffer zones created,” the head of the Deccan Heritage Trust, told TOI. Safiullah regretted that there has been no proper ground work since the dossier was submitted. He said in fact the first attempt was made way back in 2001, though a formal request was made in 2010.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/after-ramappa-eyes-on-deccan-sultanate-for-heritage-tag/articleshow/85726029.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Pune||Pune: NHAI initiates steps to plug potholes at Chandni Chowk||PUNE: Regular commuters can expect some respite from traffic snarls while travelling through the busy Chandni Chowk area as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has initiated steps to repair potholes that have cropped up along the stretch. Further, at least 25 traffic wardens are to be appointed to manage traffic flow along the stretch where the flyover work is underway. About 22% work on the project has been completed so far and this is expected to ease vehicular traffic in the area. The plan includes provision of access roads towards Pirangut Road, Bavdhan and Paud road towards the city, besides a flyover. The ongoing work has been causing traffic snarls on the entire stretch of Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, especially during the rush hours. Regular commuters have sought deployment of more traffic police staff at key junctions on the stretch. Taking cognizance of the hardships faced by commuters, Kothrud MLA and BJP state president Chandrakant Patil recently conducted visits at the site and asked Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and NHAI officials as well as traffic police officers to initiate measures. Patil stated that the potholes must be repaired within eight days and sought provision of other measures to avoid chaos at the junction. An official from NHAI said necessary steps are being planned to streamline the traffic and push works ahead. “Repairing of potholes will now be done on a continuous basis although it is a tough task because the entire stretch witnesses huge flow of vehicles round the clock. We have been asked to repair potholes at key locations and install safety barricades at spots, where works are underway. In some sections, potholes will be repaired at night so as to avoid inconvenience to commuters,” official said. Meanwhile, some portion of land required for the project is yet to be handed over to NHAI. The NHAI authorities said that they were in talks with the PMC to get possession of the required land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/nhai-initiates-steps-to-plug-potholes-at-chandni-chowk/articleshow/85723863.cms||Sarang Dastane

While the district has administered the first dose to 64% of the target population, 33% of them have received the second dose as well. Out of a target population of 18 lakh in the district, 11,50,976 have been administered the first dose of the vaccine, and 3,79,489 have been administered the second dose, as on Saturday. The district has so far administered 15,30,465 doses of vaccines, said Dr B Rajesh, RCH officer, Dakshina Kannada. “We have achieved 100% of the target in inoculating frontline workers, by administering the first dose of vaccine to all the 15,854 beneficiaries from the police, revenue and other departments.

Similarly, the district has achieved 96.6% of the target, by administering the first dose of vaccine to 50,784 healthcare workers,” Dr Rajesh said. Though the vaccination drive began for healthcare workers in the first phase in January, as per official data, only 68% have received the second dose. The RCH officer said that most of the healthcare workers have already received the second dose, but the statistics show that only 68% of them have done so, as they have entered different contact numbers on the portal. Meanwhile, some of them have not taken the second dose, due to the breakthrough infection, he added. From the frontline workers category, nearly 54% have received the second dose. Meanwhile, 57% of the beneficiaries who are above 60, have received the second dose. The district has not made notable progress in the 45-60 and 18-44 categories. While nearly 78% of the beneficiaries in the 45-60 age group have received the first dose, 42% have received the second dose. Similarly, while 47% of the beneficiaries from the 18-44 category have received the first dose, only 13% have received the second dose. The RCH officer said that the vaccination drive will be intensified, as the government has started supplying more doses. “We have been receiving sufficient quantity of vaccine from the state government. We have administered 36,573 doses of vaccine on a single day on Friday, and 47,175 doses on Saturday,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/64-of-target-population-get-first-dose-of-vaccine-in-dk/articleshow/85722201.cms||Vinobha K T

---||Varanasi||Want accused to suffer same way mydaughter did: Rape victim's mother||Varanasi: The mother of the rape victim who immolated herself outside the Supreme Court on August 16 said on Monday that she wanted the accused to suffer the same way her daughter did. Speaking to the media for the first time after her daughter succumbed to her injuries a few days ago, she said that if the government wanted to ensure justice for her daughter it would have to pursue the case in court strongly against BSP MP Atul Rai as she was capable of doing so due to her poor financial condition. Coming back to her Ballia home after the last rites of her daughter in Delhi, she said: “I want capital punishment for the accused Atul Rai (BSP MP from Ghosi). I wish that he should die suffering the same kind of pain which my daughter suffered." Her daughter had filed a rape case against Rai in March 2019 in Varanasi. Calling upon the government to take forward the case, the complainant's mother said: “If there is a government and it wants justice for my daughter, it should pursue the case strongly. I am not capable of contesting the case. I can’t do anything if no justice is done to her,” she said. “I came to know that Atul Rai had committed something wrong with my daughter when he came to my house after lodging a case to threaten us. He said that he had helped my daughter a lot.” Though the police have provided security cover to the family, the complainant’s mother said, “Now, I am not afraid of anyone as I have already lost my daughter, who struggled a lot for justice against a strongman but failed to get it as the voice of the poor remains unheard.” Mentioning that her daughter was talented and cared for her siblings, she said that she had been studying to make a decent career. The complainant never talked to her over phone out of fear but made a few WhatsApp calls, she added. After the complainant’s mother and brother returned from Delhi, Ballia SP Rajkaran Nayyar sent a deputy SP to their place to meet them on Friday. Nayyar told TOI on Saturday, “In view of the family’s security concerns, a police picket has been deployed near their house.” The complainant had lodged rape case against Atul Rai with Lanka police in Varanasi on May 1, 2019. Rai contested 2019 Lok Sabha election as absconder on BSP-SP alliance ticket and after emerging victorious he surrendered before the court. Since then he is in Naini jail. The case was in progress at MP-MLA court Prayagraj. On August 16, the complainant and her associate who was also the prime witness in the case immolated themselves outside the Supreme Court in Delhi after levelling serious allegations against senior police officials, retired IPS Amithabh Thakur, serving IPS officer Amit Pathak and others through livestreaming on Facebook. The witness succumbed to injuries at RML hospital on August 21 while the complainant also died on August 24. Large number of police officials including DIG Amit Pathak faced action in this episode while former Thakur was arrested in Lucknow on Friday on the charges of abetment of suicide of the rape victim and prime witness following submission of report by SIT formed by state government following their self-immolation. According to district government counsel (criminal), Prayagraj, Gulab Chand Agrahari, jailed MP’s lawyer had submitted a plea before MP-MLA court demanding further investigation in the case on Friday. “I strongly opposed it mentioning that they don’t have locus standi. The court has fixed September 2 as the next date of hearing in this case," added Agrahari. The statement of the complainant, her friend and seven other witnesses have already been recorded before the MP-MLA court and now recording the statement of the accused was due, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/want-accused-to-suffer-same-way-mydaughter-did-rape-victims-mother/articleshow/85726042.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Dr Bhandari said the chief minister will most probably discharged on Sunday. “Chief minister had successful angioplasty and stenting on August 27. He is recovering well. All protocol follow-up tests were done and they are normal. A team of doctors have been looking after him. He is in good health and cheerful condition. He will probably be sent home tomorrow,” said a health bulletin issued by the hospital. A day after undergoing angioplasty, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said he was unable to go among people for the past many days as he was suffering from post-Covid complications. Thanking people who prayed for his recovery, Gehlot said, “I could not take proper rest as advised by doctors. Due to this, I was having post-Covid problems for so long. This is why I was unable to be among people of the state.” Gehlot had been targeted by the Opposition for some time for apparently not leaving his residence to meet people. The chief minister further said he did not have cardiac issues before, and as per doctors, it was a post-Covid effect. Doctors say Covid has varied effects on people. It affects organs like the heart, brain, kidney, liver etc. Even after recovering from it, problems like headache, exhaustion and breathlessness persist, and so both Covid and post-Covid should be taken seriously, the chief minister added in the statement. He underwent angioplasty, a procedure to open clogged arteries, at the SMS Hospital in Jaipur on Friday. He had 90 per cent blockage in one of the three main arteries. He asked people to follow Covid protocols, including mask, social distancing and hand washing seriously and get themselves vaccinated on time. The chief minister also urged people to consult a doctor if they have any symptoms after recovering from Covid as even the slightest negligence can be serious.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cm-fine-post-angioplasty-may-be-discharged-from-hosp-today/articleshow/85726048.cms||---

Such is the menace that when these swarms appear, fishermen avoid fishing as their nets are filled with these jellyfishes. This week too, jellyfish swarms were reported by fishermen in Thiruvananthapuram when they went to the sea after Onam. These swarms are noted during the monsoon season and stay on till the non-monsoon. “However, monsoons do not play a role in jellyfish increase. These are marine organisms, and hence their presence is directly related to the oceans and sea environment,” said Prof A Biju Kumar, head-department of aquatic biology, Kerala University. In a study published by a journal of marine biology research, five species of jellyfish that appeared in abundance on the Kerala coast have been documented. “Around 15 species have been seen in Kerala, but these five (Crambionella orsini, Lychnorhiza malayensis, Chrysaora caliparea, Netrostoma coerulescens and Cyanea nozaki) are in abundance. “We were looking at the relationship between the chemical components in the water when they appeared. There is a direct correlation between salinity, phosphate, silicate and chlorophyll-a content in water as well as the pH and sea surface temperatures (SST),” he said. The study, which looked at the trawler catches for four years from 2016-2019, found an abundance of the four species - Lychnorhiza malayensis, Chrysaora caliparea, Netrostoma coerulescens and Cyanea nozaki - increased with phosphate, silicate and chlorophyll-a content and decreased with pH and SST. In contrast, the abundance of Crambionella orsini increased with an increase in sea surface salinity and decreased with an increase in dissolved oxygen. Biju Kumar said that it was important to understand the toxic behavior also. “People have reported wounds when they touch the jellyfish. It is a predator and releases a toxin that causes itching and wounds in people prone to allergies. Internationally where people go swimming in seas, a jellyfish swarm is a warning for people to stay away and even leads to the closure of beaches. “We need to understand the toxic nature of the jellyfish, which is also affecting the marine catch,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/jellyfish-influx-worries-fisherfolk/articleshow/85723911.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Mumbai||Covid concerns loom as Maharashtra festival season starts on Monday||MUMBAI: Ahead of the festival season, which begins on Monday with Janmashtami, a sense of deja vu has gripped the city’s public healthcare experts and doctors.It was in September 2020 that the worst peak of the first wave began just days after Ganpati Bappa bid adieu to the city in the last week of August. The fortnight before the Ganpati festival, in the third week of August in 2020, the state had registered 1.7 lakh Covid cases, while the fortnight after the festival added 2.5 lakh cases -- a jump of nearly 50%. A year later, the decline in the Covid second wave has led to easing of most Covid-19-related norms, which has led to a slight rise in daily cases in the city for the last four consecutive days: after almost two weeks of registering less than 300 cases daily, the BMC registered 391 cases on Saturday, and 362, 398 and 342 cases on the previous days. However, the total cases added in the state and the city since the opening up has not been significant. The state added over 81,000 cases in the first 14 days of August, which has dipped to 64,401 from August 15 to 28, while the number of cases in the city has been almost the same at around 4,000. Read AlsoNew Covid cases remain under 5,000 in Maharashtra and 400 in Mumbai amid uptickThe number of Covid-19 cases detected in the state and city increased slightly on Saturday. The state continued to add under 5,000 cases, while the city added nearly 400 cases.The fear of the third wave has led the Central health ministry to issue a directive to states to keep a tight check during the festive season, which begins with Janmasthami on Monday and continues with the Jain festival Paryushan (September 3 to 10) and Ganpati (September 10 to 19) till Diwali on November 4. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday yet again appealed to people to ensure that the health of the people is prioritised over festivities. “The state has already issued advisories regarding the protocols to be followed during the festive season. The threat of Covid-19 is still there and so all political, social and religious groups must follow government-issued norms,” said Thackeray in response to the Centre’s advisory. The state government has downsized the festivals even this year, cancelled dahi handi events, and is yet to open up religious places officially. Read AlsoCentre tells Maharashtra govt to consider local curbs in festive seasonEven as Maharashtra and Mumbai reported a slight decline in daily cases on Friday, the Centre asked the state government to consider imposing local restrictions on mass events and public gatherings during the upcoming festive season to prevent the spread of Covid-19. A doctor pointed out that the easing of restrictions has been to a “higher degree” this time around as compared to September 2020: more people have approval for train travel and there is no restriction on intra-city or district travel. However, a senior state government official said that the key difference between this year and last year is that the vaccine coverage in Mumbai has been significant and it is likely that it will help keep the cases low. Read AlsoMumbai: Third Covid wave not expected to be as big as second, says BMCThe third Covid-19 wave is imminent and could begin as early as next month, coinciding with the festive season, according to BMC officials. The silver lining, though, is the third wave may not be as “big” as the second when the number of active Covid-19 cases had touched 91,000 in April, said BMCBut BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare isn’t perturbed. She said the four-day rise is very slight and could be linked to the unlocking. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, said that the trend should be watched for a few days before an alarm is raised. “A slight increase due to unlocking is expected. The testing positivity rate is around 1%, and that is good,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/covid-concerns-loom-as-maharashtra-festival-season-starts-on-mon/articleshow/85726128.cms||Malathy Iyer

If this continues, adequate measures will be taken to bring down cases,” Sameeran said while inspecting the Walayar check post on Kerala border.Out of the 42,000-odd cases reported across the country, 32,000 were reported in neighbouring Kerala. Considering the increase in cases, check posts bordering Kerala have been put on high alert. Officials are strictly monitoring those entering the district from Kerala at 13 places and only those with RT-PCR negative certificate or those who have taken two doses of Covid vaccine are allowed to enter Coimbatore. Only those travelling for medical emergencies are exempted, but they have to undergo RT-PCR test.Over one lakh vaccine doses were administered to those who frequently travel to Kerala for occupational purposes in recent days.As colleges will reopen on September 1, the district administration is in talks with Palakkad and Malappuram district administrations to vaccinate students of Coimbatore-based colleges. “If they have taken their first dose in Kerala, they will be administered a second dose at the college,” the collector said.As many as 22.20 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in the district so far and 71% of vaccines were offered though government facilities. More vaccination camps will be conducted in the coming days, where preference will be given to those due for their second dose, Sameeran added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/more-curbs-likely-if-cases-rise-again/articleshow/85723879.cms||---

And his ambition and determination enabled him to join the BA History course at UC College, Aluva, last year amid the pandemic braving all the financial and social challenges faced by his family. But Ayyappan, who is in the second year, is now on the verge of becoming a college dropout as digital divide plays a villain in online education. His settlement in Thuduky, Attapadi, has no access to telecom networks or the internet. Ayyappan is one among the many tribal college students in Attapadi who are thinking of stopping their education due to the digital divide. Most of them wish the colleges to reopen so that they can at least stay at the hostel and study. Ayyappan, who completed SSLC in 2013, could not enrol for Plus One due to financial and other difficulties in his family. So he started working at a shop in Thavalam, much far away from his house located in the deep forest, to help his parents Pazhani and Lakshmi, who struggle to meet both ends due to various ailments. However, his passion for studying made him resume his schooling and join higher secondary at Model Residential School Malampuzha. “I became a school dropout after SSLC for nearly five years until I decided to resume studies. My parents and brothers supported me, asked me to forget all problems and study when I joined the degree course. But now, it is very difficult for me to continue my studies online. I have not submitted any assignments so far as there is no connectivity. Though I shifted my stay to my aunt’s place in Kottiyarkandi, the connectivity is pathetic. I have not attended even a single online class smoothly. I have to travel to the town if I want to download the notes shared on Whatsapp,” Ayyappan said. Though he stays with his aunt, he has to go to his house carrying provisions at least once every two weeks as his parents cannot travel. “I have to spend at least Rs 800 for the 45-minute-long jeep journey to Mukkalil and then take an 8km trek to Thuduky. Once I reach home, I will be completely cut off from the network till I return. There are many college students in Attappadi, and most of them are completely off the grid. Online education is not a feasible option for people like us,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/this-tribal-student-is-on-the-verge-of-dropping-out/articleshow/85723954.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

According to the city residents, the ban was implemented in letter and spirit initially, bringing about a noticeable change in their surroundings. All the government agencies had also then taken up a flurry of awareness campaigns on the need to embrace eco-friendly carry bags and stop using single-use plastic bags.The residents said they were encouraged to use cloth bags for shopping groceries and other items when the ban was implemented strictly. “When Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, officials stopped cracking down on the shops using or selling banned plastic items. As a result, single-use plastic bags have made a strong come back. Traders are not asking us to carry cloth bags with us nowadays,” said one of the residents.The increased use of banned plastic bags is reflected in the waste generation as well. Used plastic bags could be seen dumped on roadsides, bins and drains. Plastic waste clogging storm water drains and channels is a common sight in the city.G Amutha, a resident of Nanjundapuram, said shopkeepers were not using plastic items after the ban for fear of being caught and penalized by corporation officials. “When the officials stopped special drives to keep a tab on the use of such items, shopkeepers are widely using them, polluting the city.”Referring to the rampant use of banned plastic bags, Sheik Saleem, a resident of Ukkadam, said all the good work by the officials for months together had gone into the drain. “It will now require another round of awareness drives to curb its usage.”A fancy storekeeper from Gandhipuram said while many alternatives to the single-use plastic bags were in place, they were all costly. “We used to offer cloth bags, but our customers don’t want to pay extra for that. So, we are forced to use single-use plastic bags again.”A health official with the city corporation said they were checking the usage of banned plastic bags whenever they inspect shops to ensure adherence to Covid-19 protocols. “More importance will be given to the enforcement of plastic ban in the coming days.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/banned-plastic-makes-a-comeback/articleshow/85723910.cms||V Devanathan

The project, Nectar of Life, was implemented at the hospital in association with the Rotary Club of Coimbatore Cotton City.The bank will collect milk donated by lactating mothers, pasteurize it and then deep freezes it for storage. “When mothers are unable to lactate due to several reasons, they resort to formula or animal milk and the child is unable to get the benefit of breast milk. This bank will help babies, whose mothers cannot breastfeed them,” a doctor said.The bank will benefit premature babies kept in neonatal intensive care unit, who lack strength to drink milk and those who have lost their mother. The project will help reduce risk of infections and boost immune system of such babies.“The milk bank will provide a welcoming space for lactating mothers across the city, who can donate extra milk. We will provide milk free-of-cost to all the babies in need,” said P Sukumaran, dean and medical director of the hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/pvt-hospital-sets-up-breast-milk-bank/articleshow/85723905.cms||---

She was responding to speculations over allies-turned-rivals BJP and Shiv Sena coming together after leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis held a closed door talks with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “I do not drink instant coffee. I give some time before reacting on any subject. If politicians cutting across party lines are meeting each other and keeping up good relations, it’s a good sign. Political differences and personal relations are two different things. Even I have learnt this from former CM Yashwantrao Chavan who used to share cordial relations with all leaders,” she said after her arrival at the airport here. The daughter of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, however, asserted that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) would not only complete its entire term but would also continue to serve the people for next 25 years. On Enforcement Directorate (ED) notice to former home minister Anil Deshmukh and other leaders, the Baramati MP said that the country had never witnessed such a blatant misuse of power. “Whenever opposition parties try to raise their voices, the government uses agencies like ED to pressurize them. Conspiracies are being hatched in non-BJP ruled states to conduct raids, send notices and detain people for questioning.” Speaking on MPCC chief Nana Patole’s announcement of going alone in the civic polls, Sule said that deputy CM Ajit Pawar had already clarified their party’s stand on the issue. “Everyone has right to expand his/her party,” she said. Slamming Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government’s decision to “privatize the public sector units (PSUs)”, she said that profit making companies should be spared from it. “For the last two and half years, the centre hasn’t released MP development funds. It was only due to proper planning by the MVA government that work is going on smoothly in state,” she said. On OBC reservation, the MP said that the MVA was committed to providing the benefits and at all party meeting convened by the CM, everyone extended their support. She said that a positive decision is likely to be announced by next Friday.” Speaking on the Ganga-Jamuna area issue, Sule said that the problems should be solved by discussions involving all stakeholders. The Baramati MP would be visiting Sevagram Ashram in Wardha on Sunday for attending a workshop organized by a Delhi-based NGO, where she would be addressing the delegates. In the city, she met NCP city chief Duneshwar Pethe and other party workers from rural and urban areas at his home and held a series of meetings. BJYM blocks Sule’s convoy The BJYM activists tried to block NCP MP Supriya Sule’s convoy when it reached NCP city chief Duneshwar Pethe’s residence. They alleged that NCP’s Sayali Shendge was selected for a foreign university scholarship by violating the rules. BJP general secretary Balya Borkar, BJYM city president Parendra Patle, Sachin Karare, and other activists participated in the blockade.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/sule-doesnt-read-too-much-into-fadnavis-uddhav-meet/articleshow/85723917.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A senior official at AJL claimed that nearly 35% of the road network needs sprucing up. Earlier this month, a team had inspected more than 80 km of BRTS tracks to pinpoint basic road signages, thermoplastic markings, and cat eyes missing from the infrastructure. “The budget carry out repairs on the road and at the bus stands was postponed by seven months owing to Covid,” added the AJL official. To begin with, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has undertaken work of Rs 59 lakh to get basic road markings in place. “There is extensive repair work required in the corridors in the East and North zones where we do not get many passengers. The Central zone too, where the corridor bore a heritage look, lies dilapidated. At some stands, the infrared-based automatic doors do not function. At other stands, the turnstile will not open with the swipe card,” says the senior AMC official. From October onwards, authorities will focus on the second important aspect — traffic safety audit of the BRTS network — where experts will review safety issues at various junctions as well as road quality. They will also review the ITES services and maintenance chart for BRTS buses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/after-13-month-delay-brts-repairs-begin/articleshow/85727566.cms||---

The university had terminated the private study centres in the country and abroad in 2018 following a direction from the University Grants Commission that the distance education programmes should be offered only through the learner’s support centres with the affiliated colleges. Students were subsequently clueless about getting their degrees. In the absence of direct correspondence with them, the university had issued a public notice in June, asking the students to approach it directly to clear the dues or get readmission for their pending degree programmes. P E Thomas, director in-charge, school of distance education, said, “Many marksheets have been pending with the controller of examination department because of pending fees with the controller section or the study centres. Hence, we decided to issue the public notice, asking the students to contact the university directly.” He said they had cleared no due certificates of 3,000-odd students in the past two months and they were now eligible for their provisional certificates. “In addition, many students have received their mid-course marksheets to continue their studies. We are expecting more students to approach us in the coming weeks.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/bu-extends-helping-hand-to-distance-education-students/articleshow/85723953.cms||K Sambath Kumar

---||Kochi||Kerala state electricity board’s revenue dues jump to Rs 2,900 crore||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala state electricity board’s (KSEB) efforts to steer itself clear of the mounting losses have been seriously hit with the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The revenue dues from various organizations that had dropped to Rs 1,388 crore by March 31, 2019, through an extensive drive, has shot up and reached Rs 2,936 crore by June 30 this year, marking an increase of Rs 1,548 crore in just two years. As per the details of finances of the KSEB accessed by STOI, during the period of pandemic alone, the dues had increased by Rs 1,049 crore. Of the total dues, Rs 739.44 crore is from the Kerala water authority (KWA) alone. The KWA is supposed to pay Rs 27 crore every month to the KSEB. Though the dues of KWA were even more, the earlier dues were cleared by the government by splitting it into four instalments and allocating those in the state budget. Of the total dues, private entrepreneurs and organizations owe Rs 1,150 crore, domestic consumers Rs 698 crore, government institutions and PSUs Rs 993 crore and Union government institutions and Central PSUs Rs 80 crore. Also, of the total dues, Rs 528 crore are under litigation in various courts, which would mean that those can be recovered only after the cases are disposed of. When it comes to the revenue earnings of the KSEB, even though 76% of the total consumers are domestic consumers, only 37.51% of the income comes from this category. This is primarily because the majority of domestic consumers are within the category of 1 to 250 monthly slabs, in which the average bills are much lesser than the average cost of power supply, the finances show. While on one side the government has been announcing several measures, including waiving off fixed charges to the KSEB in the time of the pandemic, the KSEB is incurring more and more financial commitments by way of loans. As of now, the total loans availed by KSEB has increased by 72% from 2013-14 when it was Rs 5,261.11 crore to Rs 9,056.69 crore at present. The long-term loans shot up from Rs 1,431.51 crore to Rs 7,384.47 crore. While the net loss of KSEB as per the audit figures for 2018-19 and 2019-20 are Rs 290 crore and Rs 269.55 crore, respectively, the accumulated loss till 2019-20 is Rs 12, 104.43 crore, as per the documents. “The KSEB is meeting its present commitments through raising loans. Along with the ongoing pandemic crisis, it will be extremely difficult for the corporation to meet its commitments on its own in the future unless the dues are realized or the burden is passed on to the consumers or the government bails it out,” top government sources said. Power purchase and salaries and pensions of the employees form as much as 78% of the total expenses of the company. The Kerala state electricity regulatory commission had revised the power tariff four times since 2013-14, and the last time the power tariff was increased was in July 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/ksebs-revenue-dues-jump-to-rs-2900cr/articleshow/85723964.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Hotel occupancy back at pre-Covid levels, tariffs down||AHMEDABAD: Backed by a buoyant movement of corporates as well as leisure travellers, occupancies across hotels in Ahmedabad have improved over the past two months, gradually touching pre-pandemic levels. Despite revival, the average daily rate (ADR) of hotels in Ahmedabad remains under pressure. Estimates by hoteliers suggest that ADR of five-star hotels in Ahmedabad settled at Rs 3,200 per room per night in August, down 41% against Rs 5,500 per room per night in August 2019. “At least three new properties were launched in the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar market even after the pandemic, when the hospitality industry took a major hit. The city already had an over-supply situation. With fewer events and a bare minimum revival in corporate movement, the demand is not buoyant enough and therefore, ADR has taken a major hit,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat. With more supply and lesser demand, the market has become largely price driven, according to industry players. “Five-star properties are offering competitive rates to gain business after a slump over the past few months. Therefore, the ADRs have failed to pick up despite a buoyant demand,” Somani added. Hoteliers have also attributed the capped ADR to a slow revival in corporate movement. “After the second wave of Covid-19, bookings by corporate guests have slowly begun to pick up. Even though occupancy levels are up, the demand from corporate clients is picking up slowly with infrequent trips. The average daily rate is expected to take a hit till corporate movement revives fully,” said Deep Preet Bindra, general manager, Courtyard by Marriott. Over the previous months, hotel business in the city received a cushion from weddings for which hotels were preferred destinations. However, with no major muhurats till October, hoteliers are putting their best foot forward to woo corporate clients and leisure travellers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hotel-occupancy-back-at-pre-covid-levels-tariffs-down/articleshow/85727565.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Coimbatore||3, including constable, held for kidnapping former gold smuggler||Tirupur: The rural police arrested three people, including a police constable attached to the Coimbatore city police, for kidnapping a gold smuggler from Palladam on Friday.Police identified the victim as S Maheswaran, 33, of Thiruvadanai in Ramanathapuram district. He had been working as a driver for J Bhagya, 60, of Ammapalayam near Thirumuruganpoondi in Tirupur city for the last one-and-a-half-month. On Friday, Bhagya, her younger daughter and granddaughter went to Therpatti near Dharapuram in Tirupur. Maheswaran drove the car. Bhagya’s daughter got down at Therpatti. When Bhagya and her granddaughter were returning to Ammapalayam, Maheswaran’s friend Azhagarsamy contacted him over phone and asked to come to Palladam. When the car reached Palladam, a seven-member gang in three cars stopped them and abducted Maheswaran.District superintendent of police G Shashank Sai formed five special teams to nab the kidnappers. A team found one of the cars used for kidnapping at Keeranur in Dindigul district.“The kidnappers had kept Maheswaran at a farmland in Dindigul with his friends S Veeramani, 28 and O Azhagar, 33, who were kidnapped by the gang on Wednesday. The trio managed to escape on Friday,” a police officer said.“Maheswaran used to smuggle gold ingots from Sri Lanka for BJP leader Goodluck Rajendran of Ramanathapuram district. A year ago, he had to abandon 5kg gold ingots after he was pursued by men in khaki. Though he told Rajendran about the incident, the BJP leader did not believe him. When Yasser Arafat and Mohammed Rizwan of Ramanathapuram, who gave money to Rajendran to smuggle the ingots, demanded the contraband, Rajendran handed over Maheswaran to them. Maheswaran managed to escape from confinement two months ago and shifted to Tirupur city to work as a driver,” the officer added.To get back the gold from Maheswaran, Arafat and Rizwan had brought constable Rajeswaran with them to kidnap him. Palladam police arrested Rizwan and Arafat on Saturday and seized a car used for kidnapping. Police also arrested Rajeswaran for assisting the kidnappers. The trio was remanded in judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/3-including-constable-held-for-kidnapping-former-gold-smuggler/articleshow/85723932.cms||---

Dug up to lay underground drainage pipeline some eight months ago, the stretch that is yet to be relaid or repaired has become a nightmare for motorists. Podanur residents said the city corporation had completed the underground drainage work about two months ago. While the civic body has covered the pit with gravel, they said, it hasn’t done anything to repair the road that was completely damaged during the course of the work. The stretch that is used by several hundred people a day is in tatters for almost 2km from the rail over-bridge at Podanur. There is a school on the stretch and with just a few days to go for reopening of schools for high and higher secondary students, parents are scared to use the road. They have urged the civic body to repair or relay the road at the earliest to ensure a smooth ride. S Sreekala, a parent, said, “I had visited the school, where my daughters are studying, for an official work recently. The entire stretch is posing a threat to commuters. Two-wheeler riders have to be extra careful, otherwise they might fall off the vehicle. I am scared to take my daughters to the school through the stretch.”P Velayutham, a grocery storekeeper at Podanur, confirmed there were incidents of people falling off their two-wheelers. “Two months have lapsed since the dug-up areas were covered with gravel. It’s high time that the city corporation relaid the road.” L Shanmugam, another resident, said dust would envelop the entire area whenever a heavy vehicle would pass by the area. “We are facing various issues because of the dust, which gets accumulated in our houses. Some of us have developed respiratory problems as well.” When contacted, an official with the south zone corporation office said he would check the status of the underground drainage work and take steps to relay the road accordingly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/relay-vellalore-road-podanur-folk-tell-corpn/articleshow/85723958.cms||V Devanathan

The BMC razed the old CSMT market which it has now taken up for redevelopment. The fishing community has been suspicious of the BMC’s intention of allowing them to come back and continue their trade at the market, one of the oldest fish markets in the city.

These include those who had either delivered a baby, or were found to be pregnant when the case was registered. Legal-cum-probation officer, Dakshina Kannada District Child Protection Unit (DCPU), Sowbhagya Shetty told STOI, “It is shocking to note that more than 50% of the victims in POCSO cases reported this year had conceived. Some of them are only 13-years-old. We have noticed that more cases are being reported in rural areas, especially from Uppinangady, Sullia, Venur and Belthangady, when compared to the city limits. It is depressing to see children getting pregnant, and it is only after the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy, when parents take them to a doctor, that the truth is revealed. There is no doubt that several cases go unreported,” she said. The officer also observed that easy access to pornography on mobile phones is a major cause of concern. “When children first view pornography, there is fear. The second time they are curious, and they gradually become addicted, and after this point they would like to experiment. We have seen a lot of cases where children try to derive sexual pleasure from their family members, including parents and teenage boys sexually exploiting their sisters,” Sowbhagya said. A police officer who has been handling Pocso cases, feels awareness on the issue among parents is the need of the hour. “It is not just about gifting children an expensive phone, but also monitoring what they do or watch that is also crucial. Children as young as 10-12 have access to pornography and many are also aware of the available contraceptives,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/out-of-66-pocso-cases-in-dk-44-kids-had-conceived/articleshow/85722261.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Jaipur||Shortage of rain and coal behind power crisis in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Energy minister BD Kalla said efforts were on to increase the number of rail rakes for transportation of coal in the state by holding talks with higher officials in the ministry of coal and railways. Kalla was giving instructions to officials at a meeting to review the power scenario in the state. Kalla directed the managing directors of power distribution companies (discoms) to pay the outstanding bills of the power generation companies at the earliest for uninterrupted supply of coal. Instructions were given to the generating corporation to technically repair the fifth unit of 660 MW Chhabra thermal unit and to generate electricity up to full capacity from the eighth unit of 660MW Suratgarh. Akhil Arora, principal secretary, finance department, informed that out of the total arrears for the subsidy bill of electricity distribution companies, Rs 1000 crore had been paid and efforts were being made to pay the rest of the dues at the earliest. The managing director of Urja Vikas Nigam, Rohit Gupta, said in normal days the average rate of purchase of electricity in the power exchange is Rs 3-4 per unit, which has increased to Rs 17-18 per unit at present. He said to meet the increased demand, efforts are being made to buy maximum power even at the prevailing expensive rates. He however said due to the increase in consumption of power in the whole of north India, there is not enough power available from the exchange. It was informed at the meeting that due to deficient monsoon in August, consumption of electricity in the state had increased by about 700 lakh units per day as compared to last year. Breaking the records of previous years, the power consumption and maximum demand has been recorded so far as 3,107 lakh units per day. Due to lack of rain, power crisis has deepened not only in the state but in the whole of north India. Power generation of 2,500 MW was not being done due to insufficient supply of coal in the power generation units, it was informed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/shortage-of-rain-and-coal-behind-power-crisis-in-raj/articleshow/85726142.cms||---

The most affected students are in tribal settlements in places like Attappadi and they are struggling to have access to admission formalities. Though various tribal welfare organizations like Adishakthi, an initiative of the Adivasi Gothra Maha Sabha, are trying to help the students by doing the online applications for them, majority of the students are still ignorant of such facilities. If the situation prevails, the number of students enrolling for degree courses from such settlements will see a huge decline this year and the dreams of higher education for many talented tribal students may not get fulfilled. Mary Lidiya, one of the coordinators of Adishakthi, said that many of the students are not able to travel to Akshaya computer centres to have access to the internet amid the pandemic. Moreover, the delay in getting the caste certificates from the government is another challenge as online admission demands the uploading of all relevant documents. “We have launched a help desk to provide remote support to adivasi-dalit students but many students are yet to know about it,” she said. Though tribal students, who have enrolled in UG courses in various colleges last year, have volunteered to support their juniors to get admissions, many students are hesitant. “I live in Thukkudy settlement in Attapadi and I helped around five students by doing their online application with the help of Adishakthi. It is difficult to reach to others due to zero network and connectivity in most of the settlements. Even if we reach out to them, many are not convinced about it,” said P Ayyappan, a UG student at Aluva UC College and a native of Attapadi. There are 196 tribal villages in Attapadi and in almost all these villages there are students who have passed Plus-Two exam this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/tribal-students-find-it-hard-to-take-ug-admissions-online/articleshow/85723972.cms||---

Over the past week, at least 50 people in Agra, Firozabad, Mathura, Mainpuri, Etah and Kasganj districts have died after reporting high fever, dehydration and a sudden drop in platelet count, health department officials confirmed. Of those who died, 26 were children. With recovery time stretching on for up to 12 days, government hospitals are scrounging for beds. Health officials told TOI that while viral fever cases have been reported from eastern UP as well — in Gonda, Basti, Deoria, Ballia, Azamgarh, Sultanpur, Jaunpur and Ghazipur — western UP districts are the worst affected. Besides, Agra has been receiving viral fever patients with similar symptoms from the neighbouring districts of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh as well. “Last year, viral fever cases were rare because people stayed home and maintained hygiene,” said additional director (health) AK Singh. “With high humidity, vector-borne diseases are easy to spread.” Firozabad has reported the highest number of deaths so far, 25. “None of them tested positive for Covid-19. The cause of death is being investigated. Twelve teams of doctors and health staffers, and all auxiliary nurse midwives and ASHA workers have been put on this in rural areas,” Firozabad CMO Dr Neeta Kulshrestha said. It is the intensity of the viral fever, doctors told TOI, that is worrying them. Recovery time has gone up from four to five days to 10-12 days. That has meant fewer beds. At Firozabad medical college, two to three patients were being put in each hospital bed. “More than 100 children suffering from this viral fever are being treated here,” said the hospital’s chief medical superintendent Dr Hansraj Singh. In Agra, superintendent of the district hospital, Dr AK Agarwal, said, “We are attending to at least 200 patients of this viral fever every day. The numbers have gone up over the past three weeks … Children are most vulnerable.” Sher Singh Jatav from Firozabad, who lost his four-year-old son to the viral fever, said, “The district hospital had no beds. We had to move him to a private one. But his platelet dipped and fever shot. He died on Friday.” Rural areas are struggling even more. Vimal Mohan from Tiwaha village in Agra said, “There is not one house in the village without a patient. At least 20 have been admitted to the hospital in Agra over the past 24 hours. Four died over the past week.” While doctors and health officials visited the village three days ago and gave them medicines, “most patients are suffering at home because the community health centre can’t accommodate them.” Additional director Singh said health teams are being moved fast: “Besides providing medicines at doorstep, ambulances are being sent. All cases of death are being investigated.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/viral-fever-in-west-up-kills-50-in-a-week-26-children/articleshow/85722330.cms||Deepak Lavania

He said, “If Pinarayi Vijayan was a renaissance leader, his daughter should have married a man belonging to scheduled caste.” Suresh further alleged that the chief minister appointed his loyal aide to control a minister who belonged to scheduled caste. These controversial remarks were made by the MP during a dharna demanding CBI probe into the SC/ST fund scam here on Saturday. He first alleged that the chief minister was discriminating against the backward communities. “The people of scheduled castes were avoided in the cabinet and even from the state Public Service Commission appointments,” Suresh alleged. He also referred to the appointment of A Sampath as the private secretary to devaswom minister K Radhakrishnan. “This appointment was done to have a control on the ministry. At the same time he boasts of giving the devaswom portfolio to a man belonging to scheduled caste,” the Congress leader said. He added that the chief minister should have married off his daughter to a man from scheduled caste, if his concept of renaissance was genuine. “All his claims are a hoax. The CPM has never allowed a leader from scheduled caste background to come to the forefront,” Suresh said. However, when his speech became a controversy, the Congress leader said he was pointing out that the chief minister was not sincere on his words and he had only exposed it. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kodikkunnils-remarks-against-pinarayi-sparks-a-row/articleshow/85724014.cms||---
---||Imphal||Manipur body opposes fencing work on India-Myanmar border||IMPHAL: Stating that the India-Myanmar boundary disput, along the fringes of Tengnoupal district in Manipur has not been resolved, the United Committee Manipur (UCM) has asked the state government to halt the border fencing works taken up by the BRTF. A conglomerate of various civil bodies of the state, campaigning to safeguard Manipur’s territorial integrity and unity, UCM has warned of launching an agitation if the fencing activities are not stopped with immediate effect. There have been serious allegations by the local people and researchers against Myanmar authorities of shifting the India-Myanmar border pillar (BP) No. 81 3 kms inside the Indian territory from the actual boundary. A team of UCM, headed by its president Joychandra Konthoujam, inspected the controversial BP No. 81 at the Kwatha Khunou area in Tengnoupal a couple of days ago and spoke to the local people about the developments. The team also visited areas where fencing activities are currently undertaken and as a token of protest filled the fencing holes with earth. Joychandra sought a clarification from the state government that whether they have allowed such fencing activities to be undertaken in the wrong area. He cautioned of triggering a massive protest, bigger than the people’s uprising on June 18,2001, to safeguard Manipur’s territorial integrity and unity, if the fencing work remained unabated. “It is disappointing that the BRTF began border fencing activities at the wrong place, despite the opposition of the people,” he said. Stating that a central team, which inspected the controversial pillar in 2018, could not offer a solution till date, Joychandra said that UCM will not accept fencing activities in the area. The UCM president sought MoS for external affairs RK Ranjan’s intervention into the matter at the earliest. Stating that a memorandum will be submitted on the matter to Ranjan and chief minister N Biren Singh, Joychandra urged the state government to take a strong step in order to safeguard the territorial integrity of Manipur. While a central team comprising of joint secretaries of the ministry of external affairs and home affairs and surveyor general of India had inspected the disputed B in 2018 and stated that the pillar stood at the right place, the locals and various civil bodies have strongly denied the claim. Responding to their objection , the central team said that they would ask the state government to provide some more records of the pillar if they had it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/imphal/manipur-body-opposes-fencing-work-on-india-myanmar-border/articleshow/85729045.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma
---||India||Rule of law will stay till Hindus are in majority: Gujarat deputy CM||AHMEDABAD: According to Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, as long as Hindus are in a majority in the country, the rule of law, the Constitution and secularism will remain and, when Hindus cease to comprise the majority, all these will be finished. Asked on Saturday to clarify his statement of Friday at the dedication of the Bharat Mata temple in Gandhinagar, Patel said that Hindus are liberal in their thinking and so democracy is flourishing in the country. “This is my personal opinion. Democracy works where the majority embrace the values of a democracy. In countries where people believe that only what they say is right, the rule of law, democracy and judiciary are compromised. Afghanistan is the latest example of this,” Patel said on Saturday. On Friday, however, the deputy CM had minced no words in saying, “Mark my words. As long as Hindus are in a majority in the country, these people will talk of the Constitution, rule of law, and secularism. God forbid if after 1,000 or 2,000 years the number of Hindus becomes less and others’ increases, there will not be any courts, any Lok Sabha, any Constitution. Nothing will remain.” He had added, “Let me clarify. I am not talking about everybody. Lakhs of Muslims are patriotic. Lakhs of Christians are patriotic. Thousands of Muslims are in the Indian Army. Scores of Muslims are in Gujarat’s police force. They all are patriots.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rule-of-law-will-stay-till-hindus-are-in-majority-gujarat-deputy-cm/articleshow/85728974.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Std XI centralized admission in city has to be scrapped, it’s meaningless’||Std XI’s centralized admission process (CAP) has always been debated in Nagpur because of the high number of vacant seats every year, but this time its detractors have raised the decibel. Rural colleges, which are not part of CAP, began their academic session in July while in the city, the admission process is yet to be completed. Ravindra Fadnavis, secretary of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal (MRSSM), represents various trusts which manage educational institutes across the state and is a strong opponent of CAP. In an interview to TOI, Fadnavis talks about CAP and how it has become irrelevant, both due to the vacant seats and technology-driven era we now live in. Excerpts... Q. The government says the centralized admission process (CAP) saves time and money for students as they don’t have to visit different colleges for admission. Is the move justified? A. This argument is flawed to begin with and in the current technology-driven age, it has actually become invalid. Every college can have their own website where the admission process can be integrated. Students can submit documents, pay the fees online and can track the progress online. Parallelly, the education department can create a website in which names of colleges, their websites and previous year’s cut-off lists can be made available. This way the student knows that he/she is clicking on a genuine website link. And access to Internet can be had either from home or from an Internet cafe because the entire CAP is online so students even today need to access the net. Q. With students paying for the college prospectus (online or offline), won’t it result in more expenses. A. As per the directions of the court, the college prospectus can’t be more than Rs 20. But in CAP itself the application fee is around Rs 120. Once CAP is scrapped, colleges can shift their prospectus delivery online which will ensure that the cost remains below the Rs 20 mandated by the court. If any college charges more than that, the education department can take action. The CAP committee for Nagpur has around Rs 50 lakh in its bank account. They should take the initiative of reducing the application fee. Q. Why do you feel that CAP does not serve the intended purpose? A. I would ask which purpose does it serve in Nagpur city? Almost 50% of Std XI seats go vacant every year which itself defeats the primary purpose of CAP. If every student is guaranteed admission then why have such a process. The second point is that colleges just outside city limits are exempt which makes them more agile in planning their academic session. Do you know that the academic session in Nagpur (rural) colleges started in July with the option of physical classes as well. But in the city, we are still in the admission phase and August has almost ended. We can’t even begin online class because the CAP schedule has pushed our academic session back by more than a month. Q. A recent trend is that more students are taking admission in rural colleges. A. College admissions are driven by science stream students, most of whom are preparing for JEE/NEET. So coaching classes are their priority and daily college attendance is not possible for such students. In rural areas, it seems that coaching institutes have a ‘tie-up’ with certain colleges where proxy attendance is marked. Since these colleges are out of CAP, admissions can be taken in bulk by coaching institutes for their students. Q. Is CAP affecting admissions in city colleges? A. Definitely. That’s been the recent trend. Let’s go purely by statistics and you will find that every year there are about 20,000 seats vacant in the city. Last year it was around 24,000. Even if we factor in that figure, there is over-capacity, there is no denying the fact that city students are being herded to rural colleges for admission where the education department’s radar does not work. Hence we have demanded that either you scrap CAP or include rural colleges as well. Q. Can CAP be scrapped because it’s being held in places like Mumbai and Pune too? A. Well the latest example is Aurangabad, where CAP is no longer applicable. They made a claim to the government that there are a huge number of vacant seats and it’s not logical to keep CAP going. We too have sent a similar letter to deputy director of education (DDE) Nagpur division, saying that Nagpur too must be removed from CAP’s purview.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/std-xi-centralized-admission-in-city-has-to-be-scrapped-its-meaningless/articleshow/85724019.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

One of the accused managed to flee the spot as his accomplices opened fire at the police team when their pick-up vehicle was intercepted under the Baniyather police station jurisdiction, following a tip-off, said police. Police identified the accused as Kartar Banjara, Moola Ram and Sunil of Alwar from Rajasthan and Waseem of Bhot of Rampur. Sambhal superintendent of police Chakresh Mishra said, “Following a tip-off, raids were conducted on the highway and a pick-up vehicle was intercepted on suspicion by the police team. The accused had opened fire at the police team. Four accused — three from Rajasthan’s Alwar and one from UP’s Rampur — were arrested, while one managed to escape. They were produced before a court on Saturday and sent to jail.” “Police also seized drugs, illegal revolver and cutting equipment from their possession,” said the SP. The SP added that the accused were booked under appropriate sections of the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act and the Cow Slaughter Act, the Arms Act and IPC section 307 (attempt to murder).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/three-rajasthan-residents-among-four-arrested-as-sambhal-cops-bust-interstate-cattle-smuggling-gang/articleshow/85720424.cms||Maria Khan
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat corporates’ mantra: Catch them young to build a skilled workforce||Catch them young and get home-grown skilled manpower’ seems to be the mantra adopted by the corporate world in Gujarat. Having seen remarkable growth owing to quality infrastructure and business-friendly policies in the state, many companies are now eyeing to nurture local talent and mould it into the managerial role for the future. A number of companies in the state have tied up with different industries for starting academic courses offering specialised skill sets. From big firms to medium level companies and even industrial associations, many have signed MoUs with the private as well as government universities for launching academic courses in the state. Specialized course designed for chemical industries MS University, in collaboration with Heubach Colour Private Ltd (HCPL) is launching a postgraduate diploma programme in industrial chemistry and sustainable technologies. The university and HCPL have signed a MoU for collaboration in the streams of chemical engineering/material science. "The chemical industry has a good potential and we need talented manpower with a particular skill-set to sustain our growth. So, we decided to join hands with MSU to design an academic course that suits our requirements. The industry understands its current and future needs better," said Ravi Kapoor, managing director, HCPL. The one-year course will offer six months of industry experience and the rest will be classroom studies. The MoU has been signed initially for a period of five years. A large number of senior industry professionals, some renowned faculty members from institutes of national repute along with faculty members from chemistry department, applied chemistry department, chemical engineering and pharmacy departments of the university have committed to teach and share their expertise for this course. "The objective of the MoU is to provide chemical industry specific knowledge, exposure and training to fresh postgraduates of any branch of chemistry and graduates from chemical engineering or material science streams," said professor Hari Kataria, dean of Faculty of Science, MSU. Students taking up the course will have an opportunity to do a four-month-long industry-specific training. As part of MoU, HCPL will be facilitating project internships at HCPL and other industries. HCPL will also support students to seek suitable employment with various chemical industries by providing guidance and counselling. The course will serve as a unique model of university-industry interaction. Industry associations join hands with educational institutes The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), central Gujarat, recently signed a MoU with the MS University and Navrachana University to bridge the student-industry gap. CII officials said that the objective of these MoUs is to facilitate faculty and student development programmes, develop industry responsive curriculum, utilise research and development facilities in the educational institutes and offer internships to students so that they can be absorbed in the industries. CII has suggested a mandatory student internship programme for six months and the faculty and teachers should also visit the companies to learn the new technologies and stay updated. "Often the students pursuing any course are taught old technologies or management skills in the universities. Many companies are now helping the educational institutes in designing and upgrading the curriculum," said Bhavik Khera, chairman, CII central Gujarat. "This will help the industry in getting employees with upgraded and industry-specific skills and also better placement opportunities for the university pass-outs," Khera added. The Vadodara Chambers of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) of CII too signed a MoU with M S University to develop a particular skill set in the students, get them internship and placements in the companies. The association has even suggested to up-skill some of their employees through short-term courses and they can offer practical training to students and faculties, university officials said. "We propose to take this MoU further proactively with our MSME members and other chambers of commerce," said VCCI’s vice president Himanshu Patel, who is also a syndicate member at MSU. Students to get hands-on training at company facilities Four years ago, Gujarat Technological University (GTU) and Toyota Tsusho Corporation collaborated to offer a three-year diploma course in automobile manufacturing. "The diploma course in automobile engineering is a completely industry-oriented course for which the enrolment takes place for GTU. Students enrolling for the course get hands-on training at the company’s facility and they also get a stipend," said Dr N R Sheth, vice-chancellor, GTU. "The fourth batch is running currently. While enrolments take place through the university, the company representatives are a part of the selection process. Besides this, GTU also offers several certificate courses in the automotive segment at its two centres of excellence: One has been set-up in collaboration with a Keepsake Engineering Consultancy Private Limited based in Ahmedabad, whereas the other is in association with a German engineering firm, Bosch-Rexroth. These are typically add-on courses onto degree-diploma courses in engineering and automation technologies," said Sheth. A similar initiative is soon on the cards for state-owned Gujarat University as well. "The varsity has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Adani Defence and Aerospace as well as one with Blu Ray Aviation to offer a certificate course in drone training." The course is being offered as part of a tripartite agreement between the state education department, Gujarat State Aviation Infrastructure company Limited (Gujsail) and the companies. Gujarat University, in fact, has also collaborated with Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Home Association (AHNA) to offer courses in hospital management as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guj-corporates-mantra-catch-them-young-to-build-a-skilled-workforce/articleshow/85727602.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Mumbai||‘Central scheme can save Maharashtra’s tomato farmers’||NASHIK: The Centre has taken note of the distress of Maharashtra’s tomato farmers and asked the state to make use of the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) of the Centre if needed. Vivek Aggarwal, additional secretary of the union ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare, on Friday wrote to state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte in this regard. “It has been observed that the prevailing market price of tomatoes is below the production cost. As a result the farmers are not getting remunerative prices for the commodity. The chief secretary can direct the officers concerned to avail of the scheme if there is a requirement,” Aggarwal said on Friday. State agriculture officials did not offer any comment on the issue. The Centre’s MIS is a price support mechanism for perishable agriculture and horticulture commodities not covered under the minimum support price mechanism. A state government willing to implement MIS has to bear 50% of the loss incurred by farmers and the remaining 50% is borne by the Centre. Aggarwal said for the implementation of MIS, there should be either a 10% increase in production of the commodity or 10% decrease in the prevailing market prices. In either case, it has to be compared with the previous year’s production or prices. A section of tomato growers in Nashik had dumped their produce on the road after the crash in the wholesale prices in mandis from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 4.5 per kg. They sought government intervention as the wholesale price per kg was Rs 5 lower than the production cost.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-central-scheme-can-save-states-tomato-farmers/articleshow/85727612.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The first paper, biology, saw as many as 2,799 absentees, out of a total 8,655 enrolled. The mathematics paper was attempted by 7,673 candidates, and 981 were absent out of the 8,654 enrolled. No candidates with Covid-19 appeared for the test in Dakshina Kannada. A total 8,736 candidates had registered for the entrance test in the district, that was held in 19 centres. On Sunday, the chemistry and physics CET will be held. The CET will be conducted for students from Kerala on Monday, and 576 students are likely to appear for the test to be held at two centres in the city. Students from Kerala must produce RT-PCR negative reports. In Udupi district, 256 candidates were absent for the mathematics CET, and 1,456 for biology, out of a total 3,597 candidates who had registered. Separate seating arrangements were made for two candidates who had Covid-19, in Udupi. Since the NEET is scheduled in two weeks, many students did not appear for the biology CET paper. Also, due to the delay, a few students had secured admission for other courses. For instance, a student who registered for the CET but did not appear for it, said, “Due to the delay in conducting the CET, I had applied for a pharmacy course at a private college, that does not require CET scores.” The mathematics paper was of medium difficulty, said students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/many-absent-for-biology-cet-paper-in-dk/articleshow/85722364.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Over 3,300 CBSE students apply for Std XI Centralized Admission Process||NAGPUR: The Centralized Admission Process (CAP) for state board junior colleges continues to attract students from various boards, but it remains the preferred choice for CBSE. Around 3,300 CBSE students have applied for the state’s junior college admissions this year as compared to the next highest of around 200 from ICSE. While these figures do not reflect the fact that there are over 50 CBSE schools in the district as compared to less than six for ICSE, academics say the ‘choices’ have to be considered as well. A senior academic said, “For ICSE, there’s I think only one school which offers Std XI so the choice is limited, but for CBSE there are many schools which offer Std XI. Yet their students prefer to shift to state board.” The central board does not provide official figures for student enrollment district-wise, but it’s estimated that around 10,000 -12,000 students appear for board exams from here. Official figures for Maharashtra level enrollment for the 2020-21 academic session was 82,569. The reason for the shift to state board must not be construed as ‘better academic quality’, feels a senior CBSE principal. “It’s the coaching class nexus that’s driving the admission process in Nagpur. Attendance is not mandatory in state board colleges, or rather it’s not implemented. Here in CBSE, majority of the schools have strict compliance,” said the principal. A state board principal, however, refuted the charge, saying CBSE schools too have ‘adapted with time’. “I personally know coaching class owners who have tied up with CBSE schools located just outside city limits. So students from CBSE are now preferring to stay within their own system. The syllabus of NEET and JEE is aligned to NCERT. And the consensus is that CBSE schools follow NCERT more than us, so it makes sense for a student to continue within the CBSE ecosystem,” said the principal. A CBSE school principal from the city said, “Nowadays many CBSE schools have cropped up outside the city limits as affiliation is being granted with great speed. This quantity driven process seems to have compromised with quality as these schools have become an extended coaching centre.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/over-3k-cbse-students-apply-for-std-xi-cap/articleshow/85724092.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Thane||Almost 40% of patients in Thane city opt for treatment elsewhere||THANE: The city has registered a rise in volume of local Covid patients opting for treatment out of city limits in the last one month, reveal government records. Experts attribute the same to comparatively better treatment facilities and vacancy in hospitals in neighbouring cities due to drop in cases. A cursory glance through the latest available comparative records compiled on August 17 reveals that 39% or around 200 of the 506 Covid positive patients from Thane city are either taking treatment out of the city or district. This, interestingly, is higher than the figures reported on July 20 when around 31% of total active cases from Thane city were being handled at facilities outside. This incidentally is the highest volume when compared to other cities in Thane district as Navi Mumbai with 911 active patients on August 17 had a minuscule volume of 0.3% patients opting out of the city treatment while a comparatively smaller suburb of Kalyan-Dombivli has interestingly registered only 1.3% patients going out for treatment. Relatives of patients said mostly it was better facilities offered in Mumbai that drew relatives to get their patients admitted there. Activist Unmesh Bagwe said an elderly resident from Thane with his family based in America had preferred to get him admitted to Mumbai saying the facilities here weren't up to the mark. Dr Santosh Kadam, president, IMA Thane unit agreed the possibility saying that with Covid numbers decreasing the vacancy in hospitals abutting the city has increased due to which there could be a possibility of patients preferring to get admitted there. Activists however said it was time the administration took a serious view to revamp and bolster the existing medical facilities in the city and curb such outflow. “It may be a huge cause of concern if the facilities here may not be up to the mark. It is far more surprising if patients from smaller cities prefer to take treatment near their own. Whatever the reason is the local civic administration and the political class needs to find out what is lacking,” said activist Nitin Deshpande. Civic officials dismissed any possibility of poor facilities and claimed the affluent class could prefer luxury hospitals in neighbouring cities and also didn’t deny possibility of few patients from corporate and government taking treatment at office-designated hospitals out of city limits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/mumbai-almost-40-of-patients-in-thane-city-opt-for-treatment-elsewhere/articleshow/85726258.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The new DCC presidents are: Palode Ravi (Thiruvananthapuram), P Rajendra Prasad (Kollam), Sateesh Kochuparambil (Pathanamthitta), B Babu Prasad (Alappuzha), Nattakom Suresh (Kottayam), C P Mathew (Idukki), Mohammed Shiyas (Ernakulam), Jose Vallor (Thrissur), A Thankappan (Palakkad), V S Joy (Malappuram), K Praveen Kumar (Kozhikode), N D Appachan (Wayanad), Martin George (Kannur) and P K Faisal (Kasaragod). The nominees of K Sudhakaran, V D Satheesan, K C Venugopal, Kodukkunnil Suresh and K Muraleedharan have found space in the list. This has irked leaders like Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy. Former KPCC general secretary K P Anil Kumar has openly flayed the list through news channels which irked the KPCC leadership. Congress leader K Sivadasan Nair has also openly criticized the list approved by the AICC. The KPCC president soon placed these two leaders under suspension. However, they were not ready to obey the leadership and had continued with their attack against the leadership. The party leaders are of the view that there will be open criticism in the coming days also against the list approved by the AICC since the nominees of Chennithala and Chandy were sidelined. In fact, only one nominee of Chennithala has found place in the list, in Alappuzha. Chandy’s nominee also was not considered in Kottayam. It was also strange to note that a non-Christian has been given the DCC president post, which will definitely annoy the Oommen Chandy camp. Nattakom Suresh, who has been appointed now, is the nominee of Thiruvanchur Radhakrishnan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/aicc-approves-dcc-prez-list-unrest-brews-in-cong/articleshow/85724063.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Malabar Rebellion was against British & feudal lords: Pinarayi||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the exclusion of Variamkunnath Kunjahammed Haji who led the Malabar Rebellion of 1921 from the list of country’s freedom fighters has been done by those who have no clue about the country’s freedom struggle. Vijayan said on Saturday Variamkunnath and his supporters have been recognized as freedom fighters by everyone. The independence struggle was multi-faceted in nature, involving people’s movements, individual protests, protests by farmers, armed rebellions, etc. When different groups and political parties conducted such protests, all those had one common goal----driving the British out of the country, he said. There would have been different opinions on the kind of government that is required after driving the British out of the country, but because of such differing views on government, they cannot be excluded from the category of freedom fighters, he said. Further, the chief minister said Variamkunnath had opposed people from all religions who had supported the British, and he and his supporters had even murdered people like Khan Bahadur Chekkutty and Thayyil Moidheen. No one can deny the fact that the 1921 rebellion was against the British, and had developed into a rebellion against the feudal lords who supported the British. Though it is a fact that in some areas, there were attempts to give a different direction to the rebellion, such isolated incidents should be seen in that way, he said. The chief minister said that history has recorded that when Variamkunnath visited Madhava Menon who wrote about the rebellion, he had told him about his intention to end spilling the blood of innocents. He said Variamkunnath himself had strongly refuted the allegations that Malabar Rebellion was between Hindus and Muslims. His legacy was to toe an anti-British line and oppose the idea of a religion-based country, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/malabar-rebellion-was-against-british-feudal-lords-pinarayi/articleshow/85724102.cms||---

While members of the AIADMK and the BJP walked out of the assembly before the resolution was put to vote, legislators of the PMK, an NDA ally, the Congress, the VCK, the MDMK, the MMK and the Left supported the motion. Moving the resolution, chief minister M K Stalin said the laws — Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2000, Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 — were enacted by the Centre arbitrarily without consulting the state governments though the sector comes under the control of states. Stalin said the rights of the state governments were affected and federal principles were compromised. In effect, it amounted to collapse of democratic institutions. “As these three acts are not suitable for the country’s agricultural growth and the farmers’ welfare, this legislative assembly unanimously resolves that the Union government should repeal them,” the chief minister said, reading out from the resolution. After the leader of the House, S Durai Murugan insisted, speaker M Appavu announced that the resolution was passed ‘unanimously’ as all the members present in the House passed it by voice vote. The aspiration of the farmers was to get appropriate price for their produce, but none of the three laws spoke about the minimum support price. The laws would result in large-scale reduction of revenue for regulated markets, favour traders rather than farmers, and would result in artificial price hike, the CM said. Former agriculture minister and AIADMK MLA K P Anbalagan said the state government should not pass the resolution in haste. Instead, it should convene an all-party meeting, invite the representatives of farmers’ associations and discuss the pros and cons before taking up the matter with the Centre. Intervening in the debate, deputy leader of the opposition O Panneerselvam said the chief minister had listed out only the disadvantages and sought to know if the CM or the agriculture minister had approached the Union government and received any reply. “A delegation of legislature parties could visit the Prime Minister and seek explanation on the advantages and disadvantages,” OPS said, indicating that it would help understand the nitty-gritty of the issue and the effects in the long-run. When Durai Murugan said the laws were enacted by the Centre when the AIADMK was in power in the state and sought to know if the AIADMK was supporting or opposing the resolution, Panneerselvam said that Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the laws and therefore there was a need to consult legal experts on the resolution. Durai Murugan denied that the matter was subjudice. The chief minister said the resolution moved by him had a mention that it was being passed unanimously as he was hopeful that the opposition would support it. To this, Panneerselvam said the state or central governments would not be able to take any action since the court was seized of the matter and any decision should be taken based on the outcome of the court case. “We have a responsibility to take exemplary decisions. Let this subject be sent to a select committee,” OPS said. Stalin questioned the AIADMK’s reluctance to take a stand against the farm laws when some of the state assemblies had already passed resolutions against them. Reacting to Panneeerselvam, who wanted the chief minister to discuss with the Prime Minister and Union agriculture minister, Stalin said that he had spoken about the matter with the Prime Minister during his last visit to Delhi, but there was no reply. Stalin said he was humbly reiterating his plea to the opposition to support the resolution. When the AIADMK legislators walked out and resumed their seats within minutes, Durai Murugan requested Appavu to expunge certain remarks he had made on OPS and his son and LS MP, O P Raveendranath since it would hurt the former CM. OPS thanked Durai Murugan. PMK floor leader G K Mani said the Central laws created panic among the farmers and that should be resolved. Later, industries minister Thangam Thennarasu told reporters that the AIADMK had committed a blunder and betrayed the farmers. Their walk-out exposed their double standard, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-passes-resolution-against-3-farm-laws/articleshow/85722426.cms||---

Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that detailed guidelines have been framed to help in the safe commencement of classes. “The current II PU students had little access to on-campus learning in the first year. Therefore, it has been decided to reopen classes to help students academically, despite the district’s positivity rate being more than 2%,” he said. According to the circular, it is the responsibility of the college principals to strictly implement the Covid-19 SOPs laid down by the district administration. All the students from Kerala are required to quarantine themselves for a week, and a RT-PCR test must be conducted after a week. Colleges must have Covid care centres, and students in quarantine can attend online classes. “Students, teaching and non-teaching staff travelling from Kerala must produce a RT-PCR negative certificate when the college reopens, and subsequently every week, even if the faculty is fully vaccinated. Classes for day scholars and boarders will be conducted separately. An inspection team has been constituted headed by the DDPU and including taluk health officials and college principals, to oversee the implementation of the guidelines,” he said. Once the admission process is complete, I PU classes can start from September 15. However, every college has to take permission from the DDPU, before commencement of on-campus classes. C D Jayanna, DDPU told STOI : “Since II PU is a critical year for every student, we had requested the district administration to consider commencement of on-campus classes. Last academic year, students had to be promoted despite no examination being held. This batch has hardly attended classes on campus, since their admission to I PU, last year. Online classes will continue parallelly,” he said. Meanwhile, the DC has assured to look into allegations made by parents, that a few colleges will be conducting classes even if the weekend curfew is extended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/on-campus-ii-pu-classes-to-begin-from-september-1-in-dk/articleshow/85722415.cms||---

As of Saturday, six states and Union Territories were past the cutoff — Chandigarh (20%), Kerala (14.9%), Manipur (11.2%), Sikkim (9%), Mizoram (8.6%) and Meghalaya (8%). Last year, the Janmashtami celebrations were scaled down — it was observed on August 12 behind closed doors and only two temples, Krishna Janamsthan and Dwarkadhish, were open. Others, including Banke Bihari, remained shut. So, this year, the Mathura administration expects a high turnout. According to police data, over 25 lakh had turned up in 2019 and 24 lakh the year before that. “The celebrations will be telecast live from 11.30pm (on Monday) to 1am (on Tuesday). The religious rituals will include a flower ceremony before the birth of Krishna, in which 1,008 lotuses will be offered,” secretary of Shri Krishna Janamsthan Seva Sansthan, Kapil Sharma, told TOI. The temple falls under the red zone, the highest security level with round-the-clock surveillance, in the police plan. “Nearly 2,000 police personnel including five additional SPs, 21 deputy SPs, 50 inspectors, 320 sub inspectors, 314 head constables and 1,071 constables, along with 10 companies of police armed constabulary forces will be in place for two days from August 29,” Mathura SSP Gaurav Grover said. “No vehicle will be allowed to enter Mathura. We have set up 14 parking spots at the entry points.” It will also be where each visitor undergoes thermal scanning and sanitisation. DM Chahal added, “Public address systems will keep reminding pilgrims about Covid norms. Area magistrates and police will ensure no one removes face masks.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/pilgrims-from-high-positivity-states-need-ve-report-to-enter-mathura-on-janmashtami/articleshow/85722458.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Across six districts, only 1,300 to appear for SSC, HSC supplementary exams||NAGPUR: In yet another ‘record’ for the Covid-hit academic calendar, Nagpur division will witness the lowest-ever number of students appearing for SSC and HSC supplementary exams which is proposed to start from September 16. Approximately 1,300 students are expected to appear in six districts under Nagpur division which board officials say will be a ‘unique sight’. A board official, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Usually this number hovers over the 10,000 mark but this year’s bumper results have just changed the game. Almost everybody passed and what we are seeing is that many students are appearing for the Class Improvement Scheme, in which passed students get a chance to improve their grades.” Though the official did not have the exact numbers available, he confirmed that the total enrolment for supplementary exams is split ‘equally between SSC and HSC’. The board is looking at an average of 15 students in every exam centre. This is the mean average, but in the group, some centres can go up as high as 40. “In some centres we might have more staff than students,” said a board official. “Anyway, it is our duty to conduct the exams in a fair manner and it shall be done by keeping all Covid precautions in mind,” said the official. Since there is no vaccination available for those under-18, being vaccinated is not a pre-condition for appearing in the exam. An official said, “All exams will be conducted by following proper safety guidelines. As it is the number of students appearing is so low that we won’t face any issue related to crowding.” State board chairman Ashok Bhonsale reiterated that the exam schedule is in the ‘proposed’ category. “These dates are just for everyone’s information. Before exams start an official timetable will be delivered to all schools and junior colleges through the respective divisional board office. Students have to ensure that their timetable schedule comes from such official sources only, and not from forwarded Whatsapp messages,” said Bhonsale in an written statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/across-six-dists-only-1300-to-appear-for-ssc-hsc-supplementary-exams/articleshow/85724105.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The encroachers had also destroyed the vertical garden and green area beneath the flyover. They had forcefully kept their belongings in this area. The caretaker and staff tried to stop encroachment activities there, but they refused to vacate the area,” the spokesperson of the civic body said.He added that the horticulture department then wrote letters to the DCP South and the SHO of Kishangarh police station seeking legal action against encroachers and help in getting the flyover area vacated. “Finally, it was freed from encroachment and greenery was restored by SDMC. The department has now rebeautified the whole area by redeveloping the vertical garden and restoring the green area,” the official said.In the last 10 days, the department has planted 340 Kamal Cactus, 260 Sansevieria, 120 Ficus Panda, 80 Yuca, 20 Raphis palm and 100 Desi Panda plants besides hundreds of shrubs. “We have also asked Delhi Police to regularly patrol the area and ensure that no encroachment takes place again,” the official said.According to the letter written by the deputy director of the horticulture department to Delhi Police, the lieutenant governor had earlier inaugurated the beautified space, which was getting damaged by the encroachers. “When our guards and staff members try to stop them, these people behave rudely and attempt to physically threaten them. Their presence can also lead to accidents,” the letter stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/squatters-removed-work-on-restoring-greenery-below-s-delhi-flyover-begins/articleshow/85722453.cms||---

The vulture was shifted to Wildlife SOS transit facility and is currently under observation. Members of St. Peter’s Church were shocked to find a vulture lying in a semi-conscious state in their church’s garden and they immediately contacted Wildlife SOS. A two-member rescue team sent by the NGO confirmed that the bird was a juvenile Egyptian Vulture. The Egyptian Vulture is the smallest amongst all the vultures and is classified as a globally endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. A detailed examination by the Wildlife SOS veterinarians revealed that the vulture was suffering from severe dehydration and heat exhaustion. As a first step, the vulture was given oral rehydration solution and glucose to regain its strength. The young raptor continues to recuperate and will be released into its natural habitat on full recovery, said NGO officials. Dr Ilayaraja, deputy director, Veterinary Services for Wildlife SOS, said, “Juvenile Egyptian vultures take small flights, often stopping for a rest in safe areas devoid of predators. This particular vulture was unable to take flight due to severe dehydration and heatstroke.” Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-Founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, “The Egyptian Vulture is a rare raptor that plays an integral role in our ecosystem. As vultures fly at higher altitudes, they are more prone to suffering from dehydration and heat exhaustion.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/rare-egyptian-vulture-rescued-in-agra/articleshow/85722438.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

By Saturday evening, the situation was brought under control with only some villages continuing to face waterlogging. The situation arose due to incessant rainfall in neighbouring Nepal, which released a huge volume of water and in turn, five lakh cusecs of water were released from Ghaghara barrage in Shardanagar and Sharda barrage in Banbasa. As a result a flood alert was sounded in the Palia, Nighasan, Gola and Dhaurahra areas of the district. The rivers in the district were flowing above the danger mark on Saturday morning. By Saturday evening, Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya, Kheri district magistrate, told TOI, “The condition is now under control as the excessive water has passed through Kheri district to drain into the Ghaghara river in Sitapur district. Now, the threat of floods looms large in districts that fall in downstream areas of eastern UP. Most of the rivers in Kheri have receded below the danger mark and no casualty has been reported. Compensation as per the guidelines will be awarded to the affected people after a survey is completed by the revenue department.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/5l-cusecs-of-water-released-into-kheri-rivers-after-heavy-rains-in-nepal-40-villages-hit/articleshow/85722467.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The names were picked by a committee, which was headed by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, from a list of 740 names that were suggested by about 9,500 people.Every year, the Centre seeks recommendations from the state governments for the awards and this time, Delhi government had decided that only the names of doctors and paramedical staff would be recommended. The awards include Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan.The three doctors have played a significant role in Covid containment and management in the capital. ILBS vice-chancellor Dr SK Sarin commissioned the world’s first plasma bank, Delhi government’s first RT-PCR testing facility and genome sequencing lab. Led by medical director Dr Suresh Kumar, Lok Nayak Hospital treated the highest number of Covid patients, set up the country’s second plasma bank, and launched a videoconference facility to enable Covid patients to talk to their family members.Kejriwal said that Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director of Max Healthcare, was the country’s first physician to use plasma treatment. “All doctors, nurses and paramedical staff in Delhi are recommending these three names for Padma awards; they should be given the awards to fulfil the wishes of the people of the country,” he stated.In a press conference, the CM said: “During the Covid-19 pandemic, our frontline and medical workers, especially our doctors and paramedics, saved our lives by putting their own lives at risk. It is now time to show them that the entire country is grateful to them.”Kejriwal said Sarin was instrumental in setting up the plasma bank at ILBS. “He has worked tirelessly for the past three decades, which include transforming medical education as well as increasing the awareness, prevention, and access to diagnosis and treatment for liver diseases. Throughout the pandemic, he has been working relentlessly to serve the people and provide assistance to the government,” he added.The CM said that Dr Suresh Kumar increased the number of ICU beds from 50 to 900 at Lok Nayak Hospital. “He also increased the number of oxygen beds, making more than 2,000 oxygen beds available. To support pregnant women who were Covid-19 positive, Dr Kumar played an instrumental role in setting up a dedicated labour room. More than 627 deliveries were performed at the hospital,” said Kejriwal.Highlighting the contribution of Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, Kejriwal said he played a crucial role in delivering care and treatment to Covid-19 patients in Delhi and north India. “I want to sincerely thank Delhi government for recognising the great service and sacrifices made by healthcare workers during the last 18 months of the pandemic. Everyone should work and stand together in these difficult times,” Dr Budhiraja told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/3-doctors-nominated-for-padma-awards-cm/articleshow/85722463.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Delhi||Health card for all: Delhi government checks pulse||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government will conduct surveys across the city to ensure that eHealth Cards are made available to all citizens under its ambitious Healthcare Information Management System (HIMS). These cards, which will made at hospitals and other dedicated centres, will be distributed through a door-to-door campaign. The eHealth Card will contain the entire medical history of the cardholder, enabling a person to get treatment at any hospital on HIMS. One will not be required to carry medical reports and documents if they have the card. HIMS seeks to bring all Delhi hospitals under one platform with information available at the tap of a button. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said HIMS would keep the government updated on the availability of beds at all hospitals as also the status of medicine stocks and details on employees and other medical infrastructure. “One wouldn’t need to stand in queues in hospitals anymore. Appointments will be available on the phone and at the convenience of the patient,” he said. “The contract for the system has been awarded to M/s NEC Corporation India Private Limited, a multinational corporation, which will be looking after the whole platform. The funds required for the project have also been sanctioned by the cabinet,” the CM said in a statement. The government has allocated Rs 139.8 lakh for the project. The health cards will be available online for access. “This will help the people of Delhi get all the information under one roof and seek immediate help in emergency cases. After its implementation, Delhi will become the only state in the country to have a cloud-based health management system. At present, such a system is available in some countries, like Sweden, Uganda and Germany,” Delhi government said in a statement. The QR code-based cards will be issued to the residents of Delhi on the basis of voter ID and population registry from which demographic and basic clinical information of each patient can be obtained. Family mapping will be done through the cards for health schemes and programmes. It will be integrated with HIMS for seamless information exchange. To implement the HIMS project, a centralised call centre will be set up at two levels. At the first level, call centre operators will receive calls and messages from people. After logging in to CRM, they will assess the case and get it resolved and inform the available healthcare staff concerned. The operator will give the relevant information to the caller and a report will be generated at the end. At the second level, doctors and experts of the Delhi government will receive calls and messages and give appointments to the patient. If the case is an emergency, the helpline will accept their call immediately and talk to them to resolve the problem. If need be, they will contact a specialist doctor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/health-card-for-all-govt-checks-pulse/articleshow/85722460.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Chandigarh||Farmers protests in at least 12 Haryana districts||CHANDIGARH: Within hours of a police lathicharge on farmers protesting at Bastara toll plaza in Karnal district on Saturday, activists blocked all highways and toll plazas in at least 12 districts of Haryana — Jind, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Panchkula, Kaithal, Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad, Rohtak, Bhiwani and Karnal. Traffic was blocked on a call given by BKU Haryana (Charuni) national president Gurnam Singh Charuni. After Charuni’s call, Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Darshan Pal also gave a call to activists to block roads and toll plazas till 5pm. However, as some farmers in Karnal district were arrested after lathicharge, Charuni asked them to continue the protest beyond 5pm, until those arrested were released. The road blockades were lifted later in the evening and vehicular traffic on all the roads was restored after the Karnal police released all those farmers who had been rounded up from Bastara toll plaza. Police had resorted to a lathicharge on farmers when they were trying to block the Delhi-Chandigarh highway to protest against BJP’s state-level meeting headed by Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. Charuni was the first to react after the police action and released a video in which he appealed to farmers from across the state to reach Bastara and other toll plazas in large numbers. After some time, he himself reached Bastara to join protests by farmers. “This type of action will not be tolerated,” said Charuni. The SKM, an umbrella organisation of farm groups, also appealed to farmers to block roads to express their solidarity against the police action on farmers in Karnal. Due to growing outrage amongst the farmers over the police action, protesters gathered in large numbers at several toll plazas and blocked both national and state highways. The protesters vowed to continue their siege of the roads till the police released all those who had been arrested after the police action. The standoff between farmers and police affected traffic movement on Ambala-Delhi national highway, Panipat-Rohtak-Jaipur national highway, and other highways, including the Eastern and Western Peripheral highways too were blocked. Farmers of Punjab and Haryana jointly blocked NH-44 (Panipat-Jalandhar-Amritsar) at Devi Nagar village toll plaza on Shambhu border and NH-152 (Chandigarh-Hisar) at Saini Majra village toll plaza. Police asked commuters with cars and two-wheelers to take alternative routes, while the heavy vehicles were stuck in jams at several places. In Kurukshetra, farmers blocked NH-44 at Shahabad and Umri village, NH-152 at Thana village toll plaza, near Karah Sahib, and Tikri villages in Pehowa and Kurukshetra-Saharanpur road at Ladwa town. In Yamunanagar, farmers blocked NH-344 (Ambala-Roorkee) near Kail village intersection on the highway. In Kurukshetra’s Shahabad town, farmers said, "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Haryana today reminded us of Jallianwala Bagh massacre when unarmed people were brutally massacred by the British; similarly, the Haryana police brutally lathicharged farmers on Bastara toll plaza in Karnal." In Jind, farmers put up a barricade at Uchana Kalan town, represented by Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. They also blocked Baddowal toll plaza on Hisar-Chandigarh highway, Khatkar toll plaza, Jind-Delhi highway at Gatauli village, near Punjab-Haryana border at Ujhana village, Jind-Barwala road at Intal Kalan village, Jind-Chandigarh highway at Kandela village, Jind-Karnal highway at Alewa village, and some local routes as well. Farmers blocked highways at several points in Hisar, Sirsa and Fatehabad too. In Hisar, they started gathering at Ramayan toll plaza, Surewala Chowk, Chikanwas toll plaza and Chaudharywas toll plaza. In Rohtak, activists assembled at Sheila Bypass Chowk. They also kept roads blocked at Kitlana toll plaza, Dhanana village and Prem Nagar village in Bhiwani district.

According to the varsity records, degree certificates have been pending for the last seven years. Now, the monitoring committee has sought a report from the university administration in this regard. Firozabad MLA Manish Asija, who is the head of the monitoring committee, said, “We had conducted a meeting with the university administration over issues concerning students. It surfaced that Agra university had a pendency of 8.5 lakh degree certificates of students who had passed out from different courses in the last seven years. The university administration was directed to compile a report of pending degree certificates according to the sessions and courses and issue them to students in a phased manner. Besides, the university administration was asked to change 94 employees who had been serving on the same portal for over 10 years. There were several other recommendations which the committee had made to ease out inconvenience faced by the students and to put a tab on the scope of malpractices.” “Even after much delay, the varsity administration didn't inform us about the action taken on the recommendations made by the committee. An action taken report has been sought from the university administration,” he said. Examination controller of Agra university, AK Yadav, said, “We are working on the recommendations made by the monitoring committee. In this regard, a detailed plan is being prepared.

The state got 19 lakh doses from the Centre and has dispatched these to districts—including 75,000 to Mumbai —to exhaust the stock quickly. Of these, 15.7 lakh are Covishield doses needed for almost 97% beneficiaries due for the second dose. Around 3.7 lakh Covaxin doses have been sent too. According to state data, more than 16.1 lakh people are due for the second dose of Covishield and over 7.75 lakh for the second Covaxin jab. Maharashtra's National Health Mission commissioner Ramaswami N told TOI: “We expect to get more vaccines in September, so we are trying to cover maximum beneficiaries due for the second dose in time.” On the stress on maximum coverage on Monday, he said, “We have told the districts to finish off the latest lot of doses so that we could get more vaccines from the Centre and increase the coverage further. The sooner the doses are administered and exhausted, we can demand more vaccines thereafter.” Meanwhile, of the 1.3 lakh people who got vaccinated in Mumbai on Saturday, 50,734 doses were given at BMC-run centres while 79,389 were administered at private centres. The total number of doses given out in Mumbai since January 16 are 91.4 lakh, including 24 lakh people who are fully vaccinated with two doses. According to the state vaccine data, 9.9 lakh people got vaccinated on Friday, taking the number of doses distributed so far to 5.63 crore. Ramaswami said the state was expected to get around 30 lakh vaccine doses for school teachers as a special case in the next three to four days. “Overall, the country will provide around two crore doses to the states to vaccinate school teachers. Maharashtra usually gets around 10% of the total quantity,” he said. The state health ministry wants to vaccinate between nine and 15 lakh people every day so that it can cover the eligible population within the next three months. Ramaswami said all districts have to ensure that due dates do not lapse. “Some states in India have allocated a certain number of days in a week to give the second dose only. We are analysing the district-wise due lists and, if necessary, we may go for such an arrangement too,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/1-3l-jabs-in-city-in-a-day-drive-in-state-with-19l-fresh-doses/articleshow/85726418.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Delhi government services at doorstep: Plan renewed for another year||NEW DELHI: Delhi cabinet on Saturday gave its go-ahead for renewing the AAP government’s doorstep delivery of services scheme for another term. Accessing public services at home will get easier as the 1076 helpline will become toll-free. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said doorstep delivery of public services had received massive support from the people of Delhi and the cabinet was renewing it with enhanced features and new vendors. “It is a landmark measure of the Delhi government that provides the people of Delhi the facility to avail about 150 services from their homes. All they have to do is call 1076 and then an officer comes to their home and gets the work done. This is one-of-a kind service not just in India, but also the entire world,” Kejriwal said. “A lot of enhancements will be implemented in the next phase of the service. This includes making the 1076 number toll-free and dividing the work between two vendors. It will bring a positive sense of competition that will further benefit the citizens. We will soon float tenders for the next phase of the project,” the CM added. Under the new doorstep delivery regime, the mobile sahayaks who will be responsible for providing the last-mile facility will be aided with modern technology and apps consisting of a bouquet of enhanced features, which will help them in facilitating the services to the citizens. The mobile sahayaks will take a nominal fee of Rs 50. “As and when government services get established with faceless provision, a gradual closure of the sub-divisonal, regional and physical windows of departments concerned (will take place). This will apply to all such services that can be accessed in a faceless manner which the citizens can access through the internet. For anyone who cannot, for some reason, access the digital services, the option of doorstep delivery will always be available,” the state government said in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-services-at-doorstep-plan-renewed-for-another-yr/articleshow/85722500.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Kochi||Kerala: Some groups trying to trap our girls, says Pala bishop||KOTTAYAM: The bishop of Pala diocese of the Syro-Malabar Church has written a letter addressed to the priests of the diocese on alerting the families under their diocese about “some sections and groups trying to trap the girls of the diocese”. Bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt has neither mentioned about the real intentions of these groups nor have expressed the willingness to go ahead with a complaint in the letter dated August 28. The letter assumes significance as Pala diocese had come up strongly against the issue of ‘Love Jihad’ a few months ago. The Kerala Catholic Bishop Council (KCBC) has also been constantly saying that ‘Love jihad’ exists in the state. Meanwhile, the diocese preferred not to divulge more details about the ‘group’ which is trying to trap the girls. However, the bishop said in the letter that this group has come up with a new tactic of contacting girls pretending as a former priest of their parish. For this, they first contact a local body representative or a respected person in the region and convince that person that the caller used to be a priest of the parish in the region. In the next move, the person says that he is currently in a foreign country and needs the contact numbers of young girls in the region to get their feedback on a certain topic which is needed for a paper presentation in the foreign country. The caller also asks the local resident to inform the girls that he will be contacting them in five minutes. After the initial conversation with the girls, the style of talk and topic totally changes, said the letter. The bishop urged all the priests to alert the families under their parish about such attempts. Meanwhile, Fr Joseph Thadathil, vicar general of the Pala diocese, said that such incidents have been noticed in the last three-four months and many girls underwent mental trauma. He also said that the callers are seeking contacts of girls from 16-22 age groups. “It is not sure whether the intention is religious, drugs or sex,” he said. He said that the Church wants to make its members aware of such a problem. “If the problem continues, we may demand a probe,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/some-groups-trying-to-trap-our-girls-pala-bishop/articleshow/85724179.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Delhi||Delhi-to-Noida on the fast track as CM Arvind Kejriwal opens Mayur Vihar cloverleaf||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the ‘cloverleaf’ ramps and service roads on Mayur Vihar Phase-I flyover in east Delhi on Saturday. Kejriwal said that the cloverleaf would bring a lot of relief to the people of Delhi and ease the way for those commuting between Delhi and Noida. He claimed that infrastructure projects now get completed before deadlines and under the estimated budget. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Public Works Department minister Satyendar Jain were also present for the inauguration. The new ramps and service roads were constructed by the PWD as part of the Phase-III of the Barapullah elevated corridor project connecting Mayur Vihar in east Delhi to Sarai Kale Khan. A PWD official said that the ramps and service roads would save approximately 1.5 km of the travel distance for commuters. “The traffic congestion for hours, which resulted in chaos during the peak office hours on the route, will end after the opening of the ramps and service roads,” the official explained. The 800-metre-long flyover was constructed by the PWD and opened for traffic in January 2019, but its loops, which were to provide seamless connectivity between Mayur Vihar-I and other parts of Delhi, were under construction. One loop will allow the traffic coming from Noida to come down from the flyover and drive towards Mayur Vihar-I. The other will start from Mayur Vihar-I side and join the flyover towards Akshardham. The length of each cloverleaf will be 300 metres. Kejriwal said, “The service roads, cloverleaf loop, ramps and cycle track are being inaugurated today. This will bring a huge relief to the people of this region as well as the entire East Delhi area from traffic jams. Since the Aam Aadmi Party has come into power, lots of developmental projects have been taken up by various departments. PWD finishes projects before deadlines, completes them not only within the estimated costs but also saves money, and crafts more and more sustainable and cost-effective designs.We will now take Delhi’s infrastructure to a whole new level.” The chief minister later tweeted: “Inaugurated the new ‘Cloverleaf’ built on Mayur Vihar Phase-I Flyover today. With the opening of these loops and ramps of the Barapullah Phase-III, the people of Delhi will experience a lot of convenience in travelling. Especially people travelling between Delhi and Noida will benefit a lot from it (sic).” आज मयूर विहार फेज़-1 फ्लाईओवर पर बने नए ‘क्लोवरलीफ़’ की शुरुआत की। बारापुला फेज़-3 से जुड़े इन लूप और रैम्प के खुल… https://t.co/zHyrsU85Nm— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1630136605000Deputy CM Sisodia said the project would give great relief to the people of East Delhi from traffic jams.

In his letter, Deshmukh has stated that local government bodies have failed to curb the menace of illegal sand mining in various areas of the district. Disclosing the locations to the green court, Deshmukh said that mining is taking place on a large-scale at Khapapeth, Wakodi, Tembhurdoh, Ramdongri, Walni, Rayawadi, Isapur, Rohana and many more river banks aligned with the Kanhan river. Stating that as per norms, sand mining activities are to be completely halted post June 30, Deshmukh demanded that a joint committee be formed in order to investigate the matter. “Penalty should be imposed against the respondent, government officers and other persons who are involved in the illegal activity,” he said. The politician further added that a sand mining policy should look into the institutionalized scientific mining and management of sand along with use of IT-enabled services for monitoring. “Movement and transportation routes should be clearly stipulated in order to reduce the impact on nearby villages and its habitants,” he said. Deshmukh warned that illegal sand-mining is bound to cause not just long-term adverse impact on environment but also might cause a major disaster. “At many places, excess mining is taking place without pillar demarcation of the leased areas. It is also leading to weakening of bridges built on river. Trucks carrying heavy loads are also damaging roads,” he said. Stating that the agenda of illegal sand mining is of national importance, Deshmukh pointed out that sand is a crucial part of healthy ecosystem of rivers. “With depletion of sand beds, water crisis is bound to increase drastically if stern action is not taken immediately,” he said while appealing to the registrar to intervene urgently in the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/investigate-illegal-sand-mining-at-kanhan-banks-ex-mla-to-ngt/articleshow/85724214.cms||Manka Behl

From mid-May till July-end, DentalDost has screened over 1,200 people for mucormycosis and over 7,000 people for overall health through its free dental helpline, WhatsApp chatbot and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered app. “We have diagnosed 26 cases of mucormycosis from among the 1,200 people we had screened,” said Bhanushali. “Of the 26 cases, around 19 were not very serious, but seven were so serious that I feel glad we could diagnose in time,” said the doctor, who works with a team of 110 dental experts across the country.  Her team has come across a maximum of such cases from Gujarat and Maharashtra though the number has decreased since mid-July. “We have developed an AI technology which can scan photos of oral cavity uploaded on our app to find out whether they replicate mucormycosis cases. If required, we send the patient to the nearest oral surgeon partner who, if required, suggests oral fungal culture or a few scans. Once these are done, we get to know whether the patient is positive for mucormycosis. Accordingly, treatment is carried out,” she said. “One can also approach us by calling our helpline or bymessaging on WhatsApp chatbot,” said Bhanushali, who has been leveraging technology to bring oral care to the masses. The startup is now focusing its resources on detecting oral cancer. “We want to detect oral cancer via smartphone with the help of the technology we have developed and motivate patients to get intervention done at an early stage,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/startup-leverages-technology-to-bring-oral-care-to-masses/articleshow/85724172.cms||Avijit Chatterjee

---||Bareilly||UP: 15 months on, 12 Tablighis freed by Bareilly court||BAREILLY: Fifteen months after they were booked for “negligence” and “disobedience” of Covid norms, 12 Tablighi Jamaat members have now been acquitted of all charges by the chief judicial magistrate of Bareilly. Among them are nine Thai nationals, their two translators and a caretaker of the mosque in Shahjahanpur they were living in after attending the Jamaat congregation in Delhi. The Thai nationals can go home soon. “I was told by the court that my clients have been found not guilty and were acquitted,” said Milan Gupta, counsel for the Jamaat members. The order was passed verbally. “The judgment copy is not delivered instantly on acquittal. We have applied for it and it should be available after the court opens on Tuesday.” In early March last year, thousands of people gathered at the Nizamuddin Markaz (centre) of Tablighi Jamaat. The ministry of home affairs put the figure of members and primary contacts at 9,000. The Centre later said 2,300 foreign nationals had participated in the event, TOI had reported. The congregation ended by March 15, after which the Centre announced a lockdown. Foreign nationals could not leave the country and stayed on. Among them were the nine Thai nationals, who went to Shahjahanpur and put up at a mosque along with their two translators Hussain Ahmad and Abdul Sardar MS (both of whom were from Tamil Nadu). They, along with the caretaker of the mosque, Masiullah, were arrested on April 1. It was among a spate of such arrests across the country. The ministry of external affairs later, in August last year, said 1,095 lookout notices against Tablighi members were deleted and 630 foreign nationals allowed to leave. The Thai nationals and their Indian friends were charged under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of dangerous disease), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of dangerous disease), 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) of the IPC and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act (disobeying regulations made under the Act). The Thai nationals were also, separately, booked under Section 14 of The Foreigners Act (violating visa rules). Police had taken suo motu cognizance of information from a local intelligence unit official that Masiullah had “concealed” the fact that Jamaat attendees were staying at the mosque. On April 3, one of the Thai nationals tested positive for Covid-19. While they were in jail, their case went to the Allahabad high court which, in November, granted them bail. But because the charges had not been dropped, the passports of the nine Thai nationals were with the police and they couldn’t leave the country. They went back to the mosque in Shahjahanpur. “They don’t speak any language I know. But they start crying sometimes and I can do nothing. They miss home. They have been living at the mosque since November. We have tried to help as much as possible,” Masiullah told TOI. With Friday’s order, they can finally head home. A senior police official in Shahjahanpur told TOI, “Now that the court has acquitted them, their passports will be handed back to them. Some formalities need to be done after a copy of the court order arrives, after which they can leave.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/9-thai-tablighis-3-others-held-in-april-20-freed-by-up-court/articleshow/85722568.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Covid-19: Maharashtra inoculation target tomorrow across state||PUNE: Maharashtra has drawn up a plan to administer maximum possible Covid-19 vaccine shots on Monday from the nearly 19 lakh doses it has dispatched to the districts to exhaust the stock quickly, so that the state government could demand for more supply from the Centre and increase the coverage. Nearly 15.7 lakh Covishield doses, needed for almost 97% beneficiaries due for the second dose, have been dispatched to 35 districts. About 3.71 lakh Covaxin doses have also been sent. The Covaxin distribution was about 47.8% of the number of beneficiaries due for the second dose. According to the state data, over 16.07 lakh people are due for the second dose of Covishield and more than 7.75 lakh for the Covaxin second jab. National Health Mission commissioner, Maharashtra, Dr Ramaswami N told TOI, “We are expected to get more vaccines in September, so we are trying to cover maximum beneficiaries due for the second dose in time. We have instructed all the districts to ensure that due dates do not lapse. Some states in India have allocated certain number of days in a week to give the second dose only. We are analysing the district-wise due lists and if necessary, we may go for such an arrangement too.” Dr Ramaswami said as of now, both first and second doses were being administered parallelly. On the stress on maximum coverage on Monday, Dr Ramaswami said, “We have told the districts to finish off the latest lot of doses so that we could get more vaccines from the Centre and increase the coverage further. The sooner the doses are administered and exhausted, we can demand more vaccines thereafter.” He said the state was expected to get around 30 lakh vaccine doses for school teachers as a special case in the next three to four days. “Overall, the country will provide around two crore doses to the states for vaccinating school teachers. Maharashtra usually gets around 10% of the total quantity,” he said. Another state official said the latest stock dispatched would reach all the districts latest by Sunday, hence maximum vaccinations had been planned in Maharashtra on Monday. “The stock first goes to the regional stores and then to the districts. All stock received from the Union government has been dispatched. Districts have been told to try to finish the maximum vaccine stock with them on Monday by increasing as many vaccination sessions as they need to achieve this goal,” the official said. Another state official said a big chunk of doses received were likely to be given to people needing the second dose. The rest would be administered to those who need the first dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maha-inoculation-target-tomorrow-across-state/articleshow/85724185.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Maharashtra government to discuss curbs on festival gatherings||PUNE: Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Saturday said the Maharashtra government would discuss restrictions about mass gatherings and public events ahead of the festivities, after the Centre wrote to the state suggesting curbs. “We have received this letter from the Union health secretary. The state will now be discussing the way ahead before the festivities,” Kunte told TOI. Dahi handi festival and Ganeshotsav are around the corner. The Centre has advised the state to consider imposing local restrictions on mass events and public gatherings to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In a letter written to the state chief secretary, Kunte, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said though the trajectory of daily new cases had shown a decline over the last month, some districts in the state were showing some early signs of upsurge in cases and test positivity rate. The letter stated that in view of mass events and public gathering expected during the upcoming festivals, the state might “consider imposing and enforcing local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and mass gatherings”. Taking a cue from Kerala, which registered over 30,000 cases in a day after Onam, the state had been told to exercise caution, said a health official. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said, “After the Kerala experience, we do not want to take any chances because cases have just receded after the second wave. We should not behave recklessly to trigger the third wave. So, testing, tracing and isolation should continue aggressively, and we should hopefully be able to control the small peaks being observed after unlock.” Bhushan, the Union health secretary, also directed the state to maintain strict adherence to the five-fold strategy of test, track, treat, vaccinate and ensure Covid appropriate behaviour for managing the pandemic. Dr Joshi said barring the four-five districts of concern, the rest had been registering low Covid-19 positivity rate and appeared to be out of the second wave. Still, the focus should remain on doublemasking as well as intensified vaccination. A similar letter regarding controlling cases was sent to Kerala also post-Onam festivities. State health minister Rajesh Tope said he had spoken to his Kerala counterpart on the sudden increase in Covid cases. The Indian Council of Medical Research and National Centre for Disease Control had earlier raised concerns regarding potential mass gatherings leading to spike in Covid cases, especially in view of the more transmissible variants reported by various states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/govt-to-discuss-curbs-on-festival-gatherings/articleshow/85724205.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol on Saturday told the civic body to withdraw the order following strong objection from shopkeepers and traders. Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar told TOI later in the day the order had been withdrawn with immediate effect. The order signed by the PMC’s deputy commissioner, Madhav Jagtap, was issued on August 25 to the assistant commissioners and ward offices. It sought daily updates on the action taken and fine collection report. It warned of strict action in case of failure to meet the target.  Traders and shopkeepers on Saturday strongly objected to the move. Sachin Nivangune, president of Pune District Retailers’ Association, said, “Such targets of fine collection will lead to registering of false cases and harassment because the civic authorities will target the traders,” Nivangune said.  “I have sought a clarification on what basis the target for fine collection was set,” Mohol said. “There won’t be any target. The intention is to continue with action against violation of Covid norms,” Jagtap said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-purges-rs-10-lakh-daily-fine-target-order/articleshow/85724223.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Insurer liable to pay even if dead driver negligent: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: In an important order, a larger bench of the Gujarat high court has held that an insurance agency is liable to pay compensation for a motor vehicle accident claim for a hired driver in the event of his death, even if the accident is caused due to the driver’s negligence. This liability arises once the insurer has accepted additional premium to cover indemnity of vehicle owner. The issue was before the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath, Justice R M Chhaya and Justice B N Karia when a division bench referred it for adjudication on an appeal filed by the family of one Laxmanbhai Thakore, a driver hired by the Kandla Dock Labour Board for its ambulance. Thakore and two others were killed in an accident in March 2003 while they were carrying a patient in the ambulance from Gandhidham to Ahmedabad. Thakore’s family filed a case for compensation with the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal on the ground that an additional Rs 30 used to be paid as Indian Motor Tariff Endorsement by the employee towards legal liability for driver and conductor. The tribunal rejected the claim in 2017 on the ground that the accident had occurred due to the driver’s mistake, and the issue landed in the high court. A division bench referred the issue whether the insurer is liable to pay compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. For the appellant family, it was argued that irrespective of negligence of the deceased, the insurer would be liable to pay the entire compensation. This is because additional premium was paid and accepted and hence it was the insurer’s liability on the principles embodied under the Workman Compensation Act irrespective of negligence. After hearing the case, the HC concluded that once additional premium for driver on pay shas been accepted, the deceased’s family can claim compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. “In our opinion, by accepting additional premium, the Insurance Company indemnifies the owners for paid Driver and/or Conductor and risk of Driver/Conductor is covered under it. Upon death or injury caused to the paid Driver and/or Conductor, the Insurance Company would be liable to satisfy such claim irrespective of the self-negligence,” the larger bench observed and asked the division bench to decide the appeal accordingly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/insurer-liable-to-pay-even-if-dead-driver-negligent-hc/articleshow/85724225.cms||---

A probe ordered by the state government on Friday is looking into the reasons for the fall of the almost six-decade-old bridge. Public Works Department (PWD) chief engineer Hariom Sharma, who is heading the probe, said, “Initial investigation has revealed that the damage at Ranipokhari was not due to construction defects, but due to the flow of water that got concentrated at several points around the bridge. We are trying to establish a temporary road, but waterlogging in the area is making the task difficult.” “The repair work has been initiated. Teams have reached the site and are taking stock of the situation,” Sharma added. Another pillar later gave way. Ranipokhari station officer Jitendra Chauhan had said the sudden increase in water level in the river due to heavy rain submerged the pillars that held the bridge, resulting in its crash.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ranipokhari-bridge-fall-main-approach-road-from-doon-to-rishikesh-still-closed-to-traffic/articleshow/85722590.cms||Abhijeet Singh

There were no students in the college at that time. The forest department has rescued one of the cubs while two are untraceable. The cub was released in the adjoining sugarcane fields so that it could be reunited with its mother. Forest officials claimed a leopardess was spotted carrying away one cub on the intervening night between Friday and Saturday. The mother leopard may have taken away the other cub as well. However, they are keeping vigil on the college campus. “Initially, we thought they were kittens but soon realized our mistake and immediately informed the forest department,” said Ranveer Singh, manager of the college. Najibabad ranger Ravindra Shrivastava said, "SSD College, spread across 50 bighas of land, is located on the outskirts of Najibabad city on Raipur road. It is adjacent to sugarcane fields. A hospital is also located on its campus. Paddy is cultivated on its empty swathes of land. However, the college is protected by boundary walls." The ranger said, “ The leopard cubs somehow entered the premises of the institute on Thursday night. They were spotted by staff on Friday around 7am. The cubs are four to five months old. They were running from one place to another in the premises of the college and hospital. Our team, led by SDO Harendra Singh, rushed to the scene. By then, the cubs had fled into the paddy fields.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data revealed that regular vaccination dipped by 20% during the second wave of the pandemic. In April, the civic administration had appealed to the parents of children, who have missed regular vaccination, to complete the doses at the earliest. But lockdownlike restrictions and fear of getting infected had kept many parents away from approaching civic hospitals for routine vaccination. “Now parents are visiting our centres and vaccinating their children,” said Anjali Tilekar, medical officer, Kothurd ward office. The officials added that talks of a possible third wave and its impact on children also led to an increase in regular vaccination. “Though children are not getting jabs against Covid-19, having completed regular vaccination gives a psychological relief to parents. So, they are coming forward and completing the vaccination,” said a senior PMC official. According to medical practitioners, vaccination is a must for protecting the children from hepatitis, polio, pneumonia etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/regular-vaccination-of-children-back-on-track-after-relaxations/articleshow/85724253.cms||Prasad Kulkarni
---||Pune||Residents in Pune donate to buy ambulance, provide for food & travel of workers||PUNE: From pooling in funds for an ambulance to arranging for food and travel for construction workers, residents of Raheja Vista Premiere in NIBM Annexe area went the extra mile in ensuring the well-being of their neighbours and the needy during the second wave of Covid-19 and the restrictions. While some core committee members donated funds to buy an old ambulance, others contributed with their skills to fix it up with essential equipment. The housing society has 305 flats. Krishnan Venkiteswaran, a core committee member, said, they decided to invest in an ambulance looking at how people were being charged exorbitantly for ambulance services at a time when they were already under a lot of mental, physical and financial stress. “Those from neighbouring societies can also avail the service. While it is equipped with an oxymeter, oxygen tank and bed, we do not have a ventilator as yet. We have put up a board with the phone number to call when one needs an ambulance for medical emergency. Five people, including two residents and three security guards, are on call in different shifts 24x7. Since the start of this service in May, we have had two cases from our own society where the ambulance was required to transport the patients to the hospital,” he added. The residents keep track of how many people have been inoculated on the premisesCharuhas Sonar, another resident, said the ambulance service comes at a nominal rate. “The rate was decided after consulting with various hospitals. The other expenses or maintenance, repair, purchase of equipment was done through our own pockets,” he said. The residents also participated in food distribution drives. “The women in the society would cook extra food at home, pack it and leave it in a box in the lobby. Every evening, the committee members would then go and distribute the food to the poor,” Radha Krishnan, another resident, said. Coming to the rescue of migrant workers, who were on the job at another tower on the premises when the restrictions were enforced, the residents arranged for them to travel back to their home towns. “Most workers hailed from West Bengal and its neighbouring states. We took the initiative of arranging for four buses over two days to transport over 130 migrant workers to go back home for free. We also packed food for them for their travel,” Vivian Mascarenhas, another core committee member, said. The residents also volunteered to distribute tea and snacks to police personnel at check points in the area to show appreciation for their hard work during the pandemic. “At 4pm every day, a few residents would go down and serve tea and some snacks to our security staffers as well. Every day, a different resident would volunteer to arrange it,” Rohit Mahajan, another resident, said. Society members also facilitated the vaccination of their housekeeping staff, security guards and house helps. “In two days, we collected funds from residents to get 34 staffers and domestic helps vaccinated. We put out an appeal on our WhatsApp group to encourage each household to sponsor the vaccination of one employee and everyone came forward. By the first week of July, all of them completed their first dose. They will be up for their second dose soon. Since we had some funds left over, we extended the initiative to their immediate families as well. Everyone who took their shots was given one day off to recover from any side-effects,” Shoeb Jatu, in-charge of keeping track of the vaccination initiative, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/residents-donate-to-buy-ambulance-provide-for-food-travel-of-workers/articleshow/85724235.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

In the past eight months nearly 90 such cases were reported in the district. In comparison, 104 cases were reported in 2020. CWC officials said a majority of sexual abuse cases of minors were reported from plantation areas, and cited the latest incident that occurred at Manchumala in Vandiperiyar where a 50-year-old man was held for sexually abusing an eight-year-old girl, a migrant worker’s daughter. According to Vandiperiyar police the accused, identified as Anthoni Raj, abused the girl while she was asleep at her home alone as her parents had gone away to visit a family. Raj has been remanded to police custody. Idukki CWC chairman Joseph Augustine said such assaults on minors have largely increased during the lockdown period. "Nearly 90 cases were reported in the past eight months. The CWC and district child protection units are planning to provide counselling to parents and children," said Augustine. "The reality is that the number of such abusers has been increasing in the society. The criminals do not get punished due to poor investigations," said the official. Consultant psychiatrist Dr C J John said the children who come under such assaults are mostly those who are left alone without a responsible caretaker to look after them. "Idukki is not densely-populated and especially in the plantation areas the isolation of the children increases the risk of abuse," said John. "A community-level shelter home for children in plantation areas will go a long way in preventing such issues. In some cases, the abusers took pictures of the victims and used them to threaten them. To stay safe, the students must avoid sharing their devices or phone numbers with others without permission from parents. In addition, the parents should regularly keep a track on the digital lives of the children," said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/abuse-of-minors-90-cases-in-8-months/articleshow/85724289.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Assistant inspector Bhaskar Navle said a case of accidental death has been registered and statements are being recorded to ascertain the chronology of events. Pooja More, an activist associated with the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, blamed illegal sand lifting for the creation of deep pits on the river banks. “We have been asking for dedicated platforms for washing utensils and clothes, so that women and children do not have to risk their lives by stepping on slippery sections of the riverbank,” she said. She cited that on May 9, a woman and her son had drowned at Sangam Jalgaon, and on June 2, a woman, her daughter, and a niece had drowned.

The protesters contested Modi’s “moral right” to get involved in the event, the morcha added. In the meanwhile, the protesting farmers in Punjab expressed their anger and support to Haryana farmers by burning effigies of Haryana government at various places. The effigy was also burnt near a private firm’s dry port at Kila Raipur in Ludhiana and at Tikri border. Farm organisation BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said: “The way the official is heard asking policemen to hit on the head (of) those trying to go towards BJP event, (it seems the government) want(s) another Jalianwala Bagh to be made. This shows the real face of BJP, but farmers will not stop protesting.” Another SKM leader Darshan Pal said Haryana police were targeting peaceful protesters and SKM, taking serious note of it, would not sit back. BKU’s Rakesh Tikait said it was tactic of BJP government to stop farmers from Haryana from going to Muzzafarnagar on September 5, where ‘Mission UP’ was being started. Seeks SDM’s sacking:SKM demanded the immediate dismissal of Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha for allegedly giving orders to police to attack farmers. It brought disgrace and shame to the Indian democracy and the farm movement could not be suppressed by such barbaric acts, it added||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/skm-condemns-police-action-in-karnal-amritsar/articleshow/85726468.cms||Neel Kamal

When Hindus cease to be in majority, all these virtues will be finished. He said this on Friday at the dedication of Bharat Mata temple on in Gandhinagar. Asked to clarify his statement on Saturday, Patel said that Hindus are liberal in their thinking and so democracy is flourishing in the country. “This is my personal opinion. Democracy works where the majority embrace the values of a democracy. In countries where people who believe that only what they say is right, the rule of law, democracy and judiciary are compromised. Afghanistan is the latest example of this,” Patel said on Saturday. Earlier on Friday, however, he had minced no words in saying, “Mark my words. As long as Hindus are in majority in the country, these people will talk of Constitution, rule of law, secularism. God forbid, if after 1,000 or 2,000 years the number of Hindus becomes less and others’ increases, there will not be any courts, any Lok Sabha, any Constitution. Nothing will remain.” He went on to say, “Let me clarify. I am not talking of everybody. Lakhs of Muslims are patriotic. Lakhs of Christians are patriotic. Thousands of Muslims are in the Indian army. Scores of Muslims are in Gujarat’s police force. They all are patriots.” On Saturday, Patel said that there are several countries where extremist ideologies are prevalent. “In such countries, women are denied their rights. The rule of law is absent.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hindu-majority-guards-democracy/articleshow/85724286.cms||---

The fraudsters created a login for the victim on a fake website to play the online task. The victim realised that she was being duped when the commission did not get deposited after she credited Rs 3 lakh to the e-wallet for taking up the new task. Immediately after her login was created, Rs 68 got shown as credited to a fake online e-wallet. “This made the victim trust the fraudsters and she continued to take up the task. After every task, the fraudster credited the wallet with a small sum and gained her trust. We have collected details of the transaction from the bank and internet protocol (IP) address to track the fraudster,” an officer from the Charkop police station said. After the victim completed the first task, the fraudster made her recharge the wallet with Rs 200 and immediately the wallet was credited with Rs 380. Two days later, the fraudster again called her and asked whether she was ready for a big challenge to earn a big sum and asked her to complete 12 tasks for which she was asked to transfer Rs 3 lakh to the wallet. “I found out I was duped when I did not receive the money, and when I called the fraudster I was informed that I have failed to complete the 12 tasks and has completed only 10,” the victim said in her complaint. She said the fraudster had got in touch with her on WhatsApp.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-online-game-fraud-leaves-27-year-old-poorer-by-rs-3l/articleshow/85727638.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

In another incident, two NCB officials were injured while they were trying to catch a Nigerian drug peddler. Continuing its operation called ‘Rolling Thunder’ against the drug peddlers and users, the NCB in the last two days carried out raids at 15 different places in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai and arrested seven persons including two Nigerian nationals, local peddlers and actor Gaurav Dixit, who was on the run since April this year. The NCB on Friday arrested Dixit. He was produced before a court and remanded in NCB custody till August 30. The agency had in April arrested another actor Ejaz Khan in a drug case.

Authorities concerned said these children were found absent at the network of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), better known as Anganwadis, during the crucial state-level exercise. Launched on August 23, the ‘search operation’ has identified 1,2010 SAM children and 6,609 MAM children from target age groups. The drive, which is scheduled to get concluded by August 31, aims to identify and treat nearly six lakh malnourished children in Maharashtra. Deputy chief executive officer of Aurangabad zilla parishad Prasad Mirkale on Saturday said that efforts were on to locate the non-traceable children before the drive ends. “The search operation is being conducted through Anganwadis and our health teams found certain target population to be screened absent during the search operation. The local authorities have been asked to reach out to these children and record their health parameters,” he said. As per the standard operating procedure, malnourished children will be given nourished drinks and food through Anganwadis. “It is important to reach out SAM and MAM children ahead of the prediction of the possible third wave of Covid-19. These children will remain under the focus till the pandemic is over and thereafter also till their health parameters become normal,” Mirkale said. The aforesaid search operation has covered 2,781 Anganwadis so far which were having 28,672 registered children up to six months and another 2.09 lakh children aged between seven months and six years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/over-18k-target-children-non-traceable-in-search-operation-for-malnourished-children/articleshow/85720707.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Aurangabad||Bizman gets 1-month imprisonment||Aurangabad: Judicial magistrate first class, Aurangabad, V H Khedkar has awarded a 35-year-old businessman one-month imprisonment and slapped a fine of 9% per annum for dishonouring a cheque of Rs 2.4 lakh. Khedkar, while convicting Abhishek Mantri and sentencing him to simple imprisonment of one month, directed him to pay compensation Rs 3,33,600 to the complainant within three months. In case of default, he will face simple imprisonment of three months. City-based spare parts dealer Mohammed Ashraf had decided to purchase a 20,000 sqft plot in the Nakshatrawadi area, which belonged to Mantri and his mother Sujata, for Rs 38 lakh. Accordingly in October 2012, an earnest amount of Rs 5.7 lakh was paid to them, followed by another instalment of Rs 2 lakh in cash. Representing the complainant, lawyer Sachin Sarda submitted that despite the complainant being ready to purchase the property by making the remaining payment, the mother-son duo failed to execute the sale deed in favour of the complainant. Later, it was decided that Mantris would return the amount in instalments. As a part of the deal, a cheque of Rs 2.4 lakh was given to the complainant in March 2017, but was dishonoured due to “insufficient funds”. After a legal notice was issued, Mantri duo failed to repay the amount, following which a complaint was made before the JMFC. JMFC Khedkar, while citing Supreme Court directives, ruled that “It needs to maintain uniformity by awarding 9% per annum interest on the cheque amount by way of compensation to the complainant.’ While deciding the term of sentence, the JMFC observed: “The object of the Act is to enhance the credibility of negotiable instruments. The accused is a young age person. Thus, considering the age of accused, nature and manner of the offence, in my opinion, sentence to suffer simple imprisonment for one month will be proper and justified.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/bizman-gets-1-month-imprisonment/articleshow/85720722.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Aurangabad||Vaccination camps in colleges at Nanded||CLEARED SKHER Aurangabad: The Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU), Nanded has asked colleges to make necessary arrangements for facilitating institute-level Covid vaccination camps for inoculating staff and students. University Vice Chancellor Udhav Bhosle on Saturday said Nanded district administration has agreed to allocate specific quota of doses for carrying out the immunisation drive. “To begin with, the maiden vaccination camp was held on our campus for the benefit of staff. More such drives are being planned soon for which affiliated colleges need to have proper space and other required facilities,” he said. Asking colleges to ensure cent per cent vaccination of staff and students, the university administration has said that colleges not having a particular place for holding vaccination camps should seek the help of the district administration in choosing an alternative venue. Notably, Maharashtra higher and technical education minister Uday Samant during his recent visit to Marathwada had asked Nanded district administration and university authorities to come out with a model for resuming the normal functioning of colleges during the current pandemic. “Considering the contained spread of Covid-19 within the jurisdiction of our university, efforts are on to resume actual classes in colleges. While planning to this effect is being charted out with the help of respective district administrations, an official nod from the state government is a must before arriving at any decision,” Bhosle said. Having its jurisdiction over Nanded, Hingli, Latur and Parbhani districts, SRTMU has over 300 affiliated colleges that have been asked to gear up for the vaccination camps.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/vaccination-camps-in-colleges-at-nanded/articleshow/85720736.cms||---

---||Kochi||Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese to appeal to Pope||KOCHI: A day after the synod of the Syro Malabar Church decided to establish uniformity in the holy mass, priests of the Ernakulam Angamaly archdiocese, which opposes the move, on Saturday made their objection public and demanded dispensation in a press conference held at Ernakulam Bishop's House. The priests who met archbishop Antony Kariyil, the metropolitan vicar of the archdiocese to discuss the issue said the bishop has promised to take necessary action for filing an appeal against the synod’s decision before Pope Francis. At the same time, the Syro Malabar Church is going ahead with the decision with cardinal George Alencherry writing a pastoral letter urging the faithful against raising disagreements over the issue. “During the pandemic times, the faithful found it confusing when they observed differences in masses broadcasted from various dioceses online. The Holy See was also surprised by the non-uniformity in the Church’s holy mass,” the letter issued with the direction to read it in churches during Sunday mass on September 5, says. In the letter Alencherry said Pope Francis, through a letter addressed to members of Syro Malabar Church, had exhorted liturgical uniformity and that every faithful person in the church had a duty to obey him. But the priests of the Ernakulam Angamaly archdiocese have said that they have requested the metropolitan vicar to not send the pastoral letter to parishes as reading it may even cause a law and order issue in their diocese. The priests said that they have also urged the archbishop not to force them into reading it at churches. The priests of the archdiocese, including presbyteral council secretary Fr Kuriakose Mundadan and PRO of the archdiocese Fr Mathew Kilukkan, made the comments while addressing the press conference. Fr Kilukkan said that bishop Kariyil has promised the priests that he will discuss the matter with other bishops and do the needful for filing an appeal against the synod’s decision before the Pope so that the decision be reconsidered. The priests have also demanded that the archbishop make arrangements for maintaining the status quo till Vatican announces its decision. Fr Mundadan said that canon laws permit granting of dispensation based on special circumstances to a general rule and that they believe that they will receive dispensation. He added that they are opposing the new style of conducting the mass for theological reasons. Fr Jose Vailikodath, a senior priest, said that the synod was presided over by a person (cardinal Alencherry) who has several police FIRs filed against him and that he recently faced a setback in the high court as well. This is just an effort to divert the topic, he said in the press meet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/ekm-angamaly-archdiocese-to-appeal-to-pope/articleshow/85724325.cms||---

---||Kochi||Time to review wildlife law: Prof Madhav Gadgil||KOCHI: It is high time that the wildlife protection Act be re-examined, and conservation methods be made more practical and pro-people. The forest departments in India are using these rules to deny people their right to life and livelihood, said the country’s leading ecologist Prof Madhav Gadgil. “According to IPC section 100 and 103, if an intruder enters your home and poses a threat to your life and property, you have a right to defend and even kill. If this is the rule for humans, why is the forest department and WPA protecting the wild boars and punishing poor farmers for attacking the animals. While you can kill the animal in self-defence, you can burn it but can’t eat it. Why?” he asked. Gadgil was speaking at a webinar on ‘Role of environment in the rebuilding of Nava Keralam’ organized by the Abhimanyu memorial centre. “We are one of the leading hungriest nations in the world. If conservation has led to an unusual rise in the population of wild boars, tigers or elephants, people should be allowed to shoot it if they are under attack or their crops are being destroyed. If the wild boar’s meat is nutritious, why can’t the farmers who shoot it, be allowed to eat it?” Countries like Finland, Sweden and Norway have declared that wildlife remains a renewable resource. “The best way to conserve it is through regulated harvest. Population of every animal will continue to grow, if unchecked,” he said. Development and nature conservation should go hand in hand, and it has to be sustainable, he added. The forest department is the only department in the country which does not listen to the panchayats and they remain mute spectators to violations of destruction of green cover as seen in Goa, he said. He attacked CPM for not paying Rs 260 crore as damages to the people of Plachimada and accused the government of wasting crores of money on planting trees without following up on whether they survive or not. Commenting about the WGEEP report, he accused the state government of not translating the copy into Malayalam as the report clearly puts the onus of protection of nature on the panchayats and people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/time-to-review-wildlife-law-gadgil/articleshow/85724377.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Today, because of the expertise of doctors and their capacity to take right decisions, we are day-by-day improving in the health sector, said Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday while stating that “Nagpur is very close to being an all-round medical hub”. Gadkari was speaking at the launch of Advanced Heart Failure Clinic and Heart Transplant Programme started by Viveka Hospitals in collaboration with MGM Healthcare, Chennai.

Viveka has done an excellent job in setting up this heart transplant clinic,” he said. The minister hoped that in the days to come, there will be facilities for other organ transplants too. “This collaboration will be highly rewarding for the Nagpur city and citizens of the neighbouring states too, as people will not need have to travel to different places for transplant surgery,” he said. Dr KR Balakrishnan, director, Institute of Heart and Lung Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support, MGM Healthcare, Chennai, said, “Organ transplantation is not an easy task. There are many challenges. Several times delays in commute cost patients their life. It is good to see Nagpur evolving in terms of medical sciences.

---||Meerut||High alert in 7 UP dists as Kalagarh dam water level a ‘metre below danger mark’||Bijnor: Incessant rains in Uttarakhand hills have posed a serious threat to at least seven districts in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh as storage levels at Kalagarh dam on Ramganga River is at 354.5 metres - just a metre away from authorities requiring to release water. The districts under the threat are Bijnor, Amroha, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and Farrukhabad. The dam authorities have already informed four divisional commissioners, senior police officers and seven district magistrates to take all the precautionary measures. On Saturday, superintendent engineer at Ramganga Dam, Praveen Kumar, said, "This is the first time in 10 years when the water level has touched 354.5m. We have alerted the administration of seven districts of Uttar Pradesh through which the river passes. Due to incessant rain in the hills, water level at the dam is fast rising. It was recorded at 354.5m on Friday. We start releasing water at 355m. This time, we received permission from higher authorities to release water at 356m.” “There is a strong possibility of water level increasing further. And we have limited water storing capacity. We have already told the local administration to inform the villagers about the current situation,” Kumar added. According to officials, the dam is located near the UP-Uttarakhand border. Ramganga River originates from Shivalik mountain range of the Himalayas in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. It enters into Kalagarh village, a plain area of Pauri Garhwal after flowing for 158km. It is a tributary of Ganga. The dam here is used for storing water in monsoon which is later released for production of electricity and irrigation use. The dam’s storage capacity is 365.30m. And, local administration starts releasing water downstream when it reaches 355m. According to officials, any sudden release of water from the dam may cause flooding along the areas near the river banks. Notably, past floods here in 1998, 2000 and 2010 had wreaked havoc on the people. Encroachment into the riverbank area is partly one of the causes of flooding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/high-alert-in-7-up-dists-as-kalagarh-dam-water-level-a-metre-below-danger-mark/articleshow/85722676.cms||Harveer Dabas

The priests, along with their supporters, have announced a protest at the Rudraprayag district headquarters on Sunday. The Rudraprayag protest would be followed by another protest in the Uttarkashi district in the first week of September. “Over a month has passed since the CM assured amendments to the Act and yet no action has been taken,” Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of the Char Dham Tirth Purohit Mahapanchayat told TOI. During his visit to Uttarkashi on July 21, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had announced that the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act would be reviewed. On August 15, he constituted a committee headed by Manohar Kant Dhyani, former Rajya Sabha MP, to look into the act. However, Sati says that with elections barely a few months away, the move to form a committee “appears to be a tactic to delay the matter”. Meanwhile, state government spokesperson and agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal has said that the government is moving ahead with its commitment to review the act. “A committee will look into the matter and after we receive its findings, we will be able to comment further on the issue,” the minister said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/priests-to-intensify-stir-against-devasthanam-board-act-from-today/articleshow/85722673.cms||Kautilya Singh

This year, the new attraction is the black brass idol of Lord Krishna and the gold plated cradle and meenakari embellished cradle. “Gold plated cradles and aluminium ones with floral decorations on it are the most sought after. Depending on the size, they range between Rs 150 and Rs 4,000. This year we have the traditional style cradles with meenakari work on them. They range between Rs 1,000 and Rs 4,000,” said Vinod, a shopkeeper in Aminabad. Major attraction is also the pure silver Krishna idol which ranges from Rs 1,500 to Rs 15,000.

The black brass idols are priced at Rs 750. “The footfall is huge, but we have a limited stock as well since most of the items and handcrafted items were prepared during the lockdown and with limited labour. People are also coming in to buy artificial floral strings, embroidered ‘gota’, dresses with mirror work on them for decorations at home,” said Akhil Kumar, another seller in Aminabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/city-markets-abuzz-with-janmashtami-shoppers/articleshow/85726589.cms||Aditi Singh

Shah told them to achieve the target of administering the first dose of the vaccine to every eligible person by or before September 30. Shah, who is on a three-day visit to Gujarat, chaired a meeting of District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) at the Ahmedabad District Collectorate. Part of Shah’s Lok Sabha constituency, Gandhinagar, falls in the district. The meeting was attended by other local MPs, state ministers and senior officials. “Shah reviewed the status of Covid vaccination in the district and urged officials to carry out the campaign at a fast pace and achieve the target of administering the first dose of vaccination to 100 per cent beneficiaries by September 30. For this, he directed that special camps be carried out in slums and other parts of the district where vaccination number is low,” said an official release. Special camps would also be useful to provide benefits of schemes like Ayushman Bharat, Ujjwala Yojana, NFSA, Old Age Pension and Widow Assistance Scheme to the poorest of the poor, he said.

However, families of the 54 Indian prisoners of war (POWs) captured by Pakistan and still believed to be in jail will be missing their loved ones. The war, the capture and ‘Missing 54’ Indian soldiers from Indian Air Force and Indian Army who never returned home, the displacement of people from Chhamb, which was again captured by Pakistan during the war and the story of Brig Hamir Singh (Vir Chakra), who was captured by Pakistan, were part of the third session of the Military Literature Festival held online on Saturday. Panelists included author and journalist Chander Suta Dogra, Capt Anil Gaur and Brig Hamir Singh in conversation with Capt Yashika Hatwal Tyagi. “India had captured over 90,0000 Pakistani soldiers from the east frontier and Pakistan too had taken 400 Indian soldiers captive. Though India set free all the soldiers of Pakistan after the Shimla agreement of 1972 and Pakistan too released Indian soldiers, they kept back 54 as a bargaining chip. Pakistan denied then and still does so, while the families here are still hopeful that one day their father or brother will return. We won the war, but we failed to bring back our own,” Dogra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/missing-54-part-of-military-lit-fest/articleshow/85726622.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: ASI fears damage to Teen Darwaja monument as traffic goes up||KOLHAPUR: The rise in vehicular movement through the historical Teen Darwaja monument at of Panhala fort has become a cause of concern for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The national agency has written to the Panhala Giristhan Nagar Parishad to stop the vehicular movement. Concerned by the move, locals have questioned why the long-proposed road through the Rede ghat has not taken shape yet. The Panhala fort has historical significance and has a high footfall of visitors throughout the year. Following a landslide last month, the main entrance of the fort is closed and the fort dwellers are using the Teen Darwaja route. ASI’s conservation assistant Vijay Chauhan said, “The repair work of the main road to the fort will take time and the road via Teen Darwaja was allowed only for Panhala dwellers. They do not have any other option to reach the fort. With the easing of Covid restrictions, the tourist count has increased and even cars are coming through the Teen Darwaja.” He said that the vehicular movement, honking and its vibrations will damage the historical structure and hence, they have written a letter to the Panhala Giristhan Nagar Parishad demanding closure of Teen Darwaja for vehicular movement as early as possible. “The structure has already been damaged at a few places and if any there is any further damage, then the Panhala Nagar Parishad will solely be responsible for it,” the letter states. Local residents, however, feel that a permanent solution needs to be found. Amit Jagtap, who lives on the fort, said, “A separate road via Rede ghat was spoken about in the past. If a new road is constructed, then it will be a permanent solution for the local fort dwellers. The historic structure will also be preserved,” he said. Authorities said that the construction of a road to the Panhala fort via Rede ghat area has started. On the very first day, around 100-metre stretch was completed with the help of earth-moving machineries. Rupali Dhadel, chief of the Panhala Giristhan Nagar Parishad, said the forest department has given them permission to construct roads with some terms and conditions. “In the coming two weeks, the road will be made available for commuting on two-wheelers and four-wheelers. This route will remain closed for heavy vehicles and buses,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/asi-fears-damage-to-teen-darwaja-at-panhala-fort-as-traffic-goes-up/articleshow/85720837.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

TOI turns back pages of history along with Raje Mudhoji Bhosale to find out the origin of the red-light area which is now mired in controversyThe first probable historical evidence of the existence of Ganga Jamuna can be traced to the reign of Khanduji Bhosale, alias Chimna Bapu. He had helped the ‘devdasis’ of Ganga Jamuna bring a deity of the Lord Jagannath to the city between 1770-1775 — seven decades after Nagpur was established by Bakht Buland Shah, a Gond king.Unlike the popular belief of the ‘two-sister theory’ of Ganga and Jamuna as the ancestors of the present sex workers, Raje Mudhoji Bhosale, who hails from the royal family of Nagpur, had a different take to share. “Ganga and Jamuna were the two tributaries of the Nag river which had its origin in Lava village. The name of the present locality of the red-light area had originated from the two tributaries of Nag river and not any sisters,” he said.Bhosale, who provided food kits, rations and sanitizers to Ganga Jamuna residents during the lockdown through the Maharaja of Nagpur trust and Lions club, said some settlements were already present on the banks of the two tributaries from the time of the Gond kings. “These residents used to visit Puri (Odisha) to worship Lord Jagannath. Then, the Bhosale dynasty stretched from Atak (somewhere now in Pakistan) to Cuttack,” said Bhosale who is the 11th descendant of Raghuji Bhosale (1st) and 13th of Shivaji Maharaj.“Khanduji Bhosale had triumphed over Bengal and adjoining places six times. The Bhosale kings had revived Puri’s spiritual glory, renovated the temples and resumed the worship and rituals which was discontinued by the Mughals,” said Bhosale. On one such visit, Khanduji met the devdasis from Ganga Jamuna who were on their annual visit to the Jagannath temple. The deity of Jagannath was changing at that time as per the norms after every 12 years. “The Nagpur devdasis requested Khanduji Bhosale to help them take the older deity back to Nagpur. It was permitted,” he said.Bhosale also assigned one of his key commanders, Devajipanth Chorghare, to ensure a temple is set up. “The deity was brought under the patronage of Khanduji and subsequently a temple erected. The temple and the deity still exist which the police department must acknowledge,” he said. “I now intend to undertake a project for a temple facelift as it is not in a good condition now. Since, it was my ancestors who had set up the temple and also facilitated to bring the deity, I will try restore its past glory,” said Bhosale.Bhosale, whose ancestors had got the title of ‘Saina Saheb Subah’ from Shivaji Maharaj, said a Shiva temple was also constructed by his ancestors for the women of Ganga Jamuna.Bhosale said the locality of Ganga Jamuna served the army of the kings who were compelled to spend months together away from their families. “Whichever dynasty it may have served, it was the army which was entertained here,” he said. Bhosale also pointed out that the black stones laid in some lanes of Ganga Jamuna were collected from the hillocks along the two tributaries of the Nag river. Shrikant Sontakke, who had co-authored ‘Adhunik Nagpur’ with the late well-known historian BR Andhare, said the origin of Ganga Jamuna is mired with controversy and ambiguity. “But it has been associated with the Bhosale kings,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/ganga-jamuna-steeped-in-herstory/articleshow/85722678.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kochi||Kerala: Man gets life term for stabbing lover to death in Thrissur||THRISSUR: The Thrissur district additional sessions judge S Bharathi has sentenced a 42-year-old man to life imprisonment on charges of stabbing his lover to death. According to prosecutor Dini P Lakshmanan, the accused, Aabu Thahir, son of Valiyapeedika Veeettil Muhammed of Perumbilavu, Puthiyanchery, had murdered Shameera, 34, daughter of Kombathelppadi Valiyil Veettil Moidunni, Puthiyancherikkavu, Koottukulam around 11pm on September 18, 2015. Ironically, Thahir and Shameer were jailed at the same period, in another attempt to murder case. Subsequently, the family of Thahir had bailed him out and had asked him to discontinue the relationship with Shameera. Accordingly, Thahir had parted company with Shameera though they had stayed together earlier for five years. But on the day when the murder had taken place, both had met while they were proceeding to appearing before the judge in the earlier attempt to murder case, the prosecutor said. They spent the day together. When they returned to the house of Thahir, his family refused to accept them. Thahir’s father did not permit them to enter the house, and following this Thahir and Shameera entered into a bitter quarrel as Shameera asked him to pay solatium for separation. Thahir then stabbed Shameera to death. He confessed the crime to the police officers, the prosecutor said. The prosecution had to rely on circumstantial evidences, since there was no eye witnesses to the assault. The judge has also slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on the accused. The accused will have to undergo another six months of rigorous imprisonment if he fails to remit the fine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/man-gets-life-term-for-stabbing-lover-to-death/articleshow/85724452.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Making phone calls an uphill task for Kalanki villagers||AURANGABAD: Swapnil Thorat-Patil (38), a resident of Kalanki in Kannad tehsil, had learnt about his aunt’s death due to Covid a day later only after he climbed a steep hillock nearly two km away from the village and his cellphone connectivity revived. “I still remember the morning, when I had climbed atop the hillock and my phone came alive. WhatsApp messages, which were sent the night before about my aunt’s death during the first wave of the pandemic, started getting delivered and there were hundreds of missed call alerts. By the time I got to know that my aunt was no more, the funeral was over,” said Patil. Kalanki village, situated along the boundary of Nashik, Jalgaon and Aurangabad districts, is surrounded by hills on four sides and situated in the vicinity of the Gautala wildlife sanctuary. “Every day, several students climb the hillock to attend online classes on their cellphones. Many villagers have to reach the hilltop to get some signal on their phones for online verification with their thumb impressions and receive foodgrain through the public distribution system. It’s an ordeal for the 30,000-odd people living in the village,” Patil said. Many villagers said they had threatened to boycott the 2019 general and Assembly elections to step up their demand for cellphone connectivity at Kalanki. The district administration had then sent officials to pacify the villagers and convince them to cast the ballots. Village sarpanch Laxman Gunjekar (70) told TOI, “The officials had then pledged to ensure cellphone connectivity within three months. Two years have passed since then, but nothing has changed. An indefinite hunger strike by the villagers could be their last resort to get cellphone network at Kalanki.” A villager said after much persuasion, two cellphone towers were installed at Kalanki over two years ago. “But they were never made functional,” he said. Kalanki resident Nikhil Kadam, who runs a pharmacy in Kannad city, said, “In case of any emergency, we are forced to run to the nearest hill and make a call. The situation becomes all the more difficult for us during monsoon.” When contacted, Kannad deputy collector Janardhan Vidhate told TOI, “I had visited the village when the residents threatened to boycott elections in 2019. I had contacted BSNL. But unfortunately things didn't work out. We have been following up with the telecom companies on the issue.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/making-phone-calls-an-uphill-task-for-kalanki-villagers/articleshow/85720832.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The state government had reopened the schools earlier this month but the havoc caused by rain has led to students being unable to attend schools. Roads have been blocked at several places in the hills due to landslides. Speaking to TOI, several teachers and students said that there was always an issue with the quality of online classes and now with incessant rains, the problem of frequency of interruptions in net connectivity has increased. “The constant rain has affected households’ electricity supply due to which students are unable to charge their devices. Also, constant rain does make the lives of villagers difficult. They cannot continue with their daily routine. There is always fear of their houses being affected by landslides,” said Sohan Singh Majila, general secretary of the Uttarakhand Teachers’ Association. “Most of our friends residing in the villages used to trek up in the hills to find network connectivity, but constant rain has restricted movement outside our homes where the network is quite poor,” said a student, residing in a village on the outskirts of Dehradun. Notably, members of the Opposition Congress had raised questions over the quality of online classes for children in the recently concluded assembly session. To which, state education minister Arvind Pandey had replied, “The current government has taken several major steps for the children’s education. We have installed 500 virtual classrooms and another 600 are in the pipeline.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/online-classes-severely-affected-due-to-incessant-rains-in-the-hills/articleshow/85722702.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Very heavy rainfall likely in parts of Marathwada & Vidarbha by August-end||AURANGABAD: After subdued rainfall activity over central and west India, precipitation is expected to pick up from August 29, the India Meteorological Department said on Saturday. Enhanced rainfall activity is very likely over south peninsular India till August 30. It is likely to reduce thereafter, it added. Isolated heavy to very heavy falls are very likely over Vidarbha and Marathwada on August 30; Telangana on August 29 and 30; north-central Maharashtra on August 31; north Konkan and Gujarat on August 31 - September 1 and Saurashtra and Kutch on September 1. Few parts of Aurangabad, Jalna, Hingoli, Parbhani and Nanded districts, among other areas in the region, are likely to witness heavy rainfall along with thunderstorms and lightning by the end of August. Also, several parts of Marathwada are likely to witness measurable rainfall activity over next 48-hours, said an agricultural advisory issued by the Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University (VNMAU) on Saturday. Agricultural meteorologist at VNMAU, K K Dakhore said the weather system over the Arabian Sea was likely to bring almost widespread rainfall in Marathwada and some other parts of the state, including Konkan, central Maharashtra and Vidarbha. “We do not foresee any major damage to the kharif crops unless very extreme weather events occur during the next three to four days. The expected rainfall activity otherwise would be conducive to crops,” he said. While cotton and soyabean are the major kharif crops in the region, with the former said to be in the stage of bowl formation while the latter is undergoing pod formation. Maize, another major kharif crop, is said to be in the tasselling stage and could receive further nourishment during the expected rainfall activity. Experts have asked people in the rural areas to ensure their personal safety as well as the safety of their livestock. Meanwhile, barring Osmanabad (5 mm) and Latur (2 mm) districts, other six districts in Marathwada did not report any noticeable rainfall activity during the 24-hour period ending by Saturday morning. — With PTI inputs||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/heavy-rain-thunderstorm-likely-in-parts-of-mwada/articleshow/85720843.cms||---

As a result, they could not apply for college admissions with revised scores, despite the government extending the application deadline by a week, which ended on Friday. Some could manage to apply with their new mark sheets on the very last day, the moment they received the revised scores. Many principals said they got calls from students on Saturday, desperate to submit revised scores to stand a better chance in securing seats. But principals had to turn them down. “We received mails from students on Saturday morning, seeking to upload revised mark sheets. But as the deadline was over, we had to express our regret,” said Surendranath College principal Indrani Kar. For Deshapriya Balika Vidyalaya student Pinki Panda, who got her revised mark sheet on Friday, it was a race against time to submit applications. Her HS total had been revised by 108 marks and it would definitely better her chance in college admission. But Panda, who applied for BSc general course, could not upload the revised marks on Motijheel College portal due to a glitch. “I am happy with the marks but perhaps it will not make any difference as it arrived late,” she said. Tamaghna Adhikary from Kalyani is still waiting for an additional 20 marks. His father, Tapas Adhikary, said, “First, he was marked absent. Then, he received a pass mark sheet with 10 marks each in three practical subjects. According to our calculation, he got 83 less than what he should have. The revised mark sheet increased his score by 63, still 20 marks short.” Soudipta Das, general secretary of Collegium of Assistant Headmasters and Headmistresses, said many students might miss out on coveted seats due to HS council’s computation error. “Many revised results came at the eleventh hour or late. Students are pleading to upload new scores. They will be penalised for no fault of theirs,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/for-many-hs-students-added-marks-may-not-help-in-seat-race/articleshow/85724580.cms||---

He had been collecting funds for setting up this facility immediately after acute shortage of medical oxygen was felt during the second wave of Covid-19. The oxygen plant has been set up at a primary health centre in Chhapi town. It has a production capacity of eight cubic tonnes of oxygen in a day to refill over 800 jumbo oxygen cylinders, Mevani claimed. He added that it is the state’s biggest plant and came up after a struggle of more than three months of wading through the red tapes. Mevani said, “The second wave of Covid-19 caught us off guard with an unusually high demand for oxygen. We immediately set up a crowdfunding campaign to build an oxygen plant on a war footing with the help of an NGO, however the authorities frozen the account of the NGO, which remains inaccessible till date.” He further stated, “We approached the high court to allow us to use funds from my MLA grant for building the plant under special conditions. Despite these hurdles, we have been successful in creating accessible healthcare infrastructure for the people of Vadgam. No one will ever have to struggle for oxygen in my constituency or for that matter the entire Banaskantha district.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/mevani-sets-up-oxygen-plant/articleshow/85724481.cms||---

Though Delhi implemented the ‘One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC)’ scheme only in July, so far 29,600 transactions have been carried out by beneficiaries from other states using the ONORC platform as of August 19, followed by Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat. In the case of intra-state and inter-district transactions for lifting of the ration, Bihar tops the list, registering 10.14 crore transactions so far, followed by Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. According to official data, the top source states of inter-state transactions are Uttar Pradesh, (75,329), Bihar (45,675) and Maharashtra (11,615). This means migrants from UP and Bihar in other states were the biggest beneficiaries of the ONORC scheme. Sources said food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey made a detailed presentation on the status of the scheme before Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Pragati meeting this week in which he mentioned about the significant progress in Delhi in the last one month. Sources said the sizeable number of migrant poor availing the facility in the national capital, which is fully funded by the Centre, justifies why the food ministry wanted the Delhi government to come on board. Officials said going by a rough calculation, each transaction involves lifting of foodgrains for four beneficiaries and going by that at least one lakh persons have benefited from the new system in Delhi in the past one month. In fact, the number of inter-state migrant beneficiaries in Delhi has surpassed that of several other states such as Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat, which joined the ONORC platform more than a year ago. The ONORC scheme, the nation-wide portability of ration cards, was launched in August 2019 to ensure that the migrant workforce can avail their entitled subsidised food under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) whereever they stay or work. The scheme is IT-driven. To implement it, ePoS devices are installed at ration shops, Aadhaar number of beneficiaries are linked with their ration cards and the transaction happens only after biometric authentication using ePoS machines. The food secretary told TOI that so far nearly 40 crore transactions have been made on the ONORC platform and nearly 33 crore of these transactions happened during the Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, around 2.2 crore portability transactions are recorded every month. TOI has also learnt that the PM has directed the food ministry and other departments to use this ONORC platform for convergence of other social welfare benefits such as transfer of scholarship, old-age pension and Aayushman Bharat health cover to the poor since it has robust and authenticated database linked to the Aadhaar number of beneficiaries. Pandey said they have conducted a pilot with the rural development ministry in six districts for convergence of ONORC with the National Social Assistance Programme, which provides financial assistance or pension to the elderly, widows and persons with disabilities, and the outcomes are encouraging.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/with-29k-transactions-delhi-tops-in-ration-offtake-by-migrants-from-other-states/uts/articleshow/85724467.cms||Dipak K Dash

Raut said this while addressing the Shiv Sena workers in Nashik city on Saturday — to lay the party’s initial groundwork to prepare for the Nashik civic polls early next year. “Currently, there is a three-party government in the state. Perhaps a single party would be in power in the future,” he said. Later, when reporters asked him if he meant that Sena could be going it alone in the future, Raut only said: “Wait for some time.” Asked if there will be a pre-poll alliance between the coalition partners of the MVA government in the Nashik civic polls, Raut refrained from direct response. He said: “Every party has the right to grow and an election is the only democratic way to do so. Nashik is an important political centre in Maharashtra, and any political development in Nashik will have repercussions elsewhere in the state.” About the meeting between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, Raut said this was “nothing unusual” and they can meet to discuss various state-related issues. “It is a healthy sign that they are meeting and are exchanging thoughts and ideas. They can do so, and not much should be read into it,” Raut said. Raut reiterated that BJP and Sena were not enemies and shared the same ideology and were in power together in the state not too long ago. Lashing out at Union minister Narayan Rane, Raut said that leaders like Rane are tarnishing BJP’s image. “Our party doesn’t have anything against the Jan Ashirwad Yatra of the newly inducted Union ministers. However, BJP must introspect on why Rane is causing it embarrassment,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/raut-what-happens-on-the-political-front-in-maha-cant-be-predicted/articleshow/85720862.cms||Abhilash Botekar

This way the outer structure of the underground stations for the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System will be formed. The size of the Begumpul station is 246 metres long and 26 metres wide, while the platform level station will be 20m deep approximately. D-wall acts as a strong shield during the soil excavation for building stations on the underground section. It reduces the chances of soil falling and also prevents water seepage. The Rs 30,270-crore RRTS project is scheduled to be completed by 2025. Divulging details, chief public relations officer (CPRO), National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), Puneet Vats said, “Begumpul RRTS station will have three levels: mezzanine, concourse and the platform. After removing the soil, the first level — the mezzanine floor of the station — will be constructed. Through this, the passengers will reach the other two levels. At the concourse, passengers will avail various facilities such as ticketing, catering, toilets, etc. After a security check, the passengers will cross AFC (automated fare collection) gates and reach the third level i.e. the platform level for boarding and de-boarding trains.” Begumpul station is the only underground RRTS station in Meerut where RRTS trains and local transit services will be available. Two other underground stations — Meerut Central and Bhainsali — will be used only for local transit service in Meerut. The RRTS corridor in Meerut is elevated on the route Meerut South to Brahampuri crossing, Partapur, Rithani and Shatabdi Nagar. After Brahampuri, the corridor becomes underground, crossing Meerut Central, Bhainsali and Begumpul. Then it gets elevated again, passing through MES Colony, Daurali, Meerut North, Modipuram and ends at Modipuram depot. The corridor will have a total of 24 stations and will be elevated for around 70.5 km and an 11.5 km stretch will be underground. The civil construction work is in progress on the 82 km-long corridor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/rrts-critical-phase-of-underground-station-construction-work-begins-in-meerut/articleshow/85722751.cms||Sandeep Rai

The constable did not inform anyone about why he was absent. He did not reply to notices seeking an explanation for his absence. During the probe, Ingale’s explanation was sought but his replies were unsatisfactory. In June, two cops who had stopped reporting to work from the time of their transfers from the local arms department to the Malabar Hill police station in 2012 were dismissed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cop-does-not-work-for-9-yrs-draws-salary/articleshow/85727667.cms||---
---||Delhi||Bail plea of Jantar Mantar event organiser rejected||New Delhi: A Delhi court has dismissed the bail plea of one of the main organisers of an event at Jantar Mantar where communal slogans were allegedly raised. It noted that he not only voluntarily organised the event, but also allegedly actively participated and provided support to the views of the inflammatory speeches being made by the participants by acknowledging and endorsing via gestures and clapping intermittently. While dismissing the bail application of Preet Singh, the court said, given his stature, it was expected that he ought to have exercised his authority and prevented the participants from airing such inflammatory opinions in the larger interest of the public/ committee welfare. “The applicant is clearly seen actively participating in the incendiary speeches along with his other associates,” said additional sessions judge Anil Antil. The court added that the right to assemble and freedom to air once thoughts were cherished under the Constitution, however, they were not absolute and to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions. It said, prima facie, based on the material placed on record, it was observed that there had been active participation by Singh in his individual capacity and as the main organiser of the event, which was conducted at Jantar Mantar despite the denial of permission by Delhi Police and total disregard to the Covid-19 protocol issued by the Centre. “In addition, on prima facie analysis of the inflammatory and incendiary content of the speeches or interviews of the participants, comments, especially, those pertaining to express pejorative references to a religious community and keeping in view that the applicant was an active organiser of the event, he cannot later absolve himself of the responsibility for the content or consequences arising from there. The complicity of the applicant in the alleged offences are evident from the material placed before the court…,” it observed. The court added that Singh was an influential personality and there was a possibility of him interfering in the investigation and/or influencing the witnesses in the case if released on bail at this stage. Singh’s counsel had sought bail claiming he had been falsely implicated in connivance of his opposition leaders even though he was not named in the FIR.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bail-plea-of-jantar-mantar-event-organiser-rejected/articleshow/85724513.cms||Usha Das

---||Kochi||Corp urges govt to take over its land||Kochi: The land owned by Kochi corporation at Brahmapuram has sort of become a burden for the local body. To find a financial reprieve, the corporation authorities are planning to force the government to take over 22 acres out of the 115 acres it owns there. In total the corporation owes around Rs 157 crore, amount the government had spent on purchasing the land, to the government. As part of recovering the amount the state government is deducting more than Rs 5 crore from each instalment of plan fund allocation to the corporation. The corporation is to pay 28 such instalments for repaying the entire amount. The corporation has leased out around 22 acres to Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (KSIDC) for setting up a waste-to-energy plant here. It also had to allot land parcels for other agencies like IMA for setting up their projects at Brahmapuram. Even while the land owned by the corporation is being used by various agencies as instructed by the government, the civic body is to bear a huge amount as repayment of the sum spent on purchasing it. “We cannot say that we would not repay the amount as the government has already spent a huge amount for purchasing the land for the corporation. So, we have requested the government to take over 22 acres out of the total 115 acres of land owned by the corporation. After taking over the 22 acres, the government should stop deducting the amount from our plan fund allocation. We have held discussions with the minister for local self -governments and top officials on the topic,” Mayor M Anil Kumar said. The Kochi corporation has been facing huge financial constraints for the past several years and the situation stemming from Covid induced restrictions have further worsened the financial status of the civic body. The government has earmarked more than Rs 17 crore as the first instalment of plan fund allocation and more than Rs 2 crore as special component projects to the corporation during 201-22 fiscal. Out of it, the government has deducted more than Rs 5 crore towards the repayment of the amount spent on purchasing land at Brahmapuram. The government also deducted more than Rs 47 lakh which is the remuneration it paid to anganwadi workers in the city. Moreover, the corporation is to pay Rs 1.62 crore as the urban local body (ULB) share for Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) scheme. The corporation had not yet paid the ULB share for the construction of Maradu water treatment plant, which was completed under the Amrut scheme. Of Kochi Corporation owns around 115 acres of land at Brahmapuram. Of this, the local body directly bought 40 acres while the state government purchased another around 75 acres and handed it over to the local body. Now, the land owners have moved the court seeking additional compensation for the land taken over in 2008. This will add to the financial burden of the corporation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/corp-urges-govt-to-take-over-its-land/articleshow/85722753.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Gurmail Singh Sidhu, state convenor of Sanjha Mulajam Manch Punjab, said the employees’ union is going to convene a meeting to discuss the shortcomings. He said the dearness allowance till December 31, 2015, was 119%. But out of this 119%, the state government has not yet taken any decision about releasing 6% of the dearness allowance. The state government is mum on regularising the contractual and outsourced employees, implementation of the old pension scheme after January 2004 and ending of the probation period of new employees, he added. Sidhu also said the state government had stated that employees recruited after July 2020 will get the central pay commission.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pb-govt-employees-pensioners-still-not-satisfied-with-pay-commission/articleshow/85726701.cms||---
---||Delhi||Gender-wise Delhi government schools: Men as principals, women vice-principals||NEW DELHI: On July 10, an advertisement for the direct recruitment of principals in Delhi government schools appeared. Of the 363 posts advertised, 208 were meant for men and 155 for women. If that gender disparity seemed odd, then of the 196 principals in 2020-21, 120 were male and 76 female. Such a difference exists apparently because the Directorate of Education (DoE) follows different recruitment/promotion procedures for the two gender. An unwritten norm is to set aside 60% of vacancies for men and 40% for women.  To add to this, most women, despite their experience and qualification, usually have to wait for a longer period to be promoted as principals. Now contrast this with the gender data related to government schools. Women teachers outnumber men among trained graduate teachers (TGT) and postgraduate teachers (PGT).  There are 429 girls schools against 407 for boys (with 194 being co-educational) and there are 72,000 more girl students than boys among the 16.2 lakh students in government institutions. The gender skew among the principals has existed for several decades and has only recently been challenged. Aggrieved women met the director of education numerous times about the issue and DoE has now formed a “gender anomaly committee” to look into it. The aberration is undisputed. PGTs who joined between 1989 and 1992 were elevated to vice-principalship in 2012.  But after 31 years of service, they are still awaiting a chance to become principals. In contrast, their male counterparts are already working at the level of the deputy director of education.  Similarly, the 1994 batch of women recruits became vice-principals in 2018 — that too on ad hoc basis with the promotion not confirmed. Their male counterparts are mostly principals now. Women of the 1999-2000 batch assumed the vice head’s post in 2020 — again on ad hoc basis — while the men of the batch became VPs in 2012 and are now awaiting promotion to principalship. Men teachers confirmed the differing rules about promotion and seniority. One of them told TOI that he joined as a PGT in 1998 and was promoted as vice principal in 2012. “I am waiting to be elevated as principal since 2017,” he said. “But a woman PGT, who joined in 1995, became VP only in 2018.” As per UDISE data, in 2020-21 of the 1,662 sanctioned posts of vice-principals, 1,195 were occupied. The incumbents comprised 633 men and 562 women. In 2018, the gap was narrower with 692 men and 645 women. A woman vice-principal was indignant. “We are only asking for our right,” she said. “Even the women who were promoted as VPs are now approaching superannuation and will not become principals.” One of them, who will retire in 18 months, added, “I have now worked under DoE for 24 years. I was promoted in 2018 as vice principal and because my school has no principal, I take care of everything without being designated a principal. Men junior to me have already become principals.” A DoE official admitted to the oddity. “It is a legacy issue and has been such for 40-50 years now,” the official shrugged. “No one questioned it till recently. The anomaly committee is now working to usher gender neutrality.” The official added, “Principals’ posts get filled either directly through recruitment conducted by UPSC or through promotion. Since Service is not under Delhi government, there are difficulties when recruitment is delayed. As for promotion, the recruitment rules say one has to be VP for 10 years before one can be promoted as principal. Because of this, most aspirants are already 58-59 years when they become eligible. We are trying to reduce the VP tenure to seven years, but things are taking time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/school-of-thought-men-as-principals-women-vps/articleshow/85724633.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Mumbai||Tribunal nixes builder’s appeal in Rs 2.4 crore RERA refund to actor||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal dismissed an appeal filed by a builder who had challenged a July 2019 MahaRERA direction for refunding Rs 2.4 crore along with interest to actor Karan Oberoi for delay in handing him possession of a flat in a project called Imperial Heights in Goregaon (West). Oberoi and his father, who jointly filed the complaint before MahaRERA, had booked the flat on the 43rd floor of Tower C. The possession was due in December 2017, Oberoi’s lawyer Mustafa Kachwala had argued. The appellate bench of chairperson Justice Indira Jain and member S S Sandhu, in its August 20 order, whose certified copy was issued on Friday, said: “The appeal is dismissed for want of compliance of proviso to Section 43 (5) of RERA.” The proviso required the builder to deposit the amount. The builder in his appeal had said he was ready and willing to hand over possession of one flat in Tower C and explore the possibility of handing over possession of an alternate flat in Tower D with an occupancy certificate. He said, “Refunding the money at the final stage of the project would adversely affect the project and jeopardise the larger interest of other flat allottees.” The appellate tribunal had, on March 12 this year, directed the builder, Epitome Residency, to deposit the amount in compliance with mandatory provisions of the 2017 law Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). At the hearing via video-conferencing on August 20, advocate Kachwala appeared for Oberoi while none appeared for the builder, noted the tribunal in its order. The order said, “As no one appeared on behalf of appellant on 06.08.2021 nor submitted compliance to order dated 12.03.2021, the matter was kept for dismissal today.” It noted that “despite opportunities granted”, the builder has not complied with its order. The builder’s advocate, Vibhav Krishna, when contacted on Friday, said, “We will explore all legal options available to the builder and also discuss with Oberoi to amicably resolve the issue as these are very difficult times for builders and the real estate industry with Covid-19 pandemic having created more complications.’’ The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA), too, in its July 29, 2019, order had said “alternatively” if the builder obtains the OC, “it can give possession of the flat along with prescribed rate of interest for delay”. The builder also argued the project was delayed since certain permissions from the government were delayed and over some “restrictions on loading of transferable development rights and wrong classification of Coastal Regulation Zone. In its order, MahaRERA said even if it accepted the argument the project got delayed for reasons beyond the developer’s control, “in view of strict provisions of Section 18 of RERA Act”, the builder cannot get any benefit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/tribunal-nixes-builders-appeal-in-rs-2-4cr-rera-refund-to-actor/articleshow/85721023.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh closes in on 100% target for Covid-19 contact tracing||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh health department has managed to map primary and secondary contacts of nearly 99.98% of the total Covid-19 cases detected since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. Andhra Pradesh has accumulated about 20.1 lakh infections. While the primary contacts could not be mapped in only 336 cases, the officials were not able to establish secondary contacts of 356 patients. Prakasam district did not miss contacts of even a single case, while it is only one case in Anantapur and Kurnool districts. According to the state health officials, timely and effective contact tracing plays a crucial role in breaking or limiting the chain of disease transmissions, particularly with a highly transmittable respiratory disease like Covid-19. Creating awareness among the close or the primary contacts of Covid-19 patients on their possible exposure to the virus, educating them about the potential symptoms, sending them for testing and guiding them on the next steps form the basics of contact tracing. The major focus of the containment strategy of Andhra Pradesh is on effective surveillance through door-to-door contact tracing, early detection, isolation and effective clinical management of positive cases to keep the infection spread under check. Andhra Pradesh is leveraging its nearly 3-lakh ward/village volunteer system for the door-to-door contact tracing, multi-phase fever surveys, demarcation of containment zones, and targeted testing and prevention measures. The health department already conducted 21 rounds of door-to-door fever surveys. For instance, as part of the latest fever survey, the field-level staff visited nearly 1.22 crore households out of total 1.63 crore households as of August 23. They identified 2,695 symptomatic fever cases and sent them for testing. Meanwhile, the health department is conducting sentinel surveillance for 20 different categories.

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Cleric denied bail in ‘love jihad’ case||VADODARA: A local court in Vadodara on Friday rejected the bail application of the cleric who had sermonised an inter-faith marriage and had also allegedly performed religious conversion of a woman. A case filed in this regard was the first-of-its-kind offence to be registered under the amended Act, popularly referred to as the ‘love jihad’ law. Cleric Sheikh Islamuddin, who was accused of religious conversion in violation of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act 2021, had been booked in June this year along with another accused, Sameer Qureshi. The accused had allegedly hidden his identity to entice the young woman whom he forced into marriage. After his first bail plea filed before a charge sheet was filed in the case was turned down, the cleric applied for bail again earlier this week, after a charge sheet had been filed. His counsel H L Gupta had argued that Sheikh had only performed the rituals and had no active role in the offence. The bail application also mentioned the recent high court order giving an interim stay on some provisions of the Act as one of the grounds. It also mentioned that three accused in the case, including Qureshi’s parents and his sister, had been granted bail earlier. Rejecting the bail plea, the court of special judge (atrocity) S C Gandhi observed that it was evident that Sheikh had connived with Qureshi. It further observed that the accused was involved in putting pressure on the complainant in the case. It mentions that the accused had violated provisions of the Act and rules framed under it as he did not take necessary permissions for performing the rituals. The court also observed that bails on grounds of parity could also not be considered as the parents and sister of Qureshi’s role was limited to arguing with the victim as she was not wearing a burkha. It stated that Sheikh’s role was serious in the offence. Gupta, however, argued that the complainant had earlier furnished an affidavit favouring the accused. The affidavit was filed during the hearing of the bail application of Qureshi. He added that the the complainant and the accused had together filed a petition in the high court seeking quashing of the offence. The additional public prosecutor (APP) A B Joshi, however, argued that the complainant had been issued a notice in connection with Sheikh’s bail application, but had not remained present. He argued that the affidavits contrary to the offences may have been filed under pressure. The APP also highlighted that Sheikh was a resident of West Bengal and may not remain present during the trial and also he may threaten witnesses and aid the accused who were yet to be arrested. The woman who had registered an offence at the Gotri police station, accused Qureshi of forcing her into a physical relationship before marriage and told the police that she was forced to undergo abortions whenever she became pregnant. She alleged that he blackmailed her into conceding to his demands using her intimate photographs. She also alleged of being harassed by Qureshi’s family. Gupta said that the cleric will now approach the high court for bail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/clerics-bail-plea-in-states-1st-love-jihad-case-junked/articleshow/85721812.cms||---

The 17-year-old is speech and hearing impaired. The prayer to a bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar was made by advocate Ashley Cusher, pointing out with her being differently abled and her parents illiterate, a paralegal volunteer be appointed considering the special case as there could be communication issues. The petition filed by the minor’s mother sought the HC’s permission to terminate her daughter’s pregnancy beyond the legally permissible 20-week limit. The minor was raped by two male friends in April. On August 20, the HC directed the minor to appear before a J J Hospital medical board. The panel’s report said there is no abnormality detected in the foetus and the minor is “anguished with the pregnancy.” Its continuance “is also going to have a psychological impact on the pregnant minor with an uncertain future,” it added and advised MTP. Following the oral prayer by Cusher, the judges on August 25 requested government pleader Poornima Kantharia to ensure a paralegal volunteer is assigned. On Saturday, paralegal Priyanka Pawar helped the minor and parents with admission procedures for MTP at J J Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-in-a-1st-hc-orders-paralegal-to-aid-minor-before-her-mtp/articleshow/85721140.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Mumbai||Merely touching kid’s cheeks not sex assault: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Observing that touching cheeks without a sexual intent would not attract the offence of “sexual assault” under the Pocso Act, the Bombay high court on Friday granted bail to a 46-year-old chicken seller who spent 13 months in jail. The court said primary evaluation of the material on record does not suggest the accused touched the minor’s cheeks with a sexual intent. “In consideration of these facts, in my view, a case is made out for releasing the applicant on bail,” the court said. The high court, though, clarified that observations made “be construed as expression of opinion for the purpose of bail only and the same shall not in any way influence the trial in other proceedings”. The accused was arrested in July 2020 after the eight-year-old girl’s mother lodged a complaint that he had touched the child inappropriately when she went to his shop. Bail pleas of the accused were earlier rejected by the trial court. Advocate Ramprasad Gupta appeared for the accused and submitted the accused was falsely implicated by the complainant over a business rivalry. The defence said the accused was gainfully employed, had roots in society and had his family to look after. “Thus, there arises no question of the applicant’s absconding and not available for trial,” Gupta submitted. It was also submitted that the offence is not punishable with death or life imprisonment. It said that maximum punishment provided for the alleged offence is seven years’ jail. The FIR was lodged on July 29, 2020. It was alleged that at 1.30pm, the complainant who lived in the neighbourhood saw the accused signalling the girl to come to his shop. The girl went inside. It was alleged that after some time the accused came outside, looked around, went back in and pulled the shutter down. It was further alleged that when with the help of another person, the shutter was opened, the accused was found behaving inappropriately with the child. The complainant took the child and parents to the police station and complained. After completion of the investigation, police filed a chargesheet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/merely-touching-kids-cheeks-not-sex-assault-in-mumbai-court/articleshow/85719126.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The midfielder who captained India at the Fifa U-17 World Cup in 2017 joined Goa from Jamshedpur FC in January but the arrival of Glan Martins and potential of Princeton Rebello means he is surplus to requirement at the club. East Bengal have just started building their squad for the season and lapped up the chance to sign the midfielder on loan. The transfer formalities were completed on Sunday. Amarjit will be on loan till the end of the season. East Bengal were also keen on Alexander Romario and Naveen Kumar, but both are staying with FC Goa at least till the end of their existing contracts next season. While Naveen is now second-choice goalkeeper, behind Dheeraj Singh, officials said Romario has plenty to offer and is appreciated by coach Juan Ferrando. Meanwhile, Goa have explained why they allowed striker Ishan Pandita to leave the club and join Jamshedpur FC, for an undisclosed transfer fee. “Ishan communicated to the club during the course of the summer that he would like to explore other opportunities keeping his personal growth in mind. When the other club expressed their interest with a suitable proposal, we felt it in the best interest of all parties involved to accept the offer factoring above all of Ishan’s wish to continue to seek more playing time. “As a club, we have always encouraged opportunities for youngsters, and we stuck to the same principle in Ishan’s case as well. Everybody at FC Goa would like to wish Ishan all the very best for his future,” said director of football, Ravi Puskur. Pandita grabbed attention last season after coming on as a late substitute. Despite playing only 131 minutes in 11 matches, he scored four goals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/amarjit-moves-to-sc-east-bengal-romario-naveen-to-stay/articleshow/85749926.cms||---

Even though the owner of the supermarket was asked to move out in 2015, the civic body authorities are unable to execute its decision so far. It is the dilly-dallying attitude of the corporation that paved the way for the owner of the supermarket to continue occupying the local building. Though the tenant moved the court challenging the decision of the local body, the court had in 2019 issued its verdict in the corporation’s favour. In its verdict, the court also directed that the notice served by the corporation in 2015 should be considered as show cause notice. The court had also asked the local body authorities to dispose of the application by the tenant, if a fresh application is submitted, within two months. The tenant submitted a fresh application in 2019 informing the corporation authorities the readiness to pay increased rent. But, the finance standing committee of the corporation which considered the application decided to reject it as the civic body is planning to construct a shopping complex in the said land. In November 2020, the corporation issued another notice to the occupant asking to move out. Moreover, the tenant had not paid rent to the corporation for the past few years. The owner of the supermarket again moved the court challenging the corporation’s decision to evict the firm. In January 2021, the court asked the corporation to dispose of the tenant’s application within three months. The court also asked the complainant to pay Rs 3 lakh to the corporation within two weeks of pronouncing the order. Even after seven months, the occupant has not deposited Rs 3 lakh despite the order. Now, the corporation council is going to consider the supermarket owner’s application once again!||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/corps-shopping-complex-project-remains-in-limbo/articleshow/85722778.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The participants have also been given return fares by the state government,” he said. Sehgal said among the most popular products were chikankari clothes. “Shops dealing in chikankari clothes are earning an average of Rs 40,000 per day. Owing to the efforts of the state government, ODOP products have been established as special brands and are no longer struggling for identity.

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Vigilance seizes CCTV footages from municipality||KOCHI: The vigilance raid at the Thrikkakara municipality office that began at 3pm on Friday, ended around 2am on Saturday. The team, which seized the CCTV footages of the councillors allegedly carrying envelopes containing money, sealed the cabin of chairperson Ajitha Thankappan. Vigilance had conducted a raid at the municipality office on Wednesday too, based on three complaints from the opposition LDF. The latest raid was based on another opposition complaint that CCTV footages of some councillors allegedly receiving envelopes containing money might be wiped out by the ruling UDF. The opposition and a Congress councillor had alleged that the chairperson distributed envelopes containing Rs 10,000 each to some of the councillors along with the Onakkodi. Though the chairperson and the UDF denied any wrongdoing, the opposition decided to approach vigilance. A two-member team that was tasked by the Ernakulam DCC to conduct an enquiry into the alleged incident is yet to submit its report. However, it is learned that the team has given a clean chit to the chairperson and has instead blamed the controversy on the internal rift in the party’s local unit. The municipality office premises had witnessed dramatic scenes when the 12-member vigilance team arrived to seize the footages. The chairperson locked her cabin and left the office without switching off the air conditioner and light. Even though the officials called the chairperson over phone and requested her to come to the office, she refused and said that the key would be brought by another person. Since this did not happen, the team recovered the footage with the help of cyber cell experts after around 10 hours. Wednesday’s raid was regarding complaints that a daily wage driver was appointed as cleaning staff allegedly when the model code of conduct was in place, that quotation for cleaning of canals and drains was given allegedly without following tender procedures and thereby causing huge loss of money to the local body and regarding the purchase of food kits for Covid-affected families.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/vigilance-seizes-cctv-footages-from-municipality/articleshow/85722854.cms||---

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey has put up the matter for hearing on September 1 as the physical copy of the complaint was not produced in the court. The complaint filed by the state transport minister alleged that “Gupta tarnished his reputation and was involved in making reckless, unfounded, malicious, scandalous, mala fide, mischievous, libellous, spiteful and defamatory allegations against him for political mileage.” “The accused (Gupta) has been continuously making allegations of corruption since March 8, 2021, and he has continued to make reckless, irresponsible and false allegations with a deliberate intention and ill-will to tarnish the reputation of the complainant (Gahlot) in the eyes of right- thinking people. The accused, for the purposes of harassing and defaming the complainant, has used the social media platforms irresponsibly and in a destructive manner to malign and target the reputation of the complainant,” it further alleged. It added that the effort of Delhi government as well as that of the complainant was to bring transparency and accountability to the process of procurement and maintenance of buses for trouble-free performance and availability of sufficient number of buses at any given point of time. It alleged that the purchase of 1,000 buses for the benefit of residents of Delhi did not go well with Gupta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/allegations-by-bjps-gupta-are-reckless-gahlot-tells-court/articleshow/85724587.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dehradun, Haridwar and Pauri districts are also expected to receive heavy rain over the next 24 hours. “In some places, rain can be accompanied by thunder and lighting,” said an official of the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC). Due to the continuing rain and resultant landslides, a number of roads across Uttarakhand were reported to have been impacted. According to SEOC, the roads that were affected till Saturday evening included 10 national highways, over 50 rural roads, five border roads as well as district roads in almost all the 13 districts. Some of the worst-affected roads were the Bhowali- Haldwani highway where a part of the road had caved in near Veerbhatti bridge, stopping the movement of heavy vehicles completely as well as the Badrinath highway (NH-58) which was closed for traffic between Tapovan and Maletha. Landslides at Badrinath highway also hampered the traffic movement for nearly 12 hours although debris was being cleared regularly to regulate the flow of traffic. The highway was also closed near Totaghati due to debris falling from the mountains as a result of which vehicles coming to Srinagar were diverted via Kotdwar and Pauri from Rishikesh. The Rishikesh-Gangotri highway (NH-108) and Rishikesh-Yamunotri highway (NH-94) were closed for traffic till Chamba.The stretch of NH-94 from Rishikesh till Agarkhal was also closed for traffic. The national highway-123 connecting Herbertpur with Barkot was closed at the 21 km, 28 km and 31 km points. The Joshimath-Malari state highway remained closed due to boulders falling at Tamaknala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/more-rain-in-the-offing-in-ukhand-hills-several-roads-blocked/articleshow/85722788.cms||---

Several small teams have been formed for different assignments. This sudden rush of activities at several colleges is, however, not due to the undergraduate admissions but to prepare for visits by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) teams. With NAAC officials being slated for visits next month, college authorities want to complete the preparations before admission work gains momentum by September 2nd week. College and universities’ funding by UGC, grants from Centre and collaborations with foreign institutes depend on NAAC ratings. NAAC grades range from A++ to D, the lowest grade indicating no accreditation. At Lady Brabourne College, the NAAC visit is due in the next few weeks. “Several new projects have been undertaken for women’s empowerment and a women’s study centre has been set up,” said principal Siuli Sarkar. Some of the NAAC parameters are the number of classrooms, lab and library conditions and facilities for sports and cultural activities. The faculty strength, academic performance of students, placement opportunities and facilities for girls are other key criteria. Other colleges up for re-assessment include JD Birla Institute, Maulana Azad, Scottish Church, RKM colleges and City College. “Most of our staff associated with NAAC work are coming to the campus daily and trying to ensure we meet all the guidelines before the visit,” said Deepali Singhee, principal of JD Birla Institute. Inspection by NAAC officials, the last stage of the accreditation process, follows the submission of self-study reports by colleges. The purpose of the visit is to verify the colleges’ claims. A CU official said due to the pandemic, almost 40% colleges are due for re-assessment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/campuses-abuzz-with-naac-prep/articleshow/85724658.cms||Zeeshan Javed

To make these rules easily comprehensible to common man, Thankachan John, a retired motor vehicle inspector (MVI) in Ernakulam, has launched a YouTube channel. The videos posted by him are widely shared across for the amount of information they give and the channel, TJ’s Vehicle Point, has nearly 1 lakh subscribers. TJs Vehicle Point mainly deals with motor vehicles rules, RT office procedures, driving licence related issues, vehicle insurance policies, claims, accident related issues, etc. John, who retired from the MVD after 16 years of service in 2015, started the YouTube channel in May 2020 during the lockdown when the entry for people to MVD offices was restricted and everything went online. As most people did not know what to do, agents who act as middlemen to help people have been making huge profits. So John, who has worked as an insurance surveyor earlier and works as an accident investigator after retirement, started making small videos explaining various services available online and the formalities regarding all kinds of MVD services. “MVD procedures are a bit complex and rules are not comprehensible to common man. But if understood, they can do almost everything online and need not depend on any agent. Moreover in 2019, the Motor Vehicle Act saw several amendments and most of them brought in major changes in various procedures handled by the MVD. The ministry of road transport and highways has been making further amendments especially in licensing system frequently and most of the people are unaware of them. In my videos, I explain each of it and people found it useful,” John. More than 200 videos have been uploaded by John so far and they are being shared across. Now, many of the Akshaya computer centres seek the advice of John when customers approach them for various MVD applications.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/retired-mv-officers-youtube-channel-a-hit/articleshow/85722872.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Unaware of the diabolic motive of the burqa-clad customer, Pradeep swung into action and displayed a set of ornaments. Suddenly, the dulcet voice changed into a male baritone and the goon in the burqa whipped out a pistol and ordered Pradeep to quickly clear the shelves and dump all jewels in his bag. The salesman was stunned by the sudden turn of events — staring at a criminal who was mimicking a woman.

Around 11.30 am, the criminal clad in a burqa reached the shop when Soni’s employee Pradeep Rawat was alone. “Pradeep mistook him for a woman and displayed earrings (jhumkas) and gold rings. The man took out a pistol from the purse and stuck it on Pradeep’s temple, ordering him to put all jewels in the purse. The robber then tied Pradeep’s hands with a tape and fled with the booty. He decamped with 12 rings, 10 gold chains, 10 lockets, 11 pair of earrings, 24 jhumkas worth Rs 15 lakh,” said Anshu Soni in his statement to police. Minutes after the daring heist, a dazed Pradeep managed to snap the tape around his hands and called his owner, who sent an SOS to police. “In the CCTV footage, the robber was seen hurriedly climbing down the stairs leading to the shop and slipping into a bylane. His snickers were clearly visible underneath the burqa,” said deputy commissioner of police, east zone, Sanjeev Suman, who along with senior officers reached the spot to supervise the probe. Suman said, the robber is yet to be identified, but the case will be cracked soon. A source privy to the probe said, CCTVs in the jewellery shop were defunct and police were scanning footage from hidden cameras at an optician’s shop nearby. “Pradeep Rawat and a local youth are being interrogated in connection with the robbery,” said ACP, Gomtinagar, Shweta Srivastava.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/jewelry-heist-by-goon-in-burqa-dulcet-voice/articleshow/85726841.cms||---

The owner Hemendra’s cell number was in the call detail record of both the deceased and his wife Preeti, the officer added. “Preeti broke down on being interrogated and took the names of Hemendra and Sunil who were arrested,” said Singh. During questioning, Hemendra revealed that he was in love with Preeti but she was married to Ashutosh. “Preeti was not happy with Ashutosh and shared her unhappiness with fellow teacher Sunil who used to share the details with me,” said Hemendra. Hemendra and Sunil chalked out a plan and called Ashutosh on August 23 on pretext of a business deal and took him to IIM road where they shot him in his head and fled. However, Hemendra ran out of luck as his car hit a road divider and he had to abandon it on the spot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/govt-school-teacher-kills-lovers-husband-nabbed-with-colleague/articleshow/85726877.cms||---

In a first such meeting on Friday, all parties, including the BJP had agreed on not holding the civic elections till justice was meted out to the OBC community. “We would take the opinion from the state law and judiciary department, as per suggestions received at the Friday meeting. If reservation is to be adjusted within 50% limit, 118 Zilla Parishad seats for the OBCs would be reduced in state. Out of 36 districts, their seats would increase in 20, and there would be reduction in rest of them. Backward districts like Gadchiroli and Nandurbar would be most affected, as there would be few or no seats there,” the minister said during his visit to the city. Stressing that OBC reservation had become zero due to Supreme Court’s verdict, the Bramhapuri MLA said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had started efforts to collect empirical data as suggested by the bench of justice Ajay Khanwilkar. The apex court’s bench had struck down OBC reservation from Zilla Parishad and other governing bodies polls clarifying that those exceeded 50% ceiling set by it in Indira Sawhney case in 1992. On his participation in the OBC meeting at Solapur, Wadettiwar said he was actually going there to meet the migrants in their programme. “The event has a historic significance as these migrants were once labelled as criminals during British regime. They were kept in a settlement camp in Solapur. Even after independence, they were confined there for four years. They were free only after former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited their camp in Solapur and apologised for not freeing them for four years.” The former leader of opposition added that the government would be coming up with the new schemes for migrants’ rehabilitation and development and providing education and health facilities to their children. “We’ve told them to attend the event in their traditional dresses. At same place, we’ve invited the OBC community leaders to hold the talks on various issues and address them.” On some party activists expressing dissent over selection of new executive body members, Wadettiwar said it was obvious that someone would be disappointed as Congress was a big party and growing at a fast space in Maharashtra under state president Nana Patole.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/final-decision-on-obc-reservation-restoration-on-sept-3-wadettiwar/articleshow/85724645.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The gang, police said, duped foreigners of over US $ 1,00,000 (around Rs 75 lakh) in August alone. Two of the gang members, Suneet Gautam from Jhajra and Sumit Dhawan from Mandi Road, were arrested. Four others, Abhinav Kumar, Aniket, Piyush and Kuldeep Singh from Patna in Bihar, managed to escape. Jawahar Lal, deputy superintendent of police, STF, said, “Efforts are on to trace the four accused who are still at large. We have seized two laptops and 15 desktops from the gang. On interrogation, the gang members said that once the fake software was installed in the victim's computer system, they used to block their numbers.” According to police, the gang was distributed into different teams. One of the teams would collect data and the others would send pop-up messages to targeted systems, saying these were infected with viruses and charge $700 (Rs 49,000) to install an anti-virus. The gang used to operate from an office that they had rented at Prem Nagar. STF sleuths said they had been tracing cyber crime gangs active in the state capital for some time and this one was on their radar since the past one month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/doon-based-gang-dupes-us-100000-from-people-in-foreign-countries-by-offering-fake-anti-virus-services-busted/articleshow/85722900.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The survey would cover over 1.26 lakh square kilometres of land across the state, said Siddhartha Jain, commissioner, State Survey Settlement and Land Records. The integrated survey would cover all categories of land including agriculture, non-agriculture, urban and rural habitations. The survey would be done in hybrid methodology using drones, CORS network and GNSS receivers, said the commissioner. The work process was presented to the judicial preview commission for scrutiny, said Siddhartha Jain. He said that the work would require hiring of drone and aerial photography as end-to-end solution for the largescale mapping of agriculture and residential land based on the extent owned by every individual. The survey is also part of the central government’s programme of Survey of Villages Abadi and Mapping with Improvised Technology In Village Areas (SAVAMITA), he said. The commissioner requested stakeholders to give their advice or remarks or objections to the judicial preview committee before September 7.

All other Covid restrictions, including curbs on travel between 11pm and 5am and suspension of suburban train services, continue to be in place till September 15. While schools, colleges and coaching centres have been functioning online, there has been a demand for reopening of coaching classes for competitive exams so that students aspiring to study engineering and medicine can get personal attention and prepare better for entrance tests. Many students are struggling with their preparations for JEE Main, NEET and CLAT. “There are constraints in online learning, including clearing difficult concepts. Unless they get the desired help, they will lag behind students from other states. As a fair section of the population is now vaccinated, we can allow students to access coaching centres, with Covid norms in place,” said a senior state official. FIITJEE Kolkata head Debeep Banerjee welcomed the decision. “We need to build up some infrastructural reciprocation. While 50% students will be allowed to attend physical classes, the rest can attend the same class virtually. We are planning a hybrid mode,” he said. Akash Institute chief marketing officer Sudipto Chowdhury said, “We are glad students can return to the classroom. Once Covid is under control, it is a welcome decision that at least 50% students can attend physical classes,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/coaching-centres-to-reopen-with-50-rider/articleshow/85724763.cms||---

Raut said this while addressing the Shiv Sena workers in Nashik city on Saturday — to lay the party’s initial groundwork to prepare for the Nashik civic polls early next year. “Currently, there is a three-party government in the state. Perhaps a single party would be in power in the future,” he said. Later, when reporters asked him if he meant Sena could go it alone, Raut only said: “Wait for some time.”  About the meeting between CM Uddhav Thackeray and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, Raut said this was “nothing unusual” and they can meet to discuss state-related issues.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cant-predict-what-will-happen-on-political-front/articleshow/85727711.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Will bring all Mulayam Singh Yadav loyalists together, says SP president||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said he would reach out to senior leaders of SP who have stood by party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav during his political journey. The announcement came as emotions ran high when veteran politician Ambika Chaudhary broke down while being inducted back into the party fold on Saturday. He was expelled from the party in 2017 and joined BSP. Akhilesh was addressing the media and partymen to announce Chaudhary’s return to the party fold when the Mulayam loyalist broke down, so much so that he could hardly speak. “You are choking with emotions … Today I can understand the pain that you must have gone through when you had to part ways with SP… I will try to rope in everyone who has stood by Netaji (Mulayam) and bring them together …,” Akhilesh said. Chaudhary, who had served as minister in various governments led by Mulayam and Akhilesh before parting ways, described the day as his rebirth. “Aaj punarjanam jaisa lag raha hai (It feels like a rebirth),” he said wiping his tears. A founding member of SP, Chaudhary was seen as a close confidant of the SP patriarch. In the family feud that rocked the Yadav clan ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, Chaudhary was seen siding with uncle Shivpal Yadav and eventually parted ways with SP to join the BSP. Taking a jibe at the ruling BJP over reports of plans to rename Sultanpur and Aligarh districts, Akhilesh said BJP had nothing to showcase in terms of development projects and achievements of the government. “All that they can do is to change names as they have nothing new with them to describe as their achievements,” he said. On a lighter note, he cautioned Chaudhary’s supporters from Ballia to remain alert else the government might change their name as well for supporting their leader who has sided with SP. He lambasted BIP for failing to live up to the promises it had made in its manifesto – ‘Sankalp Patra’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/will-bring-all-msy-loyalists-together-says-sp-president/articleshow/85726953.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

All roads on the convoy route have been sealed and level crossings and railway tracks on the Lucknow-Ayodhya stretch have been barricaded by Saturday evening. While the railway station has undergone a makeover, all buildings along the cavalcade route have been given a fresh coat of yellow to provide a religious hue. An unannounced curfew was in place in the fortified town since Saturday night. On Saturday, the Ayodhya administration conducted a mammoth security rehearsal on the presidential route from railway station to Ram Katha Park and then to Ramjanmabhoomi via Hanumangarhi temple. President Kovind’s four-hour schedule on Sunday includes offering prayers to Ram Lalla and inauguration of Ramayana conclave at Ram Katha Park. After alighting from the presidential saloon, Kovind’s carcade will move towards Ram Katha Park, where he will be received by Governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath.

As per data from the CoWin portal, 7.04 crore doses have been administered in the state so far, reports Shailvee Sharda. Health officials stated that the final figure of the doses administered on Friday were released on Saturday morning. This was the highest number of doses given by any state in a single day. This also broke UP's previous record of 29.52 lakh doses administered on August 3. In a tweet, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath credited the achievement to the cluster strategy of vaccination and congratulated health workers for the hard work behind the milestone. Talking about the 7-crore plus doses in the state, health officials said that the last one crore doses were added in just 10 days which is the fastest in the country. Compared to other states, UP is way ahead on the count. In Maharashtra, the nearest contender, 5.70 crore doses have been administered, followed by Gujarat with 4.54 crore doses. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan follow next with 4.53 crore and 4.26 crore doses respectively. Among districts, Lucknow leads with over 26.24 lakh doses while Chitrakoot ranks last with just 3.40 lakh total doses given. Approximately 5.91 crore persons have taken at least one dose of the vaccine while 1.13 crore are fully vaccinated. This means that nearly 40% of the total eligible population of 15.25 crore have taken at least one jab while over 7.5% are fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, 26 new cases and 45 recoveries were reported in the state in the past 24 hours. With this, the tally for the state reached 17,09,234 of which 16,86,128 have recovered while 22,807 died. Officials insisted on prevention despite decline in the cases stating that the risk of infection was high, and cases were on the rise in other states. They also urged people due for their second dose to get vaccinated to achieve maximum available protection against the pandemic virus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/fri-feat-of-30l-vax-doses-takes-up-beyond-7-cr-mark/articleshow/85734159.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The officials also forced the passengers to get off the buses and asked them to walk for four kilometers through the forest road and board the Karnataka state transport buses to continue their travel. The passengers urged the Tamil Nadu government to initiate talks with Karnataka government regarding allowing Tamil Nadu buses into their state. One of the passengers M Sekar, 37, of Sathyamangalam who used to travel frequently to Chamarajanagar for work told TOI that the inter-state bus operation resumed between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka on August 23. He said, “Tamil Nadu buses entered into Karnataka without any issues at other check-posts, but the police officials on the check-post near Germalam did not allow TN buses since Friday.” He also said that the officials at the check post allowed passengers to enter the neighbouring state only after checking their vaccination certificates. “Passengers with no certificate were asked to return,” he stated. The Tamil Nadu buses entered Karnataka at two places — via Pulinjur and Germalam. “The travellers, who took the Germalam route, had to walk through the reserve forest area to cross over the border,” said S Aravinth, another passenger. He added that a few police officials from Karnataka allowed passengers to enter their state only after showing a Covid-19 ‘negative’ report. After hearing their concerns, Erode district administration assured passengers that they will take all necessary steps to initiate talks with Chamarajanagar district administration to solve the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/erode/state-buses-stopped-at-karnataka-border/articleshow/85724800.cms||---

---||Kolkata||North Kolkata group teaches adults balancing act||KOLKATA: At a time when public transport is preferably being shunned for fear of contracting the novel coronavirus and an increasing number of Kolkatans are pedalling to work, a group of cycle enthusiasts from the Gouribari area in north Kolkata has started holding free learning sessions for beginners every weekend. Learners between 25 and 40 years have been flocking to them. The learners are being trained in a scientific way so that they learn balancing and pedalling quickly and effectively. Sunish Kumar Dev (68), a retired deputy registrar at S N Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, along with a few friends, provided free bicycles for coaching. The coaching, which started in July, is being held from 7am to 8.30am on Saturdays and Sundays. Srimontani Mukherjee (28), an engineer living at Kashi Bose Lane, learnt cycling in just an hour and a half. Dev said, “The most important basics of cycling are balance and pedalling, which can be learnt in one hour if the trainee is physically fit.” Torsa Kundu (25) and her father, Somenath Kundu (62), residents of Gouribari, have volunteered to join Dev as trainers. Torsa, who recently completed her MA from RBU and learnt cycling during last year’s lockdown, said she was happy to join. Ritam Kundu, 26, a PhD student at Institute in Physics in Bhubaneswar, could not learn bicycling earlier as his father did not allow him to ride. “I could learn cycling in my locality now but it’s sometimes humiliating when someone comments about me being a complete novice,” said Kundu. He was also scared of a fall or accident during the learning process. Kundu, who recently completed his training, is happy that his teachers flanked him on the street to avoid a possible fall. “In Bhubaneswar, cycle is a very common mode of transport but I had to travel by bus or walk to reach the campus as I could not cycle,” he said. He had approached several trainers in Kolkata who asked for a charge to teach.  Dev uses a naturally elevated area of about 20 ft on Badridas Temple Street beside Pareshnath Jain Temple to teach trainees balancing. According to him, once the flexibility of the body and mind comes, it’s easy to ride a bicycle. “But the fitness of the lower part of the body is also an important element, something which is lacking in most who learn bicycling at a later age,” he said. Due to an increase in demand, Dev, who is also a member of Kolkata Cycle Samaj that was founded in 2009 by Raghu Jana with a member strength of more than 6000, now plans to extend the service to south Kolkata with the help of other members.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/n-kol-group-teaches-adults-balancing-act/articleshow/85724848.cms||Sudipto Das
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Covid-19: Weekly TPR over 20% in 36 local bodies of Thiruvananthapuram||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The district which had just one local body with a weekly test positivity rate (TPR) of 20% or above in the beginning of August now has 36 local bodies with weekly TPR above 20%. On August 1, Edava was the lone panchayat in the district with a weekly TPR of 21.7%. But as on August 27, four panchayats in the district Pazhayakunnummel, Mudakkal, Kallikadu and Uzhamalackal have recorded weekly TPR of 30% and above with Pazhayakunnummel recording the highest weekly TPR of 33.1%. Of all the local bodies, Mudakkal is the one panchayat which has not been able to tame Covid-19 for more than two months. While all other local bodies managed to bring down the number of cases, Mudakkal’s case graph has more or less remained the same even as many panchayats dragged themselves out of the second wave peak. As on August 27, Mudakkal recorded a weekly TPR of 31.5%. On Saturday, active cases stood at 456. The panchayat authorities said that the reluctance of infected people to come to domiciliary care centres (DCC) and first-line treatment centres (CFLTCs) and presence of many colonies resulted in more cases. “Mudakkal has 44 colonies in all the wards; which is one of the highest numbers for any local body. When we identify a primary contact of an infected person, they refuse to be shifted to DCC or CFLTC and in closely populated areas, there is no way to ensure proper room isolation. Sharing of eating spaces and toilets leads to fast spread of infection. The situation has been really challenging for us,” said Mudakkal gram panchayat president A Chandra Babu. Of the 456 active cases, 377 persons have opted for home care in the panchayat. The district had over 50 local bodies with weekly TPR below 10% at the start of this month. As August comes to a close, only 17 panchayats have managed to record weekly TPR below 10%. While coastal panchayats always featured in areas with high infection rates earlier, many coastal panchayats recorded a weekly TPR of below 10% and the district’s lowest weekly TPRs are currently recorded at Poovar with 3.9% and Karumkulam with 3%. Other coastal panchayats like Karode, Kulathoor, Anchuthengu also record weekly TPRs of 5% and below in the district. The civic body’s weekly TPR has gone up from 7.2% to 9% between August 1 and 27. While the rise in number of Covid cases has been evident, the critical care occupancy rate has come down between August 1 and 27. On August 1, ICU vacancy in the district was 55% which has now increased to 62%. Ventilator occupancy which stood at 53% has increased to 68% on August 27.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/weekly-tpr-over-20-in-36-local-bodies/articleshow/85723006.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Mumbai||How a war hero won India’s first Paralympics gold in 1972||Minutes before Murlikant Petkar sat down to kill himself at the INHS Ashwini Naval hospital in 1967, a sweeper came rushing towards him and asked for Rs 10 for ‘matka’, a popular form of street gambling. Petkar — who was about to gulp down 30 carefully-accumulated sleeping pills with alcohol — handed the sweeper Rs 100 instead. When the sweeper suggested that he, too, should bet on the same number, Petkar gave him another 100-rupee note but asked him to put it on a number whose last digit was one higher than the one that had appeared in the sweeper’s dream. The next morning, Petkar’s body would not only throw up the liquor and the pills but also feel the need to urinate for the first time since the fateful day in October 1965 when bullets pelted his body. On realizing that he had won a matka of Rs 40,000, Petkar’s bladder had woken up. If not for this twist of fate, India would not have won its first Paralympics individual gold medal in 1972. “Destiny has always been both cruel and kind to me,” says the Pune-based 73-year-old over a video call from his living room—a museum of medals and trophies that inspire young patrons in his building in Khadki. Even as he watches the Tokyo Paralympics with a keen pair of eyes, one of which isn’t his own, the Padma Shri-winning swimmer has been revisiting his journey for international TV channels, his crutches by his side. Petkar was a star army boxer nicknamed Chotu Tiger when he visited Kashmir in 1965. There, many who assumed the long wail of a siren signalling an unprovoked attack by the Pakistani Air Force to be the whistling call from the evening mess, died while waiting for tea. An army jeep ran over Petkar’s legs after he was thrown off by the impact of the bullets that hit his calves and thighs and kissed his right cheekbone and skull. “There’s still a bullet lodged in his spine,” reminds Petkar’s son Arjun, an Ordnance Factory employee who makes bullets for a living. One of six underfed children of an impoverished freedom-fighter father from the wrestling belt of Sangli, Petkar mimes stirring a large cauldron while recalling the fresh thandai prepared at the local akhada in his village, Islampur. The drink had filled out his emaciated body even as he trained there under local wrestler Ganpat Khedkar. Petkar slaps his right upper arm to show the signal gesture that had elicited a massive roar during the infamous bout in which the 12-year-old went up against the son of the headman of a nearby village for a prize of Rs 5. “Normally, the prizes were batashas and coconuts. But the stakes of this match were such that the villagers threw lots of coins on the cloth,” he recalls. Knives emerged after Petkar won the match that the crowd from Kanderi interpreted as a deliberate insult to their village. Khedkar fled the scene after thrusting the winners’ cash in Petkar’s pocket and plonked him on a truck that took him to Pune. A week later, Petkar found himself on a train to Bangalore soon after his Pune-based uncle had taken him to the local army recruitment centre . In the army institute, Petkar trained hard and rose quickly in hockey. “But I was not selected for the Karnataka team as I was a Maratha boy,” recalls a bitter Petkar, who then swore off hockey and turned to boxing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/how-a-war-hero-won-indias-first-paralympics-gold-in-1972-in-mumbai/articleshow/85727717.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh polls: Mukhtar Ansari’s brother, old samajwadi hand Ambika Chaudhary join SP||LUCKNOW: Sibghatullah Ansari, former Bahujan Samaj Party MLA and brother of jailed gangsters and legislator Mukhtar Ansari, joined Samajwadi Party on Saturday. SP founding member Ambika Chaudhary, who was expelled from the party in 2017 for siding with Shivpal during the tussle within the Yadav clan and joined BSP, also returned to the SP-fold along with his supporters. Sibghatullah joining the SP was a somewhat ‘internal’ affair that took place before the SP workers in the auditorium where party leadership usually holds its meetings. Ambika Chaudhary joined the party in another event at the auditorium where SP chief regularly interacts with the press persons. SP national president Akhilesh Yadav chaired the two events. Welcoming Sibghatullah and his supporters to SP, Akhilesh expressed hope that development will strengthen the party further and the impact would be visible in the 2022 assembly poll results. Talking to TOI Sibghatullah skipped queries on what prompted him to snap his ties with BSP as his two brothers Afzal and Mukhtar at present are sitting BSP MP and MLA respectively. “I will talk about it later,” he said. Later asked by media if Afzal would also join the SP, Sibghatullah said it was for his brother to decide. Sibghatullah Ansari had won the 2007 assembly election from Mohammadabad constituency of Ghazipur district on a Samajwadi Party ticket and again contested and won from the seat in 2012 on a ticket of Quami Ekta Dal (QED) that was floated by his brother Afzal and Mukhtar Ansari. In 2017, it was the merger of this QED with SP that had brought into the open the cold war that was waging between Shivpal and Akhilesh Yadav. Days after Shivpal announced the merger, Akhilesh — as state president of SP — strongly opposed the move. As chief minister, he went on to sack the then cabinet minister Balram Yadav for orchestrating the merger as it was not in line with SP state chief’s plans of alliance and mergers. Eventually, QED latched on to the Bahujan Samaj Party bandwagon accusing the ruling SP of backstabbing it. On the other hand, Chaudhary is a founding member of SP and close associate of Mulayam Singh Yadav. He was expelled from the party in 2017 for anti-party activities. Allegations were that he was close to Shivpal then who himself had parted ways with Akhilesh after the latter took over as the party president replacing Mulayam Singh Yadav. His son Anand Chaudhary, who contested the Panchayat chairman polls from Ballia backed by Samajwadi Party (SP) also formally joined the party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/mukhtars-brother-old-samajwadi-hand-ambika-chaudhary-join-sp/articleshow/85727049.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The 400-page chargesheet was filed under the amended rape laws with the cops invoking Section 37A (DB) of the Indian Penal Code under which the rape of a girl under the age of 12 years by one or more men is punishable with death or life imprisonment. Police have charged the men with murder, intimidation and destruction of evidence while invoking provisions of the POCSO Act and the SC/ST Act. The chargesheet was filed within 30 days of the incident as directed by Union home minister Amit Shah during a review of the case. The trial will be conducted by a fast track court. Shah had asked Delhi Police to swiftly complete the investigation and file a chargesheet within a month so that the victim’s family got speedy justice. The home minister had asked Delhi Police to show zero tolerance for crimes against women and to ensure stringent punishment for perpetrators. Delhi Police filed their report before a duty metropolitan magistrate at the Patiala House Courts. The court will consider the chargesheet on August 21. The case was transferred from Delhi Cantonment police station to the Crime Branch of Delhi Police on August 5 following which a special investigation team was constituted for a speedy probe. "During the investigation, scientific, technical and other evidence were gathered and analysed. Testimonies of relevant witnesses were also recorded,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal. “Besides, we received the assistance of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Rohini, and Delhi Police’s forensic experts on biology and odontology." According to police, forensic psychologists were also engaged during the interrogation of the accused, who are currently in jail. Sources said that the evidence on record suggests that at least two of the accused — Radheshyam and Kuldeep — sexually assaulted the girl while the other two — Saleem Ahmed and Lakshmi Narayan — helped cremate the body surreptitiously. As reported by TOI on August 24, cops traced the internet history of Radheshyam that showed extensive surfing of pornographic sites. He apparently had three phones, one of which was used for watching pornography. That phone was thrown into the burning pyre, the accused have confessed. The quartet reportedly confessed during forensic psychology examination that they had shown an adult film clipping to the victim on their mobile phone. Police relied on the DNA analysis and forensic examination of the water cooler, which showed no signs of any short circuit that might have electrocuted the girl. On August 1, the girl left her home around 5.30pm to fetch water from the crematorium water cooler. Around 6pm, one of the accused told the mother that her daughter had been electrocuted after coming in contact with the water cooler and had died. The accused also told the mother that involving the cops would complicate matters and that the family should cremate the child's body without delay. However, the mother raised an alarm and called for help. Before the girl’s body was fully incinerated, over 200 villagers caught the accused and handed them over to police. Delhi Police registered a case and arrested the four men on the basis of the statement given by the girl’s alleging the rape of her minor daughter and her murder and cremation without the family's consent.

---||Kochi||Thiruvananthapuram: Cop falsely accuses child, father of stealing phone||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The prejudice shown by a woman police officer has caused severe mental trauma to a Class III student after the former allegedly harassed the child and her father in public by falsely accusing them of stealing her mobile phone from the police vehicle. The incident happened on Friday afternoon at Moonnumukku near Attingal. After the visuals of the incident shot by a person on the spot went viral on social media, the state child rights commission registered a suo motu case and launched a probe on Saturday against Rajitha, an officer of the pink police squad attached with Attingal police station. The girl’s father Jayachandran said he had gone to Moonnumukku with his daughter Devipriya after she wished to see the passing of the giant trailer transporting the massive equipment (settling chamber of the trisonic wind tunnel) to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre at Thumba. “She was scrolling through the social media feed on my phone and saw the news of the transportation of the equipment,” said Jayachandran, a rubber tapping worker residing near Thonnackal. While waiting for the trailer at Moonnumukku Junction, they went to a nearby shop for refreshments. When they returned to the spot where the father had parked his two-wheeler, the officer whose patrol car was parked nearby summoned him and the child and demanded to give back her phone. When he said he did not take it, the officer turned towards the girl and told her to give back the phone which the girl had taken from the car and handed over to her father. The situation escalated quickly and people gathered around them. Soon, the officer’s mobile phone was found from her bag that was kept inside the car. The officer later claimed that she did not harass the father-daughter duo and merely inquired with them whether they took the phone. But, the witnesses contradicted her claim. Meanwhile, Attingal DSP Suneesh Babu said he has conducted a preliminary inquiry after the video went viral and has submitted the report before the district police chief (rural).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cop-falsely-accuses-child-father-of-stealing-phone/articleshow/85723036.cms||---

When the woman refused, there was a quarrel in which the duo had pushed the woman. After the woman fainted, they had strangled her and disposed of the body in a box near a water canal.Few days later, the S S Colony police recovered the woman’s body and registered a case. Three years later, police arrested Murugan in February 2014 and based on his confession Saravanan was also arrested.The Madurai district mahila court convicted and sentenced both the men to undergo life imprisonment in 2020. Challenging the same, Murugan and Saravanan had filed a criminal appeal before the HC Madurai bench. A division bench of justices V Bharathidasan and J Nisha Banu observed that it is a case of circumstantial evidence. Though the occurrence was in 2011, the accused were arrested only in 2014 based on some mobile phone call details. Except this, there are no other strong circumstances available in this case pointing out the guilt of the accused.Hence, the judges directed them to be enlarged on bail on certain conditions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-suspends-sentence-of-two-in-murder-case/articleshow/85727048.cms||---
---||Madurai||Woman acquitted of killing daughter||Madurai: Bringing relief to a woman who was jailed for nearly 11 years on charges of murdering her one year and three months old daughter by throwing her into a well in 2002, the Madras high court has acquitted her saying that the very charge that she had thrown the child into the well and caused her death, was not proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.According to the prosecution, the woman (appellant) and her husband have three daughters, including the deceased child. There were frequent quarrels between the couple and during one such quarrel on September 14, 2002, the woman took her youngest child and left her house. The next day, the husband was informed that the child was found dead in a well.The husband lodged a police complaint stating that his wife threw their daughter in a well. Few days later, police arrested the woman who was working in a powerloom unit in Namakkal. She gave a statement that she had left the child with her husband, and that she learnt about her daughter’s death only when the police apprehended her.In 2004, the Trichy sessions court convicted and sentenced the woman to undergo life imprisonment for for offence under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. Challenging the same, she had filed an appeal before the HC Madurai bench, however, the same was dismissed in 2014.When the woman moved an appeal, the Supreme Court in 2020 had remanded the matter back to the HC Madurai bench for disposing of the appeal on merits and granted bail to her by considering the fact that she has been in jail for 11 years.A division bench of justices V Bharathidasan and J Nisha Banu observed that the postmortem report revealed that there was no water in the stomach, lungs and in the intestine, and no froth was coming out of the child’s mouth. The judges took note of the government doctor’s statement that if the body is thrown into the water after death, it will not enter into the lungs, stomach and intestine.The judges observed that from the facts and circumstances, they cannot conclusively come to the conclusion that the death was due to drowning and there was a possibility that the child might have been thrown into the well after death. Hence, the judges set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court and acquitted the woman of all charges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/woman-acquitted-of-killing-daughter/articleshow/85727040.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Of 895 sandalwood trees counted in 2010, over 50% cut illegally?||Nagpur: For the last decade or so, an organized mafia has been active to cut down sandalwood trees in the city. After a series of thefts across the city, it is estimated that over 500 sandalwood trees worth crores have been chopped. The last tree census in the city was done in 2010. As per a senior official from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) garden department, the city had 21.43 lakh trees of various species. Of them, 895 were sandalwood trees. The NMC has no fresh record of sandalwood trees intact in the city. It is feared that hardly 50% of the 895 trees are now remain. The official admitted that theft of sandalwood trees has increased manifold. Habitual offenders cut sandalwood trees and smuggle them to sandalwood oil extraction factories in different parts of the country. In the last two years, the city has recorded at least 20 thefts of sandalwood trees — recently at Ambazari garden — from across the city, especially West Nagpur, said the official. Green activists have demanded a fresh census of at least sandalwood trees, which are included in the Red List of Indian Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a vulnerable category. “This means that local authorities (garden department and forests) are primarily responsible for their protection,” said environmental activist Jaydeep Das. Das further said that of late multiple cases of sandalwood tree thefts, some from parks, gardens and many others from bungalows of government officials themselves, have been reported. “NMC’s failure to conduct a tree census for over a decade shows that they are unaware of the number of species and location in an area for which they are responsible,” he said. The green crusader said that authorities have failed to take any concrete action against those cutting trees illegally in the city. “The thieves are aware of this lethargic attitude of authorities and have no one to fear,” he said. According to founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee, due to high commercial value, many sandalwood trees have been felled illegally in the recent past. “It is surprising that sandalwood trees are being felled and taken away without getting noticed,” he said. “Tree census has been postponed a number of times due to various reasons like lack of manpower and funds,” he said and demanded that at least census of sandalwood trees be done “as they are one of the costliest species and their number is not substantial”. “Instead of conducting tree census in one go, it can be a tree or area specific multilayer project,” he said. Chatterjee said that during morning hours, gangs involved in illegal tree cutting are moving on cycles unmarked across the city. “Once NMC starts taking strict action against such individuals, incidents of sandalwood as well as other tree feeling will reduce substantially,” he said.

---||Mumbai||Changes afoot as Islam Gymkhana gets a jacuzzi & pool||The paved, narrow road from Marine Drive leads to a building abutting Marine Lines railway station’s platform one where a liveried doorman greets you. You enter a shining, high-ceilinged lobby where you meet maroon jacket-cad smiling male and female receptionists. Turn left and pass through a barcoded glass door that opens into an air conditioned seating area with sofas and a glass-topped table in the middle. Current copies of India’s top English weeklies and dailies engage you while you wait for a friend and order tea or coffee. Don’t mistake it for a new five-star hotel at Marine Lines. This is the 129-year-old, iconic Islam Gymkhana preening in its redeveloped, jazzy look. Once known mostly for nurturing cricketing and billiards and snooker champions, the Gymkhana recently created facilities that modern clubs and hotels flaunt. At the northern tip of the premises along the wall that separates the Gymkhana from the busy railway platform, you reach a fenced area called ‘health and mental well-being’ section. It houses facilities that not many can easily associate with Islam Gymkhana. If a state-of-the-art gym helps tone up the muscles, its jacuzzi, steam, sauna and spa help soothe the nerves. A soon-to-be-opened swimming pool will help its health-conscious members stretch their muscles more or sunbathe at its deck. To get clarity on reasons behind Islam Gymkhana’s redevelopment, we meet its president, former MLA Yusuf Abrahni at his trendy, marble-floored lounge.  “Before I took over, the gymkhana looked poor and many called it “Yateemkhana (orphanage),” says Abrahni surrounded by several office bearers, including general secretary Noorul Amin, head of the ‘ladies’ wing’ Rakhshan Hussain who is happy the women have their own prayer room and separate timing for gym and jacuzzi, secretary of the gym Ghulam Hussain and fitness consultant Shahzad Shaikh. “Like other institutions, gymkhanas reflect the status of the communities they serve. We are grateful to Mumbai collector Rajiv Nivatkar who granted permissions after we met all the legal conditions,” reasons Abrahni who, for August 15 inauguration, invited state Congress president Nana Patole, former minister Naseem Khan, minister Aslam Shaikh, former MLA Baba Siddiqui and MLAs Amin Patel and Zeeshan Siddiqui. “The Gymkhana is a place where members unwind. There is nothing wrong if modern amenities have been created here,” Amin Patel told TOI. But former president Zakaullah Siddiqui flags a dissent. “I had made it a community centre and got photographs of past presidents framed on a wall. I’m told they have junked the presidents’ photographs in a warehouse and the trophies to a corner,” protests Siddiqui.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-changes-afoot-as-islam-gymkhana-gets-a-jacuzzi-pool/articleshow/85727722.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

Chamber president N Jegatheesan said that this new flyover will be instrumental in decongesting the ancient city that is witnessing a sharp increase in vehicle population. He said that overbridges to be built at Viraganur road junction and Aruppukottai road junction will also ease traffic movement to the city. The chamber suggested an elevated highway from Yanaikkal Junction to Periyar bus stand through South Gate Junction to decongest the city better. The association suggested a flyover from Anna Statue to Simmakkal, Periyar bus stand and Madura College. The chamber reiterated its demand for the speedy completion of feasibility study for the metro rail project and to implement it.Other projects announced for the southern region are Rs 56 lakh to prepare the DPR for a flyover at the Veeramanickapuram junction near the new bus stand in Tirunelveli city.

The state got 19 lakh doses from the Centre and has dispatched these to districts—including 75,000 to Mumbai —to exhaust the stock quickly. Of these, 15.7 lakh are Covishield doses needed for almost 97% beneficiaries due for the second dose. Around 3.7 lakh Covaxin doses have been sent too. According to state data, more than 16.1 lakh people are due for the second dose of Covishield and over 7.75 lakh for the second Covaxin jab. Maharashtra's National Health Mission commissioner Ramaswami N told TOI: “We expect to get more vaccines in September, so we are trying to cover maximum beneficiaries due for the second dose in time.” On the stress on maximum coverage on Monday, he said, “We have told the districts to finish off the latest lot of doses so that we could get more vaccines from the Centre and increase the coverage further. The sooner the doses are administered and exhausted, we can demand more vaccines thereafter.” Meanwhile, of the 1.3 lakh people who got vaccinated in Mumbai on Saturday, 50,734 doses were given at BMC-run centres while 79,389 were administered at private centres. The total number of doses given out in Mumbai since January 16 are 91.4 lakh, including 24 lakh people who are fully vaccinated with two doses. According to the state vaccine data, 9.9 lakh people got vaccinated on Friday, taking the number of doses distributed so far to 5.63 crore. Ramaswami said the state was expected to get around 30 lakh vaccine doses for school teachers as a special case in the next three to four days. “Overall, the country will provide around two crore doses to the states to vaccinate school teachers. Maharashtra usually gets around 10% of the total quantity,” he said. The state health ministry wants to vaccinate between nine and 15 lakh people every day so that it can cover the eligible population within the next three months. Ramaswami said all districts have to ensure that due dates do not lapse. “Some states in India have allocated a certain number of days in a week to give the second dose only. We are analysing the district-wise due lists and, if necessary, we may go for such an arrangement too,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/1-3l-jabs-in-city-in-a-day-drive-in-state-with-19l-fresh-doses/articleshow/85723052.cms||Neha Madaan

No case was registered but the mother, her aunt and couple to whom the child was given were let off with a warning after the district child welfare committee (CWC) obtained a statement in writing from them.CWC member B Pandiaraja told TOI that the baby’s mother, 30, from Paravai was married to a man nearly twice her age 10 years ago. She had a child with him and the girl is now nine years old. After getting separated from him about four years ago, she started living with another person, with whom she conceived again. It is learnt that the man, who is ailing from cancer, was also married and returned to his family recently. Under these circumstances, the pregnant woman returned to live with her stepmother in Paravai. She delivered the baby girl on August 20 in GRH and was discharged on Friday. Fearing criticism from neighbours if they returned home, the stepmother contacted a woman she met in GRH a few months ago. Though the 32-year-old woman and her 55-year-old husband have two children, the woman evinced interest in adopting the newborn. The baby was taken to their house in Harveypatti.Meanwhile the husband of the “adoptive couple” got annoyed on coming to know about his wife’s interest and asked her to return the baby. It was in this backdrop that an unknown caller called the police helpline and informed that a newborn was illegally sold for Rs 1.5 lakh. The baby was returned to the real mother in the evening.City police inspectors Anuratha and Flower Sheela and senior officers conducted an inquiry with those involved in the incident on Friday night. On Saturday, CWC members Pandiaraja and L Shamugam, district child protection officer Sridhar and the police conducted inquiry and got a statement from all of them. The mother has been asked to produce the baby before the CWC every month. However, police said a case would be registered and action taken if any financial transaction had taken place for the illegal adoption.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/baby-girl-given-in-illegal-adoption-rescued-within-hours/articleshow/85727082.cms||M K Ananth
---||Madurai||No resistance during sexual assault amounts to pre-consent: Madras high court||MADURAI: Giving the benefit of doubt to a man who was convicted and sentenced in a sexual assault case, the Madras high court acquitted him by observing that the non-raising of resistance during the first time of sexual assault amounts to pre-consent and accordingly, the consent given by the woman cannot be held as a misconception of fact. According to the prosecution, the man (appellant) from Madurai district had committed committed sexual assault on the woman from the same village and impreganted her. The Madurai mahila court in 2016 convicted and sentenced him to undergo 10 years imprisonment for offence under Section 376 (rape) of IPC. Justice R Pongiappan observed that the woman had specifically stated before the trial court that she fell in love with the appellant, and regularly met him. The woman had lodged a complaint about the sexual assault nearly two-and-a-half months later, only when the man went back on his promise of marrying her. The judge observed that the circumstances revealed that the man had promised to marry her after the completion of his brother’s marriage. Only after this promise, the woman also continued her relationship with him. It was not found anywhere in the evidence that the appellant had given any definite date or any timeline to marry her. The judge observed that eventually when she conceived, she insisted that the marriage should be performed soon and that is when the appellant suggested for abortion. Since the proposal was not accepted by the woman and the appellant disowned the promise, the case was registered. Hence, the judge observed that this court has doubts as to whether the woman has approached the police with full of truth or with false averment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/no-resistance-during-sexual-assault-amounts-to-pre-consent-hc/articleshow/85727068.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Speaking to the media for the first time after her daughter succumbed to her injuries a few days ago, she said that if the government wanted to ensure justice for her daughter it would have to pursue the case in court strongly against BSP MP Atul Rai as she was not capable of doing so due to her poor financial condition. Coming back to her Ballia home after the last rites of her daughter in Delhi, she said: “I want capital punishment for the accused Atul Rai (BSP MP from Ghosi). I wish that he should die suffering the same kind of pain which my daughter suffered.” Her daughter had filed a rape case against Rai in March 2019 in Varanasi. Calling upon the government to take forward the case, the complainant’s mother said: “If there is a government and it wants justice for my daughter, it should pursue the case strongly. I am not capable of contesting the case. I can’t do anything if no justice is done to her,” she said. “I came to know that Atul Rai had committed something wrong with my daughter when he came to my house after lodging a case to threaten us. He said that he had helped my daughter a lot.” Though the police have provided security cover to the family, the complainant’s mother said, “Now, I am not afraid of anyone as I have already lost my daughter, who struggled a lot for justice against a strongman but failed to get it as the voice of the poor remains unheard.” Mentioning that her daughter was talented and cared for her siblings, she said that she had been studying to make a decent career. The complainant never talked to her over phone out of fear but made a few WhatsApp calls, she added. After the complainant’s mother and brother returned from Delhi, Ballia SP Rajkaran Nayyar sent a deputy SP to their place to meet them on Friday. Nayyar told TOI on Saturday, “In view of the family’s security concerns, a police picket has been deployed near their house.” The complainant had lodged rape case against Atul Rai with Lanka police in Varanasi on May 1, 2019. Rai contested 2019 Lok Sabha election as absconder on BSP-SP alliance ticket and after emerging victorious he surrendered before the court. Since then he is in Naini jail. The case was in progress at MP-MLA court Prayagraj. On August 16, the complainant and her associate who was also the prime witness in the case immolated themselves outside the Supreme Court in Delhi after levelling serious allegations against senior police officials, retired IPS Amithabh Thakur, serving IPS officer Amit Pathak and others through livestreaming on FB.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/want-rape-accused-to-suffer-the-trauma-of-my-daughter/articleshow/85727108.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

They want to study and teachers are also putting in efforts to ensure they reach students. However, without reopening schools, there will always be lack of uniformity among students in learning,” said said M Porchelvan, district secretary, Tamizhaga Arambapalli Asiriyar Koottani, Madurai. Government school teachers said students have been adapting to learning from home now with more than a year passing since the pandemic struck.“We are in touch with students over phone calls and through WhatsApp groups and are checking if they are watching ‘Kalvi Tholaikatchi’. We are also giving homework through notebooks. Students can complete the work and parents can come and take the notebooks to and from the school. Similarly, assignments are also being given to develop skills like drawing,” said Moses, a government primary school teacher. He said though less than 50% students have access to smart phones, those who do have it have been keen to make use of it. “Students are happy and keen to participate when we share homework or assignments. Though it is not the same as in classroom, students are starting to pick up from video lessons. However, it is only less than 50% of students who continually invest in learning. What do we do with others? They may not even come back to school,” said the headmaster of a government school. There is also a divide among parents as well with some supporting students to study from home and others not so keen on it when they get to middle school level. “We have only one smart phone and I have to take it with me when I go to work. But, whenever it is at home, I try to get my daughter to study what is shared by teachers. Now we understand that there is no choice and parents have to put in effort to ensure children study,” said S Sundari, mother of a Class VI student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/steps-to-improve-remote-learning-not-enough/articleshow/85727120.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

However, Kumar was shellshocked as he helplessly watched his co-worker Akash Singh drop dead from the girder. Onlookers also expressed a sense of relief as the accident took place before 6pm, else the casualties would have been more due to the weekend crowds.Operating the ‘I Girder’ from below, he ran away from the spot on hearing the noise. “Akash Singh was standing on top of the structure and working. I heard a noise from the girders and saw it collapse. I immediately ran away from the spot to safety,” Kumar recalled while narrating the incident.The structure that collapsed was 35 meters long, 5.5 meters wide and is a set of three ‘I Girders’ that form a segment between two pillars. Its weight is said to be 70 to 90 tonnes. It fell down eight meters from the ground level, giving the effect of an earthquake in the adjoining areas.“I was attending a customer between 4.15 and 4.30pm in the evening. It was like a mild tremor as the building started to vibrate coupled with a thundering crash sound,” R Praveen Kennedy, an employee of an optical shop opposite the accident site who was among the first to witness the collapse, told TOI.“The entire area was covered with dust for a few seconds. I was not able to see anything. Only a little later I noticed that a portion of the flyover had collapsed. There were only three to four people in the area and no other employees were present,” Kennedy added.The onlookers and other workers rushed to the spot and noticed Singh amidst the shambles with his left hand cut off and his right leg broken. Since he was still alive, he called the 108 ambulance. “Every evening around 6pm several street vendors used to set up food stalls in their push carts under the main bridge and the portion that collapsed. Many people used to park their vehicles under the bridge and have food at these stalls. If the incident had happened after 6pm, it would have resulted in many casualties,” Kennedy added with a sigh of relief.District collector S Aneesh Sekhar said that the flyover work has been suspended. He said that a team has been constituted to inspect if safety precautions were followed in the site and that work on the entre stretch will be suspended till the inspection is completed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/survivor-saw-colleague-come-crashing-down/articleshow/85727101.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Goa||Goa: Hygiene audit must for food, sweet outlets, says FDA||PANAJI: With the festival season around the corner, the Directorate of Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has directed all the food business operators in Goa to register for a hygiene audit within 30 days. The FDA has also asked all outlets that sell sweets to display the expiry date next to each tray of sweets or risk paying fines. All restaurants, bakeries, meat shops, sweet shops and any other store selling food items have to undertake the hygiene rating audits and any food outlets that have a manufacturing category licence need to submit their annual returns online before August 31 failing which a penalty of Rs 100 per day will be levied. “Food Business Operators (FBO’S) engaged in sale of sweets (Indian Sweets) shall compulsorily display the best before date on each sweet tray displayed at their counter. Non compliance will attract penalty,” said FDA director Jyoti Sardesai. Last year, the FSSAI had made it mandatory to write the ‘best before date’ on sweets plates in shops for the open sale of sweets, but did not impose any restriction on the date for making sweets. Packaged sweets and food items already carry an expiry date along with details of manufacturer and food safety licences. All FBOs shall compulsorily display their FSSAI licence and registration and the applicable Food Safety Display Board (FSDB) in the business premises at a prominent place and also print it on the bills that are issued to customers, the FDA has said. Ganesh Chaturthi will be celebrated on September 10, followed by Dussehra in October and Diwali in November. The FDA’s new directives are as per the requirement that came into force last year. Food outlets also need to have at least one person who possess Food Safety Training and Certification (FOSTAC). All applications for new licences as well as renewals have to done online through the FSSAI portal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fda-hygiene-audit-must-for-food-sweet-outlets/articleshow/85724994.cms||---

Compared to Friday when there were just 115 prosecutions till noon or the 106 charged on Thursday, Saturday’s numbers were double and forced cops to take strict action. Among areas where the number of prosecutions were high were New Market, where those violating rules were put into police vans and fined Rs 100 before being allowed to go. The numbers were also high at Maniktala, Ultadanga and Girish Park. In comparison, cops claimed Gariahat saw much greater compliance. “We found people were more careful while shopping for Pujas. In comparison, the grocery and fish markets saw far greater violations,” said an officer. “We have begun announcements outside the market complexes once again. We are asking the gated communities to be careful as the numbers are beginning to rise. We are also asking everyone to wear masks, disinfect the common passages and lifts from time to time and restrict entry of outsiders. At markets, it is important everyone wears a mask and each tries to maintain some distance. Anyone breaking the rules will face arrests and will be charged under the Disaster Management Act,” said the officer. The cops, though, said that the tendency to not wear masks has seen a rise this month. “The fear factor is still missing despite the rise in daily Covid cases. We have been handing challans to 150-200 people daily since the past week. Even on Wednesday, we issued challans to 86 people till noon.” said a joint commissioner at Lalbazar. Traders of major markets will also be asked to sell items only to those buyers who have masks. KMC Board of Administrators chairman Firhad Hakim on Friday held an urgent meeting to enforce Covid protocols at major markets. Later, Hakim said the civic body will act against the traders who will entertain customers without masks. Kolkata’s markets had become hot spots of Covid infection last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mask-norm-goes-for-a-toss-in-mkts-cops-prosecute-261/articleshow/85723058.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The gang, police said, duped foreigners of over US $ 1,00,000 (around Rs 75 lakh) in August alone. Two of the gang members, Suneet Gautam from Jhajra and Sumit Dhawan from Mandi Road, were arrested. Four others, Abhinav Kumar, Aniket, Piyush and Kuldeep Singh from Patna in Bihar, managed to escape. Jawahar Lal, deputy superintendent of police, STF, said, “Efforts are on to trace the four accused who are still at large. We have seized two laptops and 15 desktops from the gang. On interrogation, the gang members said that once the fake software was installed in the victim's computer system, they used to block their numbers.” According to police, the gang was distributed into different teams. One of the teams would collect data and the others would send pop-up messages to targeted systems, saying these were infected with viruses and charge $700 (Rs 49,000) to install an anti-virus. The gang used to operate from an office that they had rented at Prem Nagar. STF sleuths said they had been tracing cyber crime gangs active in the state capital for some time and this one was on their radar since the past one month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/history-sheeter-brother-held-in-rs-30-crore-land-fraud-case/articleshow/85723072.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Tyre burst before take-off delays flight||KOLKATA: A Delhi-bound Air India plane suffered a rear tyre burst while it was about to taxi for take-off at Kolkata airport on Saturday morning. The aircraft had to return to the parking bay to offload the passengers before the engineering team could work on it. The plane finally took off nearly five hours later. The incident happened with Air India flight AI-402 at 10.20am when the flight with 226 passengers and 10 crew members was preparing to take off as per its scheduled departure at 10.25am. “When it was about to taxi, one of its rear tyres burst with a bang. Usually, pilots check brake efficiency after pushback by applying the brakes. This appears to have led to jamming of the wheels and it burst,” said an AI captain. Boeing B787 Dreamliner aircraft that was doing the Delhi flight has an electrical brake system unlike other planes like Boeing B737 or Airbus A320 that have hydraulic brake systems. While a rear tyre burst does not usually pose a threat as there are four wheels in each of the two landing gears to the rear of an aircraft. Damage to the nose wheel poses a greater risk. “Usually, tyres are inspected after every landing and before a take-off. But still, the upper rivet of a tyre does come off at times. There have been instances in which the ATC has alerted pilots after rubber pieces have been found on the runway following a flight’s take-off,” a captain said. The fight finally took off with 191 passengers at 3.52pm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tyre-burst-before-take-off-delays-flight/articleshow/85723078.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The Telangana government has asked KRMB to stop AP from diverting Krishna water outside the basin till Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-II (Brijesh Kumar Tribunal) finalises the share of water and also stop construction activity taken up in violation of the AP Reorganization Act, 2014. In a letter to KRMB on Friday, Telangana irrigation engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar said Srisailam was conceived as a hydro-electric project and, as per the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-1, no diversion of water outside the basin was allowed. He said the erstwhile AP government had taken up HNSS without approval for drawing water from Srisailam. C Muralidhar said,“It is known to all that Krishna is a deficit basin and diverting water from it to outside the basin, basin areas adjacent to the river, suffer from severe scarcity of water. It is highly objectionable and does not stand to any logic or principles.” He said Telangana wrote several letters to KRMB, bringing it to the board’s notice about HNSS and other projects and diversion of water outside the basin. “The works were not stalled. Moreover, several new GOs were issued by the AP government to expand the canal capacity from 3,850 cusecs to 6,300 cusecs. All these diversions will certainly affect the needs of Krishna basin areas of Telangana from Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar. These actions of AP will further affect as 3,850 cusecs diversion is illegal and against the provisions of KWDT-1 (Bachwat Award). Taking up further enhancements is untenable and should not be allowed,” he added. “KWDT-1 said that priority should be given to basin projects while equitable allocations are made for future projects in Srisailam water. KWDT-II rejected the demands for allocation of Krishna water by the united AP government for 29.57 tmcft to KC canal and another 10 tmcft for Tungabhadra high level canal since they are serving outside the basin (Pennar basin),” Muralidhar said. Despite both the Krishna tribunals imposed restrictions on utilisation of water in Tungabhadra sub-basin, the AP government has been diverting water, the ENC said. The Telangana government asked AP from divertingKrishan water outside the basin till Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-II finalises the share of water and also to stop construction activity taken up in violation of the AP Reorganization Act, 2014||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/stop-diverting-krishna-water-to-handri-neeva-t-to-krmb/articleshow/85725023.cms||Koride Mahesh

It will be a challenge for teachers and students as they will be divided further into more sections with both online and offline classes.The most common method to implement the guidelines put forth by the state government has been to have online and offline classes on alternate days for different classes. “In our school, we have decided to have online and offline classes on alternate days with students being divided into sections of 20 students each. The classes will be from 9am to 3pm. We did not want half day classes for students as it is difficult for parents to manage. Students who are sick or are not willing to come to school can continue with only online classes,” said Barath Silvester Raj, dean, Sri Aurobindo Mira group of educational institutions. He added that while it may be a challenge for teachers to work back and forth with online and offline classes, it will be manageable.“It is going to be an additional burden for teachers as we prepare in different formats for online and offline classes. Further, in most schools, with students being divided into more sections, we may have to teach for longer hours in a day,” said S Ramesh, a Class XII maths teacher. Schools are also unsure of how many students will attend classes in school and how many will be learning from home. “Schools have been given the freedom and flexibility to make plans for reopening based on the strength of teachers, space and facilities available. However, it still remains to be seen how the attendance will be as in the first few weeks as we expect only around 60% attendance. If online classes are conducted in a parallel manner by streaming on campus classes, there should be no issue. Teachers from lower classes can also chip in,” said Senthilnathan M, president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation.Some schools have also decided to not reopen immediately on September 1. “Since many parents expressed concerns, though we are ready with preparations, we have decided to reopen only by the end of September after waiting a few weeks. Further, with our campus also being on the outskirts of the city, commuting is also difficult,” said Shanthi Mohan, principal, TVS Lakshmi School.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/juggling-online-and-offline-classes-will-be-challenge-for-teachers/articleshow/85727130.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

According to residents, apart from the Mall road, the other affected roads are Kincraig to Masonic Lodge, Kincraig to Zero point, Harnam Singh road, Motilal Nehru road and Picture Palace to Landour road. To add to motorists’ woes, heavy rains recently caused a massive landslide on the Mussoorie-Dehradun road near Galogi power house. Even on Saturday, long queues of vehicles could be seen on both sides of the landslide site causing hardships to local residents as well as weekend tourists. “There are deep potholes on the roads all across the town posing grave risks, particularly for two-wheelers. I narrowly escaped getting injured on the road between Masonic Lodge and Picture Palace,” said Jagjeet Kukreja, secretary of Mussoorie traders’ association. “The road of Landour market was recently repaired but had developed potholes and there is a lot of water accumulation due to the rains,” said Raghav Bijalwan, a resident. Residents also claimed that frequent digging up to lay water pipelines and cables has caused a lot of damage to the roads. Debris accumulated on the roads cause two-wheelers and even pedestrians to slip. The residents added that authorities must initiate repair work on roads on priority before any major accident occurs. Assistant engineer of Public Works Department (PWD) Pankaj Aggarwal when queried about the issue, told TOI that the potholes would be filled up on priority while permanent repairs would be taken up once the rains abate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/famous-mall-road-other-major-roads-in-mussoorie-in-poor-shape-after-rains/articleshow/85723124.cms||Anmol Jain

All citizens above the age of 18 years will be vaccinated in three months as a part of a special drive. The VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh, city mayor R Bhagya Lakshmi and central MLA Malladi Vishnuvardhan launched the campaign and asked the public to cooperate. A total of 6 lakh people in the city got at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The three-day-long special drive at around 63 ward secretariats gave positive results as around 12,000 people took vaccines on an average per day during the campaign. Following this, the civic body decided to conduct a special drive at 286 ward secretariats across the city in addition to the ten permanent vaccination centres. “We should collectively work hard to make the city Covid-19-free. Positivity has come down to less than 1 per cent in the city despite wedding and festive season. Strict enforcement of masks and physical distance is paying off.

Justice Sandeep Shinde was hearing a plea by the husband, a businessman, against whom a case of cruelty and section 4 (punishment for instant triple talaq under Muslim Women Act was filed on June 16 this year. The couple married in April 2015. Her complaint said the initial days of marriage were good when they lived in Panvel. A month later, her mother-in-law asked her to bring Rs 10 lakh from her parents. When she expressed their inability, the husband, his parents and his brother started harassing her mentally and physically. When they shifted to a new flat in Kharghar, his family moved in. On May 22 this year, on the pretext of getting pest control treatment done at the flat, she was told to go to her parents’ home with her 3-year-old son. On May 29, her husband sent her an SMS, pronouncing triple talaq. His petition said that the FIR is an attempt to harass and frame him in a bogus case and that she hated his family from the early days, always complained about his parents and caused him immense mental torture and agony. On August 24, justice Shinde noted that the sessions judge had observed that the couple were blaming each other for the marital discord and therefore it is a matrimonial dispute. Also, the only ground on which pre-arrest protection was denied was that her ornaments were with him and a detailed investigation was necessary. The man’s advocate, Ali Kashif Khan, said the police can’t act as recovery agents. Having regard to the “general nature of allegations against the husband and his relatives”, justice Shinde in his order said, “In my view, it is possible to settle the disputes and differences through mediation.” The woman’s advocate sought time to take instructions and inform.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/triple-talaq-via-sms-hc-grants-man-pre-arrest-bail-in-mumbai/articleshow/85727752.cms||Rosy Sequeira

BJP core committee member and former MP G Vivek Venkataswamy and other party leaders said that MLA Balka Suman and ministers Koppula Eshwar and Gangula Kamalakar should first inform people in their assembly constituencies on the date of implementation of Dalit Bandhu and Aasara pensions for new category of beneficiaries and then take up campaign in Huzurabad. Vivek also appealed to the people of respective constituencies to confront their local MLAs and ministers on the date of implementation of Dalit Bandhu. Terming the bypoll to Huzurabad as a semi-final before the 2023 assembly elections, he exuded confidence of BJP winning the seat with a thumping majority. On the other hand, the finance minister T Harish Rao demanded that BJP leader Eatala Rajender and other saffron party leaders should list out central grants, welfare schemes and projects their party will implement in Huzurabad. Reacting sharply to BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s statement that the TRS government should give Rs 40 lakh grant to every Dalit family, Harish Rao said: “The KCR government is giving Rs 10 lakh per Dalit family towards Dalit Bandhu. Let Bandi Sanjay and other saffron party leaders prevail upon the central government and get remaining Rs 40 lakh per SC family as a grant.” While the TRS and BJP have been working out strategies and counter-strategies against each other to win the bypoll, Congress is yet to announce its candidate.

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has planned a nakshatra garden, pergolas, walking track and other works to add to the beauty of the lake which is spread over 16.42 hectare.Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis performed the bhoomi puja of the project on Saturday. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, MLC and BJP city president Pravin Datke, standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar and others too were present.Following a demand made by corporators BJP Sandip Joshi and Bhoyar, Fadnavis, as chief minister, had sanctioned the project in July 2017. However, construction could not start due to controversy over the lake’s ownership and some other issues even though funds were available with the civic body.NMC officials told TOI that the design is ready. “A private contractor has been appointed for the construction and he has a 1-year deadline to complete it,” they said.Currently, the lake has a walking track and some benches on its eastern side another walking track on the southern side. As per the design, two entrance gates will come up on the east side. Further, there will be two parking areas, pergolas, sitting arenas, greenery, washrooms etc. The nakshatra garden will be developed on the southern side. The highlight of the project will an embankment and walking track, and new greenery on the western and northern side.An NMC official said the embankment and walking track on the northern side will be completed within the available funds of Rs 18.2 crore. “We will seek more funds from the government for construction of an embankment and walking track on the western side soon,” the official said.Constructed in the 18th century, this is the first time the lake is being beautified. In the 1990s, there were attempts to fill up the lake. Former Union minister Vilas Muttemwar, Gadkari, activists including Gopal Thosar, Narayan Ahuja, TH Naidu and others took efforts to save the water body.In 2010, the government had sanctioned funds of Rs 3.24 crore for rejuvenation of the lake which was used to construct an artificial idol immersion tank, overflow system, an embankment and also desilting was done. Then, Joshi and Bhoyar had done de-silting by raising funds from different sources.Gadkari said a garden will be developed at the airport and also a food mall on NMC's land. “Now, it is the responsibility of the people to take care of the lake by conserving the works and avoiding polluting it,” he said.TIMELINE18th Century: Bhonsale family developed reservoir on Pora river which turned into Sonegaon lakeJune 21, 1974: Court of Wards auctioned lake; purchased by late Dr Sudha Sutaria and Dr Rekharani BhiwapurkarApril 13, 1992: Sutaria sells 0.81 hectare of her share to Sadanand Thote.

Medical health officer of CMC has served notices to the 63 nursing homes seeking compliance of town planning norms and has withheld their renewal of nursing licences.There are 82 nursing homes in Chandrapur city registered with CMC. The town planning department had carried out survey of all the nursing homes in the city. Based on it its report, notices were served to the nursing homes earlier too. All the non-complying nursing homes were given provisional extension in the light of pandemic. Now that Covid has eased off and with August 31 deadline of renewal of licences nearing, the medical health officer of CMC served fresh notices to 63 nursing homes. Doctor fraternity has reacted sharply to the notices served by the CMC.President of Indian Medical Association, Chandrapur Chapter, Dr Mangesh Gulwade, claimed that their nursing homes were registered under the Maharashtra Nursing Home Act and comply with all the regulations required at the time of their construction.“The same officers who have served the notices had earlier inspected and approved these nursing homes while providing nursing licences. Now that new regulations have been formulated, they should be applied prospectively instead of applying retrospectively,” Dr Gulwade said.CMC commissioner Rajesh Mohite agreed that revoking the licences of such a large number of nursing homes will affect health services and maintained that the matter has been put before the general body.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/fate-of-63-chanda-nursing-homes-hangs-in-balance/articleshow/85721460.cms||Mazhar Ali

By Saturday evening, the situation was brought under control with only some villages continuing to face waterlogging. The situation arose due to incessant rainfall in neighbouring Nepal, which released a huge volume of water and in turn, five lakh cusecs of water were released from Ghaghara barrage in Shardanagar and Sharda barrage in Banbasa. As a result a flood alert was sounded in the Palia, Nighasan, Gola and Dhaurahra areas of the district. The rivers in the district were flowing above the danger mark on Saturday morning. By Saturday evening, Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya, Kheri district magistrate, told TOI, “The condition is now under control as the excessive water has passed through Kheri district to drain into the Ghaghara river in Sitapur district. Now, the threat of floods looms large in districts that fall in downstream areas of eastern UP. Most of the rivers in Kheri have receded below the danger mark and no casualty has been reported. Compensation as per the guidelines will be awarded to the affected people after a survey is completed by the revenue department.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/5-lakh-cusecs-of-water-released-into-kheri-rivers-after-heavy-rains-in-nepal/articleshow/85721432.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Yash Ingole, aged only 19 years, has been scaling mountain ranges across India for many years and trained extensively under professionals. In Maharashtra, Ingole has scaled many forts and steep ranges along the western coast. A media release from Washim’s district information officer mentioned that Ingole recieved over Rs1.5 lakh from the district collectorate to help create a corpus for his trip.

His love for climbing to the fort top by foot increased as he went on scale the peaks of 18 more forts in the state. In 2018, he went to on scale the highest peak in Maharashtra, Kalsubai, in western ghats.After clearing in Std X, Ingole went to Uttarakhand and scaled a few peaks there thus boosting his confidence more. After this he aimed for the world’s famed seven summits, with Mount Everest being at the first rank. Mount Kilimanjaro ranks fourth in that list and Ingole started preparing for this in 2019 itself. He went for a one month training at Himachal Pradesh’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports to further gain experience of handling rough peak climbs. District collector Shanmugarajan S also helped Ingole in not only raising his morale but also for helping to raise funds.

Qaiyum’s family is expected to arrive on Sunday morning. Dr Belekar said further course of action would be decided once the family members reach Nagpur. “His brain functions have not regained. Everything depends on whether he regains consciousness in next 24 to 48 hours,” he said.No decision on airlifting the pilot to Bangladesh has been taken. Biman Bangladesh officials are said to be ready with a plan if the family gives green signal.The airline officials have left it on the family to take the final call. The hospital would be counselling the family regarding continuation of life support.Dr Ranjan Barokar, critical care specialist and head of intensive care department at Kingsway, said after stabilising the pilot, a CT scan was done of the brain. “It showed bleeding in the pontine area which was associated with a diffused brain injury because of prolonged resuscitation, hypoglycaemia and hypoxia. He is still on ventilator and his body temperature is being kept low as per protocols. Soon, we will be reversing the process and bringing him back to normal body temperature. After this, another CT scan will be done for neurological assessment again,” he said.Dr Barokar added, “We have communicated to the family and the embassy that his condition seems to be very poor. His relatives are expected to arrive by Saturday evening.”The pilot was put on ventilator after he slipped into coma following mid-air prolonged cardiac arrest on route to Muscat-Dhaka flight.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccination queues back at private hospitals as second dose recipients return||KOLKATA: After a lull of about a month-and-half, vaccination queues have grown longer again at private hospitals across Kolkata, thanks to the return of second dose recipients who had received their first shot in May-June. While most hospitals have seen doubling of recipients’ number since the beginning of this week, at some places the increase has been more than six times. At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, the surge in number this week has been sudden and dramatic. From just over 200 recipients On Thursday, the number touched 1,000 on Friday. It crossed 1,500 on Saturday. “We had been expecting a surge but the increase has been very quick and huge. Till August 23, we had just over 200 a day. It has now gone up six times,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. He added that the hospital expects the rush to continue for a month and has enough doses to meet the demand. “More than 80% are second dose recipients who had got their first shot during the second wave,” said Roy. AMRI Hospitals inoculated around 1,300 across its three centres at Dhakuria, Mukundapur and Salt Lake on Saturday. At Dhakuria alone, the number of recipients crossed 600 while Mukundapur and Salt Lake recorded around 300 each. “The surge started on Wednesday and was expected. Around 80% of the crowd are second dose recipients. We expect the numbers to rise further by the first week of September. So, we have already placed an order for 20,000 doses while we hold around 12,000 in stock now,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Peerless Hospital is among those which saw a sudden surge three days ago, when the number of recipients jumped from 200-plus to 482. “Those who got the first shot during the second wave are back. So, queues will now get longer. We expect the number to cross 600 in the next few days and are getting ready with enough stocks,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. He added that though the hospital had deferred requisition of doses during the interim lull, it will now procure enough to meet the rising demand. “The procurement process has got easier and faster. So, we expect a fresh consignment within the next few days,” added Mitra. Belle Vue Clinic has seen a four-fold rise in recipients since Thursday. “While we vaccinated just 110 on Thursday, the number reached 474 on Friday and was more than 450 on Saturday,” said CEO P Tondon. At Woodlands Hospital, too, there has been a 100% surge in recipients this week with number of recipients jumping to 200 from 100. The crowd has been swelling at off-site centres as well. AMRI Hospitals, that offer vaccinations at South City mall and Acropolis, said the queues have started getting longer after a month-long lull. At Acropolis, around 300 received the shot on Saturday while the number of doses was around 150 at South City. “That apart, we have just received an order for 5000 doses from a software firm. So, September is going to be a busy month,” added Barua.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/vax-queues-back-at-pvt-hosps-as-2nd-dose-recipients-return/articleshow/85723235.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

It’s a blatant violation of human rights,” said Bhosale who was approached by activists like Sunil Chokhare and others to support the sex workers in their fight against the closure of the locality. “I am not denying that certain aspects like pushing minors into flesh trade, solicitating on road and related activities are illegal but we cannot allow anyone to die hungry,” he said.He also said that government or any agency should never ever contemplate evicting the sex workers from their place. While stating that the sex workers would face resistance and protest wherever they are settled, he said, “By giving these sex workers some job, the government can set an example which even other organizations can follow.” In the meanwhile, some activists like Jammu Anand, lawyer Nihal Singh Rathod, writer Aruna Sabane, Hemlata Lohave, Dinanath Waghmare, Kiran Deshmukh and others met at Nagpur Nagarik Manch, CNI hall near Smruti Talkies, on Saturday. It’s learnt that the lesbian, gay and transgender community too has extended support to the sex workers from Ganga Jamuna.Lawyer Rathod said that criminalization of prostitution per se in the definition of the law was done away with in 1978. “Now, the law stands that commercial exploitation and abuse of a person is criminalized. This itself shows that a woman on her own will and accord can chose the vocation of sex work without any obstructions,” he said and added, “Sex work being a vocation is neither illegal nor an actionable wrong.”Rashtravadi Yuvati Congress city president Poonam Rewatkar had taken up the issue of Ganga Jamuna closure with NCP leader and MP Supriya Sule. One of the daughters of Ganga Jamuma sex workers met Sule along with Rewatkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/raje-mudhoji-bhosale-to-write-to-cp-against-ganga-jamuna-closure/articleshow/85721494.cms||Soumitra Bose

Taking a jibe at CM KCR’s statement that he would work for the development of Dalits till his last drop of blood is spent, the Congress leaders said Dalits don’t need assurances as several such promises made by KCR have not been fulfilled. KCR could give the CM’s seat to a Dalit for the remaining two-and-a-half-year term, they said. “KCR had promised to make a Dalit CM, but did not do it. He had promised to distribute three acres agriculture land to them, construct 125-foot Ambedkar statue near Tank Bund, enhance reservations for Scheduled Tribes and the list is long and none of the promises has been fulfilled,” Sravan alleged. He demanded that the KCR government release Rs 65,000 crore of the SC/ST sub-plan, which was unspent, and use it for the development of Dalits and Girijans. The CM should focus on filling up two lakh vacancies in the government sector as Dalits would get about 40,000 of those jobs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kcr-should-vacate-chair-for-a-dalit/articleshow/85725215.cms||---

But the Railway Protection Force found her movements suspicious and asked her to wait to get the bags checked, and she refused to let them.  The narcotics were allegedly found in the bag.

---||Mumbai||‘BMC preparing for 30,000 beds so that no one is deprived’||The second Covid wave, which began in March in Mumbai, hit more than double the people affected during the first wave in 2020. Now, as the third wave looms, the question uppermost on every Mumbaikar’s mind is whether it will dwarf the second wave or be benevolent in comparison. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani is, however, not perturbed as the BMC “health infrastructure” is ready to tackle any emergency. He tells Malathy Iyer and Richa Pinto about creating 30,000 beds for the third wave and setting up oxygen refilling plants to ensure the city’s hospitals don’t gasp for the life-saving gas. Excerpts: Q: As per BMC’s projections, will the third wave be worse than the first two?A: One cannot say with certainty about the third wave, but we believe it may not be as devastating as the second one. It may be somewhere in between the first and the third waves in terms of numbers. The only certainty is: the third wave will occur. Q: The biggest fear on people’s minds is about availability of beds. The BMC managed to create 21,000 beds during the second wave, what about the third wave of Covid?A: This time, we are preparing for 30,000 hospital beds so that no one in need is denied a bed. Many new jumbo facilities are in various stages of readiness. We will not commission all the beds in one go, but start activating as and when required. Q: Can you please elaborate?A: During the second wave, we realised the need to use our resources judiciously even while ensuring that we don’t compromise on the patient’s health. There is no point in keeping a facility active when beds are not in demand. If the facility is kept active, we have to hire doctors, nurses and other support systems such as security and maintenance. The services of the medical staff are extremely important and should be used judiciously. Therefore, even if we get 10,000 patients a day in the third wave, the facilities will be activated in in a phased way and we have planned it in detail. We have three semi-permanent facilities -- NESCO in Goregaon, Richardson and Crudass at Byculla and Seven Hills Hospital that have 6,000 beds and 1,000-plus ICU beds. If and when the third wave begins, we will first activate the beds here. Our Malad jumbo facility is ready, and the Kanjurmarg one should be ready in a few days. While the Mahalaxmi facility will be ready next month, the Sion facility could take longer. Q: In the 2nd wave, oxygen requirement was a big problem…A: We have scientifically worked to upgrade our oxygen facilities and ensure minimum wastage. As the first step, we switched from a cylinder-based system to a central oxygen supply as the former requires cylinders had to be refilled every few hours. At the end of the second wave, we started upgrading to the central oxygen system and have already had a 30% drop in oxygen requirement. Moreover, we can regulate the oxygen flow as per the patient’s need. Also, we wanted to reduce our dependence on external suppliers. We hence set up refilling plants in Chembur and Mahalaxmi and are in the process of setting up a manufacturing unit as well. These measures will ensure we get our daily requirement of 250 metric tonnes. Q: What has been the fallout of the vaccine scam that rocked Mumbai?A: The fallout has had a surprising but welcome change: more and more people trust the BMC and rely on us for vaccines in particular and healthcare in general. People wait hours together to get vaccinated, indicating they have faith in us. With us, they are confident they will get the right vaccine. Also, people have come to depend on our treatment. During one of my visits to the NESCO facility during the peak of the second wave, I remember a patient’s relative arguing with our dean about his patient not getting adequate attention. He came up to me and said he wanted to shift his relative to a private facility, and we agreed to facilitate the transfer. But a few days later, he returned to the NESCO facility saying he wanted to bring back his patient as we, in comparison, had better supply of medicines such as remdesivir, doctors and oxygen. We took back the patient, who made a full recovery and left.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-preparing-for-30000-beds-so-that-no-one-is-deprived/articleshow/85725278.cms||---

He spoke after inaugurating JSS Radio, a community radio station at JSS College of Arts, Commerce and Science. Murugan said PM Modi delivers messages through All India Radio (AIR) to the last man of the country on the last Sunday of every month through Mann Ki Bath. “So, radio is playing a big role. Community radio has become popular in recent years which has involved people in the development of the community,” he said. Stating that presently there are around 329 operational radio stations broadcasting across the country with Karnataka alone having 22, the minister said the core strength of community radio is the strong connect established with the mind and heart of people. “Community radio helps us in addressing social, economic, cultural, educational, health, water, sanitation and disaster related issues effectively and strategically. In 2003 then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee introduced new guidelines and eversince community radios are addressing the issues of the community as it is run by local people and provide opportunity for public participation in the development of the society,” he said. He said radio stations played a critical role of connecting people with welfare programs of the government. “During Covid pandemic, community radio stations like Sarathi Jhalak 90.4 FM of Bengaluru and Radio Brahmaputra of Assam played various programmes on Covid awareness, stress management and counselling programmes for migrant workers who were far away from their families. Community radio created awareness and instilled confidence among people,” he said. Former minister and Congress MLA Tanveer Sait said the government should upgrade the All India Radio station in Mysuru by introducing more entertainment programmes to compete with private players. Like JSS, more private players should join the communication sector for the development of the country, Sait said. Suttur Mutt seer Shivaratri Deshikendra Swami and mayor Sunanda Palanetra were present. Later, Murugan inaugurated the photo exhibition organized at Akashavani premises as part of the Azadi Ki Amrut Mahotsav. Download app on Playstore JSS Radio will broadcast programmes on health, literature, culture, music, environment, education, science and legal issues. People can download JSS Radio App in Google Play Store or login to www.jsscas.edu.in to listen to the programmes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/community-radio-involves-people-in-development-says-union-minister/articleshow/85747157.cms||---

Hope now shines on state’s beleaguered fishing industry that enjoyed exports to around Rs 5,000 crore per annum in pre-Covid era, after the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) decided to help these units conduct their microbiology tests on the catch at their own laboratories. The upgrading of the laboratory will not only improve export quality, but also reduce rejections by importing countries and industry players will be able to export to European countries without any hesitation. The hub of fish processing in the state, Veraval town, has nearly 100 units where fish from all across the state is brought in for processing and exporting. There are a few units in Porbandar and south Gujarat too. According to export rules, these processing units require an in-house laboratory for microbiology tests for detection of microorganisms in the food product. An exporter is required to create batches and test raw material as well as processed fish. The hygiene standards of importing countries are very stringent and according to fish exporters, if they find the presence of microbes in the fish, the entire container faces rejection. More rejections would result in getting the country’s export image tarnished. According to sources in the industry, south India’s export is considered better than Gujarat in many countries in terms of quality. Director of CIFT, Ravishankar C N on Saturday signed an MoU with four Veraval based units and one Porbandar-based unit in Veraval to upgrade exporters facilities. Ashish Kumar Jha, scientist at CIFT Veraval said, “This is the first phase and we will sign MoUs with all those units which require upgrading. We will help them improve their standards, which will be able to meet international requirements. We will give them a standard layout like chemicals required for testing, environment control for temperature and humidity levels and other necessary equipment. Our scientists will personally visit their units and will provide the lab staff of these units with training.” The rejection of container also costs high to the exporters, claim trade experts who peg the costs to around $25,000 for every rejection. Secretary of Gujarat Seafood Exporters Association, Naresh Vanik said that the exporters only wish that their containers to Europe clear the tests for entry. “Upgrading our labs will provide us with that security. If we detect any microbes in the raw fish, we will not process them further and won’t export them too. Thus, that will save our effort and cost. The improved quality will result in more demand from other countries than China.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/cift-to-help-fish-export-units-upgrade-testing-labs/articleshow/85721576.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Year after transplant, parents of Monika More’s donor fly in to stroke her new hands||MUMBAI: It was a meeting of hands and hearts. When 58-year-old Madurai resident Kalaiselva Arjunan met Monika More—who, as a collegian seven years back, lost her forearms when she slipped into the gap between the railway platform and a train—the former kept running her hands over the younger woman’s fingers and forearms for a few minutes. The reason? The hands had belonged to her 34-year-old son Aselan Arjunan. Exactly a year ago, Kalaiselva and her 65-year-old husband Arjunan agreed in Chennai’s Global Hospital to donate Aselan’s hands. Their son’s hands were flown into Mumbai and transplanted to Monika in a 16-hour surgery at Global Hospital in Parel on August 28, 2020, even as Covid-19 raged across the country. On Friday, the language barrier between the Tamilian amma and the Marathi mulgi didn’t matter. They hugged each other and cried together, acknowledging the “transplant bond” that connected them. “As she looked at my hands, I was overwhelmed by emotions. My feet were trembling and I couldn’t help but cry,” said Monika. Kalaiselva was too moved to speak, but Arjunan was able to say, “Aisa lagta hai mera beta mere saamne baitha hai (It seems as if my son is sitting in front of me).” The donor’s brother Arunvinan, who had brought his parents to Mumbai to meet Monika on the first anniversary of the transplant, said, “It’s good to see my brother in some form.” Through the evening at ITC Central, Monika used her “new” hands to gesticulate, lift a glass of water and comfort the donor’s aged parents. Aselan’s donated hands have now taken on Monika’s skin tone and colour. Plastic surgeon Dr Nilesh Sathbai who performed the transplant was “satisfied” with Monika’s progress. “The transplant was carried out during the Covid wave, but Monika’s recovery was thankfully uneventful and smooth,” he said. In the next three to four months, he expects the fine motor movement to pick up. “Her grasp should improve and she should be able to lift heavier things,” said Dr Sathbhai. Five more patients have signed up for hand transplants at Global Hospital, but Covid and lack of awareness about hand transplants have been a hindering factor. “Aselan’s family was familiar with hand transplants and consented to it. We need to create awareness,” he said. Aselan Arjunan was an IT professional in Chennai and suffered a massive stroke before being declared brain dead. “My son played cricket, had acted in serials and was running his own IT firm when tragedy struck,” said Arjunan, who left for Madurai early on Saturday. He agreed to donate seven of his son’s organs for a simple reason. “I wanted my son to continue to live. And while all the other recipients have got internal organs, Monika has his hands and we could see him,” he said. For Monika, the Arjunans from Madurai are model citizens. “They feel their son is alive through me. Everyone should agree to donate so that those living with end-stage organ failure can get a second chance at life,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-yr-after-transplant-parents-of-monikas-donor-fly-in-to-stroke-her-new-hands/articleshow/85719829.cms||Malathy Iyer

He also ordered the authorities to initiate a criminal action. The judge made this interim order after hearing a complaint from president of AP commercial taxes employees association B Mehar Kumar, who charged Ashok, a sitting TDP MLC now, with tampering and making wrong entries in his service record showing him as a commerce graduate though he never had acquired a B Com degree in the first place. After perusing a report of the special CS, the Lokayukta directed him to entrust the matter to the CID. “It can be logically concluded that the wrong entry relates to Ashok’s B Com qualification. It was struck down as it was fraught with serious consequences,” he said in his order. Justice Reddy further said: “Though the action of striking down the entries cannot be attributed to any particular person at this stage, it was obviously done at the behest of Ashok as the wrong entry has the capacity of emerging as an incriminating piece of evidence against him.” He said mere disciplinary action was not enough in such cases. “Criminal action too should be initiated to stop others with similar designs from venturing into such wrong plans. Tell us the action taken by you (government) in this regard,” the judge said. He posted the case to November 22. Mehar Kumar alleged that Ashok wanted a posting in the head office of commercial taxes on promotion. “Since it is possible only if he possesses a B Com degree, he connived with certain staff and officials manning the service records and ensured that wrong information was entered into his service record showing him as a B Com graduate,” he alleged. Later, Ashok gave up his bid and got the wrong entries struck off the service record. “But, the traces of his unlawful attempt were very much visible on record,” Kumar alleged. He said he was aghast when the inquiry officer gave Ashok a clean chit without going into the evidence. It was then he filed a complaint to the Lokayukta. Earlier, a TDP legislator had courted controversy three years ago when he claimed that physics subject was part of his B Com degree.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cop accused of minor’s rape let off as he was on duty at the time, shows logbook||MUMBAI: The deposition of a police constable who produced a log book on vehicles used by police personnel has ensured that a 45-year-old police driver, accused of sexually abusing his now-deceased 15-year-old neighbour in 2018, was acquitted. The court said that the accused, through proper evidence, showed his presence at his place of work at the relevant date and time of the offence. It said that the accused was entitled to an acquittal. The court said that it was clearly established that the accused was on duty till 10pm as his buckle number and time of duty — arrival and departure timings — are entered into the register. The incident was alleged to have taken place at 9.30pm. “It is not acceptable that, while on duty, he came home at 9.30pm, removed his dress, was in underwear, committed the act then got dressed up and returned on duty, to show himself present on duty till 10pm. It is seen [that] accused was on duty at police station which is... 23 minutes away by vehicle from his house. Hence, it was not possible for him to come to the house at 9.30pm, do the incident and return before 10pm,” the court said. The accused had claimed that he was falsely implicated as he had reprimanded the minor about about doing “indecent acts” with another boy on their building terrace and her mother had slapped her on being informed. The minor did not depose during trial as she died by suicide six months after the incident. Her parents had locked her up at home and gone for a wedding. “The victim died [an] unnatural death is clear. It shows that the parents were strict with the girl,” the court said. Both, the accused and the victim, lived in the police quarters. The minor’s father was also in the police force. The incident allegedly took place when the family of the accused was away for Diwali. It was alleged that on November 10, 2018, around 9.30pm, the accused requested the girl to come to his house for some work. It was alleged that while she was returning, the accused embraced her, pulled her close, thus outraging her modesty. The girl then disclosed the incident to her family and an FIR was lodged two days later. The accused was arrested and later granted bail. The minor’s mother and the investigating officer deposed for the prosecution. “The probability of accused being at his house to commit the incident during duty hours is ruled out. The complainant prosecution witness one [girl’s mother] herself did not see the accused from 9.30 pm to 11pm is stated in her cross-examination...” the court said.

---||Kolkata||Flyer count up two-fold in second Kolkata-London flight||KOLKATA: The second direct flight to London after the civil aviation ministry gave a go-ahead to the service that had been suspended eight months ago has recorded a two-fold jump in passenger count on the Kolkata-London sector against the inaugural flight last Sunday. Sources in AI said that the second flight had recorded nearly 85% occupancy, up from barely 35% occupancy in the first flight that departed for Heathrow last Sunday. The second flight took off from Heathrow at 1.15pm local time on Saturday and will touch down at Kolkata at 3.05am on Sunday. It will then depart Kolkata at 4.30am and will reach Heathrow at 9.55am local time. “Apart from 200 bookings in the economy class for the Kolkata-London leg, what is extremely heartening is that 16 of the 18 seats in the business class have been booked. With Durga Puja a month-and-a-half away, it augurs very well,” an airline official said. The starting fare in the economy class is Rs 28,000 while on the business class, it is Rs 70,000. Though it is the former that make up the volumes, it is the latter that gives airlines high yield. Demand for business and first class in flights across the world has soared due to safety concerns as fewer passengers are accommodated in this section and there is more distance between adjoining seats. There were around 90 passengers who departed in the first flight. An international flight usually takes around three-four months to stabilise and record a decent traffic. Incidentally, the inaugural flight was announced barely a week before its departure, by which time most of the people who were required to travel would already have booked flights. Traffic on the Kolkata-London sector sees a spike between September and January as people residing in London usually travel to Kolkata to meet with relatives and friends and vice versa. “We expect a lot more people to travel this year because most of them have not ventured anywhere in the past year-and-a-half and are now desperate for a break as well as to meet family members,” said a travel agent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/flyer-count-up-two-fold-in-second-kol-london-flight/articleshow/85723356.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Goa||Goa: Undertrial seeks leave to sign sale documents, HC says no||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has rejected an application by Altaf Yergatti — the main accused in the murder of Torda resident Vilas Methar who was burnt alive in Salvador do Mundo last year — seeking to appear before the office of the Bardez civil registrar-cum-sub registrar to execute deeds for the sale of apartments. The high court held that there is no such provision in the Goa Prison Rules, 2006. “I am afraid that if an undertrial prisoner of such a heinous crime is allowed to carry on business on the grounds of infringement of his fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g), his detention itself will be meaningless. He was detained as per the procedure of law and, therefore, his fundamental right to carry out business is suspended by lawful procedure. In the absence of any provision in the jail manual, it is difficult to grant such permission,” the court held. It further added that the accused could avail of Section 31 of the Registration Act if a special cause exists. The section provides that an officer on special cause should attend the residence of any person desiring to present a document for registration, or for the deposit of such a document or will. Yergatti’s lawyer, however, contended that when a convict of any offence is released on parole and furlough, there was no reason why Yergatti should not be allowed to execute the documents or, in the alternative, do it at Colvale jail in the presence of the prison superintendent. Additional public prosecutor Pravin Faldessai argued that if such permission were granted, the accused might either demand for mobile phones or to carry out his business under police protection. He submitted that Yergatti had hatched a criminal conspiracy and is the main accused who engaged a contract killer to murder Methar. Methar and his wife Harita had filed complaints against Yergatti’s project, The Misty Green, before different authorities. While Faldessai said the crime was serious, brutal and grave in nature and executed in a very cruel manner, the accused submitted that as he holds an irrevocable power of attorney for development and sale of the property, his presence at the time of executing a sale deed was necessary and he could not further delegate it. Yergatti added that he would suffer heavy losses if the sale deeds were not executed in favour of the respective flat owners and stated that he has several liabilities consisting of a car loan, house loan and unpaid bills running into nearly Rs 1 crore. He also said his entire business had come to a grinding halt due to his incarceration. A similar application was rejected by the additional sessions judge at Mapusa a few months ago. His pleas for bail were also rejected by the additional sessions judge and the high court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/undertrial-seeks-leave-to-sign-sale-documents-hc-says-no/articleshow/85725361.cms||Lisa Monteiro

With an aim to make every internet user aware about the threats of cybercrime, the cops have so far conducted workshops at 400 schools and colleges. “Prevention is the key to stopping cybercrime. Awareness among school and college-going students amplifies the message, as through them awareness reaches their families too. We have also roped in leaders of the diamond and textile industry for the drive,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. Apart from students, employees of around 100 diamond and textile units were also made aware about the lurking cyber threats. In the final phase of the campaign, police are now conducting workshops at schools, colleges and residential societies. “We conduct workshops on potential threats, common methods of cybercrime and preventive steps. Apart from schools, various industry-specific groups and residential societies are also being addressed through the workshop,” said Y A Gohil, assistant commissioner of police. Till now 6 lakh visitors have collected details of cybercrime from www.cybersanjivani.org and over 1.50 lakh have appeared for the online test. The test enables internet users to avoid cybercrime traps. In the workshop the cops describe how a person can be cheated financially or bullied in the cyber world. Simple steps for protecting social media profiles are also explained.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/surat-police-aim-to-reach-every-internet-user/articleshow/85721639.cms||---

---||Goa||Now, a platform for persons with disabilities to find love in Goa||PANAJI: A first-of-its-kind ‘meet your soulmate’ programme, encouraging persons with disabilities as well as those without, to find a possible life partner, kicked off on Saturday. From music and computer teachers to those employed in the government and others working in educational institutions with various types of disabilities, participated in the open house session in Panaji, organised by the disability rights association of Goa (DRAG), with the aim of showcasing and promoting marriages of persons with disabilities in Goa. Around 15 persons with disabilities looking for life partners, parents, relatives and some curious onlookers, from Sattari, Valpoi, Quepem, Velsao, Mapusa and several other places participated in the two-hour long session, president Avelino de Sa told TOI. Although the participants had various types of disabilities, a majority were visually and hearing impaired. The eligible bachelors also outnumbered their female counterparts. They all introduced themselves and spoke about their struggles and the kind of partner they’re looking for. “Some young men who are empowered, employed and drive their own vehicles spoke about rejections they’ve faced and their difficulties in getting proposals because of a slight limp. Others said they’re ready to make adjustments and were happy to have a platform to share their experiences and challenges in finding a partner,” said DRAG volunteer Prakash Kamat. A young couple from Quepem where the husband is hearing-impaired and the wife has no disability, spoke about their love story and the secret to their successful marriage. DRAG is also encouraging more such marriages. “There are several ablebodied people willing to marry and who have married persons with disabilities, and I’m a living example of this,” said polio-afflicted Vishant Nagvekar, secretary of DRAG and one of the organisers of the event. The need for such a platform was felt after the association began receiving calls from parents worried about the future of their children with disabilities. A lot of people are searching for partners within the disability community and, there may be many more out there, so we decided to launch a public platform for them to meet. There’s no registration fee involved. We have decided to continue such interactions every month in different cities,” de Sa said. Kamat said that there’s a lot of stigma and prejudice in our society, and that many people find it difficult to imagine that persons with disabilities want to marry too. “Parents of these children of marriageable age are concerned about their lives ahead, and don’t know how to go about it,” he said. The association is also looking at getting doctors, lawyers and counsellors on board to provide as much guidance, advice and assistance to couples as possible, Nagvekar said. Some parents don’t want to come out in public about the person with disability in their family, and requested that they be permitted to attend the session alone and bring in their family member at a later date. Disability rights activist Libby Mendonca said that parents, siblings and persons with disabilities, as well as those without, are all welcome to the informal meeting that is aimed at giving persons with disabilities a new life. Kamat said that it is important for persons with disabilities such as hearing or vision impairment not to hide these, and be transparent about it. Since the government provides an incentive for any person who marries a person with disability, such marriages in other states are monitored by organisations in the initial years, so that a person is not deceived into marriage, Kamat said. “We are only in the infancy stage, and are looking forward to a good response through this platform.” The event held on Saturday is one step towards inclusive marriages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/now-a-platform-for-persons-with-disabilities-to-find-love/articleshow/85725328.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Climate change a death knell for Goa’s agriculture, food security||PANAJI: Even as the impact of climate change intensifies globally, the increasing water runoffs due to concretisation and enhanced flooding in extreme weather events are likely to be a double whammy for Goa’s declining agriculture. Paddy, as Goa’s staple crop, is seeing a revival, with mechanisation easing labour costs and farmers’ problems. But given its undulating topography and disastrous conditions created by unsustainable development, the impact of climate change is likely to be amplified, especially in its coastal and midland plains. The coastal plains — being more vulnerable to immediate dangers — hold larger agricultural patches. Bicholim, Ponda and Quepem also have sizable paddy fields, which also host vegetables and other crops, according to season. For Goa, relying externally for its food, the flooding may even reduce the shrinking cultivable area, worsening the threat to food security. “The paddy fields in coastal plains (especially Bardez, Tiswadi and Salcete) and khazan lands along creeks, being in low-lying areas and vulnerable, as also reclaimed areas of tidal flats, will be progressively under water in future,” said N Somasundaram, former hydrogeologist, state water resources department (WRD). “After harvesting of rainfed kharif crop, the moisture in soil and high water table would ensure a crop of pulses,” Somasundaram said. A pit in the fields would help irrigation of vegetables, watermelon and sweet potatoes,” Somasundaram said. But extreme weather and progressive sea level rise — expected to be about 55cm by 2100 — are likely to disrupt this traditional practice of raising crops. The rapidly-changing land use pattern is responsible for the impact on agricultural land. “The conversion of the vegetated areas in Porvorim and Kadamba plateau into settlement zones has reduced the ground’s infiltration capacity, triggering increased surface runoffs during extreme weather events and flooding of adjacent low lying fields,” said reputed hydrogeologist Manoj Ibrampurkar. The flooding at Mapusa is perhaps a prime example of how climate change could amplify impacts of unsustainable development. “In the past, the water would drain in 24 hours, but now it remains for three to four days while the flood area has increased,” said Tulio de Souza, president of Guirim comunidade. With Guirim as the core area, the flood waters — now an annual affair — submerge vast cultivable land in Socorro, Sangolda, Bastora, Parra, Ucassaim, Moira and Mapusa, reducing farmers to tears. The new highway and its recent expansion, laying of water pipeline, pumphouse and other types of reclamation have buried the Tar river and its floodplain over a few decades. “The big channels across the national highway, including the Tar river have silted, and the drain levels are faulty. Highway expansion on the Guirim side, especially near Bastora bridge, is at the cost of diverting the river,” de Souza said. Traditionally, the surface runoffs in Goa flow from east to west. “The highway expansion in the north-south direction has further blocked the natural water flow and fragmented agricultural ecosystems along Goa’s coastal tract,” Ibrampurkar said. Mud embankments in Margao’s western bypass have buried the flood plain of River Sal and fields in Nuvem and other villages. In Poinguinim, a sizable agricultural tract is witnessing prolonged flooding after construction of a new highway. “The impact of flooding has increased during the past two to three years. In such natural calamities, the crops on river banks, such as paddy, banana, areca and coconut groves are damaged,” said director of agriculture Nevil Alphonso. The massive surface runoffs during copious rain in short spells are damaging to agriculture. “Such micro-climatic changes can reduce crop yield and boost growth of invasive noxious weed species,” Ibrampurkar said. A prolonged dry spell that follows sucks moisture from top soil, required for growth of the crops. A well-spread low intensity rainfall is always preferred for most crops. A rise in ambient temperature due to climate change also affects agriculture. The water resources department has suggested a slew of measures, ranging from demarcation of flood plains to halt increased flooding, to climate-resistant crops. The state action plan for climate change has also recommended steps to combat the impact. “The embankments (bundhs) along the rivers require immediate repair. Identify and explore natural mechanisms like increased mangroves or sea walls to guard against sea-level rise,” the report states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/climate-change-could-spell-death-knell-for-goas-agri-food-security/articleshow/85725389.cms||Paul Fernandes

Signs of the pandemic have faded in malls with properties recording footfall and sales that are comparable to 2019 prior to the pandemic. In at least two malls, the management said they were recording sales that matched the corresponding period two years ago while two others said sales were only a shade below 2019 and were confident of catching up by October, if not September. “The footfall and sales have been phenomenal. Last festive season was marred by the first wave. People don’t want to miss out this year. Since there have been talks of a third wave, customers did not wish to wait long lest it arrive and again dampen the spirits. They’ve hit the malls early and we’ve seen a steady rise in footfall since last month. The sale period also did its bit to attract customers. August has been the best month in over a year-and-a-half and we expect September and October to be even better,” said Ramesh Pandey, wholetime director of Ambuja Neotia Realty that operates the two City Centre malls in Salt Lake and New Town. In 2020 August, the recovery from the previous year was only around 40-45%. Sales and footfalls had picked up in September and October, leading to a 65-70% recovery till Diwali before the situation again turned bad post March 2021 due to the second wave. The high sales last month has even led to mall operators withdrawing rental concessions offered to retailers on account of low transactions due to the Covid impact on turnout and turnover. At South City, the largest mall in the east, the recovery has been over 80% against August 2019. “Barring last Sunday that was slightly dull owing to Rakhi, the turnout at the weekends has been huge. Retailers as well as restaurants are delighted. There is a lot of good cheer and optimism in the sector,” said South City mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. He expects the current growth trend to continue and lead to 100% recovery by September-end or beginning of October. “With cinemas also doing well, the food and beverage business is rocking. The pressure to serve customers at the mall is so high that we have stopped deliveries,” said Bagree. The mall management at Acropolis says sales have soared, leading to nearly 90% recovery against the corresponding month in 2019. “Vaccination and multiple measures by the government to control Covid have worked wonders. With cases low, people have gained confidence to step out. At this pace, we will definitely make a full recovery by September," said mall head K Vijayan. Two other malls in the city — Mani Square and Quest — have recorded 70%-75% and 60%-65% recovery respectively. “The business has been very good with food & beverage doing particularly well,” said Mani Group director Sudarshana Gangulee. In Quest, the recovery has been slow owing to its high net worth clientele who are still very cautious about stepping out. “I would peg the recovery at 60%-65%. If the third wave does not happen, we will continue to improve through Durga Puja and Diwali. We are all very happy with the footfall and business,” said Quest mall V-P Sanjeev Mehra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-malls-inch-closer-to-pre-pandemic-footfall-as-shoppers-go-on-spending-spree/articleshow/85723388.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Inspect building on Ameenpur nala, says NGT||Hyderabad: The National Green Tribunal has ordered a joint inspection committee (JIC) led by Sangareddy district collector to inspect a five-tower apartment complex allegedly constructed on a floodwater nala in Ameenpur. The committee was asked to submit a report by September 30. The NGT issued the orders based on a petition filed by the Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell Trust, which alleged that the building was constructed on the nala. The NGT ordered the committee to ascertain any encroachment into the water body or nala and constructions obstructing the flow of water. It also asked the committee to verify the construction activities of Lalitha Constructions and look into the allegations that the construction on the nala had led to inundation. “If there is any damage caused to environment, the committee is directed to assess the environmental compensation and also suggest remedial measures for restoring the nala and arrive at the cost of restoration,” the NGT said. The JIC will consist of officials from the irrigation department and HMDA lake protection committee. Thakur Raj Kumar Singh of Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell Trust in the petition alleged that the builder blocked the water path between Kotha Cheruvu and Bandamkommu Cheruvu with construction material. “Due to this, rainwater entered nearby colonies like RR Homes, Green Villas and Krishna Brundavan Colony and caused submergence. Despite several complaints, the authorities have not taken any action,” he said. He demanded that approvals granted to builders be cancelled and all floodwater nalas connected to Kotha Cheruvu and Bandamkommu Cheruvu be restored. He also urged the NGT to issue a directive to demolish constructions in the FTL, buffer zone and all nalas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/inspect-building-on-ameenpur-nala-ngt/articleshow/85725391.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

According to police, the auto driver, Srinivas who is a resident of Gundlasingaram village, had taken a loan for his auto last year but was unable to repay it as a result of the pandemic-induced lockdown and a lack of business. The financiers, however, are said to have been constantly after him for repayments. Unable to bear the pressure of the bank representatives and in agony over not being able to make ends meet due to the current petrol prices, Srinivas parked his auto on the main road, poured petrol all over it and set it alight. Upon seeing this, those nearby called the fire station following which fire officials rushed to the spot and doused the fire. The incident took place under Subedari police station limits but no case had been registered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/frustrated-by-bank-reps-driver-sets-auto-ablaze-in-hanamkonda/articleshow/85725427.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Goa||I-T raid on steel firm in Maharashtra & Goa finds Rs 175 crore unaccounted for||PANAJI: The Income Tax Department carried out a search and seizure operation on a steel manufacturing group based in Goa and Maharashtra. The I-T department conducted searches at three places of the group in the state. During the course of the operation, incriminating documents, loose papers and digital evidence were seized. So far, a total of Rs 175.5 crore of unaccounted income has been unearthed, including unaccounted cash and jewellery, shortage and excess of stock, and bogus purchases. The group is a prominent steel manufacturer and trader of Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar and Goa. More than 44 premises were covered in the search operation. Sources said that evidence detected during the search revealed that the group was engaged in fraudulent practice of booking bogus purchases of scrap and sponge iron from ‘fake invoice issuers’. Sources said the premises of fake invoice issuers were also uncovered during the search. Such invoice issuers have admitted that they supplied only bills, but no materials, and also generated fake e-way bills to indicate genuine purchases and claim GST input credit. With the active support of GST authorities, Pune, ‘Vehicle movement tracking app’ was used to identify fake e-way bills. The total bogus purchases identified from these parties, so far, is about Rs 160 crore. The verification is still in progress and the quantum of bogus purchases is likely to increase substantially. Sources said that shortage of goods to the tune of Rs 3.5 crore and excess stocks of Rs 4 crore was also found from the premises. Unaccounted investment in property was also unearthed. Unaccounted cash of Rs 3 crore and jewellery amounting to Rs 5.2 crore has been seized from different premises.

---||Mumbai||Chhota Shakeel’s ‘telephone operator’ dies of Covid in Pakistan||MUMBAI: Gangster Chhota Shakeel’s ‘telephone operator’ Fahim Machmach (51), who issued extortion threats on the former’s instructions, reportedly died of Covid in Karachi late on Friday night. Sources said Machmach, admitted with severe breathing problems to a private hospital in Karachi few days back after he tested positive, died of multiple organ failure. They said he was buried in Karachi early on Saturday. Shakeel called up his family which stays at Peeru Lane at Imambara, near Sir JJ hospital, and conveyed the message of his death. “Yes, we got information about his death. We are awaiting details,’’ said a senior police official here. Fahim Shaikh alias Machmach was wanted by Mumbai, Delhi and Gujarat police in more than two dozen cases. Sources said though he participated in one of two attacks on former Mumbai mayor Milind Vaidya in Mahim in 1999, he fled the country and came under the scanner for the first time in 2003, when he abused a builder in South Mumbai on behalf of Shakeel for refusing to pay up. When crime branch arrested four members of Shakeel’s gang, it was revealed that Machmach had participated in the attack on Shakeel’s behalf. A former encounter specialist said there was a plan to eliminate him in 2001. Fahim’s style of nagging victims earned him the nickname ‘Machmach’. After police started looking for Machmach in the Vaidya case, he fled to Dubai and later shifted to Karachi with Shakeel. When Dawood expanded his business in UAE , the gang needed someone to handle the Mumbai operations, so Shakeel introduced Machmach, who started calling up Mumbai targets. Machmach allegedly threatened a woman activist here but police arrested the shooters and ruined his plans. “Dawood and his brother Anees were upset when he tried to settle a financial dispute between two traders, which resulted in the arrest of Dawood’s nephew (Iqbal Kaskar’s son) Mohammed Rizwan Kaskar, when he was to take a flight to Dubai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-chhota-shakeels-telephone-operator-d-ies-of-covid-in-pak/articleshow/85727418.cms||Ahmed Ali

India Meteorological department said the revival was likely to last till September 1, Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune, told TOI. Pune city is likely to receive moderate rain in isolated areas on August 31, followed by light to moderate rain on September 1-2. D S Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services at IMD, said, “Initially, the low-pressure area will move across regions like Orissa and Chhattisgarh. As it moves further west, it will bring good rain over Maharashtra and Gujarat. Monsoon has already begun reviving in peninsular India. Coastal areas in Maharashtra also received some rain on Saturday.” “From September 2, rainfall in Maharashtra will again become subdued, followed by drastic reduction thereafter. It is not clear when the next good spell of monsoon will come, but extended range forecasts indicate a normal monsoon in September,” Kashyapi said. Kashyapi said except north Madhya Maharashtra, monsoon is likely to start reviving in the state from August 29 evening, and will be vigorous on August 30-31. The upcoming rainfall in Maharashtra will not only be a result of the southward shift of the monsoon trough, but also due to movement of the low-pressure area and slight strengthening of westerly winds, Kashyapi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/monsoon-to-revive-in-state-light-rain-forecast-for-pune/articleshow/85723474.cms||Neha Madaan

The Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh had proposed the resumption of the air bubble flights on August 4 and Biman Bangladesh had even announced flights from August 22 before they had to be cancelled as the Indian authorities had not given its nod. The flights between the two countries had been suspended in April. Initially, Indian carriers will operate seven flights a week with the Bangladeshi airlines operating a similar number of flights. This will allow two flights to operate daily. Among the Indian carriers, SpiceJet has been allowed to operate three frequencies, and IndiGo and Air India two each. SpiceJet can operate the three flights from either Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai or Mumbai. IndiGo can operate from any point in India and Air India has been allowed to operate from Kolkata.

Chodankar said that active members from each block will be given preference, while non-active members of the party will not be allowed to participate in block consultations and decision-making. A day after the All India Congress Committee (AICC) disbanded all the block committees and the district Congress committees, Chodankar said that most of the block presidents were active and vocal in taking on the state BJP-led government. “We will be appointing the block presidents immediately with a batch of five block presidents at a time. Mostly the block presidents who have had full-fledged booth committees and who have been active, will be picked,” said Chodankar. Chodankar said that the AICC observers and Goa deskin-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao will oversee the process to overhaul the blocks which will be completed in 20 days. “Majority of the block presidents were active, they were part of our agitations. They were the ones who raised the issue in the blocks over the last three, four years. They were vocal and they built the party,” said Chodankar after leading a protest against the Centre’s national monetisation pipeline. The state Congress president expects the party to win more than 26 seats in the state assembly elections with the BJP winning just six to seven constituencies. While the party is working to increase its membership, Chodankar appeared to indicate that the party will categorise workers into primary and active members. “Along with the digital membership we are starting active membership. Every block is expected to have 300 active members. A major thrust will be given to consult the 300 block workers on every major political decision. The non-active members will not be allowed to sit for the block meetings,” said Chodankar.

PI Ninad Deulkar said that two days ago, Narvekar’s sister was delivered of a baby boy at a private hospital in Porvorim, but he didn’t cry when he was born. The gynaecologist, Dr Amol Tilve, then referred the child to a paediatrician, who further referred him to GMC, as his condition was critical. The child breathed his last at GMC, and Narvekar, along with the deceased baby, went back to the private hospital. Upset about the incident, he then slapped Tilve twice. Deulkar said that Tilve approached Porvorim police and lodged a complaint. An FIR has been filed against Narvekar under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees or more), 452 (trespass) of the IPC, and Section 4 of the Goa Medicare Service Personnel and Medicare Service Institutions Act, 2013. Deulkar said that Narvekar has filed for anticipatory bail. Reacting to the incident, Dr Vinayak Buvaji, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Goa, said that the incidence of physical abuse on a reputed senior doctor colleague from Porvorim has put the medical fraternity all over Goa in “a big torment”. “IMA strongly condemns this act of assault on our collegue Dr Tilve, a senior obstetrician and gynecologist from Porvorim, by Narvekar,” he said, appealing to police to be swift and prompt in action and arrest the culprit to keep the morale and confidence of doctors high, especially in Covid times. “If silence is the answer from the authorities concerned, it would be the beginning of the end of the noble medical profession,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/man-booked-for-slapping-gynaec-after-baby-dies/articleshow/85725445.cms||---

K B Singh, retired IPS officer and single member of the police reform commission, submitted the report to Praveer Ranjan, DGP UT. The commission recommended a people-friendly face for the UT police, besides imparting soft skills to police personnel during training at the time of recruitment. The commission pointed out that as most of the complainants who visit police stations are not aware of who they have to meet or where they have to lodge their complaints, a reception area should be set up in each police station. The commission also recommended a separate cyber police station to deal with cyber crimes effectively and setting up of two more sub-divisions along with five more police stations in the city. At present, the city has 17 police stations. TimesViewThe changing nature of crime and social environment calls for having a relook at the skills needed by law enforcement officers. Apart from investigative work and communicating with the public, successful cops need to be active listeners, persuasive and have a problem-solving approach. This can only be done by providing them the right training aimed at bringing about a qualitative change in their working.The commission recommended replacement of old weapons with new and upgraded ones. Before submitting the report, K B Singh met city residents and media persons to take their feedback on police reforms. In the wake of Supreme Court directions, the UT administration set up a single-member police reform commission on September 1, 2020 to file a report on police reforms within three months. The governor said that implementation of the recommendations made by the commission would help make Chandigarh police more responsible and efficient.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/police-reform-panel-suggests-soft-skill-training-for-ut-cops/articleshow/85721736.cms||---
---||Mumbai||SC moved on order upholding governor’s payment to contractor||MUMBAI: State government moved Supreme Court in an appeal against a Bombay high court order that upheld governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s power, during President’s Rule in November 2019, to approve payment to a road contractor. On March 5, HC had dismissed the state’s review plea of a December 2019 consent order that recorded its undertaking to pay Rs 358 crore to Manaj Tollway Pvt Ltd, which bagged a four-laning and maintenance contract for two state highways in 2011. Manaj moved the HC to withdraw the amount deposited with HC in its pending contempt plea over non-payment. On August 11, the HC rapped the state for deliberately stalling release of the amount. On Tuesday, state’s advocate Jyoti Chavan told Justice Anil Menon a decision was taken by the law and judiciary department to file a special leave petition. “The CM also approved it,’’she added. Senior advocate Aspi Chinoy, with advocate Cherag Balsara, for Manaj, said the money which was with HC must be released to the contractor. But Chavan objected to it, saying contempt was filed only against two officers who signed the consent terms and not the state. Also, there was no direction sought against the state. Justice Menon permitted Manaj to amend its contempt petition to seek contempt against the state as well to direct the HC Prothonotary and Senior Master to forthwith release the entire amount with accrued interest. “Prima facie, there appears to be contempt,” said Justice Menon, posting the contempt hearing on August 31. On Friday, the state filed the SLP. Following disputes, Manaj opted out in 2015 and invoked the arbitration clause, and a payment of Rs 358 crore was made. On December 13, 2019, the state paid Rs 1 crore to it. In the winter session, it took the legislature’s sanction to pay the remaining Rs 357 crore. When the amount was not paid, Manaj moved HC for contempt, and the amount was deposited with HC. The state’s review plea said the consent terms were hurriedly entered into during President’s rule and its approval was not sought.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-moved-on-order-upholding-guvs-payment-to-contractor/articleshow/85727805.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Goa||Goa: After ‘no foul play’, Russian arrested for compatriot’s murder||PANAJI: Nine days after Russian national Ekaterina Titova, 34, was found dead in a rented room in Oxel, Siolim, Goa police registered the case as a murder after her postmortem confirmed it. Denis Kriuchkoy, also a Russian, was arrested. Goa police had initially ruled out foul play in the case. Anjuna PI Suraj Gawas said that they suspect that an “attempt to sexual assault” may have led to the murder. On the same day Titova was found dead, another Russian, Alexandra Ri Djavi, 24, was found hanging in Siolim, and Gawas said it was a “clear suicide”. “There is no foul play in the death of Ri Djavi,” said North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena. The postmortem on both the bodies was conducted at Goa medical college (GMC) on Friday. In the Titova case, Gawas said that the victim and another woman had visited Kriuchkoy in Siolim. Kriuchkoy used to live alone at the rented place. He said that investigations revealed that all three were drunk. “Kriuchkoy committed murder of his friend Titova by compressing her nose and mouth,” Gawas said, adding that Kriuchkoy was non-traceable since August 19 (last Thursday). On that day, Anjuna police received a phone call from EMRI 108 informing them that a woman was found dead in her rented room at Oxel. “At the spot, we found Titova, lying on the bed inside her bedroom,” Gawas had said. The PI had said that upon enquiry with her roommate, police learned that both of them consumed alcohol till 5am on Thursday, after which the deceased went to sleep in her bedroom and the friend went to sleep in the hall. “In the late evening, her friend woke up and found that there was no response from the deceased,” he said. “Accordingly, she opened the bedroom door and found her lying on the bed, and there was no movement.” “This case has been solved through the excellent work done by the doctors of the department of forensics, GMC, and the investigating team of Goa police,” said legal counsel for Russian consulate in Goa, Vikram Varma. “I do hope that we can collectively bring out the truth in the case of Alexandra Ri Djavi too.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/after-no-foul-play-russian-arrested-for-compatriots-murder/articleshow/85725490.cms||Murari Shetye

Panchkula, Yamunanagar and Naraingarh are to be included in the cluster. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said that the solid waste management plant would be made at a big level under the cluster plan of the state government. In October 2017, Haryana government announced that it would undertake cluster-wise solid waste management throughout the state by hiring internationally reputed firms. As of now, 125 tonnes of garbage is being collected in Panchkula every day. The trash is dumped at the Jhuriwala site, which was earmarked for the solid waste management plant. The site, which is surrounded by a forest, wildlife sanctuary and has a natural water choe nearby, has been in the news for dumping of city waste. The forest department wrote to the MC and HUDA officials demanding their land back. They pointed out that it was given for some other purpose but was being used for dumping of garbage, causing harm to the natural forest and wildlife area. The mayor said that garbage in the Sector 23 dumping ground was being processed by a firm hired by the MC for Rs 30 crore. Once the solid waste management plant starts under the cluster programme, garbage from the dumping site in Sector 23 and Jhuriwala would be processed, he said. He added that the MC is taking steps to process the garbage collected from door to door in the neighbourhood of the particular area to ease the burden on the dumping ground. In the previous Swachhta rankings, Panchkula district scored less due to the absence of a solid waste management plant and garbage processing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pkula-mc-waits-to-clear-the-mess-with-solid-waste-mgmt-plant/articleshow/85721799.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

With over 60% of the stray dogs already sterilised and hardly any deaths in humans due to rabies in the last six years, government authorities as well as animal welfare organisations say that it is not an impossible task to achieve. According to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), out of about 4,60,000 dogs counted in the greater Hyderabad limits, 60% of them already have their ear notched, which means that they are sterilised, and over 45,000 dogs have been administered the anti-rabies vaccination in the last four months. “We can declare a city as rabies-free when there is not even a single human death recorded in the last one year and also 90% of the dogs must be vaccinated. Although we haven’t seen any rabies death in GHMC limits in the last six years, we are yet to reach the vaccination target,” said a GHMC official. Speaking to TOI about her latest initiative on rabies prevention, Blue Cross chairperson Amala Akkineni said that every dog that is picked up for sterilisation is also given the anti-rabies vaccination (ARV) as a measure to control rabies. “In the dog census, it was found that with every 100 dogs counted, 40 are already sterilised. A successful birth control or anti-rabies vaccination drive depends on all this and shows good results, such as rabies-free zones and puppy-free zones, especially where it has received community support,” said Amala. However, to achieve long-term goals, she said that there is also a need for responsible dog population management which brings the pet community, street community, animal welfare groups and the government authorities into agreements on how to manage. Authorities at the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM), which receives the highest number of dog bite cases in Telangana, said that the number of rabies cases in humans has come down drastically in recent years. “We need to understand that not all dog bite cases are rabies cases. We get about 150 dog bite cases every day, but when it comes to rabies, only about five cases were recorded in last two years,” said IPM director K Shankar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/with-over-60-sterilisation-of-strays-hyd-could-be-next-after-goa-to-eliminate-rabies/articleshow/85725513.cms||Moulika.KV

Rane waded into the GPSC’s selection process by putting up a contention that Tiwari, who heads the GMC’s nephrology department, lost his seniority when he resigned from the hospital. The post is currently held by Dr S M Bandekar, who is third on the list of seniority after head of pathology Dr Wiseman Pinto, in an ad-hoc capacity. Bandekar also holds the post of medical superintendent of GMC. In a three-page letter to the commission, Rane alleged that there have been precedents of candidates being selected and finalised for the post of dean on the basis of “confidential reports”. He claimed that the personnel department had not informed the GPSC that Tiwari had resigned from the GMC and said that this needed to be treated as a break in service. He even attached Tiwari’s relieving order to his letter. The health minister further said a government order granting Tiwari lien on his post for two years could not be accepted. Lien on a regular posting, he said, is only permitted on health grounds and not to facilitate one to join other institutes. Rane claimed that Tiwari had neglected his parent institute, the GMC, whose nephrology department was also affected as he was the only nephrologist available at the GMC. He further said the public health department had accepted Tiwari’s resignation. “The lien given is illegal and has to be treated as a break in service... (Tiwari) cannot be considered for ranking and seniority as number 1 as he lost seniority once he resigned from the government service,” Rane said. He requested the commission to put the matter on record. “A file like this, without proper information, cannot be approved by the government. I, as health minister, would like to put on record that this is not acceptable and that information has not been provided by the personnel department to the GPSC,” he said. A senior GPSC official had earlier told TOI that the government can reject their recommendation “provided there is a valid justification and reasoning. Our decision can’t be simply rejected. The file came to us last month, we have given our decision.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/rane-stirs-up-another-row-goesagainst-gpsc-pick-on-gmc-dean/articleshow/85725520.cms||Murari Shetye

However, the reality is that almost 50% TB patients are going through ‘catastrophic’ health expenditure due to which a patient’s household is forced to cuts its basic expenses, shows a new study - “Rising healthcare expenditure on tuberculosis: Can India achieve the end TB goal?” Handling of TB cases is also crucial during the pandemic as there are concerns that Covid is flaring up TB cases in the country. India has the highest number of TB cases (27% of the global share) in the world. Currently, there are about 24,500-plus TB patients seeking treatment in the state, with two-thirds of the cases reported among the economically productive age group (14–59 years). To examine the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE), healthcare burden, catastrophic health expenditure, hardship financing and impoverishment effects of TB treatment in India, the authors studied data from three rounds of national statistical surveys — 2004-05, 2013-14 and 2017-18. The present analysis helps understand the financial burden TB treatment causes on households for the past 15 years. It provides evidence to policymakers for more effective channelling of resources in order to achieve a TB-free India by 2025. The analysis shows that OOPE, healthcare burden, hardship financing and catastrophic health expenditure are considerably higher for those utilising private hospital services and among poor, rural households. Overall, 49% of hospitalised patients and 52% of OPD patients with TB in 2018 were exposed to catastrophic healthcare expenditure. Incidentally, males were affected by TB more than females and this also has an impact on family’s earning. In 2004, the ratio of men and women seeking outpatient TB care was almost the same, whereas in 2014 and 2018, it was 80% to 20%. In the case of hospitalisation, the number of male patients is higher than females. “End TB strategy milestones for 2025 and 2035 has an objective that no affected families face catastrophic costs due to TB. Based on our analysis using various rounds of NSSO, this is far from achieving a reality in India,” said Denny John, adjunct assistant professor, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences & Research Centre, and co-author of the study.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/tb-care-a-financial-strain-on-households/articleshow/85723541.cms||Preetu Nair

Several small teams have been formed for different assignments. This rush in several colleges in the city however is not due to the second phase of admissions tounder-graduate courses scheduled to get underway next week but to prepare forthe visit from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) due inmany colleges next month. College authorities want to complete NAAC related workbefore the next phase of admission to UG courses gains momentum by the secondweek of September. It is important for collegesbecause funding by the University Grants Commission, financial grants from thecentral government and collaborations with foreign universities and collegesdepend on depend on the NAAC rating. NAAC grades range from A++to D. The lowest grade means that the educational institution is not accredited. At Lady Brabourne Collegethe NAAC visit is due sometime in September. The visit was due earlier thisyear but was cancelled due to the second wave of COVID 19. “Several newprojects have been undertaken for empowerment of women along with setting up ofWomen’s Study Centre,” said Siuli Sarkar, principal of the college. Some of the parameters that NAACconsiders while deciding on a rating include the number of classrooms, thecondition of the laboratories, the quality of the library and the availabilityof facilities for sports and cultural activities. The faculty strength, academicperformance of students, placement opportunities and facilities for girls areamong the other key criteria. Some of the other colleges that are up forreassessment are J.D.Birla Institute, Maulana Azad College, Scottish ChurchCollege, the Ramakrishna Mission Colleges and City College. “A lot of guidelines have changed, and we are working to fulfilall the criteria. Most of our staff associated with the NAAC work is coming tothe campus daily and spending a big part of the day trying to ensure we fulfilall the guidelines before the visit,” said Deepali Singhee, principal of J.D.Birla Institute. Inspection by NAAC officialswhich is the last stage of the accreditation process follows the submission ofself-study reports submitted by the colleges. The purpose of the visit is toverify claims made by colleges in their self-study reports. According to sources in Calcutta University dueto the pandemic and subsequent lockdown almost 40 percent of its colleges aredue for re-assessment. “In 2015, the state governmenthad asked all state-aided colleges to start the process after the UGC issued adirective making it mandatory for every college to have NAAC accreditation by2017. Earlier only autonomous, private and some top line government collegeswould go for NAAC assessment,” said an official of the education department. BOX 1) NAAC is a nodal body that evaluates highereducation institutes and grades the quality 2) Good NAAC rating ensures financial grants fromthe central government, the UGC and collaborations with foreign universitiesand colleges. 3) The accreditation certificate remains valid for five years, afterwhich a college has to renew it. 4) Some of the parameters that NAAC considers while deciding on arating include the number of classrooms, the condition of the laboratories andlibraries, facilities for sports and cultural activities. 5) Other key criteria are faculty strength, academic performance ofstudents, placement opportunities and facilities for girls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/zee-naac-28/08/21/articleshow/85723634.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Parents have said that the Intermediate board should direct colleges not to demand unnecessary or additional fees to issue TCs. The Intermediate board officials, however, said that they have not received any complaint so far. With EAMCET (Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test) counselling expected to begin soon, parents said they have no option but to pay up whatever demanded by the colleges to get the required certificates. “As classes were conducted online, we did not buy books from the college. My son cleared his Intermediate with 92%. Now, when we applied for the TC, the administration is asking us to pay over Rs 10,000 for books and material,” said a parent, adding that this was apart from the fee dues of Rs 45,000. The parent further said that even in the case of fee dues, the college did not honour its promise on concession. “The management had said that they would be giving a concession of about 20%-30% on the fee. However, they gave only 10% concession on the total fee of Rs 60,000 which was even less than the fee for books they are asking us to pay additionally,” he said. Parents said that the colleges did not have any right to ask for money for books or materials which their children never used. “They are claiming that we have to pay irrespective of whether or not we bought books or material from colleges. How is this fair?” asked a parent. Parents alleged that the colleges were trying to cash in on parents’ helplessness as they needed the TC. With EAMCET counselling expected to begin soon, parents said they have no option but to pay up whatever demanded by the colleges to get the required certificates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/colleges-taking-money-for-unused-books-material-to-issue-tc-parents/articleshow/85725549.cms||---

The deceased was identified as Ramesh Raneja (30). The injured include Raneja’s daughters Ayushi (8) and Santok (3). The children, who are in critical condition, have been referred to a hospital in Ahmedabad. Raneja’s wife Sangeeta (28) was unhurt after the explosion. Deputy superintendent of police Bharat Basiya said that they suspect the explosion was caused by a detonator in the house. “It looks as if a detonator had exploded in the house, Though most commercial detonators are stable and safe to handle, if in hands of the untrained person it could prove hazardous,” Basiya told TOI. “The forensic team is investigating the matter. They have also called an explosive specialist from Himmatnagar to reach a conclusion with regard to what caused the explosion,” the DySP added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/suspected-detonator-blast-kills-1-injures-2/articleshow/85721857.cms||---

A magisterial court on Saturday sent Shrikant Sarode (36), Aditya Pawar (19), Durvesh Jadhav (26) and Ashish Mohite (18) to police custody remand till September 4. Senior inspector Krishna Indalkar said, “A beat marshal rushed to a house after the control room relayed a message that a woman was in distress. She was screaming for help and a sizeable crowd had gathered outside. The assembled people repeatedly knocked on the door, but the suspects refused to open it.” Indalkar said, “The marshal then broke open the door and took four men into custody before they could flee. The condition of the woman was such that she urgently needed medical treatment. We rushed her to a government hospital. Her condition is stable, but she is in a state of shock. She is not in a position to make any statement.” “The suspects during questioning admitted to gang raping the woman. Preliminary investigations revealed that they had picked up the woman from a place on finding her alone at home. The suspects have not revealed as to how they had escorted the woman to the house. We don’t know whether the suspects and the woman are known to each other.” We have suo motu registered an FIR relating to gang-rape under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

We have given multiple representations at the university level and to the higher education department to introduce a UG course. But it has not been considered so far,” said professor Bala Kishan, dean, faculty of science and professor in the department of geography at OU. He added that the university has been getting a large number of applications from BE/BTech students for MSc in geography. “Due to a gap in demand and supply, many students go to West Bengal and Maharashtra to pursue a career in geography. It’s time authorities recognise the need to introduce it at the UG level,” said professor Bala Kishan.  Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) is in the process of assessing the need for a course. “Degree admissions for academic year 2021-22 are already in its third phase. So it is not possible to introduce the course this year. However, we are talking to academic bodies to evaluate if the same can be introduced from the next academic year,” said R Limbadri, chairman, TSCHE.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/state-has-tremendous-scope/articleshow/85725553.cms||---

The goldsmith (42), a resident of Katraj, approached the police on Friday. A team headed by senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Bharati Vidyapeeth tracked down the duo following a tip-off. According to the police, the goldsmith currently makes gold ornaments at his residence and takes orders from individuals and shopkeepers. “He was looking for a shop in Katraj area to start his business. He had saved about Rs20lakh to buy a shop,” a senior officer said. “The suspects gathered information about the goldsmith and decided to rob him under the guise of income tax officers,” the officer said. “On Thursday afternoon, the suspects went to his house in an SUV. They informed the goldsmith that they were IT officials and have permission to search his house,” police said. “The suspects searched his house and found cash Rs 20 lakh and 300 grams of gold ornaments (worth around Rs 12 lakh). The suspects then packed the cash and gold ornaments in a bag and asked the goldsmith to come with them for further inquiry,” police said. “They took him to an isolated spot near Katraj and dropped him there late in the evening without conducting any inquiry,” police said. “On Friday morning, the goldsmith conducted inquiries with a few people and realised that the suspects had robbed him under the guise of IT department officials.

He was on his way out when he was asked to pay Rs50 as parking charges. His explanations that he had entered the arrival area for only a few minutes fell on deaf ears. He forked out the amount as he didn’t want to create a scene in front of his guests. “The authorities should intervene to stop such malpractices at the airport,” he said. Kshitij Kaskar, a Koregaon Park resident, faced a similar situation late last month when he went to the airport to drop his father. “ While I was coming out of the airport, a parking representative asked me to pay Rs85. I argued with him for a while, but realised it was useless. The ticket he gave me was for public transport vehicles,” he said. Babulal Yadav, the general manager of Delhi-based Lovelin Enterprises, which manages the parking at the airport, said that a fine of Rs500 was to be paid by any private vehicle entering the departure area and staying for more than five minutes. “Some pay Rs50 or Rs100. We have been told by the airport authorities to collect the amount to ensure that the airport premises don’t get crowded,” he said. Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke said that he would ask for an update on the issue before commenting on it.

In his tweet, the parent, Judish Raj, wrote: “There is no single undergraduate college offering BSc Geography in Hyderabad. There is immense opportunity for Geospatial Informatics, remote sensing, climate science etc. Today every good student has to move to Calcutta University, Madras Presidency etc. (sic).” Raj’s daughter is hoping to enrol for a BSc in geography. The tweet immediately caught the attention of many, including IT minister, K T Rama Rao on Saturday. He wrote: “Thanks for the input sir. Request education minister Smt @SabithaindraTRS garu to instruct Telangana Higher Education Council to assess and advice.” A quick investigation by TOI — following this response — revealed that while geography is offered as a combination in some bachelor of arts courses, there isn’t a single college that offers a dedicated BSc or honors in geography. The situation is worse at the post-graduate level where there are barely 60 seats in Osmania University (OY) and Telangana University offering a Masters in science (MSc) in geography. “Hyderabad is home to institutions such as National Remote Sensing Centre, National Geophysical Research Institute. But there is not a single institution that offers geography at the undergraduate (UG) level. Students of ISC board learn geography of a very high standard in class 12. Climate science and Geographic Information System (GIS) are subjects of the future and it’s unfortunate that students from Hyderabad have to look elsewhere to pursue a course in it,” Raj told TOI. The state government has a dedicated Telangana Remote Sensing Application Centre (TRAC) in addition to several tech firms such as Apple that work in the area of digital maps and geoinformatics.

Leading a tobacco-free and healthy lifestyle, she only had persistent cough and backache for the last few months. Acting on the advice of her oncologist, she tried targeted therapy to help her avoid chemotherapy. Manisha did well for almost two years before her cancer progressed. She is now on another oral drug. “Being on an oral tablet has helped me avoid chemotherapy. Besides, I haven’t encountered any major side-effects. This helped me to continue my job without affecting my daily routine,” she said. A sizable number of cancer patients are living a near-normal life without taking chemotherapy by opting for oral/intravenous anti-cancer drugs called targeted therapies. Targeted therapies now cover almost all cancers. Depending on the cancer type and stage, over 50% of patients are eligible to avail the benefits of targeted therapies, experts said. “Targeted therapies are currently the focus of anti-cancer treatment. They are a cornerstone of precision drug, a form of medicine that uses information about a person’s genes and proteins to prevent, diagnose and treat the disease,” said oncologist Reshma Puranik of Avinash Cancer Clinic. Till the late 1990s, anti-cancer treatment mainly consisted of chemotherapy drugs that worked by killing the cancer cells. “Hormonal therapy for breast cancer was one of the earliest targeted therapies discovered,” Puranik said. Consultant haematologist Sweta Lunkad said, “Targeted therapies have changed the way we treat blood cancers. Diseases like acute myeloid lymphoma, which were death statements for the elderly, are now curable.” “With biomarker-driven targeted therapy, the survival rates have drastically improved to more than three years in many patients,” said Puranik.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/targeted-drugs-help-many-avoid-chemotherapy/articleshow/85723560.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Teenmar Mallanna held for ‘extortion’||HYDERABAD: Journalist-turned-politician Teenmar Mallanna was on Friday arrested by Chilkalguda police in a five-month-old extortion case. The police produced Mallanna before the Secunderabad criminal court magistrate, who directed him to a 14-day judicial remand. Mallanna was arrested on the charge of extortion after Lakshmikanth Sharma, a spiritual leader, alleged that he demanded money. Earlier, Mallana was questioned by police a couple of times with regard to this case. “Teenmar Mallanna was arrested by Chilkalguda PS in Cr no 197/ 2021. In the case the accused had demanded money by putting a person in fear of death,” Hyderabad police said in a press note. Expecting trouble from his followers, heavy police security was deployed at the Secunderabad court. The remand proceedings were conducted online by the magistrate. Later, Mallanna was shifted to Chanchalguda jail. For the last few days, Mallanna had been anticipating arrest as he was severely criticising chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and the TRS government. Meanwhile, Chilkalguda police moved a petition in the court, seeking seven days custody. “Initially, the case was registered only under sections 387, 504 of IPC. But during the course of investigation, they added another charge (306 of IPC read with 511) which is an accusation that the accused attempted to drive a person to suicide. But during the court proceedings, we have brought to the notice of the judge that there is no act of suicide attempt by the complainant as charged by the police,” Mallanna’s advocate Umesh Chandra told the media. As of now, there are 31 different cases registered against Mallanna in different police stations on various charges. A few days ago, central crime station (CCS) officials booked a case against Mallanna based on a complaint lodged by his former colleague. CCS officials raided Mallanna’s office and seized some material evidence. A few months ago, Mallanna had unsuccessfully contested MLC elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/teenmar-mallanna-held-for-extortion/articleshow/85725622.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Soon-to-be SC judge Narasimha grew up in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, better known as senior advocate P S Narasimha, who is one of the few to be directly elevated from the advocates’ room to being a judge of the Supreme Court, is a strong believer in protecting the environment. Hailing from a family of ardent devotees of Lord Ram which ran a choultry for poor pilgrims at Bhadrachalam Ram temple, he treats tall trees as divine incarnations. Born on May 3, 1963, he was brought up in Hyderabad. His stint with the Hyderabad judiciary lasted barely two years though he was enrolled in the then-composite AP high court after completing LLB in 1988. Despite the goodwill and his father Justice Kodanda Ramayya being a judge and a legal writer at the high court, he soon shifted to Delhi to practice at the Supreme Court. In 2008, Supreme Court made him a senior advocate and in 2014, the NDA government made him additional solicitor general. He continued in that post till 2018. He assisted the top court and helped it arrive at decisions in many constitutional issues. He defended the rights of the people to protect their culture in the Jallikattu case and ISRO took his help when the new space activities bill was prepared. His assistance to the forest bench of the apex court in matters related to environment and his ecology-centric approach was widely acknowledged by the legal fraternity. As additional solicitor general, he defended the Union in the Italian marines case, National Judicial Appointments Commission and Ram Janmabhoomi cases. Even those who resisted the Justice Lodha committee-led reforms aimed at cleansing the BCCI and cricket administration, acknowledge his persuasive ways that finally ensured the recommendations are implemented across the country. Otherwise, we would not even think of BCCI being headed by a cricketer today, a source who was privy to the initial friction said.  In October 2027 he would become the Chief Justice of India for a brief period of seven months. He will retire from the apex court in May 2028.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/soon-to-be-sc-judge-narasimha-grew-up-in-hyd/articleshow/85725598.cms||---

Coastal police had intensified the patrolling operations following inputs from the central intelligence agencies that about 15 people from Sri Lanka were likely to sail to Tamil Nadu and from there to Pakistan via Kerala coast. The boat was intercepted during the intensified patrolling. However, on inspection it was found that the boat was having Tamil Nadu registration, but was fishing in Kerala waters illegally without availing the required permit, according to J Jayanath, AIG of coastal police. There were six fish workers onboard the boat named ‘Jayamatha’, and they were from Eraviputhenthurai in Tamil Nadu. “All of them had proper Aadhaar cards but the boat did not have the permit to fish in Kerala waters. Such violations happen quite often but now we have tightened the patrolling,” Jayanath said. He added that there was no update on the reports of the suspicious movement of the ship from Sri Lanka.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/illegal-fishing-tn-boat-intercepted/articleshow/85723590.cms||---

He said that e-GOPALA provides real-time information to dairy farmers for better productivity of milch animals. The fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying minister further said that NDDB is promoting technology-driven activities for milk producers keeping in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream of digital India. He stressed that increasing yield of milch animals will automatically increase farmers’ income. Rupala also appreciated the role of Indian Immunologicals, a subsidiary of NDDB in Covaxin manufacturing process. NDDB’s officiating chairman Meenesh Shah briefed the minister about dairy cooperative movement, achievements of phase I of National Dairy Plan, Rashtriya Gokul Mission projects, enhancing productivity of milch animals and other initiatives. The e-GOPALA platform helps farmers manage their livestock including buying and selling of disease-free germplasm in all forms, informs about availability of quality breeding services and guides farmers for animal nutrition, treatment of animals using appropriate ayurvedic ethno veterinary medicine. There is a mechanism to send alert (on due date for vaccination, pregnancy diagnosis, calving) and inform farmers about various government schemes. IMAP web portal is meant for geographical presentation of project coverage featuring INAPH(displays state as well as district wise animal registration coverage against animal population), PSK service (displays ticket status against various services), NAIP (geographically displays government initiated projects related to artificial insemination) and NADCP (geographically displays projects related to animal disease control).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/e-gopalas-web-version-imap-web-portal-launched/articleshow/85721915.cms||---

The party has also decided to support the Bharat Bandh called by Sanyukta Kisan Morcha on September 25. It further chalked out a plan to stage demonstrations at block level on October 8 to mark the arrest of social activist Stan Swamy by the National Investigation Agency in connection with Bhima Koregoan case. Swamy, later died in custody. CPM’s Rajya Sabha MP from Tripura Jharna Das, who took part in the convention, said, “Stan Swamy was not provided proper treatment for his illnesses after arrest. I believe Swamy’s death was a murder.” She added that a proper inquiry needs to be conducted on the issue and the culprits be punished. Swamy was suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Das, while talking to media persons, accused BJP of using force to suppress the voices of opposition parties in the monsoon session of Parliament. Calling the action ‘undemocratic’, she said, “During the Rajya Sabha session on August 11, the Union government used marshals to unleash violence on opposition leaders, including the women members. In my 12-year tenure, I have never heard of such repressive measures being taken nor seen it happen in the Parliament.” On August 11, the central government tabled the insurance amendment bill which the opposition termed as a ‘sell-off’. The opposition leaders stormed into the well of the house and shouted slogans. The marshals were called in to check the protest. Das further said that opposition had demanded a discussion on the farmers’ agitation and other issues but the government did not allow it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cpm-to-organise-block-level-demonstrations-across-jharkhand-on-oct-8-to-mark-swamys-arrest/articleshow/85723930.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Railways gives in to villagers’ demand, to build foot-overbridge at Kandra station||Jamshedpur: The Chakradharpur railway division has started construction of a foot-overbridge (FOB) at the Kandra railway station to meet the longstanding demands of over 23,000 residents of 35 villages in the vicinity of the station. The division aims to complete the 80m x 3m FOB within 90 days. Senior divisional manager (commercial) Manish Pathak said on Saturday, “We have commenced work with the installation of two girders and two barrels measuring 33m and 13m have been fixed. The third barrel measuring 34m will be fixed tomorrow (Sunday) to cover the 80m length. We will construct the staircases subsequently.” Pathak said the new FOB at Kandra station, located 21km away from the Tatanagar station, will encompass all six tracks to facilitate commuters to walk from one end to the other smoothly. Currently, a short FOB exists and the commuters are forced to walk over track numbers five and six to cross the yard. A total of 36 long and short-distance trains halt at the station along with an equal number of goods trains passing through at frequent intervals. “Not many passenger trains halted at the station earlier and the movement of the goods trains was comparatively less. The old FOB served the purpose to reach the two mainline tracks but the Kandra has become a busy station and we started construction of the new FOB,” Pathak said. A 46-year-old Kandra resident, Ajit Kumar, said, “Once the new FOB is completed, we need not walk the 3km distance to reach the other side of the station during the busy hours,” said Kandra resident, 46-year-old, Ajit Kumar. Meanwhile, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth has sought the list of passenger trains halting at the Chandil railway station during the Covid period. The Chandil station master, Vishnu Tanti, said the MP has sought information about the trains that have not stopped at the station in the past year. Notably, 18 pairs of passenger trains halt at Chandil station prior to the pandemic, but only five pairs are halting at the station currently.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/railways-gives-in-to-villagers-demand-to-build-foot-overbridge-at-kandra-station/articleshow/85723823.cms||B Sridhar

The party men turned up at the airport with garlands and sweets along with traditional artistes for their ceremonial welcome with utter disregard to the Covid-19 safety norms. The Congress leaders also held a roadshow riding on an open jeep apart from a padyatra at a few places from the airport. Several of the party workers were seen without wearing masks. Similar scenes were observed at the party office in the city where a welcome ceremony was organised. The district administration remained a mute spectator to the entire issue but later said it will take up action against the violators. Reacting to the development, SDM Deepak Kumar Dubey said, “No one has taken permission to hold a political rally at the airport. We are going to get the video footages to take appropriate action against the violators soon.” It may be noted that Thakur and the party’s co-working presidents, including Geeta Koda (Singhbhum MP), Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey, Sahjada Anwar and Jaleshwar Mahto, arrived at the airport. All of them were appointed by the All India Congress Committee (AICC) two days ago replacing the earlier team headed by Rameshwar Oraon, who is also the state’s finance minister. Speaking to reporters at the party office, Thakur said his focus will be to strengthen the party and coordinate between different constituents of the government. “I am thankful to the party high command for giving me an opportunity. I want to ensure that we work towards the betterment of the party and the state government,” he said. None of the party leaders, however, wished to make any comments on the violations of Covid norms. “It wasn’t any planned event but party workers were so enthused that they voluntarily came to welcome us,” remarked a co-working president.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cong-workers-flout-cov-norms-to-welcome-state-party-prez/articleshow/85723473.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Ranka resident Deo Pratap Singh was on his way to Garhwa, along with his wife and daughter Mamta Kumari, when around 1:30pm the truck, which was coming from the opposite direction, rammed into it. The driver immediately fled the spot while the locals blocked Kuthwa Mor, located 33km from the district headquarters, for an hour in protest.

---||Delhi||Probe into riots case callous and inefficient, says Delhi court||NEW DELHI: While framing charges against a man in a northeast Delhi riots case, a Delhi court said the investigation appeared to be “callous,” “inefficient” and “unproductive,” but it could not at the stage ignore the statements of the victims. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav framed charges against Rohit for the offences under sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 147 and 148 (rioting), 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking), 427 (mischief), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house) 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance) IPC read with section 149 (unlawful assembly) and section 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant) IPC. The case related to the alleged vandalism, looting and putting ablaze the house of Anwar Ali, Ashiq Ali and Irshad during the riots in Gokalpuri. “It is worth noting that investigation in the matter appears to be highly callous, inefficient and unproductive; however, as noted earlier, this court at this stage, cannot ignore the statements of victims dehors the delay in recording of FIR in the matter,” the court said. The court added that, prima facie, there was enough material on record to frame charges against the accused under the requisite sections. The counsel for the accused had submitted that, of the alleged riotous mob of 400-500 people, only the accused had been chargesheeted, and till date, police had not been able to identify/apprehend any other accused in the matter. Special public prosecutor D K Bhatia, appearing for police, had argued that the accused was initially arrested in another case based on a mobile camera footage where he was allegedly clearly seen being part of the rioting mob and actively taking part in vandalising, rioting and arsoning of public and private property in the area. The court said the mobile clip provided by one of the prosecution witnesses could not be thrown into the dustbin at this stage as the places of the incidents in both the cases were quite nearby. “Whether the same unlawful assembly was operating in the area at the relevant time is a question that cannot be decided at this stage. Similarly, the issue of improper clubbing of complaints and delay in recording of witnesses in the matter also cannot be adjudicated upon at the stage of consideration on charge. This court will try to seek answers to these questions during the trial,” it noted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/probe-into-riots-case-callous-and-inefficient-says-court/articleshow/85724094.cms||Usha Das

ATL marathon, an initiative by NITI Aayog, is meant for igniting zeal of innovation and social responsibility in the youth. For over six months, selected teams undergo essential training in order to research, ideate and finally implement their projects. The Atal Innovation Mission had received 7,200 submissions from over 17,000 students from across the country. Team EDUBOX comprising of students — Kartik Joshi and Shane Macwan — along with their mentor Sonal Shah had conceptualised a self-learning interface for the marathon. The project concept is to install an automated system having screens that can operate using tokens in public places or near private schools, offices among others. The system allows the underprivileged to study at their will, but the learning is not free. One waste plastic bottle is used as a token to allow 10 minutes of video-based learning time on basic topics. This innovation caters to multiple aspects of our social issues. “The bottles collected do not litter public places, plastic can be utilized for various plastic waste management and recycling systems including road constructions which use plastics nowadays. And it might even encourage adults to join their children in learning,” said a school official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/learning-for-all-vadodara-students-innovation-in-niti-aayogs-top-300/articleshow/85721960.cms||---

Almost all major roads criss-crossing Civil Lines, a tony locality which houses High Court building, MLA Hostel, the office of deputy commissioner of police (traffic) office, former Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde’s bungalow among other important landmarks, are full of potholes and rough patches. BJP corporator Pragati Patil, under whose constituency the area falls, said that the state agency is in a deep slumber. “In May this year, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Dharampeth zone office had raised the issue with the state PWD and urged it to repair the roads in Civil Lines, but to no avail,” she said. Cited examples of Seminary Hills road and the patch between Raja Rani Square and MLA Hostel Chowk, Patil said that small potholes are taking the shape of craters. TOI has received many complaints about pathetic condition of roads in Civil Lines. Despite repeated attempts, PWD’s superintending engineer Vidyadhar Sardeshmukh did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. Potholes have developed on the tar roads laid down by the PWD in 2018 before the Indian Road Congress in Civil Lines, especially from Japanese Garden Square to Old Katol Naka. TOI found that the tar roads being maintained by state’s PWD in Civil Lines, especially Palm Road, Rabindranath Tagore Road, Seminary Hills road and MLA Hostel stretch, are in a poor condition. According to Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers Association, driving on many PWD roads, especially those in Civil Lines and Seminary Hills, has become unsafe. “During rains, it literally becomes a challenge,” he said. Roads in the Second Capital of Maharashtra usually would be repaired before the winter session of assembly. But since the session hasn’t been held due to the pandemic, the repair works have stalled. “But what stops PWD from keeping roads in good motorable condition?” said Renu. Renu asked who should be held responsible for the “ several minor accidents that might be happening daily on such roads”. “PWD should repair the roads without further delay,” he said urging the state government to hold the winter session in Nagpur, “if that is what it takes to repair the roads”. CITY ROAD OWNERSOf the 3642.08km roads in city, 2482.94km come under NMC. NHAI has around 29.80km roads in city limits while NIT and PWD own 965.320km and 107.02km. Besides, the PWD also owns the inner ring road patch of 41km.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/potholes-in-civil-lines-giving-jolts-to-motorists/articleshow/85724111.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||World||Final UK evacuation flight leaves Kabul; troops head home||LONDON: British troops have left Kabul, ending the UK's evacuation operation and its 20-year military involvement in Afghanistan. Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the “heroic” evacuation effort, even as the government acknowledged some eligible Afghan civilians had been left behind. The UK's top military officer conceded that “we haven't been able to bring everybody out." The UK government said late Saturday that about 1,000 troops who ran an airlift of British nationals and Afghan civilians had departed from Kabul airport, hours after the final evacuation flight for civilians. Most countries apart from the United States had already left. Before departing, Britain's ambassador to Afghanistan, Laurie Bristow, said from Kabul airport that it was “time to close this phase of the operation now.” “But we haven't forgotten the people who still need to leave,” Bristow said in a video posted on Twitter. “We'll continue to do everything we can to help them. Nor have we forgotten the brave, decent people of Afghanistan. They deserve to live in peace and security.” Britain says it has evacuated more than 15,000 people from Kabul in the past two weeks but that as many as 1,100 Afghans who were entitled to come to the UK have been left behind. Some British lawmakers who have been trying to help stranded constituents and their families believe the true total is higher. “We haven't been able to bring everybody out, and that has been heartbreaking, and there have been some very challenging judgments that have had to be made on the ground,” the head of British armed forces, Gen. Nick Carter, told the BBC. Foreign citizens from around the world and the Afghans who worked with them have sought to leave the country since the Taliban's swift takeover this month after most US forces departed. About 117,000 people have been evacuated through Kabul airport, according to American officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/final-uk-evacuation-flight-leaves-kabul-troops-head-home/articleshow/85729326.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Malvinder Singh Mali, from torture cell to CMO, taking on two ministers||JALANDHAR: From doing student politics to facing police cases under Tada (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act) and NSA (National Security Act) as human rights worker in Punjab, from being the publicity manager of two chief ministers–Captain Amarinder Singh and Parkash Singh Badal–to taking on two education ministers, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s adviser Malvinder Singh Mali has never turned his back on confrontations. Mali got into student politics in the mid-1970s, while in 1979, he became general secretary of the Punjab Students Union (PSU) by a unanimous vote. The events of 1984 killed the Leftist in him and awakened a Sikh activist. He told TOI: "We always considered ourselves Sikh communists, the real ones different from the other Left parties. We challenged their understanding of Sikh ideology and their forcing us to detach from it. When they went with the state, we worked for human rights and a common Punjabi identity." In second half of the 1980s, he edited Punjabi monthly ‘Jantak Paigam’, in which his group opposed the police encounters along with the Hindu killings by the militants. "We challenged majoritarianism and stood up for Punjabi nationalism," he claimed. The magazine’s cover, which has provoked Sidhu’s detractors, is also the cover photo of his Facebook account. It features Indira Gandhi’s caricature with a skeleton atop a gun. Mali said: "I posted it a few years ago when I made this social media account." He worked with justice Ajit Singh Bains of the Punjab Human Rights Organisation, as secretary investigation of this private entity. He said: "We exposed the Pilibhit fake encounter of 10 Sikhs, for which 47 policemen were held guilty. In 1992, I advocated contesting elections but the Akali factions and militant groups were firm on boycott." Mali, who did MA in journalism in the early1993, was jailed for three months in 1993, when he claims that he faced third-degree torture, as posted on Facebook. "I was acquitted in all the 15 cases, since those were false. My only crime was upholding human rights," he said. In the early 1990s, he got close to late SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra and stayed with him till his death, while working as social studies teacher in the education department since 1997. In 2005, he was posted to Chandigarh as scriptwriter and that July, attached to the CM’s office as PRO with Amarinder’s media adviser, B I S Chahal. Retained when the government changed in 2007, he worked with Parkash Singh Badal’s media adviser, Harcharan Bains." When Sewa Singh Sekhwan became education minister in later part of Badal’s tenure before 2012, Mali was a suspended for calling out malpractices in the department and his wife was transferred. "But I fought Sekhwan openly and he revoked my suspension," he said, adding: "Bains stood by me." He had a similar fight with Sekhwan’s successor, Sikandar Singh Maluka. Serving as teacher, he supported the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the 2014 elections but turned against Arvind Kejriwal when the convener chucked out Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav and suspended Patiala MP Dr Dharamvira Gandhi. "I called Kejriwal a dictator in a 2017 article." he said. Mali said he didn’t know Sidhu personally but supported his stand on the Kartarpur Corridor and federalism. He claims they met first at the wedding of MLA Pargat Singh’s son a few months ago. He has taken on CM Captain Amarinder Singh and braced his camp’s return fire.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/mali-from-torture-cell-to-cm-office-taking-on-2-ministers/articleshow/85726649.cms||IP Singh

It was only in December 2020 that he shifted to a house which he coowns with his daughter and son-in-law in Chandigarh. The house needs repairs but Dr Garg has been focussing more on current issues in the state. Now in the eye of storm with Punjab CM Amarinder Singh’s camp, BJP and SAD attacking him and Malvinder Singh Mali, after their appointment as advisers to Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, Dr Garg, who not only honed his skills as a super specialist surgeon but also as an activist, would not blink before locking horns on an issue which he would think was a righteous cause. Starting his activism from school days, actually from third standard in his village school over an issue to buy a notebook with hard cover or soft cover, he never refrained from taking a principled stand and locking horns with authorities whether he was in high school, later college – when he did BSc – and then in medical colleges during his student days and later when he came into government service. “I wanted to be a teacher, that is why despite getting a seat in medical college Rohtak, I joined BSc. Later I decided to be a college teacher and took admission in MSc (Botany) but then a person told me that I could be a teacher in medical college also and I took admission in MBBS,” he said. After MBBS, he did MA in sociology, appearing as a private student and later did MS and MCh. He got a passport for the first in January 2020, when he was urged to deliver a lecture on ‘philosophy of Guru Nanak’ at University of California, Fresno, by Central Sikh Society of Fresno, on 550th anniversary of first Sikh master. His fascination for studying Gurbani and Sikh history started in school days. In his eighth and ninth standard, Garg studied all the four volumes of interpretation of Guru Granth Sahib. These volumes are published by Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. He often quotes from Gurbani and Sikh history with great ease. “I also studied Gita in schooldays and it was in late college days that I studied Marxism,” he revealed. He retired as professor of surgery from Government Medical College Patiala and later became registrar of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences. Known for speaking out his mind, Garg has been criticising central and state governments. However, he remains biggest critic of Hindutva politics and a votary of federalism, who strongly identifies with causes of Punjab and Punjabi language and Punjabi identity. “We are just an excuse to attack Navjot Sidhu. It is more an attempt to deflect attention from real issues which are about performance of the government or other issues being faced by the state,” he said. “There is nothing antinational in what I have spoken on relations with Pakistan. It is ludicrous to call my statement anti-national. I had said that relations with other countries are central government’s job and country is well guarded. The Punjab CM has no business to behave like minister of external affairs and talk beyond his authority. I had advocated peace with neighbouring countries and I also said that despite bitter relations with Pakistan, trade through Karachi has never stopped and it should happen through Wagah border also,” he said. It’s ‘Pyara’ name in his papers but his friends and foes call him ‘Pyare’, and this is how he is known every where.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/profile-dr-pyara-lal-garg-super-specialist-surgeon-who-dissects-contemporary-social-political-issues-also/articleshow/85726691.cms||IP Singh

It has so far collected taxes lower compared to what it did last year. The VMC collects property tax and other charges as part of its annual tax bills. It would have expected that with the economic activity picking up, tax collection would also see a rise. But that has not been a case so far. Till August 15 this year, VMC had collected Rs 129.94 towards its tax bills. In the corresponding period last year, the VMC had collected Rs 142.27 as taxes. There is a shortfall of Rs 12.33crore. The reason for the shortfall lies in the rebates that the civic body has been offering. In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic since last year the VMC has been granting discount in various heads in the property tax bills since last year. The VMC has granted a rebate of 20 per cent on four components of property tax bills last year. But this year it reduced the rebate to five per cent for non-residential properties and 10 per cent for residential properties. The rebate was also reduced to two components of the property tax unlike the previous four. “We expect that tax collection will pick up once the bills reach people. The shortfall is also not very alarming,” said assistant municipal commissioner (revenue), Jignesh Gohil. Despite the rebates given in the financial year 2020-21, the VMC had surpassed tax collection as compared to the previous year. VMC had collected Rs 382.46crore in 2020-21 and this increased to Rs 391.91crore in 2021-22.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/low-rebate-translates-into-lower-civic-tax-collection-at-vmc/articleshow/85721994.cms||Sachin Sharma

Metropolitan Magistrate Tania Singh said, “No one is above the law. Surprised to see how this case is being taken so lightly.” The court further rebuked his lawyer for the same and noted that he has not filed his income affidavit and was not prepared with the arguments. Giving Singh one last opportunity to appear before it, the court asked him not to repeat such conduct again. Singh, through his lawyer Ishan Mukherjee, had moved an application seeking exemption from physically appearing before the court, citing medical reasons. During the hearing, Singh’s wife Shalini Talwar broke down in the courtroom and said she gave her husband 10 years, but he has abandoned her. “I am left with no option. I gave him 10 years. I stood by him. He has abandoned me,” Talwar claimed. To this, the judge said she was concerned about her mental well-being. “What do you want from the court now? What stage is the marriage at? Where is the love lost?” the judge asked. Meanwhile, Mukherjee told the court that Singh’s family was ready to accommodate her and she can come to reside at her in-laws’ home in 15 days. He added that Talwar has already taken all the valuables with her, including jewellery. Talwar had filed a plea, through advocate Sandeep Kapur, senior partner of Karanjawala & Co, seeking protection against alleged atrocities committed by Singh and his family members upon her. It alleged that Singh and his family criminally intimidated her and caused her immense emotional trauma throughout their over 10 years of marriage. She said she was subjected to numerous incidents of physical, verbal and mental abuse by him and sought Rs 20 crore as compensation under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-one-above-law-says-court-as-singer-skips-case-hearing/articleshow/85724838.cms||Usha Das

The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in mid-August. According to the Taliban shura (consultation committee) member, the caretaker government will be formed inclusively by Taliban commanders and leaders from all Afghan ethnicities and tribal backgrounds in the country, reported The News International. At present, a dozen names are being considered to be appointed as new government officials, said the Taliban member. The News International further reported that earlier appointments in the new government will be made for the ministries of judiciary, internal security, defence, foreign affairs, finance, information and a special assignment for Kabul's affairs, Taliban member said. He further stated that the Taliban co-founder, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is present in the Afghan capital, while the Taliban Chief of Army, Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob has left Kandahar for Kabul, to have initial discussions on forming the government. On Saturday, the Taliban said that they have gained control over the three gates of Kabul Airport as the US forces wound down evacuations ahead of its August 31 deadline, as per Tolo News. Refuting the Taliban's claim, Pentagon said that the US military has "begun retrograding" from the Kabul airport and it's "still in charge of the airport" and the security. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that the US troops are "retrograding" from the Hamid Karzai International airport and noted that Washington is "still in charge of the airport" and the security, CNN reported.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/taliban-to-form-inclusive-caretaker-govt-in-afghanistan-says-groups-consultation-committee-member/articleshow/85729382.cms||---
---||World||Hurricane Ida strengthens, Louisiana braces for severe blow||NEW ORLEANS: Forecasters warned residents along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast to rush preparations Saturday ahead of an intensifying Hurricane Ida, which is expected to bring winds as high as 130 mph (209 kmph), life-threatening storm surge and flooding rain when it slams ashore in Louisiana on Sunday. The National Hurricane Center warned that super-warm Gulf waters could rapidly magnify Ida's destructive power, boosting it from a Category 2 storm to an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane in just 18 hours or less. Coastal highways saw heavy traffic Saturday as people moved to escape the storm's path. Trucks pulling saltwater fishing boats and campers streamed away from the coast Interstate 65 in south Alabama. Traffic jams clogged Interstate 10 heading out of New Orleans. ``We're going to catch it head-on,'' said Bebe McElroy as she prepared to leave her home in the coastal Louisiana village of Cocodrie. ``I'm just going around praying, saying, `Dear Lord, just watch over us.''' Ida was poised to strike Louisiana 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Mississippi and Louisiana coasts. A Category 3 storm, Katrina was blamed for 1,800 deaths and caused levee breaches and catastrophic flooding in New Orleans, which took years to recover. ``We're not the same state we were 16 years ago,'' Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday, pointing to a federal levee system that's seen major improvements since Katrina swamped New Orleans in 2005. ``This system is going to be tested,'' Edwards said. ``The people of Louisiana are going to be tested. But we are resilient and tough people. And we're going to get through this.'' Edwards said 5,000 National Guard troops were being staged in 14 parishes for search and rescue efforts with high-water vehicles, boats and helicopters. And 10,000 linemen were on standby to respond to electrical outages. A tropical depression two days earlier, Ida was strengthening so quickly that New Orleans officials said there was no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of the city's 390,000 residents, a task that would require coordinating with the state and neighboring locales to turn highways into one-way routes away from the city. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell called for a voluntary evacuation and reiterated Saturday that the time to safely leave was growing short. Collin Arnold, the city's emergency management director, said the city could be under high winds for about 10 hours. Officials warned those who stayed to be prepared for long power outages amid sweltering heat in the days ahead. Ramsey Green, the city's top infrastructure official, stressed that the levee and drainage systems protecting the city have been much improved since Katrina. ``That said, if we see 10 to 20 inches of rain over an abbreviated period of time, we will see flooding,'' he said. In Washington, President Joe Biden on Saturday called Ida ``very dangerous'' and urged Americans ``to pay attention and be prepared.'' Lines at gas pumps and car rental agencies grew long as residents and tourists alike prepared to leave Saturday. ``We were willing to wait it out but the hotel said we had to leave,'' said visitor Lays Lafaurie of Fort Worth, Texas, waiting in a rental car line at the city's airport. ``They said we had to leave by 7 tomorrow morning. But if we'd waited that long there wouldn't have been any cars left.'' Ida posed a threat far beyond New Orleans. A hurricane warning was issued for nearly 200 miles (320 kilometers) of Louisiana's coastline, from Intracoastal City south of Lafayette to the Mississippi state line. A tropical storm warning was extended to the Alabama-Florida line, and Mobile Bay in Alabama was under a storm surge watch. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency Saturday for the state's coastal and western counties, warning Ida could bring flooding and tornadoes there. In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves urged residents to stay off of interstate highways to make room for people fleeing Louisiana. He said 19 shelters had opened to take in evacuees. Several casinos on the Mississippi coast had closed ahead of Ida. Meteorologist Jeff Masters, who flew hurricane missions for the government and founded Weather Underground, said Ida is forecast to move through ``the just absolute worst place for a hurricane.'' The Interstate 10 corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is a critical hub of the nation's petrochemical industry, lined with oil refineries, natural gas terminals and chemical manufacturing plants. Entergy, Louisiana's major electricity provider, operates two nuclear power plants along the Mississippi River. A U.S. Energy Department map of oil and gas infrastructure shows scores of low-lying sites in the storm's projected path that are listed as potentially vulnerable to flooding. Phillips 66 said it was shutting operations at its refinery in Belle Chasse, Louisiana. Many gas stations in and around New Orleans were out of gas, and the few still open had lines more than a dozen cars deep. Mike Laurent of Marrero, Louisiana, was filling up about a dozen gas canisters to fuel his generator and those of friends and family. Laurent said his family planned to weather the storm at home despite concerns about whether the nearby levee would hold. ``I don't think it's ever been tested like it's going to be tested tomorrow or Monday,'' Laurent said. ``I bought a dozen life jackets, just in case.'' By Saturday afternoon, Ida was a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (168 kph) . The storm was centered about 325 miles (525 kilometers) southeast of coastal Houma, Louisiana, and was traveling northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Cuba started to clean up Saturday after Ida tore through Isla de la Juventud and then western parts of the mainland. The storm toppled trees and damaged crops and buildings. There were no reported deaths.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hurricane-ida-strengthens-louisiana-braces-for-severe-blow/articleshow/85729441.cms||---
---||Chennai||Form Tamil Nadu Press Council in three months: Madras high court to govt||CHENNAI: The Madras high court has set a three-month deadline for the state government to constitute a ‘Press Council of Tamil Nadu’, saying it is necessary to weed out fake journalists, mushrooming journalists’ associations/unions and to regulate distribution of identity cards, passes and other state doles. The council, to be headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court or a high court, shall comprise experienced journalists and retired civil servants, said a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice P Velmurugan. “The council shall have sole authority to recognise press clubs and journalists’ associations or unions in the state and it shall not allow or recognise formation or continuation of clubs or unions or associations based on caste, community or state boundaries,” the court said. This apart, the court made it clear that only the council should conduct and approve elections to journalists’ clubs, unions and associations. As an interim measure, they said that once the council was constituted all journalists’ associations in the state would be kept in suspended animation. Election could be conducted for those organisations under the supervision of the council, within six months thereafter, it said. To curtail the menace of fake journalists, the court said the council should have power to identify fake journalists and lodge complaints against them to jurisdictional police. The state is directed not to issue press stickers, identity cards and other benefits to journalists, unless the organisation or media house discloses the number of employees, salary paid, TDS details, tax paid to the government and proof that it sells a certain number of copies or has certain viewership, the bench said. The court has also prohibited the state from issuing identity cards and media stickers to organisations that have circulation of less than 10,000 copies. They issued these directions while hearing a public interest writ petition by S Sekaran. The court questioned his claims of being a journalist, after he, by mistake, furnished the copy of a suspended police officer’s identity card. Holding that the PIL might have been filed at the behest of the officer who was suspended in connection with an idol smuggling case, the bench expressed concerns over lack of accountability of journalists and absence of an effective watchdog.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/form-tamil-nadu-press-council-in-three-months-madras-high-court-to-govt/articleshow/85729444.cms||Suresh Kumar

He said the fishing harbour in Tuticorin would be desilted and deepened at Rs5 crore. “Protecting the welfare and traditional fishing rights of the fishermen is the top priority of this government. It is also the intention of the government to get the national commission for fishermen welfare for safeguarding the welfare of marine and inland fishermen,” said the minister. The government would establish an advanced multispeciality hospital and research centre for pets at Nandanam at Rs7.99 crore. It would also document the native breed dogs, the minister said. The government would encourage Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Science University to undertake research for the betterment of livestock, poultry and food sector in the state. Kolathur to get ornamental fish trade centreThe government would establish an international standard ornamental fish trade centre at Kolathur in Chennai at Rs50 crore cost, minister for fisheries-fishermen welfare and animal husbandry Anitha R Radhakrishnan told the state assembly on Saturday. The trade centre would be established with contribution from government and private players.

---||Nagpur||Covid, death of 3-month-old leaves Pak Hindu family straddling the border||Nagpur: Birth of a son brought happiness for Sagar Kukreja, a Pakistani Hindu living in Jalgaon, who had been going through a tough time due to the lockdown. However, the joy was short-lived. The three-month-old baby died on August 21, throwing into disarray the family’s plans to return to Pakistan and make a fresh start. One crisis had brought them to India 16 years ago, and another was forcing them to return. Thirty-year-old Sagar had come to India as a teenager, from Kashmore town of Sindh province. He took up work instead of studies to support his family here, as it was difficult to make ends meet at that time. Their situation improved a bit with earnings from a mobile phone shop. However, the lockdown hit their fortunes hard, and the family was planning to go back and seek opportunity in Pakistan, where they have some relatives. Kukreja’s family today includes his old parents, wife and a child. Their application for Indian citizenship remains pending. They were planning to go back on a no-objection return to India (NORI) visa. This allows Long-Term Visa (LTV) holders to stay for three months in Pakistan. The plan was to keep open the option of returning to India if things did not work out, or continue staying there and let the LTV expire. Kukreja had been waiting for the second child to be born, so that a Pakistani passport could be obtained for him and the family could go back. Four days ago, their three-month-old son Lakshya, who was not keeping well since over a week, died. Sagar and his wife are cursing themselves for neglecting the child. “We were too engaged in getting all the papers right to leave for Pakistan. In the hurry, we neglected the child’s health,” says Sagar. His wife Rekha agrees, saying they had been so distressed that returning to Pakistan seemed to be the only option before them. The child’s death has shattered them completely. But now they have dropped the plans of returning to Pakistan, fearing for the health of their other son Jeevan, who is one-and-a-half years old. The family is now appealing to officials that they be granted Indian citizenship at the earliest. Kukreja says they are ready to give up the Pakistani passports. He has requested that the minimum five-year stay norm for getting citizenship be relaxed for his wife, who came to India three years ago. “We had gone to Delhi to get the passport for Lakshya when he was one-and-a-half month old. Again we had planned another trip as my wife’s passport had to be renewed. The child was not well, having cough and fever. The doctor said there was nothing to worry. We were supposed to leave on August 21, but the child died that day,” he said. “All of us were too busy gathering papers to finish the formalities, and ended up neglecting the child’s health, assuming he would be fine on his own,” says a repentant Kukreja. This is just one more heartbreaking story TOI has come across of people torn apart on two sides of the border due to the pandemic. In April, the borders were closed due to the Covid protocol, leaving people stranded on both sides. This has been happening since the first wave. Borders have opened from time to time, with more people crossing over to the other side and getting stranded. Ajit Nagdev reaches Pakistan Ajit Nagdev, a Hindu from Pakistan about whom TOI had reported has finally reached Pakistan on Saturday. He crossed the border along with some other stranded persons. Nagdev’s was also a story of a family stranded across the border due to Covid. He was trying for his return since April. Before his exit could be cleared, his wife Rekha Kumari died of a kidney ailment while undergoing treatment in Nagpur. The family was living at Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh and Ajit, who ran a small garment business, ran into bad times due to the lockdown and was wanting to return to Pakistan and join his relatives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/covid-death-of-3-month-old-leaves-pak-hindu-family-straddling-the-border/articleshow/85723539.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee exhorts students to get ready to battle ‘goli & gali sarkar’||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday called upon students and youths to gear up for an all-out battle against a “goli and gali sarkar” that has put the country “up for sale”. “This BJP government is selling out the coal sector, railway stations and trains, LIC, GIC, National Insurance, SAIL, Air India and what not. They may one day ask for your body parts and put them on sale,” Banerjee said, while addressing Trinamool Chhatra Parishad workers on the outfit’s foundation day. She accused the BJP of putting the “anti-national” tag on those who criticized the Centre. “On the contrary, candidates applying for CISF recruitment are asked to write about Delhi riots. They are trying to brainwash the security forces right from recruitment. This divide and rule policy was never adopted by security forces,” the CM said, expecting a PIL on the matter. “The BJP has two works in hand. One is to stifle the democratic voice (goli) and the other is to spread misinformation and a pack of lies (gali) against opponents. I contest the Covid figures dished out by the Gujarat government. It is dubious,” Banerjee said, saying she was “ready to die fighting like a lioness” against the BJP. The CM pointed out how the Centre was “depriving” states in terms of devolution of funds from the common revenue pool. “States are being deprived of their GST share, coal royalty and others. I will arrange a conference of CMs soon. This is continuing in every sphere. The MPLAD scheme has been stalled. Government employees are facing a day’s salary cut. And what about petrol/diesel prices? Ask housewives about Ujala gas price? It is taking away a hefty sum from the month’s income,” Banerjee said, juxtaposing these with her government’s initiatives that could bring down the state population living below poverty line to below 40%. “The state government has set up 68 industrial parks. There are plans to set up a data research centre. The government has given 200 acres to them. The Bantala Leather Complex can engage five lakh people alone. We have set up 540 MSME clusters and 90 lakh MSME units. Raghunathpur in Purulia will fetch investments of Rs 72,000 crore. Mining at the Deocha Pachami coal block will meet the state’s electricity demand at cheaper rates,” she said. Banerjee also showcased how her government was spending for the welfare of women, Adivasis, SCs, STs and also those from the general category. “Kanysharee is a big hit. Girls are no more a burden to their parents in Bengal. The state government has started giving Rs 10 lakh credit cards to students,” she said. The Bengal CM then took a dig at the BJP-led government in Tripura over the “raw deal” to teachers. “Before assuming office, BJP promised permanent jobs to these teachers. Now in government, they have dismissed those teachers. Even payment of salaries to government employees in Tripura, Assam and Gujarat have become irregular,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mamata-exhorts-students-to-get-ready-to-battle-goli-gali-sarkar/articleshow/85725787.cms||---
---||Kolkata||The Game-Changers||Kolkata: With social distancing becoming the ‘new normal’ since 2020, the pandemic has acted as a catalyst to spur a wave of innovations and accelerated the adoption of future technologies to design and build more resilient systems. In the changed tech order, “home-grown” IT firms in the city have rapidly gained a strong foothold. These firms are not only finding business avenues by assisting enterprises with customized solutions, they are prompting many to start their own startups. With the mushrooming of several IT firms at Salt Lake’s Sector V, New Town and Bantala, the computing environment has also transformed into a more distributed one. The other difference, says management consultant and IT expert Ambarish Dasgupta, is the need for different types of emerging IT applications or hardware to keep pace with the changing trends. Ambarish Dasgupta “As the delivery model is getting more distributed — be it global or within India — with work from home turning every home into a node of delivery, small firms that don’t have sprawling workspace and massive staff strength are getting a more prominent role as one vital cog in the wheel of software delivery. Big IT firms are creating an ecosystem of such players for catering to their clients,” said Dasgupta. Tapan BarmanMihup Communications, situated at Millennium City IT Park, embarked on its journey in 2016. The leading conversational artificial intelligence platform — equipped with speech to text engine, natural language processor and dialogue processor — was founded by Tapan Barman, Sandipan Chattopadhyay and Biplab Chakraborty. The services are available in Bengali, Hindi, English and Tamil. “We are offering three B2B SAAS (business-to-business, software-as-a-service) products. So far, our solutions pertain to cases in media and entertainment, consumer electronics, Internet of Things, retail, e-commerce, automotive, baking, financial services and insurance, among others. Some of our clients include leading brands like Tata Motors, Swiggy, Panasonic, Hyundai and the Indian National Congress,” said Barman. Rajendra SeksariaIn 2001, city-based Rajendra Seksaria had come up with Balaji Solutions, which has metamorphosed into a leading hardware distribution house in the country, working with various global brands. Riding on this success, he launched the IT and electronics brand Foxin in 2006. “We have catered to brands like Dell, Lenovo and Canon. Having commenced operations on a small scale, we are operating 25 offices and 95 service centres with 650 employees across the country. We look forward to expanding our operations to Nepal, Bangladesh and Dubai,” said Seksaria. Sumant Bhutoria Sumant Bhutoria, an MS in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, set up Alfatek Systems, providing hardware and IT solutions in the field of 3D bio-printing, organ fabrication and tissue culture. “The 3D bio-printing that we deal with is part of our IT solutions and we have gradually expanded our presence to more than 100 Indian labs, both in pharma industry and academia,” Bhutoria said. Souvik MajumdarBootstrapped in 2014 by IIT Kharagpur and IIM Lucknow alumnus Souvik Majumdar, GroSum provides employee performance management solutions that help organisations ramp up the process of hiring employees and augmenting their performance. “Given the changing dynamics of the workplace, the pandemic has induced remote operations and rapid tech intervention while managing the performance of employees in an inclusive manner has become crucial,” said Majumdar. The city-based firm has catered to over 175 organisations across the country, West Asia and South East Asia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/the-game-changers/articleshow/85727017.cms||Sarthak.G
---||Kolkata||Shukla murder case: Fourth shooter held||Kolkata: A fourth sharpshooter was arrested by a special team of the Bengal CID for the murder of BJP leader Manish Shukla. Accused Manish Singh has been brought to Kolkata on transit remand and will be questioned by the CID in the presence of the three other shooters, including Anish Thakur, who was nabbed in Chennai. The CID had earlier received permission from a local court to question Singh, who was lodged in a Haryana jail for a robbery. Originally from Vaishali in Bihar, Singh is part of the dreaded gangster team led by Subodh Singh. Palwal police had arrested him recently in a case lodged in 2013, said sources. While his recent criminal activities were being investigated, Singh accepted his involvement in the Titagarh murder on October 4 last year. The CID had in January filed a chargesheet naming 11 accused (three of them sharpshooters) but had kept options open for a complimentary chargesheet. The agency has named 12 others as “still under probe for their suspected role” and Singh is believed to be one of them. “If we find that these suspects do indeed have a role in the case, we will file a supplementary chargesheet,” said a CID officer. Besides Singh and Thakur, the other shooters named by CID were nabbed in Punjab. The accused have been charged under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy), among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/shukla-murder-case-fourth-shooter-held/articleshow/85725823.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||The Preferred Destination||Kolkata: Information technology biggies like Infosys, Wipro and ITC Infotech are making a beeline for Bengal to set up state-of-the-art campuses, showing the human capital-rich state’s adeptness to provide ‘plug-and-play’ infrastructure for the knowledge industry. Debashis Sen, chairman of Hidco, NKDA and NDITA, feels Bengal can boast two important components vital for building and sustaining any IT infrastructure — seamless power and Internet connectivity. “The state nodal body, Webel, has created over a dozen IT parks across Bengal; the most prominent ones being Sector V and New Town hubs that provide an advanced ecosystem for cutting-edge applications such as blockchain, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). Software Technology Park (STPI) and SEZs produce software exports and projects worth millions of dollars,” said Sen, who has also served as the IT secretary. Government data shows as many as 27 companies are setting up units in New Town’s FinTech Hub and an investment of more than Rs 13,000 crore is in the offing at Bengal Silicon Valley. Amitabh Ray, MD of Ericsson Global Services India, which operates one of the critical centres in New Town, said: “What helps us is the general IT infrastructure and availability of good talent.” As Bengal has provision for a large number of agriculture-oriented jobs, introduction of new technology can enhance the sector’s productivity and efficiency, Ray said. In recent years, the finest interventions in the IT domain have been made by Hidco in New Town with its FinTech Hub, Bengal Silicon Valley Hub, co-working spaces, and pay-per-hour Working Pods. The state government is also striving to transform Bantala, on the Basanti Highway, into a complete IT city, shelving leather hub plans there. Kalyan Kar, vice-president of Sector V Stakeholders’ Association, lauded the government’s aim to decongest Kolkata (a major problem with IT city Bengaluru) with the formation of multiple IT hubs across Bengal. “The initiative has not only encouraged local IT entrepreneurs but also distributed IT capabilities among them. Secondly, broadband penetration across tier II and III cities, along with district towns, has improved substantially,” he said. In some areas, however, steady bandwidth supply remains a spot of bother, like in the Hills. The proposed cable landing station, off Bay of Bengal, could be a strategic solution, turning Bengal into a feeder for the east and northeast. “We also need to focus on setting up more data centres. Covid-19 has created an opportunity where local talent can show their capabilities without needing to migrate,” Kar said. Apart from physical infrastructure, Bengal also needs to have year-long global connectivity, an IT education framework, and a conducive business and social ecosystem in place. According to industry, a solid policy framework may go a long way in encouraging entrepreneurs to launch startups. “The steps being taken are in the right direction. A public-private joint initiative can catapult the state to the top among all South Asian countries,” Sen said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/the-preferred-destination/articleshow/85726236.cms||Sovon Manna
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Protests over action against students rock Visva-Bharati||SANTINIKETAN: Campus protests erupted at Visva-Bharati on Saturday against the rustication of three students. A dharna was held near the official residence of vice chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty. Students raised slogans near the main gate and wrote graffiti against the VC. The trio, who were part of the agitation, were initially suspended for eight months and then rusticated for three years for alleged indiscipline. At least two professors have also been suspended on similar charges in other incidents. A makeshift tent erected on Friday night was turned into a bigger pandal to accommodate more students and Visva Bharati University Faculty Association (VBUFA)-linked teachers, who have supported the stir. Security arrangements were beefed up at ‘Purbita’, the VC’s official residence. Somnath Sou, one of the three rusticated students, said it was not clear why the action was taken. “Some of the members of so-called inquiry committee are themselves accused in various cases. We wanted to submit our explanation but they didn’t allow us to. Moreover, the university committee couldn’t file any chargesheet against us. They didn’t issue any show-cause either or follow any formal rule. They have taken action against us on the basis of unknown eyewitnesses,” he said. VBUFA president Sudipto Bhattacharya, who is currently under suspension, said teachers have extended active support to the protests initiated by the student body. “Our members will take part in a dharna and other programmes. We want to save Visva-Bharati,” he said. A senior university official said: “Since the beginning of Visva-Bharati, a section of people with vested interests always try to create anarchy in the name of agitation. Almost all previous vice chancellors had the same experience. This is another attempt but we are bound by the statute of the university.” Tensions have been rising at V-B for the last two years over dismissals and suspensions of both students and teachers. A number of complaints have been lodged at Bolpur police station and cases are pending in Calcutta High Court. The vice chancellor’s initiative to regain encroached land of the university also caused resentment among a section of Santiniketan residents. In the last assembly election campaign at Bolpur, V-B was made an issue by both Trinamool and BJP. Left parties and TMC had alleged that during Chakraborty’s tenure, there was an attempt to ‘saffronize’ Visva Bharati. Left students’ unions organized ‘solidarity rallies’ at different universities across the state over the last two days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/protests-over-action-against-students-rock-visva-bharati/articleshow/85726006.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Targeting me, my family & party will backfire, says West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: The brazen use of agencies like the ED and the CBI would not be able to save the BJP from voters’ ire, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said on Saturday while launching a counter-attack against the Centre hours after Trinamool all-India general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and his wife, Rujira, got ED notices as part of the agency’s probe into the alleged coal scam. Mamata, while addressing Trinamool Chhatra Parishad workers on the outfit’s foundation day, called the central government “demonic” and “inhuman” and taunted the BJP for its shameless use of central agencies after being overwhelmingly rejected by Bengal’s voters in this year’s assembly polls. “They (BJP) send the CBI and the ED when they cannot match us politically,” she added. Mamata singled out Union home minister Amit Shah. “I have a list of Shah’s men who checked in at the East West Hotel in Asansol. Everyone knows who runs it,” she said, adding that targeting her, her family and Trinamool leaders could be counter-productive. “I too have a dossier on some of your (BJP) leaders involved in scams and scandals but have never used them,” she said. Her nephew and Diamond Harbour MP, Abhishek, said he and the Trinamool would meet the challenge head-on. “Browbeating us will not help. We will go to every state where the BJP has stifled democracy. The battle has started in Tripura and Assam. Our leader, Mamata Banerjee, has not yet gone to Tripura. There will be an earthquake when she sets foot there,” he said. “Fight Abhishek politically. Instead, you have fished out a rat from your pocket without knowing that the rat has made holes in your pocket. I know who makes the draft and who dictates it. Why target the Trinamool and Lalu Prasad only?” the CM said. “We need donations to fight elections. We would not have needed it had the Election Commission set up a common fund for all parties. I want to know how you got thousands of crores from electoral bonds. From where did the money for the PM Cares Fund come? Engage the ED,” the CM said, adding that she had never come across such “vindictive politics” in her life. “It’s a demonic and inhuman government. Where is the NHRC team in Tripura when Trinamool men are attacked? Where was the NHRC during the Hathras incident in Uttar Pradesh? Why are BJP leaders accompanying the CBI team probing post-poll violence in Bengal? The person who submitted the report to the court too is a BJP man,” the Mamata said. The CM also pointed out how the BJP was packing boards of several education institutes, including Visva-Bharati, with its own people. “Students should keep in mind that it is not just Visva-Bharati. They have packed boards of many other education institutes with their own people. And the governor blackmails the state government saying he will not approve state government choices till we approve people he nominates,” she alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/targeting-me-my-family-party-will-backfire-didi/articleshow/85726660.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Enforcement Directorate calls Abhishek Banerjee, wife; WB CM Mamata Banerjee says BJP uses agencies after poll loss||NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate has summoned Trinamool Congress all-India general secretary and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, and his wife, Rujira, to join investigations in an alleged money-laundering scam. Abhishek, also the party’s Diamond Harbour MP, has been asked by the ED to appear for questioning on September 6; his wife has been summoned on September 1. Some other close associates of Abhishek have also been summoned though ED sources were tight-lipped about their identity. Vinay Mishra, who was allegedly instrumental in arranging ‘proceeds of crime’ from illegal coal-mining in the state, has fled to Vanuatu and renounced his Indian citizenship to escape the agencies investigating the scam, officials said. ED officials claimed Rujira was facing serious charges; the agency told a special PMLA court here earlier that ‘proceeds of crime’ from illegal coal mining to the tune of Rs 168 crore were allegedly sent out of the country through hawala channels to accounts controlled by her in Thailand and London. The ED arrested Bankura police station in-charge inspector Ashok Kumar Mishra in April. In its remand application before a special court here, the agency had claimed that the officer was involved in collecting unaccounted cash from associates of a local coal mafia, Anup Majhi. “The transactions (of Thailand and London) were related to Rujira Banerjee,” ED had told the special court while seeking remand of Ashok Mishra. The CBI, which registered a case in November last year, has already questioned Rujira in this case. Coal mafia Majhi is the prime suspect in the alleged Rs-1,300 crore money-laundering scam but the agency has been restrained by the Supreme Court from taking any “coercive” action against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ed-calls-abhishek-wife-cm-says-bjp-uses-agencies-after-poll-loss/articleshow/85726615.cms||---

According to police, around Rs 19 lakh of unaccounted money was traced to officer Ramkrishna Mohanti’s account. The cops have frozen Mohanti’s eight bank accounts that have seen accumulation of large sums of money but very little withdrawals. Three persons — including Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, who was a member of the first Mamata Banerjee cabinet and chairman of the municipality, have so far been arrested. The development came on a day Mukherjee was admitted to Bishnupur Hospital after he complained of uneasiness. The former minister is said to be suffering from high blood pressure-related ailments. He is likely to be produced at Bankura subdivisional court on Sunday after the expiry of three days of further police custody since his arrest last week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/1-more-bishnupur-municipality-staffer-arrested-in-tender-corruption-case/articleshow/85725737.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Kolkata||BJP defends probes by central agencies||Kolkata: The Bengal BJP on Saturday took a dig at chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s “flip-flop” on investigations by central agencies. “People know how many times Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee had demanded a CBI probe during the Left Front regime in the state. Things changed after she came to power. Now, any investigation by a central agency is being looked upon as a political vendetta,” said BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya in the wake of the CM’s criticism of the Union government following summons to Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee and his wife in connection with the coal scam. Bhattacharya, however, reserved his comment on the ED investigation. “People are sick and tired of the political vendetta complaint. Whenever central agencies become active, Trinamool leaders call it political vendetta. Again, when the investigation slows down, others point to a Didi-Modi game. I don’t want to add to public disgust on this issue,” he said. The state BJP said the CM was welcome to find proof against its leaders whose involvement in various scams she claimed. “If she has the names and the papers, she can send them to the ED for investigation,” Bhattacharya said. On the court-ordered CBI inquiry into post-poll violence, the spokesperson said: “Those murdered happen to be BJP workers, but the death certificates, the autopsy reports and the FIRs were all readied by the state administration. The CM, by casting aspersions on the CBI inquiry, is actually denying reports by her own administration.” Without actually mentioning the National Monetisation Pipeline, Bhattacharya rubbished the CM’s allegation that the Centre was putting the country up for sale. “There is a difference between selling and leasing. One needs to understand the same. The Bengal CM had tried a similar policy with Metro Dairy, Dunlop India, Jessop and Durgapur Chemicals. It is another matter that in many cases, there were no takers,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bjp-defends-probes-by-central-agencies/articleshow/85725757.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: In its first post-poll violence arrests, CBI nets 2 in Nadia||KOLKATA/NADIA: The CBI on Saturday arrested two persons in connection with the alleged murder of BJP worker Dharma Mandal in Nadia’s Chapra. These are the first arrests made by the central agency since Calcutta High Court asked it to probe cases of post-poll violence in Bengal. The CBI has also initiated 10 more FIRs, raising the total number of cases to 21. CBI sources said accused Bijoy Ghosh and Asima Ghosh, both members of Hridaypur gram panchayat, were present in the village on May 14, the day Mandal died. They will be presented before a special CBI court on Sunday. In his complaint, the victim’s brother Ayan claimed that some people were beating up a relative when Mandal intervened. He was attacked with a sharp weapon by one Ujjal Ghosh and he suffered fatal injuries. Ayan alleged that their family were being targeted since the poll results were declared on May 2 because of their association with BJP. Chapra MLA Rukbanur Rahman said the name of Bijoy and Asima did not figure in the FIR. “Those originally named have all been arrested. Later, the CBI included more names. We want the accused to be arrested, but people will not allow harassment,” Rahman added. On Saturday, the CBI team faced resistance from local residents when they reached Chapra. The team was carrying out searches at 15 locations in connection with the Mandal case. It is alleged that the tyres of the CBI car were punctured. “One of the CBI officers criticised the Duare Sarkar scheme and people reacted,” the local MLA said. However, BJP’s Nadia north convener Arjun Biswas said the team was attacked when it tried to make arrests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/in-its-first-post-poll-violence-arrests-cbi-nets-2-in-nadia/articleshow/85725961.cms||Rohit Khanna

Some people were supposed to join Trinamool too,” he said. Ghosh and party MP Shantanu Sen had rushed to Bandharghat soon after addressing a gathering near the circuit house in Agartala. “BJP hoodlums mobbed Trinamool member Mujibur Rahman’s house and ransacked it.

Overall, 15 districts, including Chennai, Thanjavur and Trichy, reported an increase in new cases compared to their Friday tally. Districts such as Coimbatore, Tenkasi and Kanyakumari, sharing borders with Kerala, continued to report the same number of cases. The sharpest increase was seen in Chennai, where new cases went up to 182 compared to 162 on Friday. Coimbatore, which reported 230 cases on Saturday was the only district to report more than 200 new cases in the state. After Coimbatore and Chennai, Chengalpet (122) reported the highest number of cases. “Some districts are reporting a marginal increase in cases almost every day. Besides Coimbatore, Chennai, Chengalpet and Erode, where new cases are not dropping below 100, we are concerned about high incidence in Thanjavur and neighbouring delta districts,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. On Saturday, Thanjavur reported an increase to 77 from 58 cases it reported on Friday.

---||India||The Janmashtami menu is a feast of Indian superfoods||From kuttu to makhane, many ingredients traditionally served to devotees are now prized for the nutritive valueGrowing up in Lucknow, my memories of Janmashtami are of homely celebrations, when we used all our creative skills and limited resources to make tableaux depicting the land of Braj and the stormy dark night when Lord Krishna was supposed to have been born at midnight on the ashtami of the monsoon month Shravan. As we hunted for blue chalk or rangoli powder to depict the Yamuna in full spate and plucked greens from the garden to make the forest land alongside, a steady stream of festive goodies dotted the hours. This was fasting food that was more akin to feasting to mark the festival. In fact, Janmashtami was the only fast that children were supposed to keep, and that is perhaps because it was more joyful than austere, and the foods that were cooked were prized for their nutritive value in keeping with ritualistic foods around birth. If you look at traditional Janmashtami food, both the fasting foods eaten in the day and the prasad, eaten after the fast has concluded with a midnight pooja, you will find strong parallels with postpartum rituals in Indian homes, when highly nutritious seeds, panjeeri with gond (gum), “warming” foods cooked in ghee and milk with mild and good-for-gut spices such as fennel and coriander seeds are fed to the new, lactating mother, in keeping with the tenets of Ayurveda. Many of these ingredients are today counted as superfoods and nutritionists regularly urge people to include them in their regular diets. TRADITION AND FOOD: The favourite festival dishes include kuttu or buck-wheat flour puris (below) and kheer with lotus seeds and chironjee with flavours of figs and raisinsA distinct Janmashtami food tradition involves the use of seeds in the prasad offerings. Traditionally, in UP and Delhi, thals of chironjee, dried melon seeds, and makhane or lotus seeds are set by lightly roasting these in ghee and then crystallising with a thin chashni or sugar syrup. Wedges can be cut, stored and eaten long after the festival. Chironjee is one of those lesser-known ingredients of ancient India that we seem to be forgetting. No equivalent exists globally, as is evident from the fact that there is no English name for this small brownred nut that the Mughal emperor Babur struggled to describe in his memoirs: “A thing between the walnut and the almond. Not bad!” he writes in Baburnama. Chironjee is also an important ingredient used in the kheer cooked on Janmashtami for lunch for fasting devotees, who do not eat anna or grain. Instead of rice, chironjee and makhane or lotus seeds are cooked in milk. The kheer is further accented with dried figs or chuvara and raisins to give us the quintessential Janmashtami mewa ki kheer, not cooked at any other time of the year. Lotus seeds or fox nuts of course have been enjoying a new bout of millennial popularity as a superfood full of calcium and magnesium to keep hunger at bay and help fashionable dieters feel full despite eating fewer calories. Fasting people perhaps found it similarly invaluable as a snack roasted in ghee. Lotus in any case has been a ritualistically revered plant in India, with food historian KT Achaya noting that it was common practice in ancient Indian homes to grow lotus in water tanks meant for purifying drinking water, since the Buddha remarked that water meant for drinking should be clear, cool, shining like silver and with the smell of lotus. Another ingredient that has become fashionable with foodies seeking glutenfree alternatives to wheat flour is buckwheat or kuttu, from which fasting Indians have traditionally fashioned pooris and pakoris to eat with watery potato gravy or yoghurt when they eschewed grains. Kuttu, in fact, is a wonder ingredient even in a cuisine such as Japanese, used to make soba noodles, and lately it has been used by chefs and food companies for gluten-free snacks and pasta. In villages of UP, Haryana and Rajasthan, a special Janmashtami tradition is the dhaniya ki panjeeri, an acquired taste for many. For the conventional atta panjeeri, whole wheat flour is roasted in ghee until its aroma fills the kitchen, and sugar, dried fruits, edible gum are added. To make this as a fasting food, roasted and ground coriander seeds replace the flour. But, Sneh Yadav of Tijara Farms gives another rationale for the use of coriander seeds. During the monsoon, coriander is supposed to cleanse the digestive system and keep diseases at bay. Many of our ritualistic foods obviously incorporate ingredients with seasonal therapeutic value in accordance as prescribed by Ayurveda. Finally, ritualistic worship concludes with panchamrita, part of the prasad on Janmashtami. Made from five supposedly ambrosial (amrit) ingredientshoney, milk, curd, ghee and sugar — panchamrita is a modern-day equivalent of the ancient madhuparka (KT Achaya, The Illustrated Foods of India), offered as an auspicious drink on solemn occasions. Its making and ritualistic use is apparently set out in Ashvalayana Grihya-Sutra, Achaya mentions. Interestingly, this was also the first liquid to be placed on the lips of a newborn baby, in ancient India. Fitting, for a festival that celebrates a birth.

Toy train 52541 will leave from New Jalpaiguri while train 52540 will leave from Darjeeling. Timings will be notified soon. There will be 17 seats in the first class and 29 in the general coach. Passengers will have to observe all preventive measures and guidelines for Covid-19 during the journey. Earlier in the week, the 16km steam heritage joyride between Darjeeling and Ghoom via Batasia Loop had been restored. The trains on the route have since been running packed. Trains between Siliguri and Darjeeling were suspended in July 2019 following a landslide in Tindharia. Even after the tracks were repaired, Covid restrictions didn’t allow resumption of services. Built in 1889, the DHR is a Unesco world heritage site and a major tourist attraction in Darjeeling.

Addressing the large gathering, Sanjay vowed to liberate the state from “family and dictatorial rule” of K Chandrasekhar Rao and usher in a democratic government. Kicking off his 55-day padayatra from the AIMIM’s bastion of Old City in the presence of national and state leaders, Sanjay said the BJP was the only party that would work for Hindu dharma and make every Hindu proud. Sanjay said BJP’s aim was to oust a party (read AIMIM) with a “Taliban-like mindset” and those who align with it. Seeking a response from the crowd, he roared: “You want a party of workers who support the Taliban or a party that works for people of Telangana?” Bandi challenges CM to organise Shobha yatra from Old CityAs loud slogans of ‘Bharat mata ki jai’, ‘Jai Hind’ and ‘Jai Sri Ram’ rent the air, Bandi Sanjay said: “Whose adda is pata basthi (Old City)? Telangana is our state. We can come to any street... we can come to any corner.” Claiming that the BJP had never opposed Muslim festivals like Eid or Bakrid or Iftar parties, he wondered: “Has any AIMIM leader ever welcomed Ganesh Shobha Yatra? KCR has criticised Hindus as thugs.” Throwing a challenge to the CM, he said: “If you are really a Hindu, do you have the guts to organise Shobha Yatra and Hanuman Jayanti from the Old City.” Party workers decorated the surroundings of the Charminar with BJP hoardings, flexis and saffron flags. Before Sanjay hit the road for his padayatra, he took the blessings of goddess Bhagyalakshmi at the temple. He said his padayatra was aimed at forming a democratic and ‘pro-poor’ government in the state. “My yatra will send shock waves through the government. The TRS president cheated the people by making false promises during the elections and confines himself to his Erravelli farmhouse,” the BJP leader said. Lashing out at TRS, Sanjay said: “Telangana state was achieved because of the sacrifices of thousands of people. But, only one family is ruling and no section of the people is happy with the governance in the past seven years. Time has come to boot out the government.” He said the TRS had promised to extend unemployment allowance to the youth but failed to implement the same for the past three years. Over 25 lakh people had registered themselves with TSPSC but job notifications were a far cry. “KCR was responsible for the suicides of several unemployed youth. Even RTC workers and Intermediate students died by suicides during TRS ruling.” He said KCR was now talking about Dalit Bandhu scheme. “But, where is 125-ft Ambedkar statue as promised? Instead of the statue, he constructed Pragati Bhavan with 100 rooms. What happened to the Dalit CM promise after achieving Telangana state,” he wondered. Sanjay will resume his yatra from Mehdipatnam on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telangana-bjp-president-bandi-sanjay-kumar-begins-yatra-amidst-big-show-hits-out-at-cm-k-chandrasekhar-rao/articleshow/85729588.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||ED attaches Rs 363 crore assets of Hyderabad-based MBS Jewellers||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate has attached 45 immovable properties worth Rs 363 crore of MBS Jewellers Private Limited, MBS Impex Private Limited and its promoters for allegedly defrauding Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC) Limited of Rs 504 crore. MBS Group promoters — Sukesh Gupta, Anurag Gupta, Neetu Gupta and Vandana Gupta — and their other group entities were booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The ED initiated money laundering investigation on the basis of an FIR lodged by CBI, Hyderabad branch, against Sukesh and his companies for defrauding MMTC Ltd in purchase of gold bullion under the buyer’s credit scheme. MBS Group and Sukesh’s counsel Herur Rajesh Kumar said despite a high court stay, the ED had issued the attachment order which was a violation of the stay order. ED alleges Sukesh’s firms continued to lift gold from MMTCThe ED alleged: “Sukesh in active connivance with a few officials of MMTC Hyderabad had continuously lifted gold without forex cover and without adequate security deposits. His dues were consistently misreported to the MMTC head office and without squaring off the existing losses.” It further said: “His firms continued to lift gold from MMTC Ltd for their personal gain. This has caused a loss of public money to the tune of Rs 504 crore, including an interest of Rs 277 crore to MMTC Ltd.” During its investigation, the ED found that on the basis of his business profile, Sukesh took loans, struck real estate deals and expanded his business. “All through the investigation, the conduct of Sukesh has been evasive and non-cooperative. He has also failed to discharge the burden of proof imposed on him under the PMLA,” it said. In another case under FEMA, the ED adjudicated and levied a penalty of Rs 222 crore on MBS Group. Sukesh had also entered into a one-time settlement (OTS) with MMTC Ltd in 2019. But, as per the latest reports from MMTC Ltd, Sukesh did not deposit any funds and the OTS didn’t fructify. The CBI had first filed a chargesheet against Sukesh and others in 2014.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ed-attaches-rs-363-crore-assets-of-mbs-jewellers/articleshow/85729627.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Here's all you need to know- A series of urgent terror warnings have rattled evacuation efforts overseen by US forces, who have been forced into closer security cooperation with the Taliban to prevent a repeat of Thursday's carnage at one of the facility's main access gates. In a security alert the US Embassy in Kabul said, US citizens should avoid traveling to the airport and avoid all airport gates at this time. It specifically noted the South (Airport Circle) gate, the new Ministry of the Interior, and the gate near the Panjshir Petrol station on the northwest side of the airport. The Pentagon said the remaining contingent of US forces at the airport, now numbering fewer than 4,000, had begun their final withdrawal ahead of Biden's deadline for ending the evacuation on Tuesday. After getting briefed on a US drone mission in eastern Afghanistan that the Pentagon said killed two members of the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate early Saturday, Biden said the extremists can expect more. Earlier Saturday US President Joe Biden warned that his military commanders believed a fresh attack could come "in the next 24-36 hours", calling the situation "extremely dangerous". Scores of Afghan civilians and 13 American troops were killed Thursday in the bombing claimed by the regional Islamic State-Khorasan group.

It specifically noted the South (Airport Circle) gate, the new Ministry of the Interior, and the gate near the Panjshir Petrol station on the northwest side of the airport. The Pentagon said the remaining contingent of US forces at the airport, now numbering fewer than 4,000, had begun their final withdrawal ahead of Biden's deadline for ending the evacuation on Tuesday. After getting briefed on a US drone mission in eastern Afghanistan that the Pentagon said killed two members of the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate early Saturday, Biden said the extremists can expect more. Earlier Saturday US President Joe Biden warned that his military commanders believed a fresh attack could come "in the next 24-36 hours", calling the situation "extremely dangerous". Scores of Afghan civilians and 13 American troops were killed Thursday in the bombing claimed by the regional Islamic State-Khorasan group.

Meanwhile, Hyderabad with 133.84 cameras per square mile is ranked fourth among Indian cities according to Comparitech data. Comparitech in its research has added a new feature of measuring CCTVs coverage per square mile in the cities across the world. In India, after Delhi, it is Chennai and Mumbai, which have maximum number of cameras per square mile. However, when it comes to CCTVs per 1,000 persons, as per Comparitech data, Hyderabad is among the 20 most surveilled city in the world and second in India. Hyderabad has 36.52 cameras per 1,000 persons. In Hyderabad, there are 3.75 lakh CCTVs. If Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates are considered it will be nearly 5 lakhs CCTVs. Delhi has the highest cameras in the country with 5,51,500 CCTVs. Since 2015, as part of Nenu Saitham initiative, Telangana police have been encouraging the residents of the colonies and business establishments to set up CCTVs for better security, which will help security officials to solve the crime easily and quickly. Ever since the drive to set up CCTVs were taken up in city, most of the cases were solved by the police using this footage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyderabad-fourth-in-india-in-cctvs-per-square-mile/articleshow/85729771.cms||---
---||India||A ruling that guaranteed digital freedom of speech||By: Arghya Sengupta & Lalit PandaIndia’s ambitions of being a technological superpower in the 21st century received its biggest fillip on March 24, 2015. Till that day, its ambitions were being fuelled by the innovativeness of entrepreneurs and unstinted support of the political class that was committed, across party lines, to the lofty objective of creating a ‘Digital India’. But, as is often the case, the legal framework was behind the curve. Emblematic of its retrograde nature was the Information Technology Act. A law that was meant to promote IT had been written, wittingly or unwittingly, to achieve the opposite effect—to allow policing of conversations on the internet, arrest persons with inconvenient views and constrain the animal spirits of our entrepreneurs instead of unleashing them. Particularly egregious was Section 66A, which criminalised communications that were “grossly offensive” or aimed at causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, insult, injury, hatred, ill will. Using powers under this section, the police had arrested two women simply for criticising how Mumbai had been shut down when Balasaheb Thackeray died. Against any standard of good lawmaking, the problems with Section 66A and its wanton use would be considered elementary. Yet it sat smugly in our statute books, as if to demonstrate the ease with which legal rules could fly in the face of reason and constitutional rights. Arghya Sengupta, Research director, Vidhi Centre for Legal PolicySix years ago, the Supreme Court, in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India, struck down Section 66A as unconstitutional. By doing this, it stepped up to the task of reorienting India’s free speech jurisprudence to squarely face the dangers and savour the fruits of a digital age. It held out the promise of the internet being the sanctuary of the free citizen, not a playground for law enforcement agencies. Constitutional frameworks relating to free speech regularly grapple with certain recurrent themes and issues. For what reasons can speech be restricted? How free a rein should police have in such matters? And even if a good reason for restricting speech is found, how is one to tell when that particular reason is really involved and when it is being used as an excuse? In many ways, how courts answer these questions determine how free a country actually is, as opposed to what its Constitution proclaims. Take, for instance, the question of appropriate reasons for speech regulation: Article 19(2) of the Constitution enumerates specific reasons for restricting free speech, such as the sovereignty and integrity of the country, the security of the State, public order, and incitement to an offence. Only if these specific restrictions are attracted can speech be restricted—otherwise freedom to speak is the default rule. But the inconsistency of Indian courts has meant this logic has often been flipped on its head. Broad excuses for speech regulation in “public interest” have made restriction the rule and freedom the exception. With the Supreme Court upholding the offence of sedition, criminal contempt and several other criminal penalties as legitimate exceptions to free speech, this zeal to restrict has only been bolstered. In this backdrop, Shreya Singhal becomes even more significant. Indian courts have often made the right noises on free speech but fallen short when it comes to ruling in favour of it. The Shreya Singhal case ensured a provision that actually restricted free speech was not merely the subject of judicial reprimand, but was wholly extinguished. Lalit Panda, Senior associate fellow, Vidhi Centre for Legal PolicyThat the rot of restrictiveness that Shreya Singhal curbed ran deep is clear from the fact that wildly subjective terms such as offensiveness, annoyance, and inconvenience could even be considered acceptable in drafting laws, let alone being defended on grounds of “public interest”. Fanciful dangers and uncertainties of digital communication were held up as adequate grounds for vague rules, effectively turning the internet in India into a police fiefdom. This then constitutes yet another of Shreya Singhal’s landmark contributions: in a country where courts habitually pretend as if words do not matter, and legislators even less so, the Supreme Court placed the value of clarity of language at the centre of the framework for speech regulation. In the context of a criminal provision like Section 66A, the court demanded this clarity in the form of exacting specificity, striking down the provision for its irreparably vague terms and for its failure to constrain police action. It called out the root problem underlying not just free speech jurisprudence in India, but also one of the oldest and deepest weaknesses in its legal system: imprecision in drafting laws. Such drafting imprecision is a byproduct of an even older and deeper malaise—governmental intransigence. A research paper by Abhinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta in 2018 shows cases continue to be filed under Section 66A despite it being struck down. A bench of the Supreme Court recently expressed its amazement as to how this could happen, leading to the Centre taking corrective measures. The lesson is clear—the arc of the legal universe may be long, but it needs more than one fell swoop to make it bend towards freedom. This does not in any way take away from the importance of what Shreya Singhal achieved. No judgment ever fully resolves the challenges it faces up to, but posterity determines how it shapes society. The accuracy of Shreya Singhal’s diagnosis, its insistence on law being clear and its reaffirmation of the tenets of the Constitution shine through amidst the un-freedom that surrounds us. The judgment could easily have followed a safe line of precedent and sided with police forces looking to bring a lawless internet to heel. Instead, it chose freedom and all the inconvenient boisterousness that it entails. That is its abiding legacy.

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram quadruple murders: My sister main target, faced dowry harassment since 2011 wedding, says victim’s brother||GURUGRAM: The August 24 machete attack inside a Rajendra Park house that ended in four murders had only one target, Sunita, and the others were killed because they had witnessed the crime, alleged a complaint filed with police on Saturday by her brother. Sunita (32) was the daughter-in-law of the main accused in the murders, 65-year-old property dealer and former Armyman Rao Rai Singh, and was the first to be hacked down with the machete, according to police. The three others killed were Singh’s tenants living on the floor above them – Krishan and Anamika Tiwari and their nine-year-old daughter. Their younger daughter (6) is the attack’s lone survivor. In his complaint, Ashok Kumar alleged a conspiracy by Sunita’s in-laws to kill her to usurp a plot in Mahendergarh that their father had gifted to her at the time of her wedding. Sunita married Singh’s son Anand Yadav in November 2011 and the marriage, according to Kumar, was solemnised only after the land was transferred in Sunita’s name. Kumar claimed Singh’s family had been pressuring Sunita constantly for dowry and her marital life had never been peaceful. “My father gifted an acre of land to my sister at the time of her marriage. The value of the land is around Rs 1 crore. The Singh family has been eyeing this land. They wanted us to sell the land and give them the money,” alleged Kumar. He claimed Sunita had been subjected to harassment and physical abuse and had been dragged out of the house by the in-laws on multiple occasions. Because of this, Sunita lived in their parental house in Mahendragarh for four years after the marriage, during which she completed a nursing course, Kumar claimed. Sunita had been working as a staff nurse with a hospital in Gurgaon till last year. “She was not allowed to talk on the phone. It was only in the presence of her in-laws that she could call us,” Ashok said, adding the marital dispute had spilled out of the household, and on two occasions, panchayat meetings had to be called at their village (Kinani) in Mahendergarh. Each time, he claimed, Singh apologised before the panchayat to settle the issue, but the harassment of Sunita never stopped. Kumar has sought a probe into Anand’s role as well as two other family members. Other than Singh, police have taken into custody his wife Bimlesh for allegedly accompanying him during the killings. Police have questioned Anand, but he has not been named in the FIR.  Anand wasn’t home at the time of the incident, according to information available so far. He had left for Khatushyam in Rajasthan the evening before the murders. Singh, who surrendered at Rajendra Park police station after the murders, is believed to have told the police Sunita and Krishan were having an affair and he had seen them together a couple of times. Kumar alleged this was fiction to cover up the real motive. He insisted his sister was the only target and the Tiwaris were attacked because they had come down to check on hearing her scream and had witnessed the crime. Sunita’s eight-year-old daughter, who was in the house at the time of the murders and is a key witness, has been under the care of Kumar in the Mahendergarh house since the killings.  She had earlier this week told TOI she was asleep in her grandparents’ room, which shares a wall with her parents’ room, when she heard a loud scream in the middle of the night and woke up. She said Bimlesh had told her the scream was from somewhere in the neighbourhood and put her back to sleep. The child remained in the room, which was locked from outside, and recalled cops opening the door the next morning. Police have not, so far, filed a separate FIR based on Kumar’s complaint. The investigation, sources said, is focused on analysing call record details of the victims and the accused and collecting other technical evidence. “We are investigating all possible aspects of the case,” said ACP (Udyog Vihar) Rajiv Kumar Yadav. Kumar’s is the second complaint in the case. The first was filed by Krishan’s brother-in-law Ashwani Mishra, on whose basis the FIR was filed against Singh under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and sections of the Arms Act at Rajendra Park police station. Section 34 (common intention) was added later as Bimlesh was arrested.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/machete-murders-my-sister-main-target-faced-dowry-harassment-since-2011-wedding-says-victims-brother/articleshow/85725957.cms||Bagish Jha

They claimed to have made several complaints but in vain. The authorities keep passing the buck instead of resolving the issue, they alleged . The residents have complained that the master road, as well as the internal sector road, are poorly lit, which makes the area prone to accidents. One such stretch — between ATS Kocoon and Dwarka Expressway intersection — the streetlights have been lying defunct for over two years. Manoj Tiwari, a Brisk Lumbini resident, said: “The residents are living with a sense of fear in the absence of proper illumination on the roads. We have hardly seen streetlights working on this stretch, which caters to several residential societies and schools. They need to be immediately fixed so that the streets are safer for pedestrians and motorists.” The developers who have been maintaining the streetlights and bearing the electricity cost have shunned the responsibility after the area came under the ambit of MCG, a resident said. Nirmal Daga, a Caladium resident, said: “No civic authority is willing to take up the responsibility. Since our area now falls under MCG limits, the developers who were maintaining the streetlights, are no longer doing it citing that it’s not their responsibility.” Over 3,000 families are living in the area. A senior official of the MCG said, “The internal sector road is yet to be taken over by the MCG to initiate any repair work or replacement of streetlights. If the streetlights were installed by the developer, it is their responsibility to maintain them till the civic authorities take over the assets,” said an official. Meanwhile, a senior HSVP official said the streetlights on the master road are functional and “if any of them are not working then I will get them checked and repaired soon”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/streetlights-defunct-leading-to-crashes-after-dark-in-sector-109-say-residents/articleshow/85726269.cms||Akanksha Gupta

As she continues her fairytale journey of perseverance in Tokyo, she has brought laurels to her state not exactly known for its athletics excellence. Among the ecstatic fans was Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who tweeted, “Congratulations Bhavina Patel! You played excellently. The entire nation is praying for your success and will be cheering for you tomorrow.” The whole state is waiting with bated breath for Sunday’s blockbuster clash when Bhavina takes on world number one China’s Ying Zhou for the gold medal. Nikul: Today we showed that Chinese are not invincibleIf Bhavinaben Patel’s victory on Friday over the reigning Paralympic champion, Borislava Peric-Rankovic of Serbia, in the women’s singles Class 4 event was a display of pure domination, Saturday’s win over Rio Paralympic silver medallist and world number three Zhang Miao was all about staying calm and putting the opponent under pressure. Bhavina’s parents hold aloft her picture at Sundhiya village in Mehsana district’s Vadnagar talukaEarly on Saturday morning, much before most of India had woken up, Bhavinaben produced a superlative performance to oust Zhang in five close-fought games at the Tokyo Paralympics and storm into the final. The 34-year-old Indian won 7-11,11-7,11-4, 9-11,11-8. The victory gives the Indian not only a shot at a gold medal, but also to set the record straight against the world No.1, China’s Ying Zhou, who is the only player to have beaten her in Tokyo. In the opening group match, Zhou had beaten her 11-3, 11-9, 11-2. After her win, Bhavina, who suffered disability in childhood, said: “I am just giving my 100%. I am mentally ready for the final.” Her husband Nikul Patel, who has accompanied her as part of the entourage, said, “The last two matches have been unbelievable. We can’t describe it in words. The way Bhavina put her opponents, their coaches under pressure has been incredible, and the cool manner in which she has played augurs well for the final.” He said that from the time a player picks up a table tennis racquet in India, it is fed into his/her mind that it is impossible to beat China, but Bhavina has shown that Chinese players can be defeated. “Today we showed that the Chinese table tennis players are not invincible. If we play to our strengths and keep calm under pressure, nothing is impossible,” he said, speaking of his wife’s feat. Her coach Lallan Doshi also praised her resilience. “Even when she fell behind, she played well, trusted her shots and staged a comeback to win the match. The idea was to lock Zhang’s forehand. We succeeded in that and earned points through shots on backhand and forehand extreme. This victory will help her a lot in the final.” In the semifinal’s opening game, Bhavina raced to a 3-0 lead before the Zhang staged a comeback and pocketed the first game 11-7. The para paddler from Vadnagar in north Gujarat’s Mehsana district refused to get bogged down and staged a superb comeback to grab the second and third games 11-7 and 11-4 respectively. In a tight fourth game, which went down the wire, the Chinese para paddler held her nerve to pocket it 11-9. The decider witnessed a see-saw battle with the Indian forging ahead 5-0 before the Chinese fought back to level it at 7-7. Bhavina then raised her game and wrapped it up 11-8 to give herself a shot at the gold medal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/tokyo-paralympics-braveheart-bhavina-patel-one-victory-away-from-gold/articleshow/85729871.cms||Sabu Cherian
---||Gurgaon||1 held for abducting, killing bus driver||Gurgaon: A cleaner-cum-conductor has been arrested by the crime branch for the alleged abduction and murder of a bus driver in Bilaspur. The abandoned bus and body of the driver was found near Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. Police said the accused used to work on the same bus and killed the driver after a dispute over dinner. The accused has been identified as Prithviraj Singh from Panna district of Madhya Pradesh. Pritviraj before lockdown used to work as a driver but lost his job and returned home. Around a month back he came back to Gurgaon and started working as cleaner-cum-conductor, police said. Bus driver Rajkumar on August 25 after dropping off employees of the e-commerce company parked the vehicle at a designated parking area at around 10 PM and asked supervisor Karan Singh to wake him up for morning duty. Rajkumar and accused Pritviraj had dinner together and they had an argument over something. To avenge the insult, Pritviraj killed Rajkumar, who was sleeping inside the bus with a mechanical tool. After killing Rajkumar, the accused started for MP with the bus. “By the time he reached Delhi, it was morning and fearing to be caught, he abandoned the bus and the body near Safdarjung Hospital and took a train for MP,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan. The bus was located though the GPS installed inside it. A case of abduction and murder was registered at Bilaspur police station on the complaint of bus owner Jaipal Solanki. “We traced Prithviraj in Madhya Pradesh and arrested him from there,” said the ACP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/1-held-for-abducting-killing-bus-driver/articleshow/85725959.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Why waste-to-energy plants aren’t the ideal solution for managing our trash||Gurgaon: The government’s plan to set up a waste-to-energy (WTE) incinerator plant at the city’s Bandhwari landfill has brought into debate the effectiveness of such plants in managing solid waste. Setting up incinerator plants is “illogical” in the Indian scenario, according to several experts. Most cities, including Gurgaon, are facing a huge challenge in handling waste as they are following a “flawed” system of waste disposal and management, they said. According to experts, waste management in Indian cities is solely based on collection and transportation methods, which leaves out the opportunity for segregation and recycling. While producing energy from waste is a crucial element of solid waste management as it reduces waste volume and also helps in converting it into renewable energy, WTE plants should ideally come into the management model after segregation, collection and recycling, experts pointed out. Dr Shyamala K Mani, senior advisor at the Centre For Environmental Health, Public Health Foundation of India, said 6.2 crore metric tonnes (MT) of solid waste are generated in urban areas in India annually, which will occupy 3,40,000 cubic metres of volume, or 1,240 hectares of area, in landfills per year. “This is not feasible as there is no spare land for dumping garbage and the existing ones are in a critical state,” Mani, who was formerly a professor at the National Institute of Urban Affairs, said. Out of the 6.2 crore tonnes of waste, only 4.3 crore MT (70%) is collected, 1.2 crore MT is treated and 3.1 crore MT is dumped in landfills, experts said. The remaining waste is dumped haphazardly. Asked why waste is not segregated, Mani said, “Since most concessionaire contracts state that the civic body has to pay Rs 1,700 to 1,800 per tonne to the concessionaire for collection, transportation and dumping of solid waste at the dumpsites, this leads to the practice of mixing waste and dumping it.” Why WTE plants don’t do well in India WTE plants in India handle a vast quantity of mixed waste. According to the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, however, only segregated, non-recyclable waste having a calorific value of 1,500 kcal/kg or more should be utilised for generating energy or refuse-derived fuel. “But as much as 50% of the waste that most WTE plants receive in our cities is low-calorific waste, so it ends up in dumpsites instead of being used to produce energy,” said Ruchika Sethi, founder of Citizens for Clean Air, a Gurgaon-based citizens’ group. “India’s experience with WTE plants has been unsatisfactory. The country’s first WTE plant was set up in 1987 in Timarpur, Delhi. It was shut down in 21 days due to poor quality of incoming waste,” said Ranjit Devraj, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed committee on waste management set up in 2018. Since then, 14 more WTE plants of a total capacity of 130 MW have been set up in the country. Out of these, half have already been closed and the remaining are under scrutiny for environmental violations, he added. Incineration should be the last consideration for any city, said Swati Singh Sambyal, an independent expert. “WTE plants are like boilers, they take tonnes of resources which could otherwise be recycled or recovered,” she said. Experts also pointed out incinerator plants are already being phased out in Western countries. “The US has not set up a single incinerator-based WTE plant since 1997,” said Sibhu Nair, India coordinator for the Global Alliance for Incineration Alternatives. How garbage can be better handled Composting, biogas installation and bio-methanation, and recycling of dry and electronic waste can help reduce waste sent to landfills by 80% to 90%, experts said. Only around 10% of waste, which can’t be composted or recycled, should be sent to a waste processing site, they said. “Whether waste will be incinerated, recycled or composted depends on its quality. Bio-methanation technologies for segregated wet waste from large kitchens, restaurants, slaughterhouses and market waste have proved to be more viable in India,” said Mani. “Rather than having a WTE plant in every city, we could have one in a cluster of a few cities or a larger area, which is still a more sustainable approach,” Sambyal said. Government officials, however, defended the plan to set up a WTE plant in Bandhwari. “WTE plants and landfills are not completely unscientific methods. It depends on what kind of waste is dumped in landfills and what is incinerated in the plant. Many countries are using landfills and WTE plants effectively. We need to follow their pattern,” said S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. Despite repeated calls by TOI, there was no response from Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/why-waste-to-energy-plants-arent-the-ideal-solution-for-managing-our-trash/articleshow/85726274.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||India||The men who shaped independent India’s parliamentary secretariat||The visible part of a vibrant legislature is members of Parliament (MPs) passionately debating critical national issues that shape the country. But a secretariat independent of the government, working tirelessly in the background supporting legislative functioning, is the backbone of Parliament. Two officers of Parliament, Maheshwar Nath Kaul and Sham Lal Shakdher devoted themselves to creating an efficient parliamentary administration for the national legislature of independent India. Before Independence, Vithalbhai Patel, the first president of the Central Assembly, ensured the legislature’s secretariat was responsible to its presiding officer, not the government. It was called the Legislative Assembly Department, and it was this department Kaul joined in 1937. Rising through the ranks, Kaul became secretary to the constituent assembly. It was here that he helped in moulding provisions relating to Parliament in the constitution. Then, he was at the helm of administration in the provisional Parliament and finally took charge of the Lok Sabha secretariat. Shakdher’s journey to the Lok Sabha administration started in the newly created Department of Parliamentary Affairs. He was its first secretary in 1949. After that, he followed his mentor Kaul to Parliament as an officer on special duty and finally became his deputy in the Lok Sabha secretariat. He later succeeded Kaul as the Lok Sabha secretary. Our constitution empowers the two houses of Parliament to make their own rules of procedure and have separate secretarial staff. Kaul and Shakdher put together a foundation of sound procedures and a responsive secretariat to implement them. For example, in 1952, in the first Lok Sabha of independent India, the rules provided that the House would start functioning at 10.45am. The timing was subject to the Speaker’s instruction. It also provided that MPs give their questions 10 days in advance to enable ministers to answer them. Implementing these two simple rules, among many others, required a coordinated organisational effort by the Lok Sabha secretariat. First, then-Speaker G V Mavalankar directed that the House would start functioning at 8.15am. It meant a group of secretariat personnel would have to arrive hours before to open, clean and ready the precincts of Parliament for the day. Another group would have to prepare the day’s schedule, answers to questions, and parliamentary papers. They would also make copies of each document for every MP. Chakshu Roy, Head of Outreach, PRS Legislative ResearchWatch and ward staff would assist MPs and direct the public to galleries to watch the House proceedings. When the proceedings would start, a record of every word said in the legislative chamber would be kept and then published. Parallelly, secretariat personnel would check that the questions submitted by MPs for the following days comply with the rules of procedure. They would then send them to the respective ministries for their responses and collate their answers. Then the process would start all over again for the next day. Occasionally, there were hiccups. On June 5, 1952, Lok Sabha MPs were in for a surprise when they reached Parliament. They saw the flag of Great Britain flying on the building instead of the Indian tricolour. Agitated MPs demanded answers from the government. A few days later, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru would clarify in the House that it had occurred due to the improper understanding of instructions. Kaul and Shakdher ensured procedural and operational aspects of parliamentary functioning worked seamlessly. With the support of colleagues, they designed rules not only for the conduct of business in the legislative chamber but also in its committees. They also supported state assemblies and Parliaments of other countries on constitutional and procedural matters of legislatures. During his tenure, Kaul started Parliament’s academic journal. In its inaugural issue, he laid down the need for a journal as a tool for disseminating parliamentary information and as a vehicle for sharing insights on the institution’s functioning. Writing in the same issue, Shakdher described an ideal parliamentary official as objective, nonpartisan, patient and committed to the country’s service. On retiring, the Lok Sabha speaker appointed both Kaul and Shakdher as honorary officers of the House. The president nominated Kaul to Rajya Sabha as an MP, and Shakdher became the chief election commissioner. Their enduring legacy is the seminal book, ‘Practice and Procedure in Parliament’. Popularly referred to as Kaul and Shakdher, it is the first port of call for everyone interested in the functioning of our legislatures. The book, updated by the Parliament secretariat, occupies a prominent place in every legislative chamber in the country.

---||Gurgaon||Haryana: Farmers lathicharged in Karnal, prompts over 6-hour blockade||KARNAL: Vehicular traffic on various state and national highways in Haryana came to standstill for over 6-7 hours after farmers were lathi-charged by the police on Saturday afternoon at Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza while trying to march to the venue of BJP state-level meeting headed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The state-level meeting to discuss strategy to be adopted for yet-to-be-announced elections to Panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies in Haryana was attended by the chief minister, state BJP president OP Dhankhar, ministers Kanwar Pal Gujjar, Mool Chand Sharma, Kamlesh Dhanda, Sandeep Singh, MPs Sanjay Bhatia, Nayab Singh Saini, and Arvind Sharma, and MLAs from Karnal, Panipat, Hisar, and Fatehabad districts. The area around the venue had been put under virtual siege by the police as no movement was allowed during the meeting. Thousands of farmers, carrying black and BKU flags, gathered at Bastara toll plaza from Saturday morning after a call was given to protest and show black flags to the state BJP leaders. The protesters had earlier announced that they would assemble at Dera Kar Seva in Karnal city, but the district administration had installed barricades at many places to stop all movement of farmers. When the protesters at noon tried to head towards Karnal city from the toll plaza, they were stopped by the police. However, the farmers were adamant on moving towards Karnal and tried to block the National Highway 44, thereafter police used lathi charge to disperse them. There has been no independent verification of the number of farmers injured in the police action, with farm groups estimating around 10 farmers had been injured and the Haryana police putting the number at four. Haryana ADGP (law and order) Navdeep Singh Virk said 10 cops had been injured in the incident. The police have detained several protesters, including BKU (Charuni) district president Jagdeep Singh Aulakh. Karnal IG Mamta Singh, deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav, SP Ganga Ram Punia, and other senior officials along with heavy police force were present during the action on the farmers. CM, police say farmers started it CM Khattar defended police action and said it is not legitimate to block highways. Treading cautiously, he blamed the farmers for blocking the highway and pelting stones on cops who cautioned them against it. “It was a state-level meeting of BJP and they had given a call to oppose this which I condemn. Whatever the reason, obstructing the functioning of an organisation is an attack on democracy. At one point in time, the farmers had an understanding that they would conduct peaceful agitation,” he said. “Nobody should create a disturbance in the programme of anyone. They should protest peacefully. If they pelted police with stones and blocked roads, It is the duty of the police to maintain law and order.” Taking a conciliatory route, the chief minister said: “We shall talk this out with both sides. We shall act against cops if they are found to be high handed and certainly, action will be taken against the farmers in case they are found to be wrongdoers.” Dhankar also expressed concern over the incident. “We have requested the CM to get the circumstances probed in which police had resorted to the use of force. We are sure that it would be an impartial probe,” he said. ADGP law and order Navdeep Virk, in a video message from police HQ in Panchkula, said the cops had used ‘mild’ force against the protesters to bring law and order under control. He said the farmers had violated their own agreement with police that they had agreed to after the Tohana incident in June this year. “In June this year at Tohana, the farm leaders had given an undertaking that they would refrain from violent protests. But, in this case, they had been insisting on moving towards Karnal city where the program was to be held. Our officers had stopped them but some of them had resorted to pelting stones and attacked the policemen,” said Virk, In order to maintain the law and order, the police too had to take action as per guidelines and used mild force to disperse the violent farmers, he added. The road blockades were lifted later in the evening and vehicular traffic on all the roads was restored after the Karnal police released all those farmers who had been rounded up from Bastara toll plaza. This is the second violent incident involving cops and farmers after the protest in May when the CM had visited Hisar city for the inauguration of a 500-bed hospital for Covid-19 patients. Hit protesters on the head: Karnal SDMA viral video, whose authenticity could not be independently verified, led to massive outrage online as it showed the duty magistrate, identified as Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, a 2018 IAS officer, instructing cops to hit protesters on their heads if they tried to breach the barricades. “You are free to stop the protesters at any cost. If anybody tries to breach the naka, hit them on the head, nobody will stop you,” he is heard saying in the video clip.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/haryana-farmers-lathicharged-in-karnal-prompts-over-6-hour-blockade/articleshow/85729893.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||2 farm groups clash in Shahzadpur grain market, case registered||Ambala: Two groups of farmers clashed inside grain market at Shahzadpur in Naraingarh block of Ambala district on Saturday. Five persons from one group have been allegedly injured and are identified as Kuldeep, Kanwarpal Rana, Dharampal Rana and Narpat Rana of Shahzadpur in Ambala district and Jagdeep of Baagwali village in Panchkula district. According to the information, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Charuni) had organised a farmers’ meeting at grain market Shahzadpur on Saturday, to discuss mobilising farmers to Delhi borders. Charuni reached Shahzadpur at about 11.30am, for meeting farmers from two districts and mobilise support for ongoing agitation. Hundreds of farmers from the region had attended the meeting and Charuni also invited them to attend the big mahapanchayat to be held at Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh on September 5. Meanwhile, Narpat Rana along with his brother Kanwarpal Rana and 10 to 15 supporters reached the grain market and started raising slogans against Charuni while holding black flags in their hands. Charuni’s union members first asked them to refrain from the opposition but Narpat’s supporters did not listen. Soon, both groups indulged in heated arguments and then Narpat’s supporters were allegedly assaulted by Charuni’s union members. No police force was deputed at the grain market in Shahzadpur to maintain the law and order. Five supporters of Narpat Rana allegedly received injuries, whose medical were conducted at the community health centre (CHC), Shahzadpur, of whom, three were later referred to Ambala, while two were being treated at Shahzadpur. The farmers associated with BKU (Charuni) said, “Narpat Rana was informed in advance that we are calling Gurnam Singh Charuni for a meeting and should not oppose but he did not listen.” Narpat changed three unions in three years In 2019, Gurnam Singh Charuni lead a farmers’ agitation in Naraingarh for pending sugarcane dues and the sugar mill at Banondi village was closed on January 2, 2019. After five-day-long agitation by the sugarcane farmers in Naraingarh, the administration and mill management had accepted their demands. Till here, Narpat Rana was with BKU (Charuni) and when the sugarcane agitation was about to end, Narpat and Charuni group had scuffled with each other. Following which, Narpat Rana joined BKU (Tikait) group lead by its Haryana president Rattan Mann and was appointed block president. Narpat could not stay for long with BKU (Tikait) and then he had joined hands with BKU (Mann) lead by its Haryana president Guni Parkash. Now, Narpat has parted ways with BKU (Mann) as well and he is president of Bhaichara Union.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/2-farm-groups-clash-in-shahzadpur-grain-market-case-registered/articleshow/85726207.cms||---

The decision was taken in the party meeting of senior vice-presidents and general secretaries under the chairmanship of patron Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. Both leaders also strongly condemned the lathi charge done by the police on farmers in Karnal on Saturday and said that no struggle could ever be suppressed, but the government should resolve the issue by accepting their demands generously. They added that oppression of farmers by the government would never be tolerated. Brahmpura said the lathi charge on farmers in Karnal would prove to be the last nail in the coffin. It was unanimously decided that district-level meetings would be held in Punjab from the first week of September to the end of month to strengthen the party under the supervision of party-appointed observers. Apart from this committees will also be formed for various functions. Speaking on the joining of Sewa Singh Sekhwan, who was earlier part of SAD (Sanyukt) in the Aam Aadmi Party, Dhindsa said this was an unfortunate incident that Sekhwan had to join the party in the presence of AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal. He added that the decision to part ways from the SAD (Badal) was taken by some senior leaders and workers on ethical and moral grounds so that a party with a panthic spirit could be formed in the true sense. Sekhwan was awarded a good position in the party, he added. Dhindsa also said that the departure of a leader with such a character would not make any difference to the party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sad-sanyukt-to-support-sept-25-bandh-call/articleshow/85726244.cms||---

He also expressed confidence the university would work towards promoting India’s traditional systems of healing. The President expressed happiness at the university being named after Mahayogi Guru Gorakhnath, saying he was a pioneer in natural emergency medicine from minerals, metals and herbs. The President invoked Mahatma Gandhi, a staunch supporter of naturopathy. “Gandhiji would be upset about the fact that modern education was far removed from the way people actually lived their lives,” he said. AYUSH institutes to be affiliated to new varsityAlthough tribal society has imbibed traditional knowledge of herbs and herbal medicines, the popularity of AYUSH systems of medicine has grown exponentially over past two decades in the country. The surge in demand for medicinal herbs and plants has raised incomes of farmers and forest dwellers and generated jobs,” the President said. Kovind also praised the formation of the ministry of AYUSH in 2014, aimed at promoting systematic education and research in traditional and nonconventional systems of healthcare, which have been practised in India since ancient times. He also mentioned constitution of the AYUSH department in UP in 2017 and said AYUSH institutes in the state would now be affiliated to the university . “India is the best example of unity in diversity and people don’t hesitate to adapt and adopt whatever is beneficial .Yoga, Ayurveda and Siddha are India’s contribution to world.

---||India||How Partition unfolded in the week after Punjab was split||The Indian Independence Act of 1947 freed hundreds of millions of people from British occupation and led to the creation of two new countries. But amid the fanfare came the tragedies of Partition — millions were killed and displaced as Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus migrated en masse across newly drawn borders in the weeks after August 15, 1947. The original plan for the British to leave India by June 1948 was abruptly brought forward by a year. By mid-1947, it became clear Independence would not result in a united India. The Indo-Pakistan border was drawn along religious lines. But splitting Punjab, the region at the centre of Partition, was no simple task. The ‘Radcliffe Line’ that cleaved the province left significant pockets of Hindu and Sikh populations in Pakistan and Muslim populations in India. Despite some government efforts to ease the population transfer, the subcontinent’s new leaders were not prepared to prevent the death and displacement that followed. About 1.5 crore people, fearing the implications of becoming religious minorities, were uprooted from their homes on either side of the border, and many of those who stayed put became victims of communal violence. Estimates suggest anywhere between 2 lakh and 30 lakh were killed. In the week that followed the boundary award announcement on August 18, coverage in the Times of India documented how Partition unfolded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-partition-unfolded-in-the-week-after-punjab-was-split/articleshow/85729990.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||NHAI to get land for e-way cloverleaf||Gurgaon: The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has finally initiated the process to hand over to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) around 0.3 acres of land needed for the construction of a cloverleaf flyover near Kherki Daula, a crucial intersection on the Dwarka Expressway. NHAI officials said the civic body had been delaying the handover of the land for over three years. With MCG now inviting NHAI to take over the land and begin construction work, the highways authority said it aims to complete the intersection within a year. It has already missed its revised deadline of December 2020 due to the delay in handover of the land. Speaking to TOI, a senior NHAI official said they received a letter from MCG on Saturday stating that a temple on the land would be fully relocated in the next few days.  “We are pleased with the development as we have been pursuing the matter since 2018 and wasted a lot of time and resources in the process. Once the temple is shifted, we’ll commence the construction work of the flyover. It should take us around one year to complete the structure, provided we do not encounter any unavoidable circumstances and work doesn’t come to a halt for any reason,” the official said. In the letter, which MCG sent on Friday, the corporation said it has cleared all the obstacles in the way of the takeover of 0.3 acres near Kherki Daula village. The corporation told NHAI that while the cremation ground was shifted earlier this year, the Shani temple is also being shifted to an alternate site, and after this, no matter regarding the construction of the cloverleaf flyover would be pending with MCG. “One room of the temple is still there and people have urged us not to remove it until Janmashtami. It will also be cleared by Tuesday, and NHAI can then take over the land. With this, MCG has fulfilled all its commitments and facilitated the relocation of Shani temple and cremation ground coming in the way of the Dwarka Expressway,” a senior MCG official said. As part of Package 4 of the Dwarka Expressway, the cloverleaf interchange is to be built on 14 hectares of land, of which the NHAI already has around 13 hectares. It will connect the Expressway to the other side of Gurgaon through the Southern Peripheral Road and Golf Course Road. It will be a two-level interchange in which left turns will be handled by slip roads. It will provide an alternate route to the Indira Gandhi International Airport, which is currently over 17km away via NH-8. Residents of new sectors have also welcomed the move, saying the intersection will provide them relief from paying toll at Kherki Daula. “The handover of land was pending for a very long time. MLA Rakesh Daultabad helped us get the takeover executed. NHAI must ask the contractor to complete this stretch within its existing timeline,” said Prakahar Sahay, the former joint secretary of the Dwarka Expressway Welfare Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/nhai-to-get-land-for-e-way-cloverleaf/articleshow/85726317.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

The banker was arrested and released on bail later. While police claimed he was too drunk to know what he was doing, the manager of the restaurant alleged that the accused threatened them with dire consequences after ramming the car into the counter. Asharam Yadav, the manager of Locale, said he and a woman colleague were standing at the counter to register customers who walked in when the Amaze crashed into it around 11.30pm on Thursday. The duo had a narrow escape as they jumped either side of the kiosk to get out of the car’s way. Confronted, the banker allegedly came out of the car and threatened the Locale staff if they tried to stop him from leaving. “All throughout, he kept saying he was an influential man and nobody could do him any harm. We took the keys of the car away and informed police. Before he could escape, the cops had arrived,” Yadav said. “We would have died had we not jumped away. Furniture, DJ equipment, lights and speakers were damaged.” Following a complaint by Yadav, an FIR was registered against the banker at Sector 29 police station under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the IPC. He was released on bail on Friday. “We seized the car and are investigating the complaint. The man was drunk and was not aware of what he was doing or saying,” an officer said. However, the cops did not get any medical test done on the banker and he was not booked under the Motor Vehicles Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/banker-rams-car-into-counter-of-restobar-in-sector-29-held/articleshow/85726502.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||MCG’s office project gets government nod, to cost Rs 117.6 crore||Gurgaon: The state urban local bodies department has approved the construction of a new office for the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) in Vyapar Sadan at an estimated cost of Rs 117.6 crore. MCG had earlier floated a tender and shortlisted the contractor and the proposal had been sent to the ULB department. Now that the Haryana government has given the approval, work on the new office building will begin soon, MCG officials said. “We have received approval and will issue the work order in two days, after which construction will begin,” said Thakur Lal Sharma, MCG chief engineer. The contractor will have to begin work within 10 days of receiving the work order, officials said. The project is expected to be completed in 18 months. The new office building will have 10 floors and three basements with a parking capacity of 450 cars. Officials said the civic body will require only six floors and the remaining four floors are likely to be leased out to generate revenue. MCG was constituted in 2008 and still doesn’t have its own office building. The building in Sector 34 where MCG has its office is owned by the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran and the corporation pays it a monthly rent of around Rs 20 lakh. The new office will have offices of councillors, the mayor and her team, a ‘Town Hall’ where House meetings will be conducted, a lounge, citizen facilitation centres, a library, ATMs and shops. MCG officials said there will also be a dispensary and crèche in the new office building, as per the original plan. A municipal auditorium with a seating capacity of 650 is also mentioned in the revised plan of the new office building, which was tabled in a House meeting in October 2020. “The scope of work taken in these estimates should not be taken earlier in any other work and payment will be made as per actual work done and no change in specifications. The work shall be executed under the strict supervision of the engineer in-charge as well as the architect/consultant engaged by MCG,” read the communication sent by the ULB department to MCG on Wednesday. The proposal to construct the office in Vyapar Sadan was passed by the MCG chief in February last year. However, the changes suggested in the building plan took the officials a few months time owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mcgs-office-project-gets-government-nod-to-cost-rs-117-6-crore/articleshow/85726426.cms||Vishakha Chaman
