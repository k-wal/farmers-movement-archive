Policy transmission is the central bank terminology for banks passing on the benefits of rate cuts by lowering their lending and deposit rates for both new and old borrowers, which, however, is still titled in favour of new borrowers. Between February 2019, which was Das' first policy announcement when he cut the repo rate by a modest 25 basis points (bps) to 6.25 per cent, and July 2021, the central bank has slashed the key policy interest rate or repo rate by a full 250 bps to 4 per cent, Das told reporters at the customary post-policy presser. His predecessor Urjit Patel had left the interest rate at 6.5 per cent in the December 2018 policy after he began rate hikes early into his days in the RBI. Das began the rate cut cycle in February 2019. On May 22, 2020, at an unscheduled announcement, the RBI slashed the repo rate by 40 bps to help shore up the economy amid the Covid-19 crisis. Das had earlier reduced the rate by a hefty 75 bps on March 27, 2020 at the first monetary policy meet since the onset of the pandemic. The governor said the RBI has been closely monitoring the pace of policy transmission, especially since October 2019 when it mandated all banks to set an external benchmark for their fund cost and loan pricing. Between February 2019 and July 2021, both the new and existing borrowers have seen their interest cost come down by 217 bps and 170 bps respectively, while the RBI has lowered the repo rate by 250 bps, he said, adding there has been tangible transmission of rate cuts. However, the governor quickly added that existing borrowers do not get the full benefits that new borrowers receive because of the reset clause in their loan agreements. Das further said during the pandemic period between March 2020 and July 2021, the transmission for new loans has been 146 bps, while the same for the existing loans was 101 bps. So there has been transmission, he underlined, and pointed out that even for many existing home loan borrowers, the rates are at historic lows. Since the external benchmarking has been introduced, the transmission has been good for both new and old loans, as since October 2019, the rates for new loans are down 177 bps, and the same for old loans have reduced by 119 bps, Das said. Under the external benchmarking of lending rates, banks can choose between the repo rate, the yield on three-month or six-month treasury bills, or any other benchmark rate published by the Financial Benchmarks India Ltd for linking floating rate loans. According to RBI, as of October 1, 2019, of the 62 banks from whom information was collected, 36 adopted the policy repo rate as the external benchmark. Successive governors, beginning with D Subbarao, have been focusing on better rate transmission so that the entire loan and deposit pricing becomes more transparent. While Subbarao forced the bank rate on lenders, still the loan pricing remained opaque and this led his successor Raghuram Rajan to introduce the base rate concept -- which mandated banks to declare their lending rates on their websites and not lend lower than the disclosed rate. As this too did not lead to the desired results, his successor Urjit Patel mandated lending rates to be decided based on the cost of funds. Yet old borrowers did not benefit much from it, forcing the RBI under Das to enforce the external benchmark-based loan pricing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rate-transmission-gaining-traction-new-loans-cheaper-by-217-bps-old-by-170-bps-since-feb-2019-shaktikanta-das/articleshow/85112575.cms||---

The assertion came amid reports that many small businesses had suffered freezing of accounts after the July 31 deadline for revised norms. The RBI responded to this by extending the deadline for application of new norms to October 31. "There is no blanket ban on opening of current accounts. We are following a graded approach," Rao told reporters at the post-policy review press conference. There are no restrictions on opening of the current account if the exposure of the borrower is less than Rs 5 crore, and if they have not availed of CC/OD (cash credit and overdraft) facilities from any bank, Rao said. If the exposure is Rs 5 crore and above, but less than Rs 50 crore, there are no restrictions on the opening of a current account for such borrowers but the borrowing current accounts can be used only for collection purposes, he added. For the CC/OD front, technology enables the anywhere anytime banking for such things, so there is no likelihood of disruptions as far as opening of current accounts is concerned, the DG said. “The proposal which we have tried to implement ensures better discipline on the borrowers. We have been very flexible with the borrowers,” he said. The RBI has addressed issues regarding the opening of the current account and operation of the current account in the FAQs (frequently asked questions) issued in December, he added. “Now, taking into consideration some of the concerns put out by the banks, we have extended the timeline till October 31, and will be addressing issues in consultation with IBA and banks so that any residual issues can be sorted out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-blanket-ban-on-opening-of-current-a/c-rbi-following-a-graded-approach-dg-rao/articleshow/85112749.cms||---

There were seven entries for the final selection, including two each from Chamarajanagar and Chitradurga, and one each from Tumakuru, Bengaluru Rural and Chikkaballapura district, and Venkataramana bagged first prize, said Shivakumar, deputy director, handloom and textile department, Chikkaballapura. The prize-winning sari has been woven by adopting Kuttu technique, normally used in Molakalmooru saris. “The speciality is that the border and the sari get interlocked with kuttu technique. The weaving is complicated and is a Herculean task,” explained Shivakumar. The weaver has incurred an expenditure of Rs 12,000-14,000 on weaving the sari, which will fetch him Rs 20,000 in the market. Venkataramana, 46, will be presented the award in Bengaluru on Saturday. Incidentally, he is the only weaver in Boyipalli, 120km from Bengaluru. Venkataramana told TOI he began to learn the art of weaving from Narasimhaiah at Baiyyapalli in Sidlagatta taluk at the age of 18 and stayed with his guru for seven years. Later, he went to Vijayapura in Bengaluru Rural district to learn the advanced techniques of handloom weaving from Kittanna of Venkatapura. After learning the art of “kucchu” designs, he went to Dharmavaram in Andhra Pradesh, where he got acquainted with the techniques of brocade, embossing and Kuttu in sari designing. Keen on becoming self-reliant, Venkataramana returned to his village where he put up his own handloom weaving equipment and began weaving designer saris. He said it takes about eight to 10 days to weave a sari and he earns Rs 5,000-8,000 for each. He works for about six to eight hours a day and his wife assists him in packing and other related work, Venkataramana said. His elder son is a second-year degree student, while his second son is in middle school. His younger son is likely to step into his father’s shoes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cballapura-weavers-sari-wins-award-for-best-design/articleshow/85112794.cms||Ranganath Krishnaswamy

The underpass has been under construction from February 2019 and has missed several deadlines. It is part of BBMP’s ambitious signal-free corridor along Old Airport Road. While a poultry shop, a pork stall and a two-wheeler garage, which were preventing the widening of the road, are being demolished, work on razing a commercial building that stands on a plot spread over 200 sqm in a corner of the road will be taken up soon. These were the last of the structures holding up work. “In two days, the owner of the commercial building will be compensated, after which we will take up demolition work. Precast boxes are ready and their installation will be bringing the underpass work to an end,” Lokesh, chief engineer, projects, BBMP, told TOI. Owners of 24 properties, which were to be acquired for the project, had earlier refused to agree to the compensation offered by the civic body. After a meeting with the land owners on January 3, 2020, BBMP offered to pay a compensation of over 1.6 times the guidance value. As the owners remained firm, another meeting was held on February 24. It was finally decided that two times the guidance value of the land to be acquired would be paid as compensation. This translated into Rs 42.5 crore for acquiring 33,654 sq ft of land. The underpass was to be completed by December 2019, but work halted within a few months owing to land-acquisition issues. In September 2019, then chief minister BS Yediyurappa visited the spot and ordered resumption of work. The deadline was shifted to April 2020 and then again to October 2020. The last missed deadline was February 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kundalahalli-underpass-may-be-ready-in-60-days/articleshow/85112797.cms||P Pavan
---||Bengaluru||Six years on, scrapping of JNNURM hits Karnataka STUs||BENGALURU: It’s been six years since the Centre scrapped Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) instead. The move has particularly affected state transport undertakings in Karnataka. While they inducted modern buses and constructed bus terminuses and depots under JNNURM, AMRUT, which mainly focuses on ensuring adequate sewerage networks and water supply, has no provision to fund bus purchases. Under JNNURM, the Centre sanctioned 2,851 buses to Karnataka. “JNNURM helped augment our bus fleet and construct depots, workshops and stations. Under the mission, 35% of the funds came from the Union government and 15% from the state. For instance, most Volvo AC buses of BMTC were procured under JNNURM. A total of 10 Travel and Transit Management Centres (TTMCs) in places like Shantinagar, Jayanagar and Yeshwantpur were also constructed under the scheme,” said a senior transport department official. The UPA-led government had sanctioned funds to procure around 23,000 buses across the country under JNNURM. These buses were fully built compared to earlier ones that were built on truck chassis and had features like low floor, LED sign boards, cameras etc. However, the NDA-led government focused on leasing electric buses (PPP model) instead of purchasing them. But bus stations at Tumakuru and Davangere are being built under the Smart Cities Mission. In 2015, then Union minister of heavy industries and public enterprises launched Phase 1 of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) scheme, offering subsidies up to 60% of cost or Rs 1 crore (whichever is lower) for electric buses. The subsidy for BMTC to induct 80 e-buses was Rs 74.8 crore. However, the corporation lost it since it could not induct buses before the March 2019 deadline. Under Phase 2 of FAME II, 300 electric buses were sanctioned to BMTC and 50 each to KSRTC and NWKRTC on lease basis. However, the Centre reduced the subsidy to Rs 50 lakh per bus. None of the STUs has inducted any buses so far under FAME II since most firms have been quoting high bid amounts. Meanwhile, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in the 2021-22 budget allocated Rs 18,000 crore for a new scheme to augment public bus transport across the country. “It will facilitate deployment of innovative PPP models to enable private players to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses,” she had said. However, the number of buses to be allocated to Karnataka is yet to be revealed. “This scheme is being implemented in the Gross Cost Contract model (PPP model) but it has not been finalised yet,” said an official. Vinay Sreenivasa, member, Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike, said: “The number of BMTC buses should be increased from the current 6,400 to more than 10,000. Both the Centre and state should support strengthening public transport, especially after the pandemic, to ensure social distancing norms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/six-years-on-scrapping-of-jnnurm-hits-ktaka-stus/articleshow/85112821.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

A detailed analysis of the result shows that electronics & biomedical engineering and industrial engineering registered the highest pass percentage in the BTech engineering results of the 2017 batch published by the varsity on Tuesday. The pass percentage in aeronautical engineering branch is the lowest with only 28% students clearing the exam. Other branches in the lower rungs are mechatronics with 31.36% pass and 33.55% from automobile engineering. The only branches that registered pass percentage over 70% were electronics & biomedical (78.13%), industrial (76.19%) and food technology engineering (71.82%). Statistics indicate that at least a dozen branches have pass percentage below 50%, while 10 branches have registered above-50% pass. Pass percentage in one branch (production engineering) is 50%. Several branches, including electronics & biomedical and industrial engineering that registered the highest pass percentage, had less than 100 candidates registered for the eighth-semester examination. The highest number of candidates registered for the 8thsemester examination after obtaining the mandatory credits in lower semesters were from mechanical (7,217) and civil (6,948). Pass percentage in both the branches stood at 37.2% and 49.38%, respectively. The lowest number of students registered for the finalsemester examination was from metallurgy branch. Only 19 candidates from the branch could register for the 8th-semester examination, of which only nine students cleared it. In terms of the academic performance index published by the varsity, College of Engineering, Trivandrum, topped the list with 7.21 score on a 10-point scale. TKM College of Engineering, Model Engineering college, Muthoot Institute of Technology & Science were at second, third and fourth positions, respectively. In the institution-wise result, College of Engineering, Trivandrum, topped the list with 82.49% pass. The college had presented 674 candidates, of which 556 cleared the exam. TKM College of Engineering presented 767 students, the highest number of candidates, of which 567 have passed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/low-pass-in-mechatronics-aeronautics/articleshow/85112826.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Bengaluru||Three years on, three rail flyovers at Byappanahalli remain on paper||BENGALURU: It’s been three years since South Western Railway proposed three rail flyovers in Byappanahalli to cut down delay of trains. They were included in the 2018-19 blue book (book of demands for grants) at an estimated cost of Rs 573 crore, but the railway board is yet to approve the project. The three rail flyovers span over a length of 3.8km and are expected to come up at Byappanahalli A Panel-Byappanahalli, Byappanahalli A Panel-Channasandra and Channasandra-KR Puram. These are meant to avoid detention of trains due to cross-movement and enable operation of direct trains from Hosur/Salem to Kolar/Devanahalli without changeover at Byappanahalli. At present, trains are operating from Byappanahalli in four directions: Salem, Jolarpettai, Channasandra and Banaswadi/Yeshwantpur. From Channasandra, trains run in three directions: Byappanahalli, KR Puram and Dharmavaram. “The heavy movement results in bunching of trains and wait for long hours for want of a clear path due to criss-cross movement at Byappanahalli,” said an official in SWR’s construction organisation. Train movements will increase once the quadrupling work between Bengaluru Cantonment and Whitefield via Byappanahalli line and doubling of Byappanahalli-Hosur line are completed. This means more trains will have to wait for the crossing of other trains. “Train movement will be affected if surface crossing is not provided at Byappanahalli. These flyovers will provide direct lines for trains and reduce waiting time,” said an official. Direct trains from Hosur to DevanahalliAt present, there is no direct train connectivity between Channasandra and Hosur/Salem. For instance, any train operating towards Salem side from Channasandra stops at Byappanahalli for locomotive reversal and then starts towards Salem side. Though there has been an increasing demand from Electronics City residents to operate Memu trains from Hosur to KIA halt station near the airport, SWR is yet to do so because of these operational constraints. However, rail flyovers will help address this issue. “The rail flyover connecting Channasandra towards Salem side will also help goods trains coming from Dharmavaram,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/three-years-on-three-rail-flyovers-at-byappanahalli-remain-on-paper/articleshow/85112849.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The government’s use case, ‘Crowd Monitoring using AI’ was selected out of over 300 applications from multiple stakeholders. A startup Awiros was the technology partner for this project and was selected by the state government for implementing this AI application in the state. The state’s Counter Intelligence Cell used the AI solution for estimating and managing crowds during the India vs West Indies T20 match at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in 2019 and during the Medaram Jathara festival in 2020. By using this tool, authorities can track and monitor the variation in the crowd density in an area on a real-time basis. The application can also pinpoint the location where the crowd may surge after analysing the trend in events like Medaram Jathara, hence enabling authorities to take corrective measures like manpower deployment, public announcement, rerouting crowds to less crowded areas to avoid events such as stampedes. This application could be used in places like religious gatherings, political rallies, events like sports and other public gatherings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/telangana-govt-wins-ai-gamechanger-award/articleshow/85112858.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Car-borne gang stops truck, loots cellphones worth Rs 6 crore||KOLAR: An interstate gang of truck-jackers struck at Bengaluru-Chittoor highway on Thursday night decamped with mobile phones worth Rs 6 crore from a vehicle that was transporting the consignment. The heist, which was executed in a filmy fashion, took place near Devarayasamudra (around 90km from Bengaluru), near Mulbagal. Preliminary investigation revealed the truck was coming from Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu and heading towards Bengaluru, when it was intercepted by a car-borne gang. While truck driver Suresh was alone in his vehicle, there were 8-10 people in the car. The gang reportedly accused the truck driver of having rammed their vehicle. When Suresh got off the vehicle to check the damage caused, the gang members tied him to a nearby tree and escaped with the truck. They transferred the consignment to another truck near Nernahalli and fled. The incident came to light when Suresh managed to untie himself and informed Mulbagal Rural police. Kolar SP D Kishore Babu visited the spot. Police said they are examining different angles, including the role of those who were aware of the truck’s movements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/car-borne-gang-stops-truck-loots-cellphones-worth-6cr/articleshow/85112898.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Stop squabbling over Mekedatu; get all clearances instead, say experts||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government should make a strong case before the Supreme Court and Cauvery Water Management Authority to ensure the Mekedatu reservoir project becomes a reality instead of political rhetoric with Tamil Nadu, said experts. The advice from irrigation experts follows the Centre’s insistence that the project requires CWMA approval. Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat, on July 17, told Lok Sabha that the Centre had given in-principle nod for a detailed project report in October 2019 and the government had sent it to CWMA for approval. Singh repeated it in the House on Thursday while replying to a question by Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna and said CWMA acceptance is a prerequisite for the ministry of water resources to consider it. Experts are dismayed that the panel has not taken up the matter for discussion in 12 meetings between February 2018 and July 2021. “Karnataka should be proactive and get nod without any delay. Getting into a war of words with Tamil Nadu politicians will not help,” said water resources expert Captain Raja Rao. The panel has all riparian states (Karnataka, TN, Kerala, Puducherry) but the project is blocked by TN. Sources said the government will raise the DPR at this month’s meeting. Other experts, however, said Karnataka needn’t wait for CWMA approval and can start construction as the Supreme Court has not stayed the DPR. “It is obvious that Tamil Nadu will raise objections in CWMA. Karnataka should start construction in the forest area (since environment clearance is still pending). Let Tamil Nadu move the Supreme Court if it wants and let the court clarify,” said TA Tippeswamy, former adviser to the chief minister on irrigation. Captain Raja Rao said TN has no case in the dispute since the project is meant to utilise surplus Cauvery water over which TN has no claim. “There is confusion over this since the Supreme Court, while modifying the tribunal award in 2018, did not mention utilisation of surplus water. Karnataka should seek the apex court’s clarification about this,” he added. However, senior advocate Mohan Kataraki, who is appearing for Karnataka, said the project is not meant for utilising surplus water, but the government had filed a separate petition in the Supreme Court seeking clarification about it. Bommai, Pawar discuss interstate water issues:Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra water resources minister Jayant Patil met in Bengaluru on Friday to discuss how to share real-time information on interstate water resources data to mitigate floods in both states. The unscheduled talks were mainly on water sharing between Karnataka and Maharashtra. The leaders discussed mutual cooperation in case of floods and sharing details on real-time basis. They decided to hold a meeting on interstate water issues and river water-sharing between the two states. “Our aim is to resolve every possible dispute through talks. In this direction, we held discussions,” read a statement quoting Bommai. Pawar, in a tweet, said: “On my visit to Bangalore, I got a call from Karnataka CM Shri Bommai who expressed his wish to meet me.

Thomas Woodard Jr., 38, pleaded guilty in Jones County to two counts of first-degree murder, one count of kidnapping and one count of attempted murder. Woodard and his co-defendant, 29-year-old Michael Dutcher, had each pleaded not guilty in April to the counts in the March 23 deaths of nurse Lorena Schulte, 50, and correctional officer Robert McFarland, 46.  Investigators have said the pair used hammers to beat Schulte and McFarland to death and to seriously injure an inmate who tried to stop the attack at the Anamosa State Penitentiary. The inmates also are accused of briefly holding another female employee as a hostage.  Woodard, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit and a heavy bulletproof vest, showed no emotion Friday as he answered dozens of questions from the judge about his role in the killings. He replied to most with a simple "Yes," including when he was asked if he had hit McFarland several times in the back of his head with a hammer and whether he hit Schulte at least twice in the face with the same hammer.  Woodard confirmed he intended to kill the correctional officer, but balked when asked if he intended to kill Schulte.  "I was simply trying to stop her from calling for help," he said.  The only emotion Woodard displayed came as a defiant flash of anger when the judge asked if he intended to kill the inmate who tried to stop the attack, saying the injured inmate "is a snitch and a pedophile, and I had every intention of killing him. I wish I'd hit him one more time."  Woodard's motive in pleading to the original counts was not made clear during the hearing. Woodard, who was serving at least 17 years for armed robbery when the killings took place, now faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. As part of his plea, officials stated he would be transferred to the Nebraska prison system to serve out his sentence there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-charged-in-killing-of-iowa-prison-staffers-pleads-guilty/articleshow/85113103.cms||---
---||World||North Korea developing nuclear, missile programs in 2021: UN report||UNITED NATIONS: North Korea continued developing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs during the first half of 2021 in violation of international sanctions and despite the country's worsening economic situation, according to an excerpt of a confidential United Nations report seen by Reuters on Friday. The report by a panel of independent sanctions monitors to the UN Security Council North Korea sanctions committee said Pyongyang "continued to seek material and technology for these programmes overseas." "Despite the country's focus on its worsening economic travails, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continued to maintain and develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes," the sanctions monitors concluded. North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the UN report. The isolated Asian nation imposed a strict lockdown last year amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slashed its trade and aid access, hurting an economy already burdened by international sanctions. In June, leader Kim Jong Un said the country faced a "tense" food situation and much would depend on this year's harvests. "Statements made by DPRK suggested a deepening humanitarian crisis in the country, although the Covid-19 blockade means that the relative impact of sanctions on the humanitarian situation has probably decreased," the UN monitors wrote. "With trade all but stopped by the blockade, and last year's harvest badly affected by floods, the current prospects of the wider DPRK population are poor," they said. North Korea has been subjected to UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The Security Council has steadily strengthened sanctions in a bid to cut off funding for the programs. Among the sanctions imposed are a ban on the export of coal and other commodities and the import of oil. "Maritime exports from DPRK of coal and other sanctioned commodities continued, but at a much reduced level. The import of oil products reported to the panel fell substantially in the first half of the year," according to the UN report. Pyongyang also continued to access international financial institutions and North Korean workers continued to earn money overseas for use in state programmes, said the UN sanctions monitors, adding: "Officials overseas continued to feel pressure to develop revenue streams." The monitors said they were continuing to investigate North Korea's involvement in global cyber activity and collaboration by North Korean academics and universities with scientific institutes abroad, "focusing on studies with potential applications in WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programmes." The UN sanctions monitors have previously reported that North Korea has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars using cyberattacks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korea-developing-nuclear-missile-programs-in-2021-un-report/articleshow/85113073.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: India’s Covid R-naught tops 1 again, up from 0.9 a month ago||The delta variant, considered more contagious than chickenpox, has now pushed up the R-naught -the average number of people who will contract the disease from an infected person - above one for India from 0.93 a month ago. The R-value is a tool epidemiologists and policy makers use to check if cases are growing faster or shrinking quickly. The reproduction factor in India is 1.01. "This means one person is infecting more than one person," explained Vellore-based senior virologist Dr T Jacob John. In March, as cases went up rapidly the R value was around 1.4 but by May, when overall cases began to fall, it dropped to around 0.7. While rising R0 is a cause for worry, epidemiologists say they don't red zone a state or district merely because the R value is going up. "A combination of epidemiological factors including infection growth rate, increasing number of deaths and hospital occupancy rate explain the risk," said National Institute of Epidemiology director Dr Manoj Murhekar. At least 10 states have an R-value higher than the national average of 1.01, and Delhi and Maharashtra (both at 1.01) have inched closer to match the national average. Among states, Madhya Pradesh (1.31) has the highest R value in the country followed by Himachal Pradesh (1.30) and Nagaland (1.09). Across India, by August 5, of the eight states that reported over a thousand cases, the R number was higher than one in five states. Kerala, which is reporting more than 20,000 cases a day, has a RO of 1.06. The number is above 1 for Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra as well. Covid-19 pandemic live updatesYet, the risk factor is not proportional to the R values in each of these states. For instance, Madhya Pradesh, which has the highest R values, is also reporting fewer than 30 cases a day. “The R value is high because of the erratic daily numbers, but that does not indicate risk because the percentage of people who test positive over the total number of people tested (test positivity rate) is still low,” Murhekar said. However, some states have increased growth rate and are reporting a high number of cases. For instance, in Tamil Nadu, on June 26, the state saw the steepest fall in the average number of fresh cases. The weekly average of cases was 7.8% less that day compared to the previous week. On August 1, the weekly average was 1,957 compared to 1,844 seven days ago on July 26. The R value for the state, which was hovering between 0.7 and 0.6 in the first week of June, went above 1 in the last week of July. “But numbers are going up and down. Until we see a steady increase, we won’t be able to declare it as the third wave,” Dr John said. The public health authorities, however, must monitor infection rate in every district and ensure appropriate response including interruption of transmission, said Bangalore-based epidemiologist Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor of epidemiology of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI). The analysis of R0 for Covid cases across the states points to a few broad patterns. The data shows that the second wave, which was still strong in the country’s northeast, is in a waning phase. Among the northeast states only Nagaland has a greater than one value of this indicator. Among states with over a thousand daily cases the value is less than one for Mizoram, Assam and Odisha. But even in these states, the chances of infection and deaths remain high. And with more states unlocking restrictions, the cases are likely to go up. Among the six states that reported between 100 to 1,000 cases on August 3 the R0 value is higher for Himachal Pradesh and Nagaland and it is exactly 1 for Jammu & Kashmir, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal. Public health experts say they will have to wait for a few more days before they can declare the spurt in cases of a new wave or dismiss it as a blip on the graph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-indias-covid-r-naught-tops-1-again-up-from-0-9-a-month-ago/articleshow/85113625.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||World||Official: Offensive coming against Tigray forces in Ethiopia||NAIROBI, KENYA: Ethiopia's spreading Tigray conflict faces a fresh wave of fighting as an Amhara regional official says Amhara forces will launch an offensive on Saturday against Tigray forces who have entered the region and taken control of a town hosting a Unesco World Heritage Site. "This is the time for the Amhara people to crush the terrorist group,'' Sema Tiruneh, the Amhara region's head of peace and security, told the regional state-affiliated Amhara Media Corporation on Friday. "Preparations have been underway to reverse these moves and an offensive will start tomorrow. Freedom doesn't come cheap. Everyone should come forward and defend themselves.'' Separately, Ethiopia's foreign ministry on Friday warned that the Tigray forces' incursion into the Amhara and Afar regions in recent weeks "is testing the federal government's patience and pushing it to change its defensive mood which has been taken for the sake of the unilateral humanitarian cease-fire.'' The incursions have displaced some 300,000 people, it said, accusing the Tigray forces of trying to destabilize Africa's second most populous country. Ethiopia's government is "being pushed to mobilize and deploy the entire defensive capability of the state'' if overtures for a peaceful resolution to the conflict are not reciprocated, the statement said. A spokesman for the Tigray forces, Getachew Reda, could not immediately be reached for comment. Ethiopia's government declared the cease-fire in late June during a stunning turn in the war, as its military retreated from Tigray and the resurgent Tigray forces retook key towns and walked into the regional capital, Mekele, to cheers. The conflict erupted in Tigray in November after a falling-out between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the Tigray ruling party that had dominated Ethiopia's government for nearly three decades. Since then, thousands of people have been killed. A new offensive by the Amhara regional forces would go against the federal government's command: "All federal and regional, civil and military institutions are ordered to respect the cease-fire,'' Ethiopia said in its declaration in June. While the United Nations and United States raise the alarm about the Ethiopian government's continuing near-complete blockade of the Tigray region and its 6 million people, the Tigray forces have vowed to secure the region and chase its "enemies'' even to the capital, Addis Ababa, if needed. They have said the prime minister needs to go as one of several preconditions for talks. On Thursday the Tigray forces entered the Amhara town of Lalibela, a Unesco World Heritage Site for its rock-hewn churches. While one resident told The Associated Press they arrived peacefully, Amhara regional spokesman Gizachew Muluneh on Friday said the "terror group'' that entered the town is being "routed'' by the public and the Ethiopian army. "Several of them have now surrendered,'' he added. Ethiopia's government earlier this year declared the Tigray People's Liberation Front, or TPLF, a terrorist group instead of a political party. Unesco on Friday expressed concern about the expansion of the conflict into Lalibela. "We don't have firsthand information on any actual damage being done,'' UN spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters. The conflict has strained living conditions for millions of Ethiopians, and more across the country now fear it will affect them. "There's serious suffering in Tigray. (The Tigray forces) had an opportunity to stop the military offensive,'' Tewodrose Tirfe with the Amhara Association of America told the AP. "Instead, they kept on pushing.'' He asserted that the Tigray forces aim to create a "favorable outcome in a negotiation by creating a humanitarian crisis and holding Amhara civilians and cities hostage.'' Ethiopia's prime minister repeated his commitment to the unilateral cease-fire just days ago. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told reporters "I have no reason to doubt that at all," on Friday after meeting with Abiy during an Ethiopia visit earlier this week. But regional forces vowing a new offensive could be another matter. As the Tigray forces push on, they have become the focus of increasing warnings from the UN and US amid pleas for an immediate cease-fire and talks without conditions. The civilians in Tigray would benefit, the UN humanitarian chief said: "It's going to be easier for the Tigrayan people if the war is stopped.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/official-offensive-coming-against-tigray-forces-in-ethiopia/articleshow/85113691.cms||---

The government said its plan includes an increase in the number of people who can meet in person, re-opening of schools and an increase in the number of people allowed to enter the country to 1,700 per day from the current 1,000. Argentina has a total population of about 45 million.  "The more we vaccinate and take care of ourselves, the more we can sustain these achievements and advance in sustained and progressive openings," President Alberto Fernandez said in a recorded TV message.  Vaccinations have increased in recent days after a surge in virus transmission last month, in the dead of the Southern Hemisphere winter when more people were tempted to socialize indoors, away from the icy winds coming up from the Antarctic.  Argentina adopted the plan after 10 consecutive weeks of lower case numbers and eight weeks of decreasing deaths.  The second stage of the new program, depending on infection rates, would include greater capacity for closed-door gatherings, unlimited attendance at open-air events, group trips for those who are fully vaccinated and the reopening of borders to receive vaccinated foreigners.  The program would eventually include reopening outdoor sporting events, of great importance in the soccer-crazed nation. But that will only happen if caseloads continue to fall, Fernandez said.  In news that may convey optimism ahead of November congressional elections, Fernandez said he expects the economy to grow 7% this year after a three-year recession severely exacerbated by the pandemic in 2020.  "The vaccine is the best economic policy. Thanks to vaccination we are recovering," he said.  Given shortages of second doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, one of the most frequently administered in the country, Argentina has started offering a second dose of the Moderna and/or AstraZeneca vaccines.  Argentina has vaccinated about 25.84 million people with the first dose, but only 7.98 million with the second, according to official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/argentina-partially-reopens-as-it-approaches-5-mln-covid-19-cases/articleshow/85114602.cms||---
---||Goa||I-League Qualifiers: AIFF to use financial criteria as tie-breaker to select teams||Panaji: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has told clubs that their net worth will be the deciding factor, if more than 10 are eligible to participate in the I-League Qualifiers later this year. The AIFF executive committee has decided to select a maximum of ten clubs for the Qualifiers but 29 have been nominated by 18 state associations. While one club from each state will first be handpicked, there is a possibility that more than ten could be eligible on sporting merit alone. Should that happen, “only those 10 clubs/ individual promoters with the highest net worth (in accordance with criteria ‘F.05’ of the Regulations, analysed as per the documents submitted by each club), will be selected by the AIFF to participate in the Qualifiers,” the AIFF said in a letter to all nominated clubs. Selected teams will be charged Rs 2.5 lakh as participation fee, an increase of Rs 1.5 lakh from the previous season. Nominated cubs have also been asked to submit a bank guarantee for Rs 25 lakh before August 14. The new guidelines have created some consternation with Football Delhi president Shaji Prabhakaran telling AIFF president Praful Patel “the financial conditions are very extreme and seem unfair, given the current economic scenario.” “The financial criteria is not in conformity with the current economic situation of clubs at the State level. These conditions should have been circulated to clubs well before the start of the season, helping them better understand the entire qualification process,” Prabhakaran wrote in a letter to Patel on Thursday. The AIFF, though, brushed aside concerns. “This year, unlike previous seasons, AIFF is bearing every expense for participating teams,” said I-League CEO Sunando Dhar, justifying the hike in participation fee. “From travel to boarding, lodging, local transport, stadium rent, training grounds, everything will be paid for by AIFF. Teams will be put up in five-star hotels. There will be nil expense for the clubs. AIFF will be spending quite a lot.” The bank guarantee, Dhar said, is being sought to ensure that teams who take part in the Qualifiers (September) are good enough to compete in the I-League (December). “There has to be a rationale in deciding the 10 teams. We felt since the Qualifiers and I-League will happen after the end of the transfer window (on August 31), a team which is seriously considering to play I-League will make sufficient investment. “We don’t want a team to win the Qualifiers and then say they cannot take part (in I-League). This is a guarantee money, not franchise fee. The bank guarantees will be returned to the clubs, once the tournament is over. We just have to ensure that the clubs have enough money to play the Qualifiers and I-League,” said Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-qualifiers-aiff-to-use-financial-criteria-as-tie-breaker-to-select-teams/articleshow/85114445.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||ISL: Nemil returns from Spain to join FC Goa||Panaji:Muhammed Nemil has returned home after a two-year stint in Spain and will join FC Goa for pre-season next week. The 19-year-old attacking midfielder spent four years with the Reliance Foundation Young Champs Academy in Mumbai and travelled to Spain in the summer of 2019 to train at the Marcet High-Performance Academy in Spain. When Nemil graduated from RFYC last year, he signed a four-year contract with Goa. The Indian Super League side allowed him to continue his development in Spain and have now decided to bring him home. “We felt like it was time for Nemil to compete with professional players in the ISL,” Ravi Puskur, director of football at Goa, told TOI on Friday. “It was necessary for us to see him here in person. Given how he has progressed in Spain, we want to see what he does in ISL.” After the training stint at Marcet, Nemil moved to Barcelona based third division club FE Grama to be part of their under-19 squad. He impressed and was soon promoted to the senior squad. While he didn’t make heads turn, Nemil did generate interest in Spain. La Liga side Rayo Vallecano made inquiries but felt he wasn’t yet ready for their reserves, which had an established team. A spot in the third team didn’t make sense; when he tried, it was too easy for him. Segunda side Sabadell FC also showed interest, though for their reserves. Rather than playing in the fifth tier in Spain, Goa thought it was best for him to play in ISL. At FC Goa, Nemil –who trained with the developmental squad last season -- will face competition to break into the team. “Nemil will have a role to play in the team,” said Puskur. “How big a role remains to be seen, based on coach Juan Ferrando’s plan and system. He is competing with some top-quality players in his position.” At the Reliance Foundation Young Champs Academy, Nemil was touted as the brightest prospect with Goa staving off challenge from other ISL clubs for his signature that keeps him at the club till 2024. Hailing from Kozhikode in Kerala, Nemil shot to fame in 2018 when he was named the best midfielder in the Super Division of the Mumbai District Football Association (MDFA) league. He also picked up the player of the tournament award at the Subroto Cup, an All-India U-17 inter-school football tournament. Nemil scored just three times during the 2016-17 season, but gave a good account of himself the next year when he had 17 goals and 16 assists in 47 matches. A year later, that tally was 25 goals and 15 assists from 53 games. “FC Goa have excellent depth in attack, but Nemil has undeniable potential. He’ll do well,” said Puskur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-nemil-returns-from-spain-to-join-fc-goa/articleshow/85114796.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||90,000 affected by floods in South Sudan: UN||NAIROBI: Heavy rains in South Sudan have forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes and exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in the troubled country, the United Nations said Friday. About 90,000 people have already been affected by flooding as unrelenting rains inundate homes, agricultural fields and push people and their livestock to higher grounds. Most of those affected are in the counties of Ayod and Canal in Jonglei state, the UN's humanitarian agency OCHA said in a statement. "For many, this is the second time they have faced flooding since May," it said. The young nation is still struggling to cope with the aftermath of a five-year civil war that left nearly 400,000 people dead. The fighting, marked by ethnic massacres, widespread rape and other forms of brutality, heightened poverty and crippled the production of crude oil, a major generator of revenue for the state. About 82 percent of the 11 million-strong population is poor, according to a April 2021 World Bank report. The flooding is seriously eroding people's ability to cope and survive, said OCHA's humanitarian coordinator Arafat Jamal. "What is occurring in Ayod is a distressing example of how a changing climate disrupts the normal patterns and intensifies the effects of flooding, leaving people disoriented and dispossessed," he said. "The people we met in Ayod and Canal faced acute humanitarian needs, yet their thoughts were directed to their brethren across the river, marooned on islands surrounded by water, sheltering under trees and unable to cross to safety." The United Nations called for urgent assistance, saying shelter, medicine and access to clean water was needed. "The imperative right now is to alleviate suffering, which we shall do with the resources at our disposal," said Jamal. "But we must also help communities to adapt to change, and we are also investing in longer term interventions, such as dyke building, that will help communities to better withstand recurring climate shocks."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/90000-affected-by-floods-in-south-sudan-un/articleshow/85114508.cms||---
---||India||SC: Judges under threat, CBI, IB & cops doing nothing||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said trial court judges, especially those dealing with cases involving gangsters and high-profile persons, are most vulnerable to external threats and bristled at the inaction of the CBI, Intelligence Bureau and the police in countering the threats to create a conducive atmosphere for judges to do justice without fear or favour. A bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justice Surya Kant said, "In criminal cases, involving gangsters and high profile persons, when the accused do not get expected orders from the courts, they start maligning the judiciary. Unfortunately, This is a new trend developing in this country. A situation is created where the Judges do not feel free to make a complaint. Even if the judges complain to the District Judge, Chief Justice of the HC or the CJI, and a complaint is forwarded to the police or the CBI, they do not respond. They do not think it is a priority issue." "The IB, CBI and police are not helping the judiciary at all (in providing an atmosphere for doing justice without fear or favour). I am making this statement with some sense of responsibility. It is a serious issue," the CJI said and sought attorney general K K Venugopal's assistance to chalk out a mechanism. The SC felt time has come to create a force that would dedicatedly provide security to judicial officers across the country, on the lines of specialised police forces like Railway Protection Force, CRPF or CISF. Venugopal gave an even more startling account of threats given to trial judges hearing cases involving gangsters, powerful and high-profile persons. "I am told that in many cases, a magistrate or sessions judge, who is about to take up a case involving a gangster or a very powerful person, gets a call saying that his daughter is going to such and such school, in a car with such and such registration number. Between justice and daughter's safety, the judge adjourns the case by six months. We must look into those criminal cases which are getting adjourned time and again for years together. So far as state governments are concerned, each must form a protection group for the judiciary." The CJI said: "We want to make one thing very clear. There are several cases in the country which involve gangsters to high profile people as accused. Some places in the states, the trial court and HC judges are threatened, not only physically but mentally, by sending abusive messages through Whatsapp, facebook and Youtube etc. One or two places the courts ordered CBI inquiry. I am very sorry to say that CBI has done nothing even after one year after the order. We expected some change in the attitude of the CBI." It ordered the states to file replies by August 17, the next date of hearing. SC asked the AG to ensure that the Centre files a response by that date. "All the states should appear and state what steps they have taken to provide security to the judges. We will take a final call and pass orders," the bench said. On the Dhanbad incident, the bench issued notice to the CBI and asked it to present before the court on August 9 the details of the investigation, which it took over from Jharkhand police on August 5. Jharkhand advocate general Ravi Ranjan said that the police had immediately arrested two persons who were riding the autorickshaw that appear to have mowed down the judge in the viral video clip. "They are being interrogated in custody," he said. The advocate general said that the 22-member Special Investigation is still investigating the case. "Since it is a border area with West Bengal, there are cross-border implications and larger conspiracy. We are considering that and that part has not been handed over," Ranjan said, adding that security has been beefed up in court and judges' residential complexes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-judges-under-threat-cbi-ib-cops-doing-nothing/articleshow/85114861.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

With Raksha Bandhan – the first festival of this season – just weeks away, the markets in NCR are all decked up, and the shoppers have begun to arrive. Markets like Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and Gurgaon’s Arjun Marg are once again seeing the kind of footfall they did pre-pandemic. With Raksha Bandhan just weeks away, markets in NCR are all decked upRachana, who has been to Gurgaon’s open markets a few times recently, says, “Markets are prepping for Raksha Bandhan. Given the pandemic, most of us won’t be travelling to extended family but mailing them our rakhis. So, going to the markets now when there is a smaller crowd makes sense. Beyond that, just wear masks, use hand sanitiser, and maintain social distancing and you should be okay.” Delhi resident Nilesh Kapoor adds, “Raksha Bandhan is almost here, and then Ganesh Chaturthi and Janmashtami are next. Shopping for these festivals can’t be done online. I am prepared to head to the markets given that vaccination has increased now. We have to get used to the new normal now.” NCR's shoppers have begun to arrive with safety measures in placeDespite the increased footfall, the shop owners maintain that there is no crowding and social distancing is maintained. “Of course, the footfall is high, so there is a risk of it getting crowded. But most shops have a cap on the number of people going inside. We discourage shoppers from crowding in one place. It is well-organised. We try to be as systematic as possible,” says a shop owner from Sarojini Nagar market. Most markets also have sanitisation and thermal screening processes in place. A shop owner from Arjun Marg tells us, “We have thermal screening and sanitising stations at the entrance. Additionally, most shops have sanitisers and everyone wears masks. We regularly tell people to not take off masks and we never take off our masks, too.” Shoppers say they don’t see safety precautions as a hassle but just a necessity. Asha Gupta, a Gurgaon resident, says, “The precautions are for our own safety so we should not get annoyed by them. In fact, if anything, we should avoid going to places where such precautions are not being taken. So far, I have observed that bigger markets are trying to keep things safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/festive-season-brings-back-normalcy-to-markets-across-ncr/articleshow/85103554.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

---||World||Vaccines less protective in Colorado county with Delta variant surge: CDC study||Covid-19 infections in a Colorado county with a Delta variant surge this spring were more common among fully vaccinated people than in the state's other counties where it was circulating at lower levels, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released on Friday showed. The study also found that the Delta variant caused more severe illness. Cases, hospital intensive care unit admissions and deaths were higher in Mesa County, Colorado, than anywhere else in the state, it said. The CDC recently said in a leaked report it believed the Delta variant was producing more severe illness among the unvaccinated than other versions of coronavirus, citing studies outside the United States. In Mesa County, the proportion of Delta variant cases more than doubled from 43% for the week ending May 1 to 88% for the week ending June 5. The study looked at data from April 27 to June 6 in the county, which accounted for half of Delta variant cases in the state. An estimated "crude efficacy" of Covid-19 vaccines against preventing infection among the fully vaccinated people in Mesa County was 78%, versus 89% for other Colorado counties where the variant was less dominant. The lower estimates may "lend support to previous findings that Covid-19 vaccines provide modestly lower protection against symptomatic infection with the Delta variant," the study found. In another study also published on Friday, CDC data showed that a person infected with Covid-19 who was fully vaccinated is less likely to be reinfected than someone who has had the virus but is unvaccinated. The analysis of 246 patients in Kentucky showed that state residents with previous Covid-19 infections who were unvaccinated had 2.34 times the odds of reinfection compared to those who were vaccinated and had been infected previously. "If you have had Covid-19 before, please still get vaccinated," CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/vaccines-less-protective-in-colorado-county-with-delta-variant-surge-cdc-study/articleshow/85113570.cms||---

Scott Fairlamb, 44, of Stockholm, New Jersey, entered guilty pleas to charges of assaulting police and obstructing an official proceeding during the attack on the Capitol by Donald Trump supporters trying to overturn his election defeat.  Prosecutors asked for a sentence of 41 to 51 months in prison. US District Judge Royce Lamberth said he would not sentence Fairlamb until he receives a pre-sentence report.  So far, one other Capitol riot defendant who pleaded guilty has been sentenced to serve an eight-month prison term, a law enforcement official said. A handful of defendants were sentenced to time served in pre-trial detention after pleading guilty.  In late July, Beryl Howell, chief federal judge in Washington, asked prosecutors to explain why a riot defendant was allowed to plead to a misdemeanor charge carrying a short prison sentence.  Harley Breite, Fairlamb's defense lawyer, told Lamberth that Fairlamb was willing to talk with FBI investigators, but had not yet done so.  Breite told Reuters that after his arrest, Fairlamb had lost a gym business which he operated.  An FBI affidavit said a concerned citizen submitted a video showing Fairlamb "shove and punch" a police officer during the riot. Video submitted by another member of the public showed Fairlamb climbing on a metal scaffolding outside the building.  More than 535 people have been charged with taking part in violence when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory.  Trump falsely claimed he lost the election because of widespread electoral fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ex-boxer-who-punched-cop-faces-longest-sentence-yet-in-us-capitol-riot/articleshow/85115030.cms||---

The plane crashed Thursday as the pilot was returning five passengers to Ketchikan from Misty Fjords National Monument, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The plane's emergency beacon was activated about 11:20 a.m. when it crashed near the monument, the US coast guard said. A helicopter company reported seeing wreckage on a ridgeline in the search area, and coast guard crew members found the wreckage around 2:40pm. A coast guard helicopter lowered two rescue swimmers to the site, and they reported no survivors, the agency said. The victims have not been identified, and troopers were working with volunteers from the Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad to coordinate recovery efforts. "Poor weather conditions and deteriorating visibility in the Ketchikan and Misty Fjords area have prevented the Alaska State Troopers and volunteers from the Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad from conducting any recovery efforts this morning,'' troopers spokesperson Austin McDaniel said in an email Friday to The Associated Press. Victims won't be named until they have identified them following recovery efforts, he said. All five passengers were on an excursion off the Holland America Line cruise ship Nieuw Amsterdam. The company was making counseling services available to guests and crew, it said in a statement. The plane involved Thursday, a de Havilland Beaver, was owned by Southeast Aviation LLC. "Our hearts are shattered at the loss of six people today. We are thinking of and grieving with the families of the five passengers and our dear friend and pilot aboard the aircraft,'' the company said in a Thursday evening statement. "We are cooperating with the first responders and agencies involved.'' Ketchikan is a popular stop for cruise ships visiting Alaska, and cruise ship passengers can take various sightseeing excursions while in port. Popular among them are small plane flights to Misty Fjords National Monument, where visitors can see glacier valleys, snow-capped peaks and lakes in the wilderness area. In 2019, two sightseeing planes collided in midair, killing six of the 16 people on board the two planes. The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a crew to investigate the crash. The team is expected to arrive in Alaska later Friday. The FAA is also investigating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/poor-weather-hampers-crash-victim-recovery-efforts-in-alaska/articleshow/85114849.cms||---

The pair of plea deals with federal prosecutors could be a benchmark for dozens of other cases in which Capitol rioters are charged with attacking police. An attorney for Scott Kevin Fairlamb, a former mixed martial arts fighter who owned Fairlamb Fit gym in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, said prosecutors are seeking a sentencing guideline range of about 3 1/2 to 4 1/4 years in prison. But the judge isn't bound by that recommendation. Later on Friday, the same judge in Washington, DC, ordered Devlyn Thompson to be jailed in Seattle after he pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon, a baton. Thompson, 28, of Puyallup, Washington, had been free since his participation in the Capitol riot. The pleas come less than two weeks after a group of police officers testified at a congressional hearing about their harrowing confrontations with the mob of insurrectionists. Five officers who were at the Capitol that day have died, four of them by suicide. The Justice Department has said that rioters assaulted approximately 140 police officers on January 6. About 80 of them were US Capitol police officers and about 60 were from the Washington, DC, Metropolitan police department. Fairlamb, 44, whose brother is a US secret service agent, was one of the very first rioters to breach the Capitol after other rioters smashed windows using riot shields and kicked out a locked door, according to federal prosecutors. After leaving the building, Fairlamb harassed a line of police officers, shouting in their faces and blocking their progress through the mob, prosecutors wrote in a court filing. A video showed him holding a collapsible baton and shouting, and shouting, "What (do) patriots do? We f___ disarm them and then we storm the f___ Capitol!'' US district judge Royce Lamberth set a sentencing date of September 27 for both Thompson and Fairlamb, who has been jailed since his January 22 arrest at his home in Stockholm, New Jersey. Thompson wasn't arrested after he was charged last month with one count of assaulting a Metropolitan police officer. His attorneys said in a court filing that he has autism spectrum disorder. They cited that as a reason for keeping him out of jail while awaiting sentencing. It wasn't immediately clear what prosecutors estimate the sentencing guidelines should be for Thompson's case. Fairlamb's lawyer, Harley Breite, said he will ask the judge for a sentence below the government's recommended guidelines. Fairlamb's involvement in the riot has "eviscerated large parts of his life,'' his attorney said. "He has lost his business. The mortgage on his home where he lives with his wife is in peril. And he has been publicly disgraced,'' Breite said during an interview after Friday's remote hearing. Breite said his client wanted to "pay the price for what he had done and then move on with his life.'' "It wasn't so much about the deal. It was about his desire to own up to what he had done, make himself a better person for the future and move on,'' the lawyer added. Fairlamb pleaded guilty to two counts, obstruction of an official proceeding and assaulting a Metropolitan police department officer. The counts carry a maximum of more than 20 years in prison. Another video captured Fairlamb shoving and punching a police officer in the head after he left the Capitol, according to an FBI agent's affidavit. "As a former MMA fighter, the defendant was well aware of the injury he could have inflicted on (the officer),'' prosecutors wrote. "His actions and words on that day all indicate a specific intent to obstruct a congressional proceeding through fear, intimidation, and violence, including violence against uniformed police officers.'' Fairlamb's brother was one of the secret service agents assigned to protect first lady Michelle Obama, Breite said. Fairlamb's social media accounts indicated that he subscribed to the QAnon conspiracy theory and promoted a bogus claim that former President Donald Trump would become the first president of "the new Republic'' on March 4, prosecutors wrote. QAnon has centered on the baseless belief that Trump was fighting against a cabal of Satan-worshipping, child sex trafficking cannibals, including "deep state'' enemies, prominent Democrats and Hollywood elites. The rioters sought to interrupt the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory and believed Trump's lies that he was robbed of a second term because of massive voter fraud nationwide. In fact, claims of massive fraud have been refuted by numerous judges, state election officials and even Trump's own administration. On July 27, a House panel investigating the deadly riot heard emotional testimony from four police officers who tried to defend the Capitol when the mob of Trump supporters stormed the building. At least nine people who were at the Capitol on January 6 died during or after the rioting, including Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who collapsed after he was sprayed by rioters with a chemical irritant. Four other police officers have died by suicide, including two Metropolitan Police officers who were found dead within the past month. Police shot and killed a woman, Ashli Babbitt, who was part of a group of people trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber. Three other Trump supporters who died had suffered medical emergencies. More than 560 people have been charged with federal crimes, and authorities are still searching for hundreds more. At least 165 defendants have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or Capitol employees, including more than 50 people charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer, the justice department said in July. Fairlamb and Thompson are at least the 32nd and 33rd defendants to plead guilty. Most of the others have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, including parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/capitol-rioters-enter-1st-guilty-pleas-to-assaulting-police/articleshow/85115739.cms||---

The statement came hours after the Lok Sabha passed the Bill meant to end tax disputes with 17 companies, including high profile ones such as Vodafone and Cairn Plc. Addressing exporters, businesses, states and Indian ambassadors in foreign missions at an event to work out a strategy to scale up India's exports to $400 billion this year, the PM said exporters know very well the importance of stability. "It sends a clear message to all investors that not only does India offer new opportunities, but a decisive government has the will to fulfil its promise," Modi said while talking about the legislation. He also said that the Centre was working closely with states to minimise the regulatory burden. While promising all possible support from the government to boost exports, Modi exhorted every stakeholder to play their role, with states governments and Indian missions advised to work together in identifying new product segments and markets. Modi said there were positive signs in the economy. "Today, we are not just seeing signs of recovery, but there are positive signs on high growth too. So, this is a good time to set high targets for exports." The $400 billion goal is seen to be ambitious as the government is looking to boost exports by 37% over last year's level. While seeking to corner a larger share of the global pie, the PM said there were four key focus areas to provide a thrust - stepping up manufacturing, removing logistical and transport-related challenges, working closely with exporters and getting international markets for Indian products. He identified quality and reliability as key attributes and urged businesses and the central and state governments to focus on them, citing how honey exports had received a fillip due to stringent testing, which improved quality. During the meeting, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said that the global environment is favourable and India should look at leveraging comparative and competitive advantages with respect to other countries for increasing our exports. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said while the theme was local goes global, the Indian missions needed to be "globally local" to help connect Indian producers with the demand in specific countries. Modi said, "Given the size of our economy, potential, and our manufacturing and services base, there is a massive scope for to increase exports. When the country has embarked on the path of Atmanirbhar Bharat, one key focus is to increase India's share in exports and global supply chain many times."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/boost-exports-to-400bn-this-year-pm-to-businessmen-envoys/articleshow/85115906.cms||---
---||World||Retired marine whose troops planted US flag on Iwo Jima dies||SAN DIEGO: Dave Severance, the Marine company commander whose troops planted the American flag on Iwo Jima during World War II, a moment captured in one of the most iconic war photographs in history, has died. He was 102. Severance died Monday at his home in the San Diego suburb of La Jolla, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Severance's company came ashore in the 10th wave of what eventually would be about 70,000 Marines invading the island, about 660 miles (about 1,000 kilometers) south of Tokyo. They were met by some 20,000 Japanese. On February 23, 1945, the fifth day of fighting, about 40 members of Severance's company were sent up Mount Suribachi with orders to plant the flag. When Navy Secretary James Forrestal, arrived on the island, he asked for it to be kept as a memento. After it was removed, Severance ordered a second group of Marines to replace the flag with a bigger one. The second raising of the flag on Mount Suribachi was captured in a dramatic photo by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal who won a Pulitzer Prize. The Marines would keep the first flag, and the Navy secretary would get the replacement, which flew over Mount Suribachi for the rest of the battle. Both flags are now at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Va. Severance spent his retirement quietly trying to set the record straight that there were two flag-raisings that February morning in 1945. He cared about the flag story, he told the Union-Tribune in a 2012 interview, because it spoke to the courage and sacrifice he witnessed every day for more than a month during the battle, one of the bloodiest of the war. About 75 percent of his company were wounded or killed. Severance earned a Silver Star. Born February 4, 1919, in Milwaukee, Severance grew up in Colorado and joined the Marines in 1938. After leading Marines in WWII, he went on to fly nearly 70 missions in Korea as an aviator. He retired from the Marine Corps in 1968. His death was first reported on Wednesday by The New York Times, which attributed the information about his passing to his family. His survivors include two daughters, Nina Cohen and Lynn Severance; two sons, Dave Jr and Mike Severance; and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was pre-deceased by his second wife, Barbara, who died in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/retired-marine-whose-troops-planted-us-flag-on-iwo-jima-dies/articleshow/85115738.cms||---
---||Business||Johnson & Johnson seeks approval for single-dose Covid vax||MUMBAI: US firm Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has sought Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine in India. Once approved, it will be the fifth vaccine to get EUA after Serum Institute’s Covishield, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, Dr Reddy’s SputnikV and Moderna. Earlier this week, the company had said that it was finalising its plans, soon after withdrawing its application for conducting local studies. Without elaborating on vaccine manufacturing plans, J&J said its collaboration with Hyderabad-based Biological E will be an important part of its global supply chain network. The company had tied up with Bio E last year. ``This is an important milestone that paves the way to bringing our single-dose Covid-19 vaccine to the people of India, and the rest of the world, through a collaboration with Biological E Limited. Biological E will be an important part of our global supply chain network, helping to supply our Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine through the extensive collaborations and partnerships we have with governments, health authorities and organisations such as Gavi and the COVAX Facility’’, a J&J spokesperson said. The EUA submission is based on topline efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial, which demonstrated that the single-shot vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied, and showed protection against Covid-19 related hospitalization and death, after 28 days of vaccination, a company statement said. J&J had withdrawn its application to India’s drug regulator as there is no requirement of local bridging trials, after the policy-tweak of fast-tracking foreign-produced Covid-19 vaccines. Though the revised policy to facilitate the entry of imported vaccines was announced in April, there has not been progress in the launch of any foreign-made vaccines, so far. Talks with foreign companies-- Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, have been on for months, but there is no decision by the government yet on granting the manufacturers indemnity from lawsuits. According to the new policy, vaccines approved by Western regulators including the USFDA, UK’s MHRA & WHO will be granted emergency authorisation, with the company conducting post-approval parallel bridging studies, in place of prior local clinical trials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/johnson-johnson-seeks-approval-for-single-dose-covid-vax/articleshow/85116363.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||World||Indiana University students urge US Supreme Court to block Covid vaccine mandate||Students at Indiana University on Friday asked the US Supreme Court to block the school's requirement that they be vaccinated against Covid-19 in an early test of vaccine mandates amid a spike in infections and hospitalizations caused by the Delta variant.  The students filed an emergency request with the justices after lower courts rejected their bid for an injunction against the vaccine mandate while litigation continues.  Beginning this fall, the university requires that students be vaccinated unless they qualify for a religious or medical exemption. Those granted exceptions would be required to wear face masks and be tested twice weekly.  Eight students sued in June, contending that the mandate violates their right to "bodily integrity" and due process under the US Constitution's 14th Amendment.  The university "is treating its students as children who cannot be trusted to make mature decisions," the students said in Friday's filing, requesting that the justices act by Aug. 13.  Covid-19 vaccines have become a political flashpoint in the United States as the highly contagious Delta variant is hitting states with lower vaccination rates particularly hard.  Hundreds of colleges and universities have already mandated the Covid-19 vaccine, as have some private employers. The students' case presents one of the first challenges to the legality of these mandates.  In July, US district court judge Damon Leichty in South Bend, Indiana, rebuffed, finding that the university's policy "isn't forced vaccination."  On August 2 the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to bar the mandate, noting that "vaccination requirements, like other public-health measures, have been common in this nation."  The appeals court added: "A university will have trouble operating when each student fears that everyone else may be spreading disease."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/indiana-university-students-urge-us-supreme-court-to-block-covid-vaccine-mandate/articleshow/85116446.cms||---
---||World||Biden taps major donors for Argentina and Switzerland envoys||WILMINGTON: President Joe Biden is nominating two major Democratic donors to serve as ambassadors to Argentina and Switzerland. The White House announced Friday that Biden has picked LGBT rights activist and philanthropist Scott Miller to serve as his administration's envoy to Buenos Aires and trial lawyer Marc Stanley to serve in Bern. The US ambassador to Switzerland also serves as the chief envoy to Liechtenstein. Miller, a former account vice president at UBS Wealth Management in Denver, and his husband, Tim Gill, are prominent philanthropists and generous backers of Democratic candidates and causes. In 2016, Miller served on the board of the pro-Hillary Clinton group Correct the Record before joining the group Draft Biden. Stanley, a prominent Dallas attorney, was chairman for the Lawyers for Biden arm of the 2020 campaign, recruiting lawyers across the country to donate legal services to the president's run for the White House. Presidents often dispense prime ambassadorships as rewards to political allies and top donors. Those appointments often come with an expectation that the appointees can foot the bill for entertaining on behalf of the United States in pricey, high-profile capitals. About 44% of Donald Trump's ambassadorial appointments were political appointees, compared with 31% for Barack Obama and 32% for George W Bush, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Biden hopes to keep political appointments to about 30% of ambassador picks, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal discussions. To be certain, most political appointees from the donor class, a small population that's made up of predominantly white men, have historically had little impact on foreign policy. Other major donors to receive ambassadorial nominations from Biden include Denise Bauer (France and Monaco), David Cohen (Canada) and Cynthia Telles (Costa Rica). The White House also announced Biden is nominating career senior foreign service officer David Gilmour to serve as ambassador to Equatorial Guinea. Gilmour has held a series of high-ranking state department positions and is a former ambassador to Togo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-taps-major-donors-for-argentina-and-switzerland-envoys/articleshow/85116606.cms||---
---||India||On 'public wish', Khel Ratna renamed after Dhyan Chand||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday announced that India's highest sporting award will be renamed after hockey wizard Major Dhyan Chand, a change which effectively removes "Rajiv Gandhi" prefix to the Khel Ratna. The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, launched in 1991-92, comprising a medallion, a certificate and a cash prize of Rs 25 lakh, will now be known as the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award. Chess legend Viswanathan Anand was its first recipient. The announcement sparked a discussion over the "political overtones" of the decision though Modi tweeted that he had been getting many requests from citizens across the country to name the Khel Ratna Award after Major Dhyan Chand. "Respecting their sentiment, the Khel Ratna Award will hereby be called the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award," the PM said and shared a picture paying floral tributes to Major Dhyan Chand. I have been getting many requests from citizens across India to name the Khel Ratna Award after Major Dhyan Chand.… https://t.co/rdHleXA1yw— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1628232952000The PM, who has been interacting with the Indian contingent participating in the Tokyo Olympics and had also urged the nation to keep encouraging the Indian players, said the exceptional performance of the men's and women's hockey teams has captured the imagination of the entire nation. "There is a renewed interest towards hockey that is emerging across the length and breadth of India. This is a very positive sign for the coming times," he added. BJP hailed the announcement made by PM Modi with home minister Amit Shah calling it a "true tribute to one of India's greatest sportspersons". "Naming the country's highest sports honour in the name of the country's greatest sportsperson Major Dhyan Chand is a true tribute to him. The decision will make everyone associated with the sporting world proud," Shah said. Defence minister Rajnath Singh said Dhyan Chand is a symbol of inspiration and pride for Indian sportspersons. BJP President J P Nadda said, "Naming the highest sporting honour after the 'magician of hockey' is a welcome decision and the nation embraces it." Party MP Gautam Gambhir, a member of two cricket World Cup winning teams, said the Khel Ratna Award should have been named after a sport's personality when it was launched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-public-wish-khel-ratna-renamed-after-dhyan-chand/articleshow/85116954.cms||---
---||World||Dixie Fire becomes third largest in California history||GREENVILLE: A huge wildfire tearing through northern California became the third largest in the state's history Friday, and looked set to continue growing.  A long-term drought that scientists say is driven by climate change has left the western United States parched -- and vulnerable to explosive and highly destructive fires.  The Dixie Fire, which this week razed the Gold Rush town of Greenville, has torched more than 1,700 square kilometers (650 square miles) since it erupted in mid-July.  Plumas County Sheriff Todd Johns, who is helping to co-ordinate the fight against the fire, said the destruction was devastating.  "I am a lifelong resident of Greenville. My heart is crushed by what has occurred there," he told a briefing on Thursday.  "To the folks that have lost residences and businesses... their life is now forever changed.  "All I can tell you is: I'm sorry."  The town of Greenville stood charred and in ruins Friday, with timber structures gone completely and some stone buildings reduced to rubble. Todds said there were no injuries so far from the huge blaze, but stressed it was vital that people in the path of the fire heeded evacuation warnings.  "This fire is not over. If that plume is anywhere near your direction... you need to prepare. Wherever the wind blows this fire, that's where it's going to go."  Over 5,000 personnel are battling the blaze, which is sending enormous clouds of smoke into the air that are easily visible from space.  The Dixie Fire grew overnight to more than 430,000 acres (174,000 hectares), making it larger than the Bootleg fire that has laid waste to a swathe of Oregon over the last month.  Thousands of square kilometers of the western United States has burned this year, an alarming result of the warming planet that has affected weather patterns.  By late July, the number of acres burned in California was up more than 250 percent from 2020 -- itself the worst year of wildfires in the state's modern history.  The Dixie Fire has evoked painful memories of the Paradise Fire, the deadliest blaze in California's recent history.  Faulty power lines sparked the inferno, which swept through the northern town of Paradise in 2018, killing 86 people. Pacific Gas and Electric, California's largest energy utility firm, was deemed responsible.  PG&E equipment is again being blamed for the Dixie Fire, after a tree fell on a power conductor the day the blaze began.  The utility announced in late July it will bury 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers) of power lines in a massive bid to prevent its equipment from igniting more deadly wildfires.  Greenville itself is no stranger to fire disasters. A catastrophic blaze destroyed much of the town in 1881, and several major infernos have threatened residents in the intervening 140 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/dixie-fire-becomes-third-largest-in-california-history/articleshow/85117089.cms||---
---||India||Fill up vacancies or scrap 15 tribunals: Apex court to govt||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday lashed out at the Centre for virtually rendering the 15 major tribunals defunct by not filling large number of vacancies of presiding officers, judicial and technical members for a long periods and gave a 10 day ultimatum to the government to "clearly specify whether it wanted to continue the tribunals or close them down". Pointing out the vacancies of 20 presiding officers, 110 judicial members, 111 technical members in tribunals across India, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant said "Our own suspicion is that some lobbies are working to ensure these vacancies are not filled...We do not know what is the stand of the government on this sorry state of affairs." It asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to inform the court in 10 days about filling up of vacancies for which statutory selection committees headed by SC judges have recommended names long back. The tribunals include Armed Forces Tribunal, National Green Tribunal, DRT, CESTAT, ITAT, TDSAT, NCLT, NCLAT and Central Administrative Tribunal. It posted the matter for further hearing on August 16. On a PIL filed by advocate Amit Sahni, the CJI-led bench also lashed out at the finance ministry for its failure to set up the important CGST Appellate Tribunal more than four years after the CGST Act came into force. "Any person aggrieved by the GST authority or the revision authority, is entitled to approach the appellate tribunal within 90 days. You were mandated by the CGST Act to create an appellate tribunal. Even after four years, you have not been able to set up an appellate tribunal." "So many orders passed by the GST authority or revisional authority are not dispatched for the reason that the aggrieved persons would then be bound by the 90 day limitation period for filing appeals before the appellate authority, which does not exist. So, the finance ministry passed an administrative order on December 3, 2019 waiving off limitation period because of non-constitution of the appellate tribunal. What is this? I do not understand," the CJI said. The bench told Mehta that apart from certain lobbies having a vested interest in keeping the tribunals non-functional, it also gathered an impression that the bureaucracy too is disinterested in allowing the tribunals to adjudicate disputes. The tribunals were created to take load off the High Courts in litigations relating to specialised sectors. CJI said, "We must know whether the government really wants to continue with the tribunals or close them down. The impression which we are gathering is that some bureaucrats do not want the tribunals. We heard that you had attempted to reduce the tenure and changed qualification criteria despite repeated decisions from the Supreme Court." The bench said, "This is a very sorry state of affairs. Within a week, the government must take a call and inform us. Otherwise, we will be forced to call top officers of the country to appear and explain why appointments are not made. We are very serious on this issue. Do not precipitate the matter. Wherever the selection committees have recommended the names, the appointments can be made immediately." The CJi had done his homework and came prepared to back his apprehensions about the government's intentions behind non-filling of posts in tribunals. He said, "As per the available data, Debt Recovery Tribunals, there is no chairperson in 15 places. In DRAT, one post is vacant. Appellate Tribunal for forfeited properties, no one is there and is closed. These posts are vacant since December 2019. TDSAT there is no one. The NCLT president is not there and the posts of nine judicial and 14 technical members are vacant. We had recommended names of 11 judicial members and 10 technical members as far back as May 27, 2020. We still do not know why they have not been appointed." "The National Consumer Dispute Resolution Commission (NCDRC) has three technical members posts vacant. Justice D Y Chandrachud-led selection committee had recommended names of eight judicial and six technical members on June 24, 2020. You have appointed only two. In AFT, posts of 13 judicial and 10 technical members are vacant. Justice A M Khanwilkar committee had recommended names on November 6, 2020. We do not know what happened. In NGT, posts of 14 judicial and 16 technical members are vacant, Justice S K Kaul committee had recommended names. Again, we do not know what happened to that." "ITAT has 25 judicial and 27 technical members' posts vacant. Justice Khanwilkar-led committee had recommended 35 names in October 2019. No steps have been taken to make the appointments good. In the Railways claims tribunal posts of 20 judicial and five technical members are vacant. In CESTAT, posts of 16 technical members are not filled. The CAT president has retired and there are vacancies of 18 judicial and 14 technical members," the CJI said, reading out from the data collated by the SC registry. Justice Kant said, "You cannot defunct the tribunals. If you do not want the tribunals, then allow us (SC) to restore the jurisdiction of the HCs over these subjects. You cannot keep people remediless. People are entitled to go somewhere. If you do not want the tribunals, then let the people go to HCs. If you want tribunals, then fill up the vacancies. Recommendations for appointments for the vacant posts in various tribunals were made by various selection committees strictly in accordance with the procedure mandated by the statute governing the tribunals."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fill-up-vacancies-or-scrap-15-tribunals-apex-court-to-govt/articleshow/85117138.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The EU list currently includes two dozen countries, including the United States, Japan and Australia, which are considered safe from a health perspective under the ongoing pandemic.  Next week's meeting "could" also assess the situation in relation to the United States, one EU official told Reuters, without elaborating because no decision has been made yet.  EU officials regularly review the list as the pandemic evolves.  The bloc has repeatedly asked Washington to let in EU citizens after the United States was added in June to the so-called white list.  "Many representatives of the EU member states and of the EU have spoken to our US counterparts about the plans to reopen the country for visitors from the EU countries, in particular after Europe's step to allow the US citizens to travel," a spokesperson for the Slovenian EU presidency said.  "We all consider people-to people contacts to be the building block of strong, successful transatlantic partnership and alliance, so we keep reminding, asking and encouraging our US friends to follow suit," the spokesperson added.  The list is non-binding, although EU governments tend to apply it. They can however ignore it and let in citizens from countries which are not on the list, or vice versa.  The 27-nation bloc is divided among states who are pushing for reciprocity from the US, and others who are more reliant on tourism and could be reluctant to remove Washington from the list, officials have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/eu-to-review-safe-travel-list-could-reconsider-us-status-source/articleshow/85117142.cms||---

The extension of the pause, which was due to expire on Sept. 30, comes as cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus continue to surge around the United States.  The Department of Education "believes this additional time and a definitive end date will allow borrowers to plan for the resumption of payments and reduce the risk of delinquency and defaults after restart," a White House statement said.  The department, the statement said, will begin notifying borrowers about the final extension in the coming days and "release resources and information about how to plan for payment restart as the end of the pause approaches."  "It is the department's priority to support students and borrowers during this transition and ensure they have the resources they need to access affordable, high-quality higher education," the statement quoted Education Secretary Miguel Cardona as saying. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and two fellow Democratic lawmakers hailed the extension, but they said the measure did not go far enough.  "Our broken student loan system continues to exacerbate racial wealth gaps and hold back our entire economy," he said in a statement with Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Ayanna Pressley. "We continue to call on the administration to use its existing executive authority to cancel $50,000 of student debt (per borrower)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-announces-final-extension-of-student-loan-repayment-pause/articleshow/85117166.cms||---
---||Business||Win for Amazon: SC upholds Singapore panel’s ruling against Reliance-Future Retail deal||NEW DELHI: In a setback to the proposed Rs 24,713-crore Future-Reliance deal, the Supreme Court on Friday held that Singapore’s Emergency Arbitrator (EA) award restraining Future Retail Ltd (FRL) from going ahead with its merger with Reliance Retail is valid and enforceable and allowed the plea of US ecommerce giant Amazon, which had challenged the Ambani-Biyani pact. A bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai quashed the order passed by a division bench of the Delhi high court, which virtually allowed Kishore Biyani’s Future group to go ahead with the deal by staying the single bench order that had directed the group to maintain status quo in view of Singapore’s EA award. The SC bench also ruled that the order passed by the single bench of the HC for the enforcement of the Singapore arbitration award was not appealable and could not have been challenged. The bench framed two questions arising out of the corporate battle for adjudication- first whether an award of Emergency Arbitrator under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre can be deemed to be an order under the Arbitration Act, and second, whether an order passed for enforcement of the award by a single judge of the HC can be appealed. The SC passed verdict in favour of Amazon on both counts. “We, therefore, answer the first question by declaring that full party autonomy is given by the Arbitration Act to have a dispute decided in accordance with institutional rules which can include Emergency Arbitrators delivering interim orders, described as ‘awards’. Such orders are an important step in aid of decongesting the civil courts and affording expeditious interim relief to the parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/win-for-amazon-sc-upholds-singapore-panels-ruling-against-reliance-future-retail-deal/articleshow/85117185.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||World||The FDA is aiming to speed extra vaccine doses for immunocompromised patients||The Food and Drug Administration is speeding efforts to authorize extra doses of the coronavirus vaccines for Americans with weakened immune systems, a change that reflects a growing concern within the Biden administration about these vulnerable patients as the contagious delta variant surges nationwide. The regulatory move would mean that people with impaired immune responses who need an extra shot, such as certain cancer patients, would be able to get one legally. That is a safer alternative than patients seeking shots on their own, as many now do, several experts said. "The data are unequivocal that they have not gotten a good response to begin with" and need additional doses, Dr. Anthony Fauci, lead medical adviser to the White House on the pandemic, said in an interview Friday. Compared with other Americans, "there is much, much more of a compelling reason to do that sooner rather than later," he said. The benefit of vaccinating these patients may extend well beyond this group. Persistent infection with the coronavirus in immunocompromised people may lead to more transmissible or virulent variants, according to recent research. Protecting these patients may help prevent variants from emerging. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA had been exploring special programs to get additional shots to immunocompromised patients. Now the FDA aims to modify the emergency authorizations of at least two of the vaccines, if data from the CDC support such a move, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The move, expected this month, was first reported by The Washington Post. Full approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is expected by early September, perhaps even sooner. "If you told me that full approval is expected by February, I would say that’s a long time for immunosuppressed people to wait," said Dr Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins University. "But the next month will bring us a lot of data." Fauci earlier in the week distinguished between booster shots for people who are fully vaccinated but may be seeing waning immunity, for which the scientific rationale is not yet clear, and additional shots for people with impaired immune systems. Research indicates that at least some of the latter group need extra doses. The World Health Organization on Thursday decried the move toward booster shots for fully vaccinated people in rich countries, saying poor nations urgently need the extra doses. But officials took pains to add that this criticism did not refer to extra doses for people with weakened immune systems, who may not have been fully protected to begin with. Since April, France has offered third doses to certain people with poor immune responses, and Germany and Hungary recently followed suit. But in many European countries, the strategy is not limited only to these patients but also includes the older adults, for example, or those who received the AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. In the United States, at least 3% of the population is immunocompromised because of medical reasons such as some cancers, organ transplants, chronic liver disease, kidney failure and dialysis, or because of widely prescribed medications such as Rituxan, steroids and methotrexate. With the delta variant surging, some of these patients and their physicians have been pleading with federal agencies to open a regulatory path to third doses. Although advisers to the CDC have long seemed to favor the idea, the FDA had not yet done so. Older adults and people with some conditions that suppress the immune system are routinely given extra doses of the vaccines for influenza and hepatitis B. That experience provides a sound justification for offering additional doses to some older adults and people whose immune responses are muted, said Dr Balazs Halmos, an oncologist at the Montefiore Medical Center in the New York City borough of the Bronx. "Being very proactive makes sense to me," Halmos said. "I would love to see the FDA quickly making that stand and maybe following these countries in terms of their proactive approach." But other experts are more circumspect. Scientists are still unsure which groups of immunocompromised people will benefit from a third dose. "I think you can justify both positions," said Dr Helen Boucher, an infectious disease physician at Tufts Medical Center. "Germany is justified in what they’re doing, but I also feel like we’re justified in hanging back because the information is far from perfect." Boucher said she empathizes with patients who are immunosuppressed. But "the bottom line is, we need more information," she added. That information has been trickling in far too slowly for some Americans. Deborah Rogow, 70, has multiple myeloma and is worried about the spread of the contagious delta variant. Rogow said having a doctor prescribe a third dose if necessary would have been ideal. For the moment, she is on her own, so Rogow plans to get a third dose of the Moderna vaccine next week at a pharmacy in Santa Barbara, California. The Moderna vaccine is still far from full approval, she noted, but she did not want to get a Pfizer/BioNTech dose without more data on mixing the two vaccines. "I definitely would have appreciated if I could have had my doctor say to do it," she said. "But it’s coming a little too late." Additional doses may help some people with weak immune systems, but others may show little improvement even after a third dose, and still others may not need extra doses at all. In a study of organ-transplant recipients, only one-third of the patients who got a third dose showed a benefit. "I wish we had a more rational process to identify individuals within these categories who actually need it versus not," said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona. There are safety concerns with enhancing immunity in patients whose responses are suppressed for a reason. One patient in the transplant study rejected her heart after receiving a third dose, said Segev, who led the research. Patients who have autoimmune conditions may experience flares when their immunity is enhanced. "You’re walking this fine line between wanting the immune system suppressed but also needing the immune system activated to get a good vaccine response," Segev said. There is also not much long-term data on people who have received third doses, he noted: "I don’t think there is strong evidence that a third dose is safe yet there is encouraging evidence." In the meantime, he suggests that the safest way for people with weak immune systems to get a third dose is to enroll in research studies where they can be closely monitored. The coronavirus persists for much longer than usual in some immunocompromised people and has opportunities to make big evolutionary leaps, according to a study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Some variants now in circulation may have arisen in that way, researchers have said, and leaving people with impaired immune systems unprotected may open the door to more dangerous variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/the-fda-is-aiming-to-speed-extra-vaccine-doses-for-immunocompromised-patients/articleshow/85117182.cms||---
---||World||Arkansas judge blocks state from enforcing mask mandate ban||LITTLE ROCK: An Arkansas judge on Friday temporarily blocked the state from enforcing its ban on mask mandates after lawmakers left the prohibition in place despite a rising number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox issued a preliminary injunction against the law that Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed in April banning mask requirements by governmental entities. The ban was being challenged by two lawsuits, including one from an east Arkansas school district where more than 900 staff and students are quarantining because of a coronavirus outbreak.  Fox ruled against the measure on multiple grounds, including the argument that it discriminated between public and private schools.  The law "cannot be enforced in any shape, fashion or form" pending further court action, Fox said.  Fox issued the ruling hours after lawmakers adjourned a special session that Hutchinson had called to consider rolling back the ban for some schools. Hutchinson had said the change was needed to protect children under 12 who can't get vaccinated as the state's virus cases and hospitalizations skyrocket.  Hutchinson faced heavy opposition from fellow Republicans, who had been inundated with calls and messages from opponents of masks in schools.  The governor, who has said he regretted signing the ban into law, said he agreed with Fox's decision but didn't plan to reimpose the statewide mask mandate he lifted in March. He also criticized lawmakers who opposed taking action, saying many of them had taken a "casual, if not cavalier, attitude" toward the state's Covid-19 crisis.  "What concerns me is many are simply listening to the loudest voices and not standing up with compassion, common sense and serious action," he told reporters.  Hutchinson was named as a defendant in the lawsuit along with the state and legislative leaders. He left open the possibility of separately asking the state Supreme Court to uphold Fox's ruling when it's appealed.  A House panel on Thursday rejected two measures that would have allowed some school districts to issue mask requirements.  There had been growing calls to lift the ban before school starts statewide later this month, and Little Rock's mayor issued a mask mandate on Thursday for the city's parks and in buildings, despite the prohibition.  The Marion School District, which joined with Little Rock's schools in challenging the ban, on Friday said 949 staff and students have had to quarantine since classes began last week because of a coronavirus outbreak. The district said 54 students and 11 staff have tested positive for Covid-19.  Marion Superintendent Glen Fenter warned lawmakers that his district's experience could be a harbinger of what other schools will face. He said Friday he will consult with attorneys and will begin discussing the possibility of a mandate with the local school board.  "This gives us another opportunity again to potentially protect our students," he said.  Pediatricians and health officials have said masks in schools are needed to protect children, as the delta variant and Arkansas' low vaccination rate fuels the state's spiraling cases. The state on Monday reported its biggest one-day increase in Covid-19 hospitalizations since the pandemic began, and the Department of Health on Friday said only 28 intensive care unit beds were available in the state.  Only 37% of the state's population is fully vaccinated against the virus.  Arkansas ranks second in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state reported more than 3,000 new virus cases on Friday, bringing its total since the pandemic began to more than 400,000. It also reported 22 new Covid-19 deaths.  Opponents of lifting the ban who testified before the Legislature repeatedly cited false and discredited claims about the virus, including a woman who falsely suggested Covid-19 doesn't exist.  "That's what's frustrating, is we're not making decisions on data, respected data," Democratic Rep. Denise Garner, who co-sponsored one of the proposals to lift the ban.  The Republican sponsor of the mandate ban said he thinks the state needs to focus on other ways to address outbreaks in schools, such as leave for teachers who have to quarantine.  "What I don't want is this false sense of security that masks seem to be providing because it's an easy political tool," said Republican Sen. Trent Garner. "Let's come up with the real solutions when this happens in our schools, and I think we're woefully inadequate on that."  The House and Senate on Friday gave final approval to the only other item on the session's agenda, legislation aimed at preventing the state from resuming supplemental unemployment insurance payments to 69,000 people in the state.  A state judge last week ordered Arkansas to resume the payment, ruling that Hutchinson didn't appear to have the authority on his own to cut off the payments. Hutchinson was among more than two dozen GOP governors who ended their states' participation in the federally funded payments, which were scheduled to run through early September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/arkansas-judge-blocks-state-from-enforcing-mask-mandate-ban/articleshow/85117266.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: India to partner China, Russia & Brazil for genomic sequencing||NEW DELHI: Indian Scientists, in partnership with experts from China, Russia and Brazil, will carry out genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and work on the epidemiology and mathematical modelling of the Covid-19 pandemic. "This will help trace genetic mutations, re-combinations as well as distribution of the virus and also make predictions about the future of its spread," the ministry of science and technology said in a statement on Friday, while announcing the collaborative approach among the countries under the BRICS-Multilateral Research and Development Project. "The study will provide a common platform to share and analyse the data of four different countries and understand the spread routes and transmission dynamics of viruses," it said. A whole-genome sequencing is required for identification of genetic mutations and recombinations of the coronavirus, while epidemiological studies can help assess its distribution. On the other hand, mathematical modelling is required to assess the future spread of Covid-19. Under the joint research, the Indian and Brazilian sides will assess distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples through metagenome analysis for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) surveillance. Chinese and Russian scientists will carry out the real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in biological material (nasopharyngeal swabs) from patients with symptoms of respiratory diseases and investigate the genomic variability, comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis. "The genomic, metagenomic and epidemiological data from India, China, Russia and Brazil will be integrated to develop mathematical models for mutations analysis, population genetics, phylogenetic relationship, recombination analysis and risk evaluation to reveal spread network and dynamics of the virus," said the ministry. The move will help trace spread routes and dynamics of the virus. The database developed by the different groups will also compare the distribution and survival of the virus in the different regions and establish the surveillance of the relevant early warning system. The collaborative research plan has been developed considering the strengths of international collaborators from the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences of China, Federal Research Centre of Fundamental and Translational Medicine of Russia and Respiratory Virus and Measles Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute of Brazil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-india-to-partner-china-russia-brazil-for-genomic-sequencing/articleshow/85117306.cms||---

Posting a picture of his meeting with the girl's family on Wednesday, Gandhi had tweeted in Hindi: "Parents' tears are saying only one thing- their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice." The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had asked the Delhi Police and Twitter on Wednesday to take action over Gandhi posting the photo of the girl's family on the microblogging website, saying it violates the Juvenile Justice Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. A click on the tweet led to a message that read: "This tweet violated the Twitter rules." Gandhi met the girl's family members on Wednesday and asserted that he is with them on the path to justice and "will not back down even an inch".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dalit-girls-death-rahuls-tweet-with-picture-of-victims-kin-no-longer-available-on-website/articleshow/85117601.cms||---
---||Kochi||Marital rape can be ground for divorce: Kerala HC||KOCHI: Marital rape can be accepted as a ground to grant divorce by recognising it as a form of cruelty, the Kerala high court has held. The Supreme Court had, in 2019, turned down a plea to accept marital rape as a ground for divorce. The high court gave its ruling while hearing an appeal filed by a husband against a divorce granted by a family court in 2014. “Treating wife’s body as something owing to husband and committing sexual act against her will is nothing but marital rape. Right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity encompass bodily integrity; any disrespect or violation of bodily integrity is a violation of individual autonomy...,” the high court said. Though such conduct cannot be penalised, it falls in the frame of physical and mental cruelty,” said a division bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and Kauser Edappagath, while referring to the allegation of unnatural sex against the husband. The case involves a doctor who married the daughter of a realtor in February 1995. A car, a flat and 501 sovereigns of gold were gifted but the husband suffered heavy losses in real-estate business. The father-in-law had also given Rs 77 lakh to the man to pay off debts and it was also alleged that he misappropriated the gold. The woman sought a divorce in 2009. The HC also said a uniform, secular law on marriage and divorce that makes it easier for a spouse to exercise his/her free will to separate is the need of the hour. The HC said the present legislation on divorce curtails an individual’s free will to separate by limiting it through defined grounds, such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, etc. “A spouse in a marriage has a choice, a choice not to suffer, which is fundamental to the autonomy guaranteed under natural law and the Constitution. Law cannot compel a spouse to suffer against his/her wish by denial of divorce,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/marital-rape-can-be-ground-for-divorce-kerala-hc/articleshow/85117907.cms||---

The NIA stated that a case was registered on June 29 at New Delhi, in connection with the conspiracy of the proscribed terrorist organisation Islamic State (IS) to radicalise and recruit impressionable Muslim youth to wage violent jihad against India. IS terrorists operating from various conflict zones, along with IS cadres in India, have allegedly created a network by assuming pseudo-online identities, wherein IS-related propaganda materials are disseminated for radicalising and recruiting members to the IS fold, according to NIA. ‘Abu Hazir Al Badri’ (cyber entity), a key operative of IS, who is involved in the translation of ‘Voice of Hind’ to South Indian languages and its further dissemination, was identified as Jufri Jawhar Damudi, a resident of Bhatkal. He was arrested in a joint operation by the NIA and Karnataka police. The cyber ID was also allegedly used to radicalise and recruit people. Jawhar is the younger brother of Adnan Hasan Damudi, who was arrested for IS-related activities in 2016. He is currently under detention in a separate NIA case. Jawhar was allegedly in touch with IS leadership currently operating out of the Af-Pak region, who provided him propaganda material, and also gave directions for its dissemination, NIA said, adding for this purpose Jufri had created multiple pseudonymous IDs on encrypted chat platforms, and was also a member of various online propaganda channels of IS. During the searches conducted on Friday, a large number of digital devices like cellphones, hard disks and SD cards were seized. NIA had conducted multiple searches in Jammu & Kashmir on July 11 and arrested three accused — Umar Nisar, Tanveer Ahmad Bhat and Rameez Ahmad Lone—all residents of Achabal in Anantnag. An investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/nia-picks-up-bhatkal-man-for-suspected-is-links/articleshow/85110442.cms||---

The decided to keep the policy repo rate (the rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks) unchanged at 4%. It also retained the GDP forecast for FY22 at 9.5%, while raising the inflation forecast to 5.7%, stating that it expects the pressure to ease on the prices front with the arrival of the kharif crop and the impact of the supply side measures. This is the seventh consecutive meeting when the RBI has kept rates unchanged. "The outlook for aggregate demand is improving, but the underlying conditions are still weak. Aggregate supply is also lagging below pre-pandemic levels. While several steps have been taken to ease supply constraints, more needs to be done. The recent inflationary pressures are evoking concerns; but the current assessment is that these pressures are transitory and largely driven by adverse supply side factors," RBI governor Shaktikant Das said in his policy statement. "The conduct of monetary policy during the pandemic has been geared to maintain congenial financial conditions that nurture and rejuvenate growth. At this stage, therefore, continued policy support from all sides - fiscal, monetary and sectoral - is required to nurture the nascent and hesitant recovery," said Das. The implication for borrowers is that there is not much scope for interest rates to come down, barring some pass-through of earlier cuts by lenders. The RBI has cut the repo rate by 250 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) since February 2019 and banks have responded with a 217 bps cumulative decline in their weighted average lending rate. Das said that the country was in a much better position than it was in June 2021 but advised caution. "The need of the hour is not to drop our guard and to remain vigilant against any possibility of a third wave, especially in the background of rising infections in certain parts of the country," he said. Announcing the MPC decision, Das said that members were unanimous on retaining the repo rate at 4%. However, one member, J R Varma, voted against the proposal to continue with the 'accommodative' stance. "The decision of keeping the repo rate unchanged along with maintaining of accommodative stance is on expected lines as low-interest rates are critical to an economic revival," said S S Mallikarjuna Rao, MD & CEO, Punjab National Bank. Das said that the new variable rate reverse repo, which could soak up a large part of liquidity was not a reversal of the accommodative phase. He said that the policy had to be nuanced as it had to address conflicting objectives. On the action against Mastercard, Das said that it was to ensure compliance with RBI norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-sees-inflation-rising-but-holds-rates-to-fuel-growth/articleshow/85118174.cms||---

The deceased, Shashinath Jha, 58, was the mukhiya of Bakhri Buzurg panchayat for two consecutive terms before his wife Madhuri Devi got elected to the post in the last election held in the state. Its five-year term ended on June 15 this year. Fresh panchayat election in the state is due in September-November. Though the police could not ascertain the motive behind the murder, the coming panchayat election may be one of the reasons, they said. Police are probing the case from different angles, including personal enmity, Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon told TOI over phone. Jha’s supporters blocked the NH-28 at Musrigharari chowk connecting Muzaffarpur to Begusarai, disrupting traffic for over an hour. He was an influential person in the area and had been running a bus stand at Musrigharari chowk for the last several years, police said. The SP said Jha was returning to his car parked on a village road after a meeting with two families to resolve a dispute over a private road between them when a local criminal, Rajesh Pal, and his associate pumped four bullets into his body. Dhillon, quoting eyewitnesses, said the two criminals escaped on foot after killing Jha. “Pal hails from the same area,” he said. The SP said two separate pistols were used in the murder as police recovered two empty cartridges of 7.65mm and four of 9mm from the spot. Musrigharari police station SHO Sanjay Kumar Singh said Pal is accused in at least three criminal cases, including a murder case last year. “He had been sent to jail twice. He has been evading arrest in the last year murder case,” Singh said. The SHO said police are trying to identify the second shooter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/former-mukhiya-killed-in-samastipur/articleshow/85112182.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The police have also seized an OMR sheet, a booklet, an admit card, two aadhaar cards, a PAN card, a driving license, two mobile phones and Rs 22,000 cash from their possession. The prime accused who was arrested is identified as Balendra Singh Patel of Shankargarh. He is currently posted as a Hindi and Sanskrit teacher at a primary school in, Shankargarh. Another accused arrested is identified as Deeksha alias Neha of Fatehpur. She is a proxy candidate and a receptionist at a private bank in Ghaziabad. Deputy SP (STF) Navendu Kumar told TOI, “STF received a tip-off that two members of a solvers’ gang had arrived at an examination centre of UP B.Ed combined entrance examination (2021-23), and one of them was a proxy solver.” Acting upon the tip-off, a team of STF checked the PG college, Handia, and caught Deeksha alias Neha who was appearing on the behalf of one Usha Devi, a resident of Koraon. On being caught red-handed, Deeksha told police that the kingpin of the solvers’ gang, Balendra Singh Patel was present outside the entrance centre, and the police team nabbed him as well. Deeksha confessed that she was associated with the solvers’ gang for a long time and was also preparing for competitive exams in Prayagraj. While preparing for the exams, she met Dharmendra Singh Yadav and Balendra. She came to know that the duo, Dharmendra and Balendra, were running the solvers’ gangs in the state. Deeksha later joined the solver’s gang and was being paid Rs 50,000 in advance for every competitive exam. Later, she was offered Rs 5-6 lakh once the candidate was declared successful. Police said that Deeksha had appeared as a proxy solver for many exams including TET, Super TET, C-TET and BEd. When police quizzed Balendra, he said that he was currently posted as a Hindi and Sanskrit teacher. Besides, he also works as an LIC agent. He told police that his gang had been charging Rs 6 lakh-Rs 15 lakh from a candidate. Police, meanwhile, said that Dharmendra, along with his gang members, was already sent behind the bars on January 31. A case has been lodged under Sections 419 and 420 of IPC and Sections 6 and 10 of UP Public Examination Act against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/stf-busts-solvers-gang-arrests-kingpin-woman-member/articleshow/85116084.cms||---

They will also demand caste-based census, filling up of backlog vacancies for reserved categories and implementation of all the Mandal Commission recommendations. Party members will march to the collectorate in their respective districts and submit a memorandum to the district magistrate with their demand to be sent to the Prime Minister. In Patna, this protest march will be led by the leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, from the RJD headquarters on Beerchand Patel Path. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said the party members as well common people will be participating in the protest march for the rights of the reserved category of people. “We will continue with our demand for caste census, which is to provide proper benefits to the people who belong to the reserved categories. Our party president Lalu Prasad ji had raised this issue in Parliament in 2010 and had also led a massive protest in Patna,” said Gagan, while lashing out at BJP for creating obstacles and not letting it happen. “When a memorandum for caste census was being passed in the Bihar assembly, BJP MLAs had given their consent. Even Rajnath Singh had earlier promised that caste census will be conducted in 2021. But now they take a U-turn. BJP has exposed its dual face and how it is guided by the RSS, which is against reservation and anti-backward caste and extremely backward caste people,” added Gagan. Talking about the preparation for the Saturday protests, another RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said apart from district headquarters, party members will raise their demand even at the block level. “It will be a massive protest,” he said. RJD seems to have become more active with party members hitting the road against the NDA government at the Centre as well as in the state. In July, the RJD had staged protests for two days against inflation and price rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-to-stage-dharna-at-all-dist-hqs-today/articleshow/85112234.cms||---

With 63 more people recovering from the virus in the last 24 hours, active cases have come down to 356 in the state. No fresh Covid death was reported by the health department on Friday. With 55 new cases, the state’s Covid tally has gone up to 7,25,122. Altogether 7,15,119 people have so far recovered from the virus in the state since its outbreak in March last year. Of 55 new cases registered on Friday, seven patients were from Patna and six from Muzaffarpur. Ten districts did not report any new case and 14 others logged one case each on Friday. Meanwhile, a report of double vaccination of a youth in a rural area of Bhagwanpur block in Begusarai went viral on social media on Friday. Begusarai district magistrate Arvind Kumar Verma said the BDO concerned was asked to investigate the matter and it was found that the man was confused. “When the ANM was vaccinating him, he thought this was the second time he was getting the vaccine. However, ANM confirmed to him that he had not been given any vaccine earlier,” Arvind said, adding as a precautionary measure, the man was kept under observation for 24 hours at sadar hospital. “He is fine now,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-registers-55-fresh-covid-cases/articleshow/85110322.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: First flood warning issued at Prakasam after inflows swell||VIJAYAWADA: Irrigation officials issued the first flood warning at Prakasam barrage on Friday following huge inflows from upstream over the last two days. Officials are also trying to empty the reservoir to fix the damaged gate at Pulichintala. As the dam still contains nearly 25 TMC of water, the repair works could not proceed as anticipated. Officials are expecting the gate fixation to be completed by Saturday evening or Sunday depending on the water level and the inflows. Gate 16 snapped on Thursday morning while it was being lifted to release water as the dam has reached full reservoir level. Water needs to be released from the reservoir and the levels should go below crest gates to fix the damaged gate. As the project is still receiving inflows from Nagarjuna Sagar, it is still unclear when the water level would come down to the required level. Sources said the fixation of the gate would be possible only if the water level is less than 10 TMC. About 5.1 lakh cusecs of water are being released through all crest gates. Engineers from Polavaram project, Nagarjuna Sagar and Telangana have been pressed into action to fix a stop-lock gate in place of the damaged gate. Over 20 TMC water has been released downstream so far and another 20 TMC will be released to start the gate repair works. The project is still receiving 1.8 lakh cusecs from Nagarjuna Sagar. With the water release from Pulichintala, Prakasam barrage is receiving over five lakh cusecs of water, Krishna division executive engineer H Swaroop Kumar informed. The water is being released into the sea by lifting all 70 gates. The first flood warning has been issued at all low-lying areas, he said. Krishna district collector J Nivas has directed officials to take all measures in the flood-prone areas. Revenue, police and irrigation officials in downstream areas of Prakasam barrage have been put on high alert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/first-flood-warning-issued-at-prakasam-after-inflows-swell/articleshow/85112287.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Addressing the webinar, WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said the suggestions made by the experts would be first discussed by the department and then implemented. Jha, who inaugurated the webinar, added the WRD has already taken some steps towards mitigating flood menace like establishing advance warning system, real-time data acquisition system (RTDAS), spatial data system, using remote sensing and GPS, satellite imaging to identify erosion sites and carrying out anti-erosion work. Experts participating in the webinar were from Italy, Nepal, IIT-Roorkee, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Lucknow. WRD secretary Sanjeev Hans said due to climate change, floods have become frequent and intense in the state. “The department has taken structural, non-structural and green measures to fight the menace,” he added. Given the theme of the webinar, department’s chief engineers had also been asked to participate in it and benefit from the experience and suggestions of the experts. On the first day of the webinar, the experts discussed the technical aspects of the problem. Among the suggestions made by them included storage of floodwater and its transfer to areas suffering from water scarcity during lean season, silt management, construction of percolation wells and community participation in flood management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-day-intl-webinar-on-mitigation-of-flood-begins/articleshow/85110238.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Searches in central jails yield no ganja and mobile phones||More than 1,000 personnel from prison and police departments conducted simultaneous searches in all the central prisons in Tamil Nadu in search of mobile phones and contrabands on Friday.But all the teams which had inspectors, sub – inspectors as well as prison warders had to return empty handed as they could not find even a single cellphone or contraband in any of the prisons.All that the raiding teams could seize were three steel bars (half feet), one iron rod (pencil size) and a couple of sharpened toothbrushes. It was the first surprise check since the lockdown was enforced to contain the spread of Covid-19 in March 2020.The searches commenced about 6am at Central prisons in Vellore, Cuddalore, Coimbatore, Madurai, Trichy, Salem, Palayamkottai and Puzhal in Chennai and continued till 8am. In Coimbatore, 100 prison warders from Coimbatore central prison, 38 police personnel from Coimbatore city police, bomb detection and disposal squad conducted searches at the Wall Medu, Tower block, High Security Block, Sub Jail of Coimbatore central prison, Special prison for women and prison hospital.While prison officials claimed that the non– seizures of phones, SIM cards and ganja indicated that the central prison campuses in Tamil Nadu were clean, intelligence officers in police department as well as former jail inmates raised doubts if the searches were an eyewash.They pointed out that similar raids conducted once in two months in the past have resulted in detection of Ipad, smartphones, SIM cards, phone chargers as well ganja packets.Vellore prison officials had seized phone, and SIM cards from high profile prisoners like Sriharan (alias) Murugan, a convict in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, in March 2017.Director General of Police (Prisons) Sunil Kumar Singh told TOI that surveillance and frequent checks has prevented smuggling of such items into the prison. “We have taken action against erroring warders and officials and place them under suspension. This has created a deterrent effect,” he said.A senior prison official justified the zero seizure of contrabands and banned items saying the department had installed door-framed detectors, scanners and conducting manual frisking to limit the chances of smuggling the banned items into the prisons.Cancellation of the periodic interviews prisoners had with family members also ended smuggling as some of these family members sneak in prohibited items.However, sources in the police department said Friday’s surprise check was an “eye-wash.”“The city police would send a letter to the prison officials on the proposed surprise check. Prison warders would get to know about the letter and alert inmates,” said an intelligence officer. He alleged that from beedi to smartphones would be smuggled into the prison through various modes. Several warders were hand in glove with convicts and served as “couriers”. “If a district judge with the help of police department organises a surprise check, without the knowledge of prison authorities, we will get to know the true scenario in the prisons,” the police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/searches-in-central-jails-yield-no-ganja-and-mobile-phones/articleshow/85114931.cms||---

Employment letters were issued to 62,000 beneficiaries at the fair. Also, Rupani virtually launched 52 employment fairs in different parts of the state from the event held at Sarsana Convention Hall in the city.In his address Rupani claimed that Gujarat is the top job creator state in the country and the government provided jobs to young people even during Covid times. “Almost 2.30 lakh people took advantage of the apprentice scheme in which candidates learned while working. The candidates were given stipends of up to Rs 5,000 while they were studying and working,” Rupani said.Rupani also launched ‘anubandham’ web portal and mobile application which will assist the job seekers. Energy minister Saurabh Patel, who also attended the event, said, “Around 2 lakh students are currently being trained in state ITIs and this skilled manpower will be available for work in the industries in the future.”“Subsidy and infrastructure support has helped create employment in the state. During the lockdown many trains with workers aboard left Gujarat while none came into the state. This proves that Gujarat is a job provider,” Navsari MP and state BJP chief C R Paatil, said.“Against 5.2% unemployment rate of the country, Gujarat’s rate is 2.2%. As per the recent employment data Gujarat is the top job provider in the country,” said Anju Sharma, principal secretary, labour and employment department.

No concrete leads, however, emerged in the case till Friday.The double murder took place at the Golana Palla village of Lunawada taluka in Mahisagar. Tribhuvandas Panchal (75) who used to stay with his wife Jashoda was found dead in their house on Thursday morning. Panchal was a BJP worker since its Jan Sangh days and was a member of the Mahisagar district BJP executive committee. While the couple was found dead on Thursday morning, it has come to light that they may have been murdered on Wednesday night itself. Panchal had spoken to a man who used to till his farm over phone at 8.35pm on Wednesday night and may have been killed soon after.Deputy superintendent of police N V Patel said that cash and jewellery had remained untouched in the house. Panchal too was wearing rings that were not taken by the accused.Police believe that the murderer may have been known to Panchal as he had gone into his courtyard and opened the gate at the back of the house. This gate was not used commonly except at times when Panchal wanted to go to buy milk. The couple and others used the front entrance of the house.According to Patel, Panchal may have been having his dinner when someone came at the rear gate. “There was food on his hand and he had eaten only a few morsels. The key of the gate was also found on him hinting that he had opened the gate,” Patel added.The police had even asked the son to check the house and see if something was missing. “The son too said nothing was missing from the house,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-concrete-leads-into-bjp-worker-and-his-wifes-murder/articleshow/85114821.cms||---

In yet another photo that went viral on social media on Friday, a marriage procession could be seen leaving for the bride’s home in a boat because of the flood water. The marriage procession of one Zubair, a resident of Madhaiya Pankhian village in Tehsil Sadar area, left for Shamsabad on Thursday afternoon in a boat. Zubair’s entire village is surrounded by water following rise in the river Ganga. Zubair and his family members, along with other ‘baraatis’ had to take a boat ride to cross his inundated village to reach an approach road near a culvert in Bilawalpur, from where they headed to Shamshabad in separate vehicles. He was accompanied by his mother Alima Begum, sister Naseema, Khushnuma, Kazima and aunt Rajbano and some other relatives. Elder brother Ghulam Mohammad and other villagers ferried them to the approach road. Zafar, Zubair’s relative, said that there are two boats and a steamer in their family. “His cousin Zubair’s marriage was to be solemnised to Tarmeen, daughter of Abre Hasan of Shamshabad on Thursday night. They reached the approach road near Bilawalpur culvert in two boats and a steamer, thereafter, they left for Shamshabad by bus and other vehicles. It was when they returned, they again used the same boats and a steamer,” said Zafar further. To recall, only a couple of days ago a groom and other members of the marriage party had to take off their clothes to cross their village inundated with flood water and reach the approach road from flood hit-Farrukhabad district. Zubair, added, “We had planned a grand wedding with Covid-protocol. The date was fixed and we had finished all the preparations. Usually, we have a grand procession for the wedding but, floods played spoilsport. However, we decided not to postpone the wedding date.” He said, though he and other ‘baraatis’ missed all kinds of ‘masti’ like ‘band-baaja’, but the boat ride to the bride’s house will make this wedding memorable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/groom-baraatis-cross-flood-hit-village-by-boat-to-reach-brides-home/articleshow/85116332.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Varanasi||Weavers to fight MSD with ergonomically designed seat||Varanasi: A research team of the mechanical engineering department (industrial management) of the Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU) has made an ergonomically designed seat for weavers using pit looms that will provide them with back support and thigh comfort, making them less prone to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Dr. Prabhas Bhardwaj, professor of mechanical engineering, said, “The Varanasi handloom industry has low productivity of weavers. They have to work a minimum of 12 hours continuously every day by sitting in one place. Because of this, they are facing musculoskeletal disorders. According to a survey conducted in Varanasi, the majority of weavers have back pain and thigh pain. It is because weavers do not have a proper back support, and they are sitting on plain wood planks.” “So, a seat has been designed for them to provide comfort during working. It will help the weavers to work more productively,” he said. A research scholar and designer of the ergonomic chair M Krishna Prasanna Naik worked on the growth of the Banaras handloom industry. According to him, it is very strenuous for weavers to work the whole day, over a pit loom. The plane plank used by them is of no support. Research revealed that not only old but also the young weavers are facing MSD. The weavers are taking more work breaks in the afternoon shift than in the morning because of pain in the body. Therefore, the cost-effective and ergonomically designed seat for weavers comes with adjustable features depending on the weavers’ shape to help them overcome MSD. The manufacturing of this seat is also easy. Any weavers can make it for his loom. He further said, “Firstly, he measured the length, width, weight of the weavers and the shape and size of the waist and back while sitting. After that the design of the chair has been made with wood. Such an arrangement has been also made in this chair that any weaver may set it according to his size.” Amresh Kushwaha, the chairman of a co-operative society of weavers at Ramnagar, said, “After working for 5 to 6 hours, weavers used to take leaves from work because of body pain. Their weaving speed decreases because of body pain, which creates a delay in production. After use, this ergonomically designed seat has received positive feedback. Weavers said that they are able to work comfortably for long hours with the help of this seat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/weavers-to-fight-msd-with-ergonomically-designed-seat/articleshow/85116156.cms||---

It was in a condition of rupturing at any time. Since the condition was life threatening, the patient was operated on July 22,” a doctor said.After taking control of the blood vessel in abdomen and lower limb, doctors separated the aneurysm without causing damage to intestines and nerves. “We ensured that the aneurysm was not ruptured while removing. Damaged artery supplying leg was also repaired,” he said.The doctor said the patient had recovered completely. The surgery was done free of cost under the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme. The same procedure would have cost Rs5 lakh in a private hospital, said K Rajesh who headed the surgery team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-63-with-large-blood-vessel-tumour-gets-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/85114948.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Nobel laureate youngest to get Presi alumni award||Kolkata: One-and-a-half years ago, it had been planned as an “adda”, a coming together of some of the best minds of the 1981 batch of Presidency College (now Presidency University) to honour their batchmate, Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, with the Atul Chandra Gupta Distinguished Alumnus Award 2020. But then the pandemic struck and the programme was rescheduled. On Friday, a small get-together at Banerjee’s Ballygunge residence attended by only three members of the alumni association — president Sutirtha Bhattacharya, vice-president Bivas Chaudhuri and Banerjee’s classmate Abhijit Pathak — was the occasion when the Nobel laureate was handed over the award, making him its youngest recipient yet. “I thank everyone for the award. My school life was not that great. When in school, the focus was on single-minded personality development. College offered me the chance to meet and make new friends. I suddenly realized there are people who think like me and share my passion, people who are creative and not always too worried about personality development. With them around, I could take little pleasures of life. It opened up new avenues for me. Remembering those times, I am really feeling delighted after receiving this award,” said Banerjee. Chaudhuri said the association was thankful that Banerjee could make time for this award. “Ideally, we would have wanted this to be a big event. But Banerjee arrived in the city on Wednesday and is leaving on Saturday. He had a lot of commitments. But it is humbling to see how much he remembers his alma mater,” Chaudhuri said. The plaque was officially handed over to Banerjee by Bhattacharya. Chaudhuri, though, said there was a small regret. “Nabaneeta Deb Sen, who was the president of the association when the decision to honour Banerjee was taken in 2019, and who shared a close relationship with Banerjee, had wished to join the event. Nabanitadi herself is a recipient of this award. She was missed today,” he said. Other recipients of this award include stalwarts from Bengal cutting across different fields. Another economics Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, too, is a recipient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nobel-laureate-youngest-to-get-presi-alumni-award/articleshow/85112361.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||Sebi looks to do away with promoter concept||MUMBAI: With the definition of a promoter undergoing a change as a large number of private equity and venture fund-led companies are getting listed on the bourses, Sebi has decided to do away with this traditional concept. The Sebi board on Friday gave its nod to start the process of changing the concept of ‘promoters’ to ‘person in control’ or ‘controlling shareholders’ and asked the regulator to prepare a road map in consultation with their counterparts. “In recent years, number of businesses and new age companies with diversified shareholding and professional management that are coming into the listed space are non-family owned and/or do not have a distinctly identifiable promoter group,” Sebi said. For instance, in the recently listed Zomato, there are no identifiable promoters, NSE data showed. Its early backers like Info Edge and Alipay (an arm of Alibaba of China), Deepinder Goyal, the founder as well as Uber BV, that sold its food delivery business to it recently, are all listed as public shareholders. Traditionally, most of the bluechips like Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank and several others have promoters. The exceptions include HDFC, ICICI Bank, ITC and L&T. The board also decided to halve the 20% lock-in of promoter holding in newly listed companies to 18 months from three years and for non-promoters for six months from one year. These will be subject to some conditions relating to use of funds raised through the IPO, Sebi said. Industry experts say both the decisions are to keep market regulations in tune with the emerging shareholding scenario in the country. According to Sandeep Parekh, a securities lawyer and former executive director with Sebi, the concept of promoter is a rigid one with “almost no international parallel”. “Sebi’s decision to move to the concept of ‘person in control’ is a more realistic, fluid and accurate portrayal of who actually controls the company,” Parekh said. Securities lawyers also feel that the reduction in lock-in of holdings is a forward-looking step. “Private equity investors will welcome the reduction of the post-IPO lock-in period as they can get a timely exit,” Anand Lakra, partner, J Sagar Associates, said. According to Parekh, this decision also has the potential to increase liquidity in the market, “as more shares become available for trading”. Lakra also feels that Sebi could use this opportunity — the move to change from promoter to person-in-control — to re-consider the definition of control itself. To facilitate the government’s ‘ease of doing business’ objective, Sebi on Friday also scrapped the requirement of disclosing post-facto nod for acquisitions between 2-5% shareholding in market infrastructure institutions. “The stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories shall put in place appropriate mechanism to ensure compliance with fit and proper criteria,” Sebi said. Sebi also merged two regulations — Issue of Sweat Equity Regulations, and Share Based Employee Benefits Regulations — into a new one called Sebi (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-looks-to-do-away-with-promoter-concept/articleshow/85114108.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Scientists went wrong during pandemic: Abhijit||Kolkata: Science should be backed by reason, research and a humane approach, but it has gone wrong during the pandemic and gave out information that misled people, said Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee on Friday at the Indian Institute of Liver and Digestive Sciences (IILDS). The Nobel laureate was speaking at the Sonarpur institute after the inauguration of a new building, a recently installed oxygen plant and a digital science daily. “It was a success of science that we got the vaccine early. Few thought it would be so successful. But scientists are making mistakes. They are coming up with conclusions and predictions that are not based on scientific evidence. It was predicted that 2 lakh will die in England. But was that based on a study? How did they know it? There was no answer,” said Banerjee. The Nobel laureate stressed on the need to disseminate the correct scientific information in the context of ‘Vigyanbhash’, a daily science portal by Liver Foundation West Bengal (LFWB). He added that when scientists make such wrong predictions, people stop listening and believing them. “Our central government believed scientists when they predicted that the pandemic will be a bad one. Steps were taken immediately and a lockdown imposed. It helped to push back the peak period of the first wave to September-October 2020. But then it was said that we have won the battle against Covid. On what basis was that conclusion reached? Then, we had the second wave and we know what happened. This is wrong science and it’s our biggest enemy. People lose confidence in science and on scientists due to this. And they realize they must act on their own,” he said. Countries which can’t buy enough vaccines are suffering, Banerjee pointed out. “USA has thrown away 10 lakh vaccines and they will waste more. These extra doses could have been used as boosters in other countries. This lack of humanitarian approach is now evident all over the world. No president or prime minister has so far been able to say that we will vaccinate all,” he said. On Friday, the foundation stone for Chandrakanta Institute of Nursing and Health Sciences was also laid. IILDS has been running a GNM nursing course for a year now. Started in February 2016 with OPD services, IILDS is now a 100-bedded hospital. “We have plans to start courses like OT/ITU technicians, radiography, etc, once we have this new building ready. For patient care, we will now have a comprehensive emergency care unit and OPD dialysis facility,” said Parthasarathi Mukherjee, secretary IILDS. “We are expanding our activ-ities beyond patient care and get-ting into academics and research,” said LFWB mentor hepatologist Abhijit Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scientists-went-wrong-during-pandemic-abhijit/articleshow/85112341.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Patna||‘Promote Indian knowledge system in schools, universities’||PATNA: Education expert Manasvini M Yogi on Friday said scholars in the country need not depend on foreign literature to validate their research findings. “Our own ancient languages and literature are rich treasures of knowledge and wisdom,” Yogi said while addressing a webinar on ‘Indian knowledge system: language, art and culture’, organised by the department of mass communication of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) to mark the completion of one year of National Education Policy (NEP)-2020. Yogi said though there was no harm in studying foreign literature considering the pace of global change, scholars should not value the western literature more than their own and must strive to preserve the country’s rich culture and heritage. Bihar State University Service Commission member Vijay Kant Das, in his keynote address, described language as the carrier of culture. “NEP has rightly suggested accurate inclusion of traditional Indian knowledge, including tribal and other local knowledge throughout the curriculum, across humanities, sciences, arts, crafts, and sports for ensuring the country’s all-round progress,” he said. Head of CUSB’s Centre for Historical Studies and Archaeology, Sudhanshu Kumar Jha, spoke about the various challenges in effective implementation of NEP. “Maintaining harmony in a country with diverse culture and languages is difficult, but these challenges can be met by sincere efforts of the academics,” Jha said, adding foreign scholars who studied India’s ancient wisdom became leaders of culture and civilization in their own countries. He also pleaded for incorporation of the Indian knowledge system in schools and universities. Webinar convener Atish Prashar welcomed the participants.

The bodies of Anjanamma and her daughter Lakshmi Devi were found in a pool of blood. Villagers alerted the police, who arranged a postmortem. The revenge killings are linked to a murder that dates to 2019, when Anjanamma’s daughter-in-law Charishma was found dead, which the latter’s parents claimed to be due to dowry harassment. A murder case was filed against Anjanamma and Lakshmi Devi . The deceased girl’s father Ramanjaneya Raju had the body buried in Anjanamma’s house and raised a ‘samadhi’, vowing to kill the duo. Though the mother-daughter duo got bail, they did not return to their village and stayed in B Matham town for nearly two years. They returned on Friday to attend a panchayat meeting. Police suspect Ramanjaneya Raju and his younger brother Srinivasa Raju.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/2-accused-in-murder-case-found-dead/articleshow/85112336.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

It is for the first time that such a surgery has been started in Uttar Pradesh. In a very short span of time, more than 20 patients have been successfully operated through this modern procedure at MPMMCC. Microlaryngeal laser surgery is used to treat vocal cord cancer, leukoplakia, polyp cancer and early oral cancer lesions. While this procedure takes less time to perform this surgery, there are no surgery marks left (cut) anywhere on the face. Most of the surgeries performed by this method in the hospital so far have been related to the vocal cord. Dr. Aseem Mishra, in-charge of head and neck cancer department of MPMMCC and HBCH, said the MPMMCC is the first such hospital in the state to operate vocal cord through microlaryngeal laser surgery. Earlier, this surgery was not available anywhere in Uttar Pradesh. “In the last few days, we have performed surgery on more than 20 cancer patients with this method. The biggest feature of microlaryngeal laser surgery is that the patient does not have to undergo open surgery, which reduces hospital stay after the surgery,” he said, adding that at the same time, this surgery is cost and time effective and its success rate is 90-95%, provided patients approach the hospital in an early stage. “The early symptoms of vocal cord cancer may be hoarseness of voice. If one sees such symptoms, it is better to see a doctor immediately. Along with this, we also appeal to the ENT specialists that if such symptoms are seen in a patient, then they must also suggest them for cancer screening, so that the disease can be identified in time,” he added. Dr. Durgatosh Pandey, deputy director of MPMMCC, said that vocal cord cancer comes under head and neck cancer and consumption of tobacco products is responsible for up to 90% of head and neck cancer. Therefore, to avoid such disease, tobacco products should not be consumed at all, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/microlaryngeal-laser-surgery-for-vocal-cord-cancer-begins-in-kashi/articleshow/85116241.cms||---

Talking to mediapersons ahead of third leg of his ‘ashirvad yatra’, Chirag said Singh had been rewarded with the post of JD(U) national chief for his role in the split in LJP founded by his father and former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan. Reacting to Singh’s statement of reuniting old guards of JD(U), the Jamui MP said, “I don’t know whether he will succeed in his efforts to reunite old guards of his party, but he is an expert in causing rift in the opposition parties.” To drive home his point, Chirag recalled the recent statement of JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar that Singh’s political injection was very powerful and capable of making his political opponents falling flat. Chirag also accused CM Nitish Kumar of failing to check crime and corruption in the state. “The CM is more concerned about strengthening JD(U). He has no time to think about state’s development. Had it not been the case, he would have focused on checking crime and corruption prevalent in government offices. People have been left at the mercy of criminals,” he alleged. Meanwhile, sources close to Chirag said he would leave for poll-bound Uttar Pradesh after August 15 and meet the top leaders of like-minded parties to stitch a pre-poll alliance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalan-elevated-for-causing-split-in-ljp-says-chirag/articleshow/85112104.cms||Ramashankar

According to police sources, six teams from Guntur Urban and Krishna district stationed themselves in Ongole to nab the two accused, identified as Venkat Reddy and S Krishna. The arrests follow extensive investigation, during which police personnel went undercover to carry out inquiries with beggars, transgenders, small traders and rag pickers near the railway tracks. Cops pointed out that Krishna was last spotted by locals near his home in Vijayawada. Upon identifying him and calling out his name, he managed to board a moving goods train and flee from the spot. The information led police to suspect that Krishna might be hiding near the railway bridges. While Venkat Reddy was arrested when he was resting under a flyover, police suspect that the second accused Krishna might be in the same vicinity, as investigation points to the duo having fled together. Cops took Venkat Reddy to an undisclosed location where he is being interrogated while the search for Krishna continues. It may be recollected that the crime happened on the night of June 21 at the Seethanagaram Pushkar Ghat where the victim, a nurse, and her fiancé were spending time. The two accused attacked the couple and tied their hands. While the man was brutally thrashed, the woman was sexually assaulted before the duo stole their mobile phones and fled on a boat.  Cops ascertained the identity of the accused after the victim identified them from pictures of previous offenders in the area. Cops said the accused were previously part of the notorious blade batch in Vijayawada.

---||Patna||Bihar: Tug of war between BJP & JD(U) on caste census issue||PATNA: As the RJD and JD(U), along with other opposition parties, are on the same page and have also started mounting pressure on the Centre for a caste-based census in the country, the Bihar BJP appears to be caught in a gridlock and, therefore, countering their moves in its own limited way. The RJD and JD(U) have been also pitching for the caste census in the state with its own resources. The peculiar situation of the BJP originates from the fact that its MLAs had supported the unanimous resolution for caste census adopted by the state assembly twice, in 2019 and 2020, but has now to abide by the Centre’s stand on it; that general caste census cannot be conducted, except of the scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) groups. The central government also informed Parliament about it in the current monsoon session. On Friday, JD(U) MP from Sitamarhi, Sunil Kumar Pintu, told mediapersons, “If the central government decides to hold caste census, then it is all right. Otherwise, our government will conduct it in Bihar. The central government should bring in a Bill in Parliament and get it passed to authorise state governments to hold caste census in their states. The Bihar government has started preparations in this regard.” JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha, who is touring the state to strengthen the party, said at Sheikhpura on Friday that if the census of people based on religious denominations could be done, then caste census could also be conducted. Asked by mediapersons about the state government itself deciding for a caste census if the central government did not opt for the pan-India one, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad said, “There is no such proposal at present with the state government. CM Nitish Kumar has sought appointment with PM Narendra Modi to discuss the demand for caste census in the country. The central government is looking at all the aspects of the matter. It will take its decision only after due consideration of all the aspects involved,” Prasad also said. Otherwise, Both CM Nitish from JD(U) and RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who is also leader of opposition in the state assembly, are in agreement that if the Centre did not agree to holding the caste-based census in the country, then the Bihar government should conduct the one in the state on the pattern of Karnataka with its own resources. In fact, to increase the pressure on the Centre, the RJD has called for the district-level dharna and demonstration on Saturday in the state in pursuance of the demand for the caste census. Its other demands include filling the backlogs of the reserved vacant seats in the government and implementation of the remaining recommendations as had been made by the Mandal Commission, RJD state general secretary Alok Kumar Mehta told mediapersons. Earlier, a delegation of JD(U) MPs led by the party’s newly nominated national president Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan had called on Union home minister Amit Shah and also submitted a memorandum demanding that caste census be held in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tug-of-war-between-bjp-jdu-on-caste-census-issue/articleshow/85112285.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Patna||Health experts divided as Bihar govt allows reopening of schools||PATNA: The state government’s decision to resume offline classes in primary and middle schools with 50% attendance from August 16 has evoked mixed reactions from health experts. While some health experts have welcomed the decision, others have opined that the government should have waited for some more time as the pandemic is not over yet. However, almost all of them agreed that the authorities would have to remain vigilant against the violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour by students and school staff as the threat of the third Covid wave is looming large. Immediate past president of the state branch of Indian Medical Association, Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, appreciated the government’s decision to reopen schools with a view to restoring academic normalcy. He said the third wave might hit the state in October, but its impact would not be so large as the second wave. “There would be a maximum one-fourth casualty if the third wave comes at all. There is no harm in running classes in offline mode with full Covid protocols. Children will have to be trained well to maintain social distance in schools,” he added. Deputy superintendent of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), Dr Satish Kumar, said it is the best time to reopen schools as the incidence of Covid-19 infections is at its minimum level. “The authorities will have to remain on their toes to ensure that children and teachers follow Covid-appropriate behaviour by wearing masks and maintaining social distance within and outside the classrooms. There is no immediate threat of the third wave, but the situation may deteriorate if the people from badly hit states like Kerala and Maharashtra start migrating to Bihar,” he said. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said the third wave is expected to hit the state within a month according to predictions made by experts. However, this wave would not be as deadly as the previous ones owing to the ongoing vaccination and development of antibodies in a sizable section of the people, he said. Dr Shah, however, added the government should have waited for some time more, at least for a month, to make it sure that the threat of the third wave has subsided. Gynaecologist Dr Punam Raman hailed the decision to reopen the schools, saying they can’t be kept closed indefinitely. “Most children had already started developing various kinds of mental illnesses owing to the prolonged closure of their schools. However, there is a need to ensure proper cleaning and sanitization of classrooms and the entire school premises and vaccination of all the school staff before resumption of offline classes,” she added. Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s dean of medicine faculty, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, however, opined that at least in primary and middle schools, offline classes should not have been resumed until the vaccination of a majority of the state’s population, including children. “Even if schools are sanitised and all the staff are vaccinated, children may get infected while commuting to their schools by private buses, vans or autorickshaws. If children in larger numbers get infected, it can lead to a catastrophe,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-experts-divided-as-bihar-govt-allows-reopening-of-schools/articleshow/85110144.cms||B K Mishra

The Dubai branch was an important centre for the corporation for international business. According to sources, the move is part of government steps to promote GIFT City for international business and prevent Indian financial markets from being exported to other regional finance centres. “Following a review of the branch operations, it has been decided to underwrite business emanating from MENA region (both new and renewal), effective July 3, 2021, from Gujarat International Finance Tec-City,” the reinsurer said in a letter addressed to all partners. The Dubai branch will cease to underwrite business under its operations. “This move underlines the importance being accorded to GIFT IFSC by the national reinsurer, which already has a presence there,” said Satyendra Shrivastava, senior partner, Consortia Legal. “With the unified regulator, IFSCA in place, business activity has picked up pace. For example, aircraft leasing and financing have commenced in GIFT IFSC,” said Shrivastava. The regulator also recently issued the exposure draft of regulations that propose to allow Indian and foreign insurers and reinsurers to set up offices in GIFT IFSC and the new regulatory framework is expected to be finalized soon. GIC had set up international operations in Dubai in 2007 and has been providing reinsurance to the African continent.

While several steps have been taken to ease supply constraints, more needs to be done. to restore supply-demand balance in a number of sectors of the economy. The recent inflationary pressures are evoking concerns; but the current assessment is that these pressures are transitory and largely driven by adverse supply side factors. We are in the midst of an extraordinary situation arising from the pandemic,” RBI governor Shaktikant Das said in his policy statement. “The conduct of monetary policy during the pandemic has been geared to maintain congenial financial conditions that nurture and rejuvenate growth. At this stage, therefore, continued policy support from all sides — fiscal, monetary and sectoral — is required to nurture the nascent and hesitant recovery,” said Das. while promising to keep the stance easy to support growth. The implication for borrowers is that there is not much scope for interest rates to come down, barring some pass-through of earlier cuts by lenders. The RBI has cut the repo rate by 250 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) since February 2019 and banks have responded with a 217bps cumulative decline in their weighted average lending rate. Pointing out that indicators of consumption, investment and external demand are gaining traction, Das was optimistic about recovery and retained his forecast for FY22 at 9.5%. While the growth outlook for the year is unchanged, the governor hiked the first-quarter forecast to 21.4% from 18.5% but lowered it in the subsequent quarters. The RBI now expects growth to be 7.3%in Q2 as against 7.9% earlier, 6.3% in Q3 (7.2% earlier); and 6.1% (6.6% earlier) in Q4 of 2021-22. Real GDP growth for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 17.2%. In his address, Das said that the country was in a much better position than it was in June 2021 but advised caution. “The need of the hour is not to drop our guard and to remain vigilant against any possibility of a third wave, especially in the background of rising infections in certain parts of the country,” he said. Inflation forecast has been raised to 5.7% from 5.1% earlier: 5.9%in Q2; 5.3% in Q3; and 5.8%in Q4 of 2021-22. Das explained the rationale for looking through inflationary pressures pointing out that these were transitory and that policy normalisation now would be pre-emptive. “With adequate pandemic protocols and ramp-up in the vaccination rate, we should be able to tide over a third wave, if it occurs,” said Das. Announcing the MPC decision, Das said that members were unanimous on retaining the repo rate at 4%. However, one member, J R Varma, voted against the proposal to continue with the ‘accommodative’ stance. “The decision of keeping the repo rate unchanged along with maintaining of accommodative stance is on expected lines as low-interest rates are critical to an economic revival,” said S S Mallikarjuna Rao, MD & CEO, Punjab National Bank. In his interaction with the media, Das said that the new variable rate reverse repo, which could soak up a large part of liquidity was not a reversal of the accommodative phase. He said that the policy had to be nuanced as it had to address conflicting objectives. On the action against Mastercard, Das said that it was to ensure compliance with RBI norms. RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar said that a model for digital currency would be out by the year-end. In the conference, Das, who was formerly the revenue secretary in the government, praised the government move to do away with retrospective tax In its development measures, the RBI extended by three months, up to December 2021, a scheme to provide cheap refinance to banks that on-lend to corporates. The Targeted Long Term Repo Operations was announced in the wake of the pandemic and already extended once by six months. Given the impact of the second wave, the RBI has relaxed the norms for companies that were allowed to get their loans restructured. These companies were required to meet ed to meet sector-specific thresholds in five financial parameters - total debt to Ebidta ratio, current ratio, debt service coverage ratio and average debt service coverage ratio, by March 31, 2022. They now have until October 2022 to meet the parameters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-sees-inflation-rising-but-holds-rates-to-fuel-growth/articleshow/85114067.cms||---

Lovely Akhtar, the HC said, will be accompanied by cops till the security hold. The HC will take up the case again on August 23. Lovely had a valid passport and worked in Mumbai, said her lawyer Soumya Nag. However, her visa had expired when she was trying to leave the country. “It was due to Covid and her ailing mother, who came back home, that she tried to leave the country illegally when intercepted along the India-Bangladesh border in Swarupnagar (North 24 Parganas) on April 14 this year,” Nag said. Lovely, who was charge-sheeted for her illegal stay, had subsequently pleaded guilty before a judicial magistrate. The court had sentenced her to 66 days in prison. “After her sentence was over, she had written to the Centre and the state, urging them to allow her to return home at her own expense. She got no response that prompted her to move court,” Nag said. Deportation is usually a complex and time consuming process, which usually ends with people being physically escorted till the India-Bangladesh border by law enforcement agencies. In Lovely’s case, the Bengal government had consented to her deportation by air, but it also needed a nod from the Centre. During the hearing, the additional solicitor general Y J Dastoor was also present. Justice Debangsu Basak, in his two-page order, said, “Since the petitioner is no longer required to be in custody in the correctional home of India and since the petitioner is a Bangladeshi national, it would be appropriate to permit her to be deported to her nation forthwith.” The HC said that Lovely will show her ticket details to the Dum Dum prison authorities. The prison authorities will verify it and depute cops to accompany her to the airport, where they will ensure that she steps into the security hold with the valid ticket and passport. Nag, her lawyer, said, “The court orders have been communicated formally to the prison authorities on Friday. We hope she can return home by next week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bdesh-artist-to-return-home-after-66-days-in-jail/articleshow/85112536.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Business||Bonds, stocks slide on RBI, SC move||MUMBAI: Friday was a busy day for the bond and stock markets both with decisions by the Supreme Court and the RBI impacting investor sentiment. In the government bond market, after the RBI increased its retail inflation forecast for the year to 5.7% from 5.1%, gilts witnessed a selloff with the benchmark yield in the 10-year paper jumping to 6.26%, a one-and-half-year high, from 6.2% at Thursday’s close. The central bank also allowed banks to park surplus liquidity under variable rate reverse repo (VRRR), increasing from Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 4 lakh crore by end-September, was seen as a tentative step to normalisation of the excess liquidity situation in the banking situation. VRRR is a process through which banks can park their extra funds for 14 days or more with the RBI. According to Kumaresh Ramakrishnan, CIO, fixed income, PGIM India Mutual Fund, the policy was “‘supportive” and the commentary as reasonably dovish. “But the less-than-unanimous vote for an accommodative stance, higher VRRR amounts and raising of inflation forecasts, signal some emerging concerns within the central bank at the margins,” he said. In late afternoon, the RBI also announced that it had cancelled the Rs 26,000-crore weekly auction of G-Secs under the government’s borrowing programme for the current fiscal. Bond dealers said that the central bank was not comfortable with bond buyers’ demand for higher yield (meaning lower price) for G-Secs and hence the cancellation of the whole auction. On Dalal Street, RIL, along with banking and financial stocks mostly led the slide. RIL closed 2.1% lower on the back of an adverse SC judgment on its Rs 24,713-crore deal to buy Future group’s retail business. Along with RIL, all the stocks belonging to the Future group witnessed strong sell-off and most closed at the lower circuit. Led by RIL, the sensex closed 215 points lower at 54,278 points, while on the NSE, the Nifty closed 56 points lower at 16,238. The day’s trading on the Street also witnessed strong buying in Vodafone Idea with the stock closing 20% up at Rs 7.1 on the BSE. The rally came after the Lok Sabha repealed a controversial tax law that had led to several court cases globally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bonds-stocks-slide-on-rbi-sc-move/articleshow/85114031.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||AP: ‘Farmer’ sub-collector nails malpractices at fertilizer stores||VIJAYAWADA: Krishna district sub-collector G Saisurya Praveen Chand donned the attire of a farmer to make some surprise checks at fertilizer stores after receiving complaints about MRP violations. Wearing a lungi, torn shirt, and a towel to look like a farmer, Praveen Chand first went to Venkata Naga Datha Agencies, a fertilizer store at Kaikaluru, on a bike and asked for urea and DAP. The shop owner told him the price but asked him to collect them from his warehouse. After collecting the stock, the sub-collector found that a bag of urea was being sold at Rs 280 when the MRP was Rs 266, while DAP, which costs Rs 1,200, was being sold for Rs 1,250. He immediately called up the mandal revenue officer and agriculture officials concerned to the shop and directed them to book a case against the shop owner for MRP violations. The shop was also sealed. Another shop, Vasavi Fertilizers, was also sealed for illegally stashing fertilisers. The shop owner told Praveen Chand they do not have any stocks. However, when officials inspected the warehouse, they found large quantities of fertilizer stocks. Another fertilizer shop was found closed at Mudinepalli, but when officials went to the warehouse, they found enough stocks. The motive was to stash stocks to create artificial scarcity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmer-sub-collector-nails-malpractices-at-fertilizer-stores/articleshow/85111666.cms||---

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: SPVs set up to raise funds for water grids||AMARAVATI: To resolve the drinking water crisis in drought-hit regions, the state government has constituted separate special purpose vehicle (SPVs) take up water grid projects. The government has designed the SPVs in such a way that they could pool required money from financial institutions and government agencies such as National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) from different schemes. The state government estimated that it would require at least Rs 9,000 crore to complete the new drinking water schemes. The government directed the rural water supply and water resources department to coordinate with other departments to expedite the water grid projects. The state government has granted administrative approvals for different water grid projects helping them to approach the financial institutions. With abundant funds available with the Union Jal Shakti ministry under drinking water schemes, the state government has tied up a majority of the water grid schemes with central funds to lessen the burden. Sources said that the Centre had already agreed to extend financial assistance to the tune of Rs 3,200 crore to the state government to take up the drinking water schemes under Jal Jeevan Mission. The state government has also succeeded in roping in Nabard for grant of funds for water grid projects. While the state government is likely to spend close to Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 crore as its share, tie-ups with different agencies to grant loans to the tune of Rs 3,500 crore have also been finalised. The state government is taking up a water grid project in Uddanam region of Srikakulam district with a massive Rs 700 crore. This project is likely to help the region overcome the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as several hundreds of locals were found struggling with kidney ailments. Although several studies carried out by the national and international agencies have failed to pinpoint the reason behind a large section of the population getting affected with kidney diseases, contaminated ground water for drinking water needs is suspected to be one of the reasons. Taking serious note of the issue, the government constituted a separate SPV to take up the water grid project in Uddanam. Similarly, the government is taking up a water grid project in Pulivendula, the home town of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy at a cost of Rs 480 crore. Nabard has agreed to grant nearly Rs 2,400 crore for a water grid scheme in East Godavari and Rs 1,850 crore for West Godavari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/spvs-set-up-to-raise-funds-for-water-grids/articleshow/85111619.cms||Samdani MN

It will improve doctors’ understanding and skill, which will, in turn, improve the quality of cause of death data for decision-making,” said TMC director Dr Rajendra Badwe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/e-training-for-doctors-on-scientific-death-certification-in-mumbai/articleshow/85117327.cms||---

---||Lucknow||‘Wrestling is all about holding nerves & fighting to the finish’||Wrestler Ravi Dahiya, who missed an Olympic gold by a whisker in the 57kg freestyle semi-final bout against Zavur Uguev of ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) on Thursday, says though he is happy that he has won a silver for the country, he is certainly not satisfied as he had come to Tokyo to win gold. Dahiya has registered his name as India’s one of the most successful Olympians. Talking to Fazal Khan, Dahiya spoke about his journey as a sportsman and his experience in the Tokyo Olympics. Excerpts:  First of all, congratulations for winning the medal and bringing honour to the country... Thank you. All the bouts went off well.  How do you describe your journey from a remote village (Nahari in Sonepat district) of Haryana to the Tokyo Olympics? I started off with village wrestling. Later, I moved to Delhi where I started training under my coach Mahabali Satpal at Chhatrasal stadium. The exposure changed my life.  Your performance in the semi-final was exceptional when you pinned down your rival (Nurislam Sanayev of Kazakhstan) after an initial setback. How did you manage to do that? Wrestling is all about holding your nerves and fighting to the finish. I tried to give my best and did not give up till the last second of the game. Finally, I got success.  How do you see your performance in the final? I had come to Tokyo to win a gold for the country but unfortunately that didn’t happen. He (Zavur Uguev) performed better and deserved to win. I am happy that I reached the finals and gave my best shot. I will continue to improve my performance.  How often do you get to visit your village? What are the things you crave for? I rarely get a chance to visit my village. I miss the food prepared by my mother. Whenever I get time, I share the experience of my tours with my mother.  You have visited Gonda in UP in the past. Tell us something about your experience. I used to visit Gonda in connection with wrestling events. Earlier, tournaments were held on a small scale. Now, a centre (Khelo India centre monitored by SAI, Lucknow) has been set up and players are getting good facilities. It will go a long way in producing talented players.  Any message for sports authorities and budding players? There is no dearth of talent in our country. If our players get good facilities and encouragement, more youngsters will get opportunities to win medals for the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wrestling-is-all-about-holding-nerves-fighting-to-the-finish/articleshow/85116939.cms||Fazal Khan

According to L C S Srikanth, deputy director, MTR-buffer zone, 89 forest officials in the rank of deputy director and forest range officer, along with biologists, are attending the training programme. “It is to prepare the forest officials for the all India tiger census, which is already due this year.” The all India tiger census is done once in every four years by NTCA with technical help from the Wildlife Institute of India and the state forest departments. The census is done using camera traps and capture-mark-recapture method that was introduced in the 2006 census, which was the first ever tiger counting survey in India. There were 2,967 tigers in the country, as per the last national tiger census held in 2018. With the recently notified Srivilliputhur-Magamalai Tiger Reserve, Tamil Nadu houses five tiger reserves, which are home to 235 tigers. The remaining four are Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve.

As many as 9,229 Covid cases were reported among vaccinated people in July alone whereas it was only 8,930 till the end of June. Among the total 49,049 cases documented in July, 18.82% were vaccinated people. It also reported that 91 partially vaccinated people died of Covid. However, only eight fully vaccinated people died of Covid in Ernakulam so far. Meanwhile, infections among healthcare workers (HCWs) continue to report more. As many as 293 HCWs were tested positive in the last two weeks of July touching the total cases reported among them so far to 5,312. “The infection among vaccinated people shows that they may not be following Covid appropriate behaviour properly after vaccination. It has been noticed that 26% of them got infections within two weeks of getting the dose and the rest after two weeks. It may be because 26% might have gotten the infection at the facility during the vaccination drive or just before that,” said a health official. To identify the strengths and failures, the report calls for conducting sero surveillance at district level. He said a discussion was going on at the state-level to allow districts to conduct sero surveillance. Meanwhile, Indian Medical Association (IMA) officials said that though vaccination gives advantage for individuals, crowding poses a threat of spreading the virus further. “Vaccination gives individual protection from turning Covid infection into a severe one. The death among vaccinated people is not because of Covid infection but of severe comorbidity. People are not ready to accept the fact that crowding or social functions was impossible for the next two years. The social behaviour of people should change until we achieve herd immunity and we need to vaccinate more people in the coming months,” said Kerala IMA secretary Dr Gopakumar. IMA will revise the guidelines on social behaviour to be followed in various places where people gather. Though they released it last year, it was not implemented properly despite suggestions, including appointing infection control offices in places like malls to ensure that customers follow protocols. “Earlier incubation period was four or five days. Now, we feel that it has been reduced to 48 hours. A study is going on in this regard,” said Dr Gopakumar. In Ernakulam, 18% of the population above 18 years have been fully vaccinated so far. More than 50% have been vaccinated with at least one dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rise-seen-in-cases-among-vaccinated/articleshow/85112576.cms||T C Sreemol

---||Mumbai||Pregnant women avoiding vax due to fever fear: Doctors||MUMBAI: The fear of fever as an after-effect could be keeping thousands of pregnant women from getting the vaccine against Covid, believe gynaecologists. The doctors have called for a massive awareness drive if the state wants success in vaccinating its estimated 20 lakh pregnant women. In Mumbai, where the drive started on July 15, merely 429 have taken the shot so far. The city has an estimated 1.5 lakh pregnant women. “The response has been guarded so far. Developing fever after vaccination is the big concern expressed by most. We have been trying to counsel that it is mostly mild and resolves in a day or two, but there is hesitancy,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. Of the pregnant women vaccinated so far, only one had a bout of vomiting that required hospitalisation of a few days, she said, adding that no other serious adverse events were noted in those who got vaccinated. Post-jab fever not risky for pregnant women: DocsGynaecologist Nikhil Datar said fear of fever is one of the biggest reasons behind vaccine hesitancy of expecting mothers, and explained why post-immunisation fever is not risky for them. “There is a crucial message that we need to spread. The fever after immunisation is the body’s immune response and largely harmless. They shouldn’t confuse it with the fever one gets following an infection,” said Datar. It is common knowledge that getting fever can be hazardous to pregnancy. The fear is more among women in the third trimester, said Goregaon gynaecologist Sudhir Naik. “Many getting the vaccine in the second trimester worry that the second dose would come in the third trimester. We tell them the fever would be no different from the one they suffer during regular bouts of cold and cough,” he said, adding that an awareness campaign that vaccination is safe in any trimester was necessary. Little is known about how the drive is faring in the rest of the state as districts are not keeping a count of vaccination among pregnant women. Dr Raj Gehlot, district health officer of Chandrapur, called the response “mixed”. Officials from three more districts confirmed that they have not been asked to maintain data. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said CoWin does not capture pregnant women data. “It is not required at the time of registration either. In the vaccinator module, the government of India has created a drop-down menu but still no reports are generated,” he said, adding that daily reporting will not be possible from 4,000 sites. The Centre had released a statement on July 30, saying 2.3 lakh pregnant women had taken the vaccine across India. States leading the chart were Tamil Nadu (78,838), followed by Andhra Pradesh (34,228), Odisha (29,821), MP (21,842), Kerala (18,423) and Karnataka (16,673). Since then, TN has vaccinated 1.9 lakh pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pregnant-women-avoiding-vax-due-to-fever-fear-docs/articleshow/85116953.cms||---

Chief minister Pramod Sawant had recently announced that the renovated monument will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Portuguese-era structure has been renovated at a cost of Rs 26 crore, and has attracted controversy over fears that the government may hand over the iconic monument to a private player. In fact, there were murmurs of protests when the historic fort was handed over to Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) in 2016. After his visit to Fort Aguada on Thursday, the chief minister said there were no plans to commercialise the complex. A tourism official also said the monument can’t be given to a private party as it is under the control and management of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). While GTDC has shortlisted Drishti Lifesaving Pvt Ltd for operations and maintenance, the former will still be responsible for overall supervision and control, the official said. “The ticket counter will be managed by the agency appointed. People visiting the Aguada Lower Fort, that is the former central jail, will have to pay an entry fee as well as a fee for the sound and light show. School students will be entitled to a 50% discount, while freedom fighters and their spouses will not be charged fees,” he said. The sound and light show at the complex will showcase Goa’s history and its freedom struggle. Personal objects used by freedom fighters Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, T B Cunha and those who were imprisoned at the Aguada Lower Fort will be displayed. Goa government used the premises as a prison, calling it a central jail until 2016, the year it moved all prisoners to the modern Colvale Central jail. “Movable life-size statues of freedom fighters will be placed at the fort and information about their role in the freedom struggle will be given in English, Marathi, Konkani and Marathi,” he said. Besides, an arrangement is being made to facilitate tourists to reach the Aguada fort via a boat from the Santa Monica jetty in Panaji.There will be designated photography points. To showcase Goa’s culture, there will be a tie-up with local musicians, folk dancers and artistes who will perform songs, drama, and folk dance. The museum will be set up in hall one and hall two. GTDC will set up a digital museum which will be maintained by the operator. GTDC will arrange two shuttle buses to ferry tourists to the Aguada Jail premises from the Aguada upper fort parking lot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/renovated-fort-aguada-likely-to-be-open-on-all-days/articleshow/85115167.cms||Bindiya Chari

The tombstones were shifted to Bastion Bungalow, a monument in Fort Kochi protected by the state archaeology department. It was while digging earth for erecting the pillar of a temporary roof to be constructed over the synagogue that the tombstones were unearthed. “One of the tombstones was unearthed on Thursday while we got the other one on Friday,” said an official with the state archaeology department. “We sent the images of the tombstones to Ophira Gamliel, an Israeli Indologist, who is working with the University of Glasgow, Scotland. She translated the Hebrew inscriptions on the tombstones into English. According to her, one tombstone is that of Eliah, son of Tiferet, a Malabari Jew who died on December 24,1598,” said Prof Karmachandran, a Jew historian. “The second one is that of Eliah, son of Gershon, who died on December 8, 1832. Unlike in the case of mosques and Christian churches, there would be no cemeteries attached to the synagogue. Then, these tombstones might have been brought to the synagogue area by some others. We need more studies to get such details,” Karmachandran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/2-tombstones-unearthed-at-kadavumbhagam-synagogue/articleshow/85112604.cms||---

---||Pune||Experts say strict curbs can be counter-productive, worsen scene||Pune: Covid-induced lockdown and restrictions introduced by states could be counter-productive and worsen matters, leading health economists and experts told TOI on Friday. Health economist and World Health Organisation consultant Dr Rijo M John told TOI, “The intent should be to reduce crowding at any point in time. This is best done by distributing the crowd as evenly as possible across the day as well as across days in a week. When Covid cases are low and medical facilities have a breathing space, regions must do away with the weekend triple lockdown (stringent weekend restrictions within ongoing restrictions) and revoke the policy of shutting shops on select days in a week. Very stringent measures are not required when case numbers are not doubling at a rate of two weeks or less.” Dr John, along with Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, and Reuben Abraham, the CEO of IDFC Foundation and IDFC Institute, had recently recommend these measures on Covid-19 management to the Kerala government. The experts had suggested expanding the operational hours of shops, but at the same time, rigorously controlling the number of customers allowed entry at any time, depending on the size of shops. Another suggestion included government allowing businesses to function 24x7 if need be, so that crowds could be further spread out. Dr John said, “It’s high time that people are allowed to get back to some form of normality, albeit with proper crowd management strategies.” Dr T Sundararaman, the global coordinator of the People’s Health Movement, said, “Interactions have to be lowered in the most rational way possible. Also, care should be taken that a decrease in interpersonal interactions at one place does not causes it to increase elsewhere.” Giving an example, he said if people are prevented from going to offices, the number of interpersonal interactions would increase at home. “If operational hours of shops are restricted, it would cause more people to crowd in and around shops during tight deadlines, which may cause a surge in interpersonal interactions, aiding infection spread. Operational hours of retail shops should, thus, be spaced out through the day instead of restricted windows, apart from ensuring a system when some people visit at a particular time and others visit later or earlier,” Dr Sundararaman said. He said the authorities might have to opt for stringent measures during the peak of transmission, those cannot be continued with when cases come down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-say-strict-curbs-can-be-counter-productive-worsen-scene/articleshow/85115111.cms||Neha Madaan

Mohol asked why there couldn’t be relaxations in Pune, similar to Mumbai. He said health minister Rajesh Tope told the PMC to submit a proposal about relaxations, after deputy CM Ajit Pawar spoke about possible relaxations for the last two weeks. “We submitted a letter to Tope with details of the city’s positivity rate in the last few weeks. We strongly recommended relaxations as the positivity rate dropped to 3.22% in the week ending on August 5, while it was 3.37% and 3.93% in the two previous weeks,” he said. Kothrud MLA and BJP’s city unit chief Chandrakant Patil said the BJP had been demanding phase-wise relaxations. Amruta Fadnavis, the wife of Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, pressed for relaxations in Pune during her visit to the city on Thursday. Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole said, “Ajit Pawar and state home minister Dilip Walse Patil had assured relaxations for Pune would be announced at the start of this week after talks with the CM.

A bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh passed the order on a PIL filed by Lok Nyayarath Sanstha and ordered the district magistrate to ensure maintenance of these flyovers. The bench fixed September 13 as next date of hearing. In compliance with an earlier order, municipal commissioner Ajay Kumar Dwivedi had appeared before the bench on Thursday and expressed his inability to install streetlights on the three flyovers due to non- cooperation by concerned departments. The PIL had sought direction to civic authorities to install streetlights, immediately start repairs on the Polytechnic flyover, which was a death-trap at night in the absence of lights. Considering its public importance, the bench had on an earlier hearing directed LMC to install streetlights by August 5 or the municipal commissioner would have to appear in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/deathtrap-flyovers-hc-directs-dm-to-ensure-streetlights/articleshow/85116949.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Goa||Goa: Third Covid wave inevitable, but vaccination coverage will blunt it, say experts||PANAJI: Even as cases appear to have plateaued in Goa for now, experts said that the third wave is inevitable, but were unsure of its impact. Stating that vaccination would help blunt the impact of the wave, they also stressed people should not let their guard down, and that the state too shouldn’t take lightly the incidents that may lead to crowding. “Otherwise, too, September is the month we witness a rise in flu cases,” said state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar. “If normal flu cases go up, Covid-19 infections also will, to some extent.” We are continuously tracking cases and may see the third wave this or next month, though we are currently on a plateau.” Stating that the third wave is “inevitable”, chest specialist Dr Anil Mehndiratta said that vaccination has to be expedited to cover a larger section of the population to lessen the severity of the disease. This, he said, will ensure fewer ICU admissions and fewer deaths. As of Friday, more than seven lakh people have been vaccinated with the first dose, and over 2.88 lakh are fully vaccinated. During the peak of the second wave in May, Goa reported 66,000-plus cases and 1,481 mortalities. “We need to set up a central oxygen facility in most hospitals to lessen the load on tertiary care hospitals,” Mehndiratta said. Eminent pathologist Dr Eugene D’Souza said that the state can flatten the curve of the third wave but preventive health measures are the key, rather than focusing on the predominant task force. “The government needs to involve more experts in preventive social medicines and epidemiology. We need genome sequencing performed in Goa to identify variants of concern early,” he said. Goa is yet to receive the results of the samples sent for genome sequencing to outstation laboratories over a more ago. The state sent samples every 15 days. Till the first week of last month, the directorate of health services received the results of about 120 samples — of those sent since the beginning of the second wave in March-April — with 109 showing the delta strain that caused the second wave. “The delta-plus is a triple mutation. Most probably, it will not cause much harm. That’s why wherever the delta-plus variant has been found so far, we haven’t seen a rise in cases. It has been detected in some 15 states,” Betodkar said. D’Souza said that active tracing of contacts to identify super-spreader events and micro-management zones to limit spread, as well as enhancing the ratio of RT-PCR tests for surveillance and stronger border testing can help blunt the impact of the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/third-wave-inevitable-but-vax-coverage-will-blunt-it-experts/articleshow/85115134.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||Can’t let guard down, will issue new SOPs for festive season: Goa CM||PANAJI: The state government will frame new SOPs in view of the upcoming Ganesh Chaturthi festival, to prevent crowding. Goans should not let their guards down as there is still a Covid-19 case positivity rate of 2% in the state, CM Pramod Sawant said on Friday. Sawant also said that there are no plans yet to reopen schools. “The pandemic is still on. Even today, there is a case positivity rate in Goa of around 1.9-2%,” he said. “Also, one or two deaths are still being reported every day,” he said. We need to take precautions, especially during the upcoming festival season. The state government will issue SOPs in this regard. When framing the SOPs, we will take the sarvajanik Ganeshostav mandals into confidence and SOPs will be issued accordingly,” said Sawant. We all need to ensure that we celebrate the festival without any crowding taking place, he said. “No decision has been taken yet on school reopening. We have requested the Centre to allow us to administer the second vaccine dose to teachers by reducing the gap between the two doses. Once we are able to complete the second dose for all teachers, then we will see. In states like Kerala, cases have already started showing an increase,” said Sawant. He said that the state has made it mandatory for those entering from Kerala to get a negative RT-PCR report, to control the spread of the virus in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cant-let-guard-down-will-issue-new-sops-for-festive-season-cm/articleshow/85115171.cms||---

On Friday she said that if the NDA government at the Centre decides to take up the matter, her party would support it fully within and outside Parliament. “BSP has been asking for a separate census for OBCs and continues to reiterate it. If the central government takes any positive steps for this, then BSP will definitely support it,” she tweeted. देश में ओ.बी.सी. समाज की अलग से जनगणना कराने की माँग बी.एस.पी. शुरू से ही लगातार करती रही है तथा अभी भी बी.एस.पी.… https://t.co/H25MGKP9A1— Mayawati (@Mayawati) 1628226451000A senior party leader said that the matter had come to the forefront due to the ongoing Parliament session, with the 2021 census yet to take place. Various formal and informal discussions had been taking place on the issue even in Parliament, the BSP member said, even though the Centre was silent on its plan of action. “OBCs are an integral part of BSP’s social engineering programme,” the member said, adding that the party was already working on this issue on the ground level and was likely to amplify its efforts in the coming weeks. “BSP has been on the forefront in giving representation to OBCs since its formation by Kanshi Ram. It is another matter now that the party has to work towards bringing them back into its fold as many have left us over the past few years. What is visible in our ongoing campaign for UP is the Prabuddha Sammelan aimed at Brahmins but we are also working on ground through our ‘bhaichara committees’ to draw OBCs back into the party,” the member said. Sources in the party said that ‘bhaichara committees’ have been working in each block and sector to draw together members of all communities but a special focus this time are the OBCs and MBCs like Kahar, Kashyap, Bind, Nishad, Pal etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-back-nda-if-it-conducts-separate-census-for-obcs-maya/articleshow/85116974.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Rahul Ramnath, co-committee member of United Hospitality Association said, “Groups of restaurant/eatery owners and other traders went to different police stations in Peth areas and Deccan region to request them to not take action against those who are participating in a peaceful protest to demand revision of shop timings in the city. It is a question of our survival now. We will adhere to the rules of weekend lockdown in the hope that some good news comes our way on Saturday. If our demands are not met, we will be hosting a silent protest along with other associations — such as the Hotel and Restaurant Association (Wester India), National Restaurant Association of India and the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association on August 10.” Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association said, “We met the mayor, who said he has sent a letter to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar conveying our demands for a change in operation timings. We have requested to be allowed to operate at 50% capacity from 11am to 3pm and from 7pm to 10.30-11 pm.” Restaurateur Sandy Singh said weekend lockdowns are responsible for over 70% loss of business for the hospitality sector in the city. Senior police inspector Rajendra Landge, said, “The businessmen requested us not to take action against them for keeping their shutters open past the 4pm deadline while they protest to demand a change in shop timings. They tried to give us the keys to their shops which we did not accept.

---||Nagpur||NMC implements 5% rebate with retrospective effect from July 1||Nagpur: In some relief on property tax, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has implemented rebate of 5% in property tax, effective July 1. Around 51,000 taxpayers have benefitted from rebate of 10% implemented between April 1 and June 30.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B implemented the 5% rebate on Friday. “Timely payment of tax is good for taxpayers as well as welfare of the city and public. Covid-19 pandemic caused financial loss to many people. Therefore, I proposed rebate in my budget, which was incorporated by standing committee chairman, and approved by general body. Rebate of 10% resulted in encouragement for timely payment of tax dues. Therefore, we decided to extend it. We also want to incentivise tax payments and recognize prompt taxpayers with rebates,” he said.NMC general body had approved rebate of 5% in the meeting on July 22.NMC deputy commissioner Milind Meshram said, “Taxpayers who paid tax for entire current fiscal from July 1 will also get rebate of 5%. This rebate will be on general tax and other components, excluding those of state government. Taxpayers can avail this rebate by paying tax on or before December 31.”Earlier, NMC used to give rebate of 2-4% but only on general tax. Rebate was very less and for very short period.During the discussion on budget on May 31, rebate of 10% was approved. It was implemented with retrospective effect from April 1. The taxpayers did not get demand notes but paid tax and got the benefit.Meshram said, “Around 51,000 taxpayers paid property tax of around Rs28 crore till June 30 and they got rebate of around Rs2 crore.”Many could not get demand notes so they did not avail the rebate of 10%. Therefore, the civic body decided to continue with rebate system but reduced it to 5%.Supposed to be distributed to 6 lakh taxpayers in April, demand notes distribution for 2021-22 by NMC has been delayed. NMC’s property tax department published and handed over demand notes of 5.75 lakh taxpayers by May-end. The zones have distributed demand notes to around 3 lakh taxpayers till date, and the process continues.Meshram said, “Distribution was delayed due to pandemic works. Also, we discontinued private agency engaged in distribution of demand notes. Our staffers are visiting households and distributing demand notes.”But the demand notes have no mention about 5% rebate.The delay in distribution of demand notes did not affect revenue of NMC. From April 1 to August 4, the civic body got Rs64.09 crore tax of which current demand was Rs42.71 crore and arrears of Rs21.38 crore.In the corresponding period in last fiscal, the NMC had earned revenue of Rs47.5 crore of which Rs29.38 crore was current demand and arrears was Rs18.12 crore.BOXIN A NUTSHELL* NMC used to give rebate of 2-4% only on general tax, which was very less* NMC decided to encourage timely payment and give incentive to prompt payers* Rebate of 10% was given from April 1 to June 30* Around 51,000 taxpayers paid Rs28 crore till June 30 and got rebate of Rs2 crore* NMC’s distribution of demand notes delayed this fiscal* Only 3 lakh of total 6 lakh demand notes distributed till date* Rebate of 5% approved on July 22 and implemented on August 6* Rebate will be effective July 1 and continue till December 31||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-implements-5-rebate-with-retrospective-effect-from-july-1/articleshow/85110672.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Nagpur||Can’t ignore crime’s seriousness even if accused is doctor: HC||Nagpur: While rejecting the anticipatory bail plea of a well-known doctor, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has made it clear that just because he is into a noble profession, the seriousness of his crime cannot be ignored.Justice Vinay Joshi said that one cannot predict in which way the information from the accused (doctor) would assist or provide a clue to the investigating agency for arriving at a logical conclusion. “Prima facie, there is no material to indicate that the accusation has been made with an object of injuring or humiliating him for having been arrested. Merely because the applicant is a doctor by profession and having immovable property, other vital material and seriousness of crime can’t be overlooked,” the judge said.Dismissing the plea of Meditrina Hospital director Dr Sameer Paltewar, the HC said that in such cases thorough investigation from various angles, including the accounts experts and computer system experts, would be needed. “On thorough investigation, the police would be in a position to pinpoint who, and in which manner, manipulated the account. At this juncture, there is ample material against the accused, at least to direct him to join the course of investigation.”The petitioner moved the judiciary seeking anticipatory bail after an offence was registered against him for alleged irregularities in the state government’s Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY). He was booked under Sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 268, 471 of IPC and Section 66 (C) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.The doctor contended that the inquiry is already ordered and the case is largely dependent upon the documents. Additionally, the investigating agency has already seized computers and hard disk and, therefore, there is no necessity of custodial interrogation, the doctor stated and argued that he is a reputed person working as a neurosurgeon, having deep roots in society. The petitioner stated that except one crime registered at the behest of his partner — director Ganesh Chakkarwar — he has a clean record. The doctor said that he cooperated with the investigating agency while on interim bail and assured to continue with the same.Quoting the prosecutions’ charges, justice Joshi noted that alteration was found in 57 bills submitted by the hospital, which would likely go up as the probe progresses. “Obviously, the alleged misappropriation is of crores of rupees. The petitioner would be able to furnish the relevant information during the course of interrogation. In view of his position of being major shareholder and chief executive officer (CEO) of the hospital, the possibility of pressurizing his staff can’t be ruled out. It’s not a fit case to use judicial discretion and grant pre-arrest protection,” said the judge.What HC said* Alleged misappropriation in government scheme is of crores of rupees* One can’t predict in which way information from accused doctor would assist* Info from him can lead to clue for investigating agency to arrive to a logical conclusion* In such cases thorough probe from various angles would be needed* After investigation, cops would be in a position to pinpoint accounts manipulation * At this juncture, there is ample material on record against the accused||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cant-ignore-crimes-seriousness-even-if-accused-is-doctor-hc/articleshow/85110708.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The situation will be the same for the next two days due to lack of doses.Inoculation will continue at 11 Covaxin centres of which five started on Friday.Due to lack of doses, vaccination continued only in three centres of Covishield — AIIMS, Indira Air Force and Motibagh Poly Clinic — on Friday.The state government has supplied good amount of Covaxin to the district a couple of days ago. Therefore, vaccination was held in six centres of Covaxin on Friday and will continue on Saturday.NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “Centres of Covaxin have also been opened at AIIMS, Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya, Isolation Hospital, Ayush Hospital at Sadar and Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital. These centres will continue from now onwards. The plan is to open a few more centres of Covaxin as the government supplied huge quantum of doses,” he said.Most of the beneficiaries and doctors prefer Covaxin due to very less adverse event following immunization (AEFI). But it was not available in many centres.Initially, Covaxin was available only at Government Medical College and Hospital for a long period.The number of beneficiaries dropped to a great extent due to no vaccination at NMC’s Covishield centres. Only 2,711 could get the jab at the civic body’s centres on Friday while 509 people were vaccinated in 26 private centres.Sources in the state public health department said fresh stock is expected from the government by Sunday afternoon. Thus, there will be no vaccination in the city on Saturday and Sunday. Inoculation will resume on Monday.Vaccination continued in the centres of Zilla Parishad (ZP) in rural parts of the district. Total 3,803 people took the jab. Thus, 7,023 people were vaccinated in the district on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-vaccination-in-most-of-nmcs-covishield-centres/articleshow/85110688.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

By Friday afternoon, both the rivers were flowing about one and half metres below the danger mark with the water level of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers rising 20 and 15 centimetres per hour, respectively. The situation is likely to worsen as water from the river Chambal will reach the Yamuna by Saturday. After witnessing the rise in water level of the two rivers, the city police installed barricading on routes leading to Sanagm. Apart from sounding an alert for villages and areas located on the banks of the rivers Ganga and Yamuna, duties of State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) and Jal police personnel have been assigned to take immediate remedial measures in low- lying areas if flood water continues to enter into these pockets. Additional district magistrate (Finance & Revenue) MP Singh on Friday told TOI, “SDRF and Jal police have deployed at Bagahra and low-lying areas after flood water started entering the localities. We have also deployed three boats at Badra Sonauti route as the road connecting Badra Sonauti village with Jhunsi/Phulpur has been submerged in flood water.” As per the current situation, residents living in low-lying areas are maintaining a close watch on water level and claimed that they would be shifting to temporary camps set up by the district administration if needed. They, however, claimed that the water level of both Ganga and Yamuna has gone up in the past 24 hours. Officials said that though both the Ganga and the Yamuna were flowing about one and half metres below the danger mark by Friday afternoon, the level of water was rising continuously. The water level of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers was rising at a pace of 20 and 15 centimetres per hour, respectively. The water level of the Ganga at Phaphamau was recorded at 83.03 metres at 12 noon. At Chatnag, the same was registered at 82.30 metres. Similarly, the level of the Yamuna in the Naini area was measured at 82.84 metres. The danger mark of both the rivers is 84.73 metres. Singh said, “In view of the continuous rise in the water level of both the rivers, the district administration has deployed boats to help residents of the low-lying areas. The water level of both the rivers is being regularly monitored.” He added that water level of both the rivers was likely to rise further as water from the Chambal river will be reaching Yamuna on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/flood-water-enters-low-lyingareas-in-city-boats-deployed/articleshow/85116066.cms||---

This will boost the vaccination of first dose beneficiaries, as the focus amid low supply was to cover second dose recipients. Covishield, which has been administered to over 90% of the total 62 lakh beneficiaries in the district, is still in short supply at the government-run vaccination sites, the officials said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The district received a steady supply of over 46,000 Covaxin doses and around 52,000 Covishield doses on August 3 and more doses are expected on Saturday. Now that more Covishield beneficiaries are due for the second dose, the first dose of Covaxin can be made available. We have suggested this to the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies.” Suryakant Devkar, Pune civic body’s immunisation officer, said some of the special drives offering Covishield were now using Covaxin. “We cannot stop the special drives due to the shortage of Covishiled. So, we are offering Covaxin to the beneficiaries now. The shortage has affected over 190 vaccination sites across the civic limits,” he said. Meanwhile, the district vaccinated only 26,680 beneficiaries on Friday because of the short supply of Covishield doses. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said they would conduct only Covaxin drive across seven sites on Saturday, while the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corproations (PCMC) officials said they too would be conducting only Covaxin drive across eight vaccination sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covaxin-supply-to-streamline-this-month-covishield-shortage-persists/articleshow/85115198.cms||Piyush Bhusari

A notification issued by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B states that the height of idols at Sarvajanik Ganesh Mandals should not exceed 4ft while the maximum height for homes is 2ft.The civic body has disallowed any religious procession during the ensuing festive season in view of the perceived third Covid wave.The NMC has replicated the Maharashtra government’s order issued in June regarding religious festivities and restriction on height of idols.Radhakrishnan clarified that the appropriate restrictions under “Break The Chain” will be in place. “So there will be no relaxation for Ganeshotsav,” the civic chief said.The mandals will have to keep the celebrations simple and permissions must be sought for erecting pandals from the zonal offices and other authorities concerned.According to Radhakrishnan, households should try to avoid installing clay idols and instead go for metal or marble stone ones. Those installing clay or eco-friendly idols should immerse them at their respective homes and if it was not possible, then they should prefer immersion in artificial tanks to be installed by the NMC in nearby locations.Various social organizations, housing societies and public representatives should come forward to help the NMC for creating artificial immersion tanks.The notification also pointed out that the mandals should avoid collecting donations and accept only voluntary contributions. Advertisements of mandals should be avoided to curtail rush.The NMC has advised the mandals against holding cultural events. It further appealed to the organizers to conduct healthcare programmes like blood donation and awareness camps regarding Covid-19, malaria and dengue among others.It has also urged organizers to ensure all follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and asked them to arrange online darshan through social networking sites, local cable networks and websites etc.Similarly, it advised them (mandals) to ensure there is no rush during arti, bhajan, kirtan and other religious programmes. The mandals must keep thermal scanners, sanitizers, ensure physical distancing and sanitization of premises frequently.Citing Central Pollution Control Board’s order issued on May 12, 2020, the NMC has banned use and sale of plaster of paris idols in the city limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-restricts-height-of-ganesh-idols-to-4ft-for-mandals-and-2ft-for-homes/articleshow/85110731.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

He was convicted on April 20, 2013, by special CBI court at Patiala. At the time, Punjab judicial services officer Gopal was presiding officer of the CBI court that convicted Rai. In his plea seeking stay on his conviction, Rai contended that additional district & sessions judge-cum-special judge, CBI, Patiala (currently under suspension), Hemant Gopal, who had convicted him, was found guilty of grave misconduct by the enquiry officer-cum-district & sessions judge at Panchkula, vide enquiry report dated March 31, 2018. Rai’s counsel further argued that it was an established fact that Gopal, as CBI special court judge, had accepted illegal gratification of Rs 40 lakh from co-accused Parminder and had demanded Rs 1 crore from him and others. “Singh was acquitted because he had paid the illegal gratification of Rs 40 lakh, whereas the applicant-appellant and other accused were convicted as they did not pay any amount to him,” counsel representing the former MLA argued, while seeking stay on his conviction. After hearing the plea, the HC issued notice to CBI to file reply on the contention raised by Rai and asked the registrar general of the HC regarding the action taken against the former CBI judge after his indictment in the inquiry report. Rai was convicted and sentenced to seven year imprisonment in the paddy scam in which the CBI had registered a case on the directions of the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-seeks-report-on-judge-suspended-for-rs-40l-bribe/articleshow/85115373.cms||---

This is the first time any aircraft, let alone a naval aircraft, kissed the flight deck of ‘Mother’, as naval aviators affectionately call an aircraft carrier. The landing comes a full 50 years after the first naval Sea King landed on the British-built INS Vikrant (R11) on July 26, 1971. The Sea King 42B took off from INS Garuda, Kochi, and flew out to sea to link up with IAC 1 before setting its wheels down on the aircraft carrier. Pynumootil, who is presently stationed in Goa as the flag officer of Goa area (FOGA), is a qualified pilot on the Sea King 42 B/C and has commanded INAS 330, the carrier-borne anti-submarine warfare Sea King squadron. On completion of the first landing, Pynumootil also has the distinction of landing on all four Indian aircraft carriers. The IAC 1 sailed out of Kochi for sea trials on Wednesday as the Indian Navy prepares the massive floating complex for commissioning in August 2022, when she will be christened as INS Vikrant, after the Indian Navy’s very first aircraft carrier. INS Vikrant (R11) was a Majestic-class 19,500-tonne warship that was decommissioned in 1997. India acquired it from the United Kingdom in 1961, and the carrier played a stellar role in the 1971 war that led to the birth of Bangladesh. For the Indian Navy, IAC 1 is the first Indian-built aircraft carrier, unlike the ‘hand-me-down’ British aircraft carriers or the Russian-built INS Vikramaditya. The warship has been designed by the directorate of naval design, and is being built at Cochin Shipyard Limited. IAC 1 has the capacity to carry 36 fighter jets, and will soon have MiG-29K fighter jets and American anti-submarine warfare MH60 R helicopters deployed. The moniker Vikrant holds a close place in the Indian Navy’s heart as it helped the fleet gain the nuances of the huge complexities of carrier operations. Most naval aviators who flew SeaHawks, Sea Kings, Alizes and Chetaks learnt deck operations aboard the INS Vikrant. Landing an aircraft on a carrier is a complex, variable and highly-challenging process, particularly during rough sea conditions, and pilots undergo rigorous training to qualify for deck operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-naval-head-lands-history-on-vikrant/articleshow/85115236.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Elamkulam, Aluva to get sewage plants||KOCHI: The two proposed sewage treatment plants under the vertical sewage section of Kerala water Authority (KWA) will come up at Elamkulam and Aluva market with 25 million litres per day (MLD) and 7 MLD capacities, respectively. KWA has asked respective local bodies to provide either government land or acquire private land for setting up pump houses, where sewage waste will be collected before being pumped to plants through pipelines. “The decision on the places were taken two days ago. In Elamkulam, we have land. In Aluva, the local body is going to shift the functioning of the existing market to a new place. Once it is over, the plant can be set up in the old market place. The council has to pass the decision in this regard,” said a KWA official. Minimum 10 cents of land is required for setting up a pump house and allied equipment like motor and pump sets.  “If 22 pump houses are required for a seven MLD plant in Aluva, we need a total of two acre 20 cents for the project. The number of pump houses will be depending upon the area and load of the plant. We have reached seven MLD loads in Aluva based on the assessment of increase in population in the area in future,” said the official. Reconnaissance and field survey will be conducted to identify pump houses required for each plant. The survey will also include areas from where sewage waste should be pumped to the plant. The official said Kochi corporation will require four or five more sewage plants to address the issue of polluting water bodies in the city. District sewage action plan report had found that Ernakulam generates 357 million litre sewage waste per day and of this Kochi corporation, constitutes 147 MLD. Officials have been asked to utilize the available land in Elamkulam maximum. Detailed project report of the plants has been prepared and has been directed to submit it by September 10. Meanwhile, the decision on whether Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) will renovate the existing 4.5 MLD plant at Elamkulam and run it will be taken soon. Managing directors of KMRL and KWA had held a discussion in this regard recently. The manure of the sewage waste stockpiled in the plant for more than 10 years will be used in the plant itself as there are no takers for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/elamkulam-aluva-to-get-sewage-plants/articleshow/85112772.cms||T C Sreemol

Such persons soon take out their mobile and start recording the incident. “The clips are promptly posted on the social media, tarnishing the petrol pumps’ image,” said Gupta.“The incidents have increased after the rates have gone. There is a general impression that it’s the dealer who is benefiting due to rising fuel prices and is also tweaking the machine so that less volume is filled,” said GuptaThe matter has been reported to the police and a recent video posted on the social media was deleted also, he said.VPDA said the stock complain is that less petrol was filled in the vehicle. “The consumers ask to the staff to empty the tank. On doing it, they allege that there was higher volume in the tank which cannot be proven,” said the dealers.The VPDA said the consumers often allege that the dispensing machines can be tweaked. However, it is not technically possible. “The new machines have a faster rate of flow,” said Gupta.There is also a demand that the dispensing pipe should be made of transparent material. “The dealers have no objection to it but the proposal needs to be put up before the oil marketing companies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vigilantism-by-consumers-leaves-petrol-pump-staffers-harassed/articleshow/85110746.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three held for Rs 55 lakh robbery at angadiya businessman’s shop||MUMBAI: Three men have been arrested for carrying out a brazen daylight robbery and walking away with Rs55 lakh after allegedly threatening an angadiya businessman at Zaveri Bazar near Crawford Market. The incident took place on July 22. Those arrested include Goregaon resident Manoj Jain (46), and Bihar residents —Rajesh Rai (33) and Chandrashekhar Thakur (35). A hunt has been launched for a fourth accused, who is still at large. LT Marg police said that the complainant, a 55-year-old businessman, was in his shop with two employees when two masked men barged into the shop. One of them was carrying a bag on his back. He threatened the businessman saying there was a weapon inside and asked him to hand over all the money in the office. “He warned him of dire consequences if he did not cooperate or if he tried to alert neighbouring shop owners,” a police officer, who is part of the investigation, said. The panicked businessman gave them Rs 55 lakh kept in his office bag. The businessman then approached the police and a case of robbery and criminal intimidation was registered. DCP Rajiv Jain formed a team led by senior inspector Dipak Nikam to nab the culprits. “We analysed footage from around 125 CCTV cameras. While going through footage from cameras installed near the shop, we found that two men had entered the shop. They were joined by a third while they were going back. Footage from other CCTV cameras showed the three accused had boarded a cab near Marine Lines railway station,” said an officer. Investigators found that the three accused had changed taxis thrice. They alighted from the first cab at Reay Road and hired another cab. They got off at Prabhadevi, where they split the loot and went their separate ways. While Jain headed for another location in the city, Rai and Thakur left for Bihar. Using the footage, police managed to get the number of one of the cabs. They also analysed mobile data. In a major breakthrough, police found that the mobile number of one of the accused was active at several locations. Police teams left for different places, and within a week, all the three accused were caught and Rs 26 lakh was recovered from them. During interrogation, investigators learnt that Rai had earlier worked in Zaveri Bazar area and was familiar with its business culture. Before carrying out the robbery, the accused had also done a reconnaissance of the place. Jain told the police that he had met Rai in Arthur Road jail where he had been jailed in a 2014 Wadala robbery case. Rai and Thakur had come from Bihar on July 17 and stayed in Bhiwandi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-three-held-for-rs-55l-robbery-at-angadiya-businessmans-shop/articleshow/85116999.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Godinho said that such concession will be granted to taxi owners provided they submit an undertaking that they will fit the digital meters. Yellow and black and airport taxi owners met Godinho and requested him for extended time, stating that they could not fit the digital meters due to difficulties arising out of the pandemic situation. “They are happy that for the first time, the government keeping their difficulties in mind has increased taxi fare by Rs Three per kilometer. The last time the fare was hiked in 2014. They are now in the mood to fit the digital meters. They said due to Covid there are some genuine difficulties, some are affected by Covid and Covid-related complications and some do not have the money at present to fit the meters. So their only request is to give more time to fit the meters,” said Godinho. The minister said the period to fit digital meters has already lapsed for taxi owners with registration number of series zero and one. “We were to issue termination to those who do not fit the meters from Friday. But I spoke to secretary transport. Taxi owners are main stakeholders of tourism. We will approach the high court accordingly. We will give them 15 more days. But I have asked them to give it in writing. They will have to submit in bulk the applications with undertaking that they will fit the meters,” said Godinho. He said the state government has sped up the process of reimbursing 50% of the meter cost. “They will get the money in their accounts within 15 days. We have given them this benefit because if they do not fit the meters, the court will pull up both the government as well as the taxi owners. My only request to them is that fit the taxi meters because I have not imposed this requirement, the high court has. Don’t be on the wrong side of the law,” said Godinho.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/15-day-extension-for-cabbies-to-fit-meters/articleshow/85115367.cms||---

The officials seized 11 dead and 9 injured birds from them. All the accused belong to Chhattisgarh.The accused have been identified as Mahesh Solanki, Choradevi (Bilaspur), Nanduram Solanki, Junwani (Bhatapara), and Rakesh Malviya, Kora (Bilaspur). They were staying temporarily in the city under the Narendra Nagar bridge. Egrets are listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and hunting them is a non-bailable offence.ACF Surendra Kale said, “The accused were produced before JMFC SD Mehta, Nagpur. We opposed bail to the accused. The court said this was a serious crime and rejected their bail and remanded them to magisterial custody (MCR) till August 18. All the youth were engaged in selling brooms. They used to hunt these birds using slingshots.”According to RFO VS Gangawane, “The hunting of birds was for consuming its meat and it was first noticed by wildlife lovers Pratik Dhawad, Nitesh Bhandakkar, Vikrant Kawle, Ankit Salode, Sahit Sharnagat, and Dheeraj Miskin. They called up state wildlife board member Kundan Hate and Hudkeshwar police.”Hate said according to these wildlife lovers, the accused were hitting the birds relaxing on a tree with slingshots. The youths tried to stop them but in vain. However, police reached the spot and took custody of the accused.Meanwhile, forest guard LA Warghat rushed to the spot and arrested the accused. “We collected 11 dead and 9 injured birds and shifted them to Transit Treatment Centre (TTC), Seminary Hills,” said Kale.“After being hit by stones the condition of these birds is critical,” said wildlife veterinarians Dr Syed Bilal and Siddhant More.Hate said, “The massive and rapid expansion of the egret’s range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. These birds feed on a wide range of prey, particularly insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies, maggots, and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, lizards, and earthworms and play a crucial role in the environment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-held-for-hunting-egrets-11-dead-9-injured-birds-seized/articleshow/85110805.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Pune||Pune curbs can be eased by disaster management authorities: Chief secretary||PUNE: Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday said further relaxations in Pune city, which has a lower positivity rate than Pimpri Chinchwad and the rural areas, could be decided by the district disaster management authorities as per the earlier state guidelines on considering the three areas as separate administrative entities. “Our framework document provides for the administrative units to be carved out like this. The local disaster management authorities can decide on further relaxations for Pune city, as per the positivity rate. If they need any concurrence from the state government, it will be provided,” Kunte told TOI. The state had, in the latest break-the-chain order, relaxed the Covid curbs in 22 out of 36 districts. It had, however, left the decision to reduce restrictions in Mumbai, Mumbai suburban and Thane to the respective district disaster management authorities. The curbs were eased by the local authorities in these three districts. The government had not allowed any further relaxations in 11 districts, including Pune. This was widely opposed by citizens and business owners, who said the government should have considered Pune city as a separate administrative unit and eased the curbs. Though the weekly positivity rate in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits for the current week will be available on Saturday, it was 3.4% for the week ending last Saturday. The weekly positivity rate for areas under the jurisdiction of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) was 4.3% and Pune rural 5.6%. Kunte said, “If it feels necessary, the district disaster management authority (DDMA) can consult the state during the process. Otherwise, the DDMA has certain powers and can take a decision on further relaxations in Pune city, if the positivity rate is low, like other Maharashtra districts that got some relaxations (as per the August 2 order.” He said if the authorities decided to bring in some relaxations in Pune city, one mechanism that could be worked out would be to restrict public movement from Pune rural to the PMC limits to avoid Covid spread. On the need for the DDMA to send a formal proposal in this regard to the state government, Kunte said, “That is left to the DDMA. If it feels it needs to send a proposal to the state government for approval on any matter, it can do so.” The district collector is the chairman of the DDMA, as per the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Kunte said such decisions have to be taken locally “because of the loco-regional dynamics such as people’s movement within the administrative units”. He added, “The decision making process has to be local and guided by local factors such as movement of people and positivity rate.” Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI, “The issue will be discussed at the weekly review meeting on Sunday. All decisions are taken during this meeting. A decision on this issue will also be taken after due consultations with the guardian minister and other district authorities.” Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao did not respond to TOI’s calls, SMSs and WhatsApp messages seeking a comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-curbs-can-be-eased-by-disaster-management-authorities-chief-secy/articleshow/85115259.cms||Neha Madaan

NMC’s general body too had passed a resolution in this regard.Handing over of Aapli Bus service will be another project apart from several infrastructure projects being implemented by MahaMetro.Kukde was elected chairman of the 13-member transport committee unopposed. The committee has 10 BJP corporators, 2 of the Congress and 1 from BSP. The election was conducted by district election officer and collector R Vimala at the NMC headquarters.Speaking to media persons, Kukde said his focus will be on reducing financial loss of the cash-strapped NMC. Pre-Covid, NMC was spending Rs7 crore per month as viability gap funding to run Aapli Buses through three Red and one electric bus operators.“My focus will be to accelerate the process of converting NMC-owned diesel buses into CNG. At present, the NMC has converted 83 diesel-run standard buses and another 167 buses will be converted into CNG,” he said.The civic body has already placed an order for procuring 40 more electric buses. Besides this, through Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDLC), the civic body will receive 15 additional electric buses. NSSCDCL too announced this in its board meeting on Friday. At present, the NMC runs 6 electric buses. Operation of electric and CNG buses will reduce the operation cost.Kukde will also explore other options to increase transport department revenue by starting advertisements on Aapli Buses. “I will check whether the civic body can start a commercial complex on its 2.5 acre land in Mor Bhavan,” he added.Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, former mayor Sandip Joshi, leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve and other corporators were present at Kukde’s swearing-in ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/okay-with-mahametro-running-aapli-bus-if-party-feels-so-kukde/articleshow/85110781.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Data with food and civil supplies department shows in 24 hours spanning Thursday and Friday, UP government disbursed 2.9 lakh metric tonnes of grains covering 1.36 crore ration card holders through 80,000 fair price shops. This translates into coverage of 5.8crore beneficiaries in UP since the scheme kick-started. This round of PMGKAY will continue till August 16 in the state, which has 3.6crore ration card holders covering 14.86 crore beneficiaries. Additional food commissioner Anil Kumar Dubey said, the new milestone in food grain distribution to 81.59 lakh card holders surpassed the previous single-day record on September 2020, when 79.6 lakh ration card holders were handed out 1.68 lakh metric tonnes of grains. “This time, nodal officers deputed in all districts ensured that distribution of 5kg food grain (3kg wheat and 2kg rice) per unit in a single ration card is accelerated. The festive mood also contributed its bit in creating a new record,” he said, while speaking to TOI. Involvement of people’s representatives, including MPs, MLAs and zila panchayat presidents and members expedited distribution of grains to beneficiaries. Dubey said, foodgrain distribution was essentially done through biometric authentication, envisaging Aadhaar card seeding to ensure transparency. The scheme, which will be executed every month till November this year, is seen as a big public outreach measure of the BJP in the run-up to UP assembly elections next year. As a matter of fact, beneficiaries, this time, were also distributed waterproof bags carrying a photograph of PM Modi. The scheme was announced by the prime minister as part of the existing PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana on March 26, 2020, soon after Covidtriggered lockdown was imposed. The scheme’s formal launch in April last year saw the state government getting into an overdrive to add 22.93 new card holders. Records show that till date, 77.37 lakh metric tonnes of food grain has been distributed to nearly 15crore beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/single-day-chartbuster-1-7l-mt-grains-given-to-81l-card-holders-in-up/articleshow/85117014.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Hyderabad||Drone terror: Forces count on anti-drone tech to neutralise it||HYDERABAD: In the wake of recent drone IED attacks in Jammu and Maoists using drone cameras for surveillance, security forces guarding vital installations are now keen on immediate deployment of anti-drone systems to effectively counter the threat. The double drone terror attack on Jammu Airforce Station with IEDs on June 27 and subsequent sightings of unidentified drones at different places close to India-Pakistan border has forced security agencies to rethink defence preparedness against such UAV attacks. Cops operating in Maoist-hit Gadchiroli (Maharashtra) and Dandakaranya (Chhattisgarh) have also spotted drones near camps of security forces. Given the backdrop, a conference was recently held at Shamirpet at National Industrial Security Academy (NISA) — training academy of CISF which guards several vital installations such as airports, nuclear facilities, oil refineries, power projects and government offices — to discuss drone and anti-drone technologies. CISF authorities said that the agency immediately required anti-drone technologies to safeguard establishments under their protection. “We have already been using drones for surveillance. But anti-drone technology is not available. A Jammu-like drone attack on some of the vital facilities guarded by us could cause unimaginable loss,” said a CISF official. Another paramilitary agency, CRPF, which has already been using drones for surveillance, is also counting on anti-drone tech to foil plans of ultras. “We have been using UAVs to track Maoist movements. Drones are being used to monitor terror suspects in J&K. But with Maoists and terrorist groups also using drones for surveillance and even attacks, now we need a counter mechanism. As of now we just open fire when any drone flies over our camps,” said a CRPF official. A representative of Zen Technologies Ltd, one of the companies involved in development of Anti-Drone System, has mentioned their system can identify, track drones using multiple methods including radio frequency detection, video-based ID & tracking, radar and neutralise it by either jamming frequency or by shooting it down using an auto aligning gun. The system can also capture rogue drones using a drone with a hanging net. “Currently our Anti-Drone System is being tested by security forces,” Zen Technologies Ltd representative Abdul Imran said. While till now it has been a case of one or two drones (as in Jammu incident), the threat from multiple drones attacking simultaneously could be a reality soon. Badrinarayan Rangarajan, founder of Vishwa Swarm which is a drone swarm project incubated at Bangalore based Art Park, said: “We are working towards addressing a potential future threat, an attack by a swarm of drones. Our project Vishwa Swarm is to use a swarm of drones to neutralise the threat. Currently we do not have a comprehensive anti-drone solution in the country. Along with other companies who are into manufacturing drones, our aim is to come up with a comprehensive solution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drone-terror-forces-count-on-anti-drone-tech-to-neutralise-it/articleshow/85112835.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: CBI books ex-exam controller of UPPSC for faulty selections||LUCKNOW: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case under Prevention of Corruption Act, dishonesty, criminal misconduct and forgery against former controller of examinations (COE) of Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) on Friday. The central agency has also booked unidentified persons in the case. The UP government had recommended the CBI probe into the case on September 4, 2018. A CBI team carried out a search operation at the Ansal API society near Shaheed Path where residential premises of former COE Prabhunath is located. Searches were continuing till the last reports came in. A senior CBI official privy to the probe said that Prabhunath and some of his subordinates had abused their official position, resulting in selection of undeserving candidates in the additional private secretary (APS) exam in 2010. The official said that UPPSC had advertised 250 posts of APS in 2010 for the direct recruitment through an advertisement. The exam result was declared in October 2017. It was alleged that rules were violated and additional relaxation was given in the Hindi shorthand test to favour some candidates. Even though the commission in June 2015 had approved relaxation of 5% errors in Hindi shorthand test, candidates, who had committed up to 8% mistakes, were also allegedly declared qualified for the computer test, stated to be the third phase of the examination. Moreover, advertisement rules were also relaxed for a few candidates. “Though computer certificates submitted by some candidates were found to be forged, they were declared qualified by the commission,” said the CBI official. During the probe the CBI found that instead of 913 students, who were qualified, the then COE gave names of 1,244 candidates as qualified. “The Gopan section three also did not crosscheck the gross error and did not raise any objection. It rather put up the list overlooking the decision taken by the examination committee in 2015,” the CBI officer added. Besides, anomalies in evaluation of Hindi shorthand test and Hindi type test were detected, the CBI officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cbi-books-ex-exam-controller-of-uppsc-for-faulty-selections/articleshow/85117015.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Teen plots self’s fake kidnapping ‘to teach father a lesson’||Nagpur: A 19-year-old and her friend from the neighbourhood allegedly scripted a bizarre kidnapping drama to teach the girl’s father “a lesson for his overprotective nature”. The hoax, which triggered a kidnapping scare in Chandan Nagar on Friday, came to an end with the police nabbing two accused.Two so-called ‘kidnappers’ demanded Rs 30 lakh ransom, threatening to chop off the girl’s body otherwise. City police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar’s team spread across the city — plugging entry and exit routes, checking CCTV cameras at every junction and enlisting the help of cyber experts, only to find out it was a hoax.Using the girl’s mobile phone, the ‘kidnappers’ made around half a dozen calls between 7.14am and 7.45am, asking for Rs30 lakh and then reducing it to Rs20 lakh. They tied scarves around their necks to make their voices sound hoarse and spoke in a Haryanvi accent, which unnerved the cops too.The teenager had a CCTV connection of her residence in her cellphone. After watching the cops stepping into her house through the phone, her friends warned her father of dire consequences.Cops booked the two youngsters — Rishikesh Korke and Chiku Chavan — for kidnapping and extortion which, if proved before the court, may lead to a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment. Korke and Chavan are Std XII pass outs. Police said Korke and the teenage girl in question had planned the kidnapping a day ago. Korke had approached a friend for his car but the vehicle had punctures. Later, Korke hired another car from a garage to execute the bizarre drama. He picked up the girl from her residence, who stepped out out under the pretext of taking the dog for a walk, before driving to different parts of the city like Futala Lake and Seminary Hills.After learning that the cops have started a probe, the girl used a passerby’s phone to tell her father she was abandoned near Sakkardara Lake. The cops later nabbed Korke and Chavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/teen-plots-selfs-fake-kidnapping-to-teach-father-a-lesson/articleshow/85110839.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kochi||Customs to quiz all heist bid accused||Kochi: Customs department would question all 17 accused in the Ramanattukara gold heist bid case as part of its probe into the Karipur gold smuggling case. Customs submitted this in a report filed on Friday before the additional chief judicial magistrate (economic offences) court opposing bail to prime accused Arjun Ayanki. Customs submitted before the court that the investigation revealed that the accused runs well-organized gangs functioning from Kannur. Customs said that it had approached the magistrate court in Manjeri and sought permission to interrogate the accused in the FIR registered by police in the Ramanattukara case. “The interrogation of these persons is in progress. As there are 17 persons, the process is likely to conclude only by August 9, 2021. It is expected that more evidence can be unearthed when this round of investigation is completed,” customs submitted before the court. The report also briefed the court about the Ramanattukara police FIR. Customs submitted that even as they intercepted Shafeeque, the gold carrier, another gang of smugglers, who had purportedly financed the smuggling operation, had gathered outside the airport to intercept Shafeeque and Ayanki, if Shafeeque handed over the gold to him. “This gang followed Arjun’s vehicle when he moved out of the airport. A cinematic chase ensued and one of the chasing vehicles collided with a lorry and five people lost their lives…It can be seen from the above FIR and remand report that these gangs were targeting Arjun as he was trying to snatch away the gold being financed and smuggled by another set of people and this was not the first such instance of snatching,” customs said. Customs said that they received a person’s statement that Ayanki paid him Rs 2 lakh for leasing his vehicle. “Making payments of such large amounts for leasing in vehicles, which are then used for illegal activities as above, gives way to suspicion that there are influential people behind the curtain and Arjun is the key operator,” customs said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-to-quiz-all-heist-bid-accused/articleshow/85112902.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On a priority basis, Covid-19 vaccination will be taken up on a greater scale in Huzurabad. A team of senior health officials from Hyderabad went to Karimnagar on August 5 and held a meeting with the health staff in Karimnagar on containing the spread of the virus. The team comprised director of public health G Srinivas Rao, director of medical education K Ramesh Reddy and officer on special duty (OSD) in CMO DT Gangadhar. Gangadhar said that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had specially sent the team comprising senior health officials to Karimnagar in view of the rising Covid-19 cases in the district. He said that Covid-19 testing will be increased. When contacted, district medical and health officer (DMHO) Juwaria told TOI that apart from the testing, vaccination will also be increased. “This is being done at the village level. In the coming days, depending on the quantity of vaccine supply and availability, it is intended to vaccinate more people,” she said. So far, in Huzurabad, 50% of the people have got their first dose of vaccine. The number of Covid-19 cases for August 5 show that Karimnagar is in the second place in the most number of cases that have been detected after GHMC areas. Of the 582 cases detected, 83 were in Hyderabad and 61 each in Karimnagar and Warangal Urban. According to the DMHO, vaccine is being administered at 27 centres in Karimnagar district. As many as 11,233 people were given the vaccine on Thursday and 7,487 Covid-19 tests were conducted. “Our focus on containing the spread of Covid-19 and increasing the vaccination is not linked to any election,” Juwaria said. She pointed out that it is advisable for people not to congregate and to take steps to curb Covid-19 spread. Senior health officials from Hyderabad who visited Karimnagar advised district officials that at least 9,000 Covid-19 tests be conducted everyday in the district. Tests will be done at public places and where there is a gathering of people by mobile teams. To detect seasonal diseases, camps will be held at the village level to provide treatment to patients. Director of public health, G Srinivas Rao, directed officials to do primary contact tracing of 20 to 25 people if at all Covid-19 cases are detected and to quarantine those who test positive. Officials will focus on villages where more cases are being reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bypoll-covid-surge-pull-health-officials-to-karimnagar-district/articleshow/85112864.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||TASL to also make fan cowls for Boeing 737s in Hyderabad||Hyderabad: After sealing a deal to manufacture the vertical fins of Boeing’s 737 aircraft earlier this year, Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) will now also manufacture the fan cowls for the US giant’s single aisle aircraft in Hyderabad. TASL on Friday said it has bagged a contract for manufacturing and supplying fan cowls for the Boeing’s 737 family of airplanes at its facility in Adibatla and will supply 50% of the monthly 737 fan cowl requirements from FY2025. The move further ramps up Boeing’s sourcing from India that has already crossed the $1 billion mark from just $250 million a couple of years ago, as was indicated by a top Boeing India official recently. Pointing out that the contract was won by TASL in a global competition, TASL managing director & CEO Sukaran Singh said: “Projects like these with Boeing and other global aerospace companies have greatly helped build TASL's capabilities such that today TASL has the ability to build an entire aircraft or helicopter at high rate production, to global quality, in India.” Fan cowl doors provide an aerodynamic surface over the fan case of the engine, between the inlet and the thrust reverser, and protect engine mounted components and accessories. The two fan cowl doors (left and right) around each airplane engine can be opened to provide access for servicing and maintenance of the engine components and accessories on the fan case of the engine.  TASL also manufactures thousands of critical systems and components for some of Boeing’s most advanced products from its facilities in Hyderabad, Nagpur, Bengaluru. While in February this year, TASL added a new production line for producing vertical fin structures for the 737’s in Hyderabad, a Tata-Boeing joint venture TBAL has been manufacturing aerostructures for Boeing’s AH-64 Apache military helicopters at its facility spread over 14,000 sq mts in Adibatla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tasl-to-also-make-fan-cowls-for-boeing-737s-in-hyderabad/articleshow/85112893.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Builders get relief, RERA grants 6-month extension||MUMBAI: Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) on Friday allowed a six-month extension to builders who have been unable to deliver their projects due to the pandemic. Developers had earlier demanded that the ‘force majeure’ clause (unforeseen circumstances that prevents them from fulfilling a contract) be invoked. This is the second time in the Covid-19 pandemic that the authority has granted such a relief to builders in the state. “All MahaRERA registered projects where completion date, revised completion date or extended completion date expires on or after April 15, 2021, the period of validity for registration of such projects shall be extended by six months,” the authority said in a notification. The six-month period ends mid-October. The authority added that it will accordingly issue project registration certificates with revised timelines for such projects at the earliest and also made it clear that the extension will not apply to projects that were to be completed before April 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-builders-get-relief-rera-grants-6-mth-extension/articleshow/85117029.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s R-value at 0.95, state at critical juncture in Covid fight||HYDERABAD: Despite a decline in Covid-19 caseload, Telangana’s R-value, reproductive number indicating how fast Covid-19 is spreading, saw massive fluctuations before settling near 1 in the last few days. The Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSC) in Chennai has projected Telangana’s current R-value at 0.95, a critical standpoint for infection propagation. Experts strongly suggest that R-value near 1 might lead to either a positive or negative trend, and continuing to follow the Covid-19 protocols is important to curb the virus spread. In mathematical terms, R-value of 1 means that if 100 persons are infected, they will infect another 100. However, in the context of the application, R value 1 denotes a plateau-like scenario in which the number of recoveries equals the number of new infections, and it may not be a cause for concern if proper behaviour is adopted. According to professor Sitabhra Sinha of IMSC, who estimated the R values, the current plateau condition will either lead to a decline in cases or a spike, depending on the Covid-appropriate conduct by the people. “There was an outbreak-like scenario due to massive gatherings recently in Himachal Pradesh where the R-value shot up from a plateau-like condition. There might be another spike in other regions including Telangana as well if similar outbreaks happen,” he said. There have been fluctuations in R-value in Telangana over the past few weeks, but the exact reason cannot be pinpointed because it is dependent on multiple factors, he told TOI. According to experts, Covid-appropriate behaviour by vaccinated persons plays a vital role at this point. “Many vaccine recipients are unaware that they can contribute to an increase in caseload. They may have improved protection against severe infection with the vaccine, but they will infect susceptible populations with mild infections they carry,” Dr Subhodh Kandamuthan, centre head, health care management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) said. On the other hand, for the first time, the state government is undertaking an antibody survey in 30 of the state’s districts. The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has previously conducted sero preliminary surveys in Jangaon, Kamareddy and Nalgonda districts. From the third week of this month, 600 samples from the remaining 30 districts will be collected for the antibody survey. Officials plan to beef up their preparations for the third wave based on the findings. The serosurvey was previously conducted by NIN in four stages, the most recent of which was in July this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telanganas-r-value-at-0-95-state-at-critical-juncture-in-covid-fight/articleshow/85112926.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||BMC junks Rs 50 crore tenders for open spaces’ maintenance over low bids||MUMBAI: The BMC last month scrapped tenders worth Rs 50 crore for the maintenance of more than 200 parks and gardens after contractors bid over 40% below estimated costs and allegedly attempted to create a cartel. The contractors have lost deposits totalling around Rs 50 lakh for bidding so much below estimates. The BMC had floated 24 tenders for the maintenance of around 200 parks and gardens in its wards through a one-year contract. With the tenders scrapped, now several parks are without any full-time maintenance contractors. The decision to scrap the tenders and make contractors forfeit their deposits was taken by additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide. TimesViewPublic open spaces are vital for citizens in a space-starved city like Mumbai. The need for well-maintained, easily accessible open spaces has become even more acute after the pandemic. It is a good move that the BMC has penalised contractors who had bid way below the estimates and would have ended up doing a shoddy job. The BMC must float fresh tenders at once with strict conditions and supervision to improve and beautify open spaces.“Since the contractors bid over 40% below estimates, we have told the contractors to forfeit the deposits and scrapped the tenders. New tenders will be floated next week and we will only go ahead with tenders of the bids that are closer to the estimates. There was no way contractors would have carried out maintenance work in a standard manner at such low costs,” said a senior civic official. In all, the BMC has 1,052 open plots, together measuring 1,200 acre. The BJP alleged the BMC had failed to break the cartel of contractors. “The BMC is now giving out short-term quotation contracts to the same companies at over 50% below the estimated costs. So, scrapping the tenders and then giving work to the same companies doesn’t make any sense. Those companies whose deposits have been forfeited must be barred from taking part in the new tenders. For almost a month, with no dedicated contractor for maintenance, these gardens used by thousands of residents are falling into disrepair,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra.  While usually the BMC floats tenders for a two-year contract, this year it had planned to give it out for only a year.  Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal in his budget speech in February announced a new open spaces policy will be rolled out but it has not happened. NAGAR, an NGO that works on open spaces issues, has also written to Chahal expressing dismay over the 50% cut in the budget for parks and gardens.  The NGO has demanded that the BMC come out with a robust open spaces policy so as to reduce the financial burden on the BMC. “The financial burden on the BMC will be lessened a fair amount by formulating a robust open spaces policy with watertight guidelines, including the checks and balances recommended by NAGAR to the Garden Department in August 2019. Many stakeholders and NGOs are keen to assume responsibility, both financial via CSR and restoration and maintenance, of these open spaces, provided there is a fair policy with at least a three year contract reviewed every year and renewable on good performance,” NAGAR Trustee Nayana Kathpalia had said in the letter to Chahal. With the BMC’s old open spaces policy scrapped in 2016, NGOs and citizen groups have asked the BMC to fast-track the new policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-junks-rs-50cr-tenders-for-open-spaces-maintenance-over-low-bids/articleshow/85117040.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Stating that the government has spent Rs26.6 crore on renovating the fort under the central government’s Swadesh Darshan scheme, Sardesai said that the state government will stand to get a meagre Rs1.5 crore per year from the firm appointed. “Ideally the return on investment should be such that the project breaks even after 8-10 years. Considering the return on investment for this project it will take 25 years for it to break even. Is Aguada fort so bad a business,” Sardesai said while addressing reporters. The Fatorda MLA further charged the government with having “declared a war on Goa’s identity and heritage”. “The chief minister’s agenda is to dilute Goa’s heritage and make Goa powerless,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-questions-tourism-prospects-of-aguada-jail/articleshow/85115410.cms||---

Given the rise in Covid cases, it also brought back weekend curfew in eight districts bordering Kerala and Maharashtra till August 16. After reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state with health and education experts, CM Basavaraj Bommai said schools and colleges will be asked to hold classes on alternate days by dividing students into two batches. “We have decided to do it (reopen educational institutions) in two stages. In the first stage, Class 9-12 and in the second stage, Class 1-8,” he said. Online classes will continue as usual. Of the 1,805 cases in Karnataka on Friday, Bengaluru reported 441 of them. Thirtysix Covid-releated deaths were recorded across the state and 7 were from the city. Bommai said public health experts are of the opinion that a decision on starting primary and secondary classes up to class 8 should be taken by August-end after considering the possibility of a third wave and the intensity of Covid infections at that point of time. He said weekend curfew was imposed in the border districts due to increase in Covid cases in the neighbouring states. Weekend curfew will come into effect in Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Belagavi, Bidar, Vijayapura and Kalaburagi till August 16. The government has also issued orders banning jathras (fairs), temple festivals, processions and other congregations. Only 20 people will be allowed for cremations and funerals and not more than100 for marriages and family functions in these districts. The CM said travel checks will be stringent and RT-PCR tests remain mandatory. “Those who are entering from Maharashtra and Kerala will have to produce the negative certificate. It is a mandatory requirement, we will not show any laxity in implementing this,” he said, when asked about protests against the measures in bordering states. Across the state, night curfew will now be in force from 9pm to 5am, instead of the earlier 10pm-5am. Police have been asked to strictly implement the timings. “We have discussed the current Covid situation, also some directions have come at the all-India level about possible increase or decrease in the positivity rate in the days to come. Based on that, we have come to certain decisions,” Bommai explained. He added that a new Covid-19 task force comprising of ministers would be constituted in a couple of days. Officials sources said parents of students who will be attending schools will be identified and vaccinated on priority. “We have given directions to anganwadi workers and health officials to identify parents of students from classes 9 to 12, above 45 years, and start giving them vaccines on priority,” said an official who was present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-schools-to-reopen-for-class-9-12-from-aug-23/articleshow/85118261.cms||---

Officials sources said parents of students who will be attending schools will be identified and vaccinated on priority. “We have given directions to anganwadi workers and health officials to identify parents of students from classes 9 to 12, above 45 years, and start giving them vaccines on priority,” said an official who was present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/ktaka-schools-to-reopen-for-class-9-12-from-aug-23/articleshow/85120939.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Tikri gang rape case: Punjab and Haryana HC rejects bail plea, says trial is a discovery in pursuit of truth||CHANDIGARH: Dismissing the bail plea of Anoop Chanaut, one of the accused in sexual exploitation of a girl (now deceased) at Tikri border in Bahadurgarh, the Punjab and Haryana high court has held that the criminal trial is a discovery in pursuit of the truth and without a thorough free and fair investigation, it becomes a futile exercise. In its detailed orders released on Friday, the HC has also observed that it cannot compromise with the quality of free and fair investigation by enlarging the petitioner on anticipatory bail. On the plea taken by the accused that his arrest would be in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, the HC has held that it (Art 21) is not an absolute right and is subject to the procedure established by law. “The facts and circumstances involved in the present case, point towards the complicity of the petitioner. Thus custodial interrogation of the petitioner is necessary and would not amount to the violation of the petitioner’s right under Article 21 of the Constitution,” observed Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj while dismissing the anticipatory bail plea sought by Chanaut. “...the allegations pertain to a serious crime. A free and fair investigation is the backbone of every criminal trial. The criminal trial is a discovery in pursuit of the truth. Without a thorough free and fair investigation, the trial becomes a futile exercise,” observed Justice Bhardwaj in his 10-page detailed order. He also observed that the petitioner’s counsel has rightly argued that in the present case neither is there any statement of the victim nor any medical conduct but the investigation conducted so far cannot be ignored. On the query put by this court to the state counsel for clarification of this lapse, the reply was that at that time there was no such doubt regarding foul play with the victim.“As the victim was tested Covid-19 positive, therefore, no post-mortem was carried out. However, a complete narration of the incidents to her father which is being investigated by the police, from the call details and disclosure of the co-accused, there is no doubt left in the mind of the court that allegations levelled in the FIR are serious and need thorough investigation,” the order states. The HC held that primarily, the courts are required to take into consideration factors like the gravity of offence, probability of the accused tampering with the investigation and his chances of fleeing from justice while granting anticipatory bail. “Applying the said ratio laid down, to the facts and circumstances of the present case, the petitioner does not deserve the concession of the anticipatory bail as the prayer for custodial interrogation by the prosecution appears to be justified,” the HC held. In his plea for interim bail, Chanaut had asserted that it was a case of molestation but the investigating agency slapped serious rape charges against innocent persons to oblige their political bosses. The FIR in this case, which includes charges of gang rape, was registered on May 9 at city police station Bahadurgarh in Haryana’s Jhajjar district on the complaint of the deceased’s father, a resident of West Bengal. The deceased was staying with the accused to participate in the ongoing farmers agitation at Tikri border against Centre’s farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tikri-gang-rape-case-hc-rejects-bail-plea-says-trial-is-a-discovery-in-pursuit-of-truth/articleshow/85115477.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Hyderabad||Vax key to limit impact of Covid waves: Experts||Hyderabad: Experts on Friday asserted that vaccination is the key to limit the impact of further Covid-19 waves that are likely to occur. Speaking at a webinar on ‘Covid-19 vaccination and next drive’ organised by FICCI-Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), they said that there is enough evidence that vaccine can prevent the severity of waves and infection. According to Dr Vinay K Nandicoori, director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Covid-19 has the largest base among viruses. He said that Delta and Gama variants have the potential to elude detection during the second wave. “Quicker and better vaccination, as well as maintaining social distance, can reduce the impact of the waves,” he said. Dr Raches Ella of Bharat Biotech International Ltd, citing the United Kingdom as an example, said that because approximately 70% of the population is vaccinated in that country, the current wave impact has been greatly reduced compared to previous waves. The state government’s focus has shifted to vaccine drives with limited supplies. Dr T Gangadhar, member of Telangana Covid-19 task team and head of nephrology said, “We made sure that over 35 lakh people in high-risk groups, such as kirana shop owners, gas delivery boys and others are vaccinated first,” he said. Dr Nirmal Bagchi, director-general of ASCI, stated that the pandemic can only be overcome through collaborative efforts from both the government and society at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-key-to-limit-impact-of-covid-waves-experts/articleshow/85112949.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Police try to track down nearly 600 who jumped parole||AURANGABAD: The absence of photos of prisoners who jumped parole and furlough from prisons in the state is proving to be a major challenge for police. As many as 595 prisoners, who were among hundreds granted parole and furlough in three decades, have to return. Most absconders are convicts facing life-terms for murder, dacoity and rape. In each case, an offence has been registered with police stations, but state police have failed to zero in on them. Last month, state prison department submitted data about absconding inmates, updated till April, to the home department and director-general of police’s office. Additional director-general of police (law & order) Rajender Singh told TOI, “Police are exploring legal resources and other options. Police have started initiating action through tehsildars or appropriate authorities, against guarantors of absconders.” A total of 333 inmates jumped parole, while 262 jumped furlough from the 14 central, district and open prisons of Maharashtra. Authorities maintained that the absconders do not include inmates granted emergency paroles due to the pandemic since March 2020. The emergency parole of those released during the pandemic has been extended. Nagpur central prison recorded 120 absconding inmates, Amravati central prison 126, Morshi open prison one, Yerawada central prison 108, Kolhapur central prison 44, Yerawada open prison two, Aurangabad central prison 61, Nashik Road central prison 113, Paithan open prison 17, Dhule district prison two, Mumbai central prison three, Thane central prison two, Ratnagiri special prison two and Gadchiroli central prison one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-try-to-track-down-nearly-600-who-jumped-parole/articleshow/85117503.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Chairperson of SGPDA Wilfred D’Sa said that a memorandum of understanding will be signed with the fisheries department. The members said that though the market may be handed over to the fisheries department for executing the project, it was important that SGPDA take possession of the premises on its completion of the project. It was earlier decided that the project should be constructed by the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) at an estimated cost of Rs 20 crore. However the project couldn’t take off due to a financial crunch and since SGPDA later planned to add a cold storage facility, it was decided to tap central funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/might-tap-central-funds-for-margao-wholesale-market/articleshow/85115507.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 80% stocks in lakes, but supply hit in some areas||MUMBAI: Water stocks in the seven lakes that cater to the city’s needs have touched nearly 80% of the required quantum. The biggest lake, which supplies almost half the potable water consumed by the city, has 75% stocks in it. Currently, the total water stock in the lakes is 11.6 lakh million litres. With the BMC supplying 3,750 million litres of water to the city daily, the current stocks should last for approximately 300 days. Till the end of monsoon, the lakes are required to have 14.5 lakh million litres to ensure the city has adequate supply for the year. The water situation in the lakes as on date is much better than it was at this time last year when the water stocks stood at six lakh million litres or 41% of the required stocks. Civic officials have already ruled out the possibility of a water cut this year. However, despite sufficient stocks in the lakes, locals in areas like Juhu Koliwada have been complaining of water shortage. Residents said ever since the 15% water cut was enforced for a day on August 3 owing to repair works, water supply has been erratic. On raising complaints with the BMC, they were informed that since they are at the end of the supply network, they have been affected. “We have gone without adequate water supply for two days in a row. We had to get a civic team to check the supply problem. Despite digging underground to check the valves, the problem couldn’t be fixed,” said Larson Fernandes, a resident. Residents in some parts of Kalina are also peeved at the irregular water supply. Many locals said they wake up at 4 am, which is their supply hour as per the BMC, only to find the taps either running dry or a very short duration of supply. They said morchas taken to the BMC have not yielded any result either. Crompton Texeira, a Kalina resident, said they have made several representations to the authorities about the acute water shortage in Kalina, Koliveri and Jamplipada, but the civic body has been unable to find the cause of the fault. “The supply starts at 4.15 am, but stops after 15 minutes. We are forced to get water via tankers,” said Texeira, adding they even met opposition party leader in the BMC, Ravi Raja, to seek a solution. Raja said he had spoken to the hydraulic department, asking them to resolve the snag at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-80-stocks-in-lakes-but-supply-hit-in-some-areas/articleshow/85117050.cms||Richa Pinto

The cop has refuted the allegations. Additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Pragya Jain is investigating the case.The 13-year-old said in her police complaint, “On July 21, my friend took me along, saying she wants me to meet someone and that we will return in some time. She took me to Rakh Bagh and introduced me to her boyfriend. Thereafter, the three of us went to civil hospital. After staying there for a while, my friend and her boyfriend took me along to a hotel, where I lost consciousness after having a soft drink. When I gained consciousness, I found myself undressed.”Her friend and her boyfriend then dropped the minor at civil hospital and left. She approached a staffer at the health facility who took care of her during the night and handed her over to the civil hospital police post the next morning, she added.“The police post in-charge removed my clothes to examine me. He took me in his car to an isolated place and raped me. He then dropped me at a childcare home. At the home, I requested the staff to let me talk to my parents, but they paid no heed. After my repeated pleas, they allowed me to talk to my parents. I was brought out of the home after two weeks,” she said.The kin of the girl said they have lodged a complaint with the police to register a case against the cop and the boyfriend of her friend, but they were not listening.The police post in-charge said, “The allegations are baseless. The hospital staffer had handed over the girl to me. After a medical examination, she was sent to a childcare home. I am clueless why she is saying this. The police investigation will prove the allegations are false.”ADCP-I Pragya Jain said they were verifying the charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/13-yr-old-accuses-cop-and-friends-beau-of-raping-her/articleshow/85111065.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Irrigation projects in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh delayed, Centre dejected||CHANDIGARH: The Centre has expressed “disappointment” over the dismal progress of implementation of irrigation projects in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. In a report tabled both in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the standing committee on rural development, department of land resources, Union ministry of rural development observed that the delay has been caused due to lack of focus on the part of concerned state governments and not releasing the central funds to the state-level nodal agencies (SLNAS) in time. Besides Punjab and Himachal, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala and Sikkim are the other states lagging behind. The department in its response to the observations made by the committee submitted that in spite of putting best efforts, the progress of implementation of various projects of watershed development component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) in these states remained slow. The department held that these projects are not on the priority of these state governments and the funds released by the department of land resources (DoLR) to the state governments during a particular financial year are not timely transferred to the respective SLNAs for project implementation, hampering the release of central funds in the subsequent year. Citing example of Himachal Pradesh, the department maintained that the central funds could not be released in 2020-21 due to a huge unspent balance available with the state. The department informed the committee that it has been continuously monitoring the implementation of schemes in these states through review meetings and video conferences with emphasis on the completion of all the due projects by effective utilisation of the available funds, as well as, in convergence with relevant schemes. The committee “strongly” recommend that SLNAS of all these states should focus on efficacious implementation of the projects and the delay in the release of central funds should be avoided so that purpose of sanctioned projects are not defeated and thereby adequate irrigation facilities could be provided to rain-fed areas and degraded areas of the country. Punjab is among states in the country having high irrigation intensity. According to data of the Union ministry of agriculture, the net irrigated area in the state is 4.019 million hectares — 26.2% by canals, 72.5% by tube wells and 1.3% by others means. The gross irrigated area is 7.442 million hectares, while the percentage of the net irrigated sown area is 96.17%. While in the case of Himachal, nearly 40% of the geographical area is available for cultivation and only about 12% of the net sown area is irrigated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/irrigation-projects-in-punjab-hp-delayed-centre-dejected/articleshow/85115509.cms||Vinod Kumar

Police had organized an awareness programme to educate people against borrowing money from unauthorized lenders who charge exorbitant interest rates. Emotional scenes were also witnessed as women broke down narrating their ordeal of daily harassment by money lenders. Talking to TOI, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Manoharsinh Jadeja, said, “We came across many cases where people had borrowed money because of the financial crunch during Covid period. We have received 96 applications out of which we have registered one offence and more will be registered with the concerned police stations after preliminary investigation and collecting evidence.” One offence was registered with Pradyumannagar police station by Jayant Panchasra against Dilipsinh Gohil and his son Narendrasinh. According to the complaint, Panchsara had borrowed Rs 70,000 in various amounts over the last three years and repaid Rs 35,000. However, the accused had allegedly beaten him near Astron Chowk a few days ago and demanded Rs 70,000. They had even threatened to take away his two-wheeler and by doing so, they forced Panchasara to pay Rs 12,000 on the spot. Talking to reporters, Kanchan Solanki, an old woman, claimed that her son had borrowed Rs five lakh and the family had been paying interest for the last nine years. They paid Rs 13 lakh but the lenders are demanding Rs 10 lakh more. Solanki said her son earns Rs 50,000 per month but gives Rs 100 per day to run a family of nine members, while the remaining salary goes into payment of interest. The police refused to divulge the contents of the applications received, expressing fear that the accused may get alert. The applicants were also fearing harassment from money lenders if they came to know that they had approached police. “It’s an offence to lend money without licence, but in the process of pocketing high interest, more offences are being committed. It was our attempt to educate people to borrow money from financial institutions or licenced moneylenders,” said Jadeja. According to sources, the Rajkot police have registered over 100 offences against unregistered moneylenders in the last three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cops-note-loan-sharks-hunt-in-covid/articleshow/85115820.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Online investment racketeers arrested||VADODARA: The cybercrime sleuths have unearthed a countrywide racket wherein a gang used to dupe businessmen of crores of rupees by offering lucrative returns on their investments. Two men were arrested from Goa while the other gang members located in different states are yet to be traced. The cops swung into action after Dhruv Shah, a city-based businessman, filed a complaint of cheating worth Rs 2 crore at cybercrime police station about two weeks ago. Shah told the cops that he had read an online advertisement wherein the investors were promised high returns on their investment. The gang offered help to invest money in bitcoins and the stock market too. “Shah invested a good amount and initially he got very high returns. So, he encouraged his family and friends to invest in the scheme too,” said Hardik Makadia, ACP (cybercrime). Shah invested Rs 4 crore out of which he got Rs 1.96 crore back but the gang duped him of the rest of the money. “We first nabbed Ramjash Mittal from Delhi and questioned him. He used to travel to different states and form bogus companies. Mittal revealed about their modus operandi and other gang members,” Makadia told TOI. The cops froze nine bank accounts of the gang and have seized Rs 1.23 crore deposited in these accounts. Two other accused were also nabbed from Goa on Thursday. “One of these accused, Vikram Singh Jaat used to make phone calls and communicate with the investors while the other accused Hansraj Raiya used to handle the bank accounts,” Makadia added. Investigating officials said that the gang had employed dozens of persons who were not aware of the fraud that was being committed. The police suspect that some persons from abroad too are involved in the racket and the gang seems to have earned crores of rupees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/online-investment-racketeers-arrested/articleshow/85114886.cms||---
---||Kochi||HC: Nuns, priests in teaching jobs liable to pay tax||Kochi: Tax should be deducted at source on salaries paid to nuns and priests working in educational institutions, the high court has held. TDS was not being paid since 1944. A division bench of Justice SV Bhatti and Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas considered a batch of appeals filed by nuns and congregations challenging a single bench’s ruling that tax deducted at source (TDS) is applicable on income earned by nuns and priests. The appellants contended that since salaries paid to nuns and priests are handed over to the congregation, as they have taken a vow of poverty, TDS is not applicable. The court said tax deduction is not dependent on the manner of utilization of income. They also contented that since they undergo ‘civil death’ after taking the vow as per Canon Law, they can’t be included in the definition of ‘person’ under the Income Tax Act. To this the court held that the concept of civil death is not recognized by Income Tax Act. “Canon law cannot relieve the legal obligations/duties created under the various legislations enacted by the legislature,” the judgment stated. The court also rejected the contention that TDS violates fundamental right to freedom of religion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-nuns-priests-in-teaching-jobs-liable-to-pay-tax/articleshow/85113187.cms||---

They were returning from Madhya Pradesh with the contraband, worth Rs 1.75 lakh, when the police intercepted them. The accused cop was in uniform and tried to influence the STF team, saying there was nothing illegal in his SUV. The arrested have been identified as ASI Rajinderpal Singh, 53, his cousin Daljeet Kaur Babli, 46, of Gautam Vihar, Haibowal, and driver Pawanjit Singh, 35, of Manjit Nagar. The police have also seized the SUV, which has a Delhi registration number. STF AIG Snehdeep Sharma said, “ASI Rajinderpal’s cousin Daljeet has been into drug peddling for over 10 years. She has completed her sentence in one case and is facing trials in other cases. She works as a labourer in a hosiery factory. The ASI joined her in the drug trade about one-and-a-half years ago to make easy money. He used to charge Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh per consignment from her. At times, he too would sell poppy husk to addicts.” “On Friday, when the STF stopped the SUV at the checkpost near Dyalpur village, ASI Rajinderpal, who was in police uniform, told the officials that it was his own vehicle and there was nothing illegal in it. During checking, the STF recovered 350kg poppy husk from a sack hidden in the vehicle. During questioning, the accused confessed that they had smuggled in the contraband from Madhya Pradesh,” he added. Ludhiana STF in-charge inspector Harbans Singh said, “The ASI never took official leaves from duty to accompany the accused for procuring drugs. He would mark attendance in the morning and leave without informing his seniors. At times, he would work double shifts and take off the next day unofficially, citing urgent work in family. The STF has written to commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal, informing him about the arrest of the ASI and his pattern of remaining absent from duty. We will also question the Daba police station SHO about it.” Daljeet has bought three to four vehicles and some properties with the drug money. Her properties would be attached.

The ODP, however, will be prepared without first preparing the land use map. The SGPDA has already received government sanction for preparing the ODP for Margao and Ponda planning areas. The ODPs-2028 of Margao and Ponda planning areas were notified by the state government in March 2019 under provisions contained in the Town and Country Planning (TCP) Act, 1974. The ODPs were approved by the SGPDA when Sardesai was the TCP minister in the Pramod Sawant-government. Following a change of guard at the SGPDA in 2019 with BJP MLA Wilfred D’Sa assuming the reins of the planning body ostensibly as a reward for his defection to the saffron party, the SGPDA decided to prepare a new ODP for Margao and Ponda planning areas on the grounds that the plans contained errors and thus needed to be rectified. The government by an order dated March 15, 2021, accorded approval for the preparation of the ODP of Margao and Ponda planning areas. The decision, however, was met with strong objection from Sardesai and Kamat. The ODPs-2028 of Margao and Ponda planning areas were notified by the state government in March 2019 under provisions contained in the TCP Act, 1974||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/amid-opposition-from-vijai-digambar-sgpda-to-open-devpt-plan-for-margao-ponda/articleshow/85115593.cms||---

Eighteen-year-old Suman and her 13-year-old sister Pooja have taken all household responsibilities on their shoulders in the absence of their parents. “We are seven siblings, including me, Pooja, Rani (10), Sunny (9), Raman (7) and five-month-old Kartik. Eldest of us, Shobha (20) is married in Delhi. After Shoba and my birth, my father Raju Thakur abandoned my mother Bandna Devi, who belonged to Bhagalpur. He returned after many years. Then Pooja, Sunny and Raman were born, after which he again went away and later returned. Now he has again left us and we don’t know about his whereabouts,” said Suman, who works as a maid in different houses and lives in Raiyaan of Machhiwara. The family has been living in Machhiwara for around 20 years. “My mother died on July 22 and my father didn't even come for her last rites. I have to work as my siblings are too young,” said Suman, who earns Rs 4,000 and has to pay Rs 1,800 as rent, excluding the electricity and water charges.Pooja tries to help her elder sister in her work. She said their two siblings, Rani and Sunny, study in a government school. Talking about the pain of not having parents around, the children went speechless. The two teenage sisters are also taking care of infant brother Kartik. An area resident, Puneet Kaur, has been helping the children. “Their father was hooked to drugs and left the family. He would sit idle and ask children to work. Their mother had to work even when she became acutely anaemic. That man didn’t even come for her last rites and then some Machhiwara residents stepped in,” she said, and appealed to the people to come forward and help these children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mother-died-father-left-them-six-siblings-left-to-fend-for-themselves/articleshow/85111172.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Amritsar||Farmers move ‘no trust’ motion against Narendra Modi government||BATHINDA: With 12 opposition parties participating in the “parallel parliament” being organised farm organisation at Jantar Mantar in Delhi, protesting farmers moved a ‘no-confidence motion’ against the Narendra Modi government on Friday. On the 12th day of the ‘Kisan Sansad’, MPs from the opposition parties, led by Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, told them they would not let Parliament function till the farmer laws were repealed. The monsoon session of Parliament is will go on till August 13. During these 12 days the farmers held debates on the three contentious farm laws, apart from the electricity bill and the air quality management bill. Gandhi said the Narendra Modi government was not listening to opposition demand of repealing farm laws and debate on Pegasus spyware. The opposition parties were fully with farmers in raising their voice. Earlier, farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal “tabled the no-confidence motion”. Seconding it, Yogendra Yadav listed seven charges against the seven years of the NDA government. Yadav said the first charge was “cheating” in the name of doubling farm income. The government promised to double farm income in six years which will expire on February 27, 2022. To double the income, the growth should have been 10.4% per annum but as per economic survey of the government the growth is 3.3% per annum, which was even lower than previous UPA government when it was 4.5%. The second charge was it failed in ensuring 50% profit on input cost. It closed bonus on crops and implementing Shanta Kumar committee report on disbanding of FCI. It changed the parameters and counted the partial input cost on A2FL+50 instead of complete cost under C2+50%. It changed import-export policy “while snatching money from farmers”. In 2014, the export was 1.59 lakh crore more than imports, which had decreased to 1 lakh crore, he claimed. The Centre increased farmers’ input cost by increasing prices of diesel. The farmers also accused the government of not properly implementing ‘Fasal Bima Yozna’. Farm leader Darshanpal headed the proceedings when the ‘motion’ was tabled. The retired civil servants from Punjab too attended the ‘sansad’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/kisan-sansad-farmers-move-no-trust-motion-against-modi-govt/articleshow/85115601.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Kolkata||48 flights delayed, 2 diverted from 8am to noon due to thunderstorm||Kolkata: Severe rain and thunderstorm on Friday morning delayed flights that were scheduled to take off from the city airport and forced some of the incoming ones to be diverted to other airports. A majority of planes were put into a holding pattern in the sky — a manoeuvre designed to delay an aircraft already in flight while keeping it within a specified airspace — due to the localized thunder and lightning strikes in the morning. In all, 19 flights arriving from different sectors were delayed by 45 minutes to an hour and two flights were diverted to Bhubaneshwar between 8am and noon. Twenty-nine departures were also pushed back. “The weather conditions were extremely inclement. Frequent thunderstorms and lightning in the area around the airport disrupted flights in the morning. But adequate measures were taken to ensure there was no overcrowding at the terminal and social distancing was not compromised,” said airport director C Pattabhi. Airline officials said it took them several hours to clear the backlog even after the localized storm that had formed above the city airport subsided. “Almost every flight during that four-hour period was delayed. The backlog continued well into the afternoon, disrupting our entire day’s flight schedule,” said an airline official. . Air Traffic Control officials here put incoming flights on a holding pattern till the weather improved. A holding pattern is usually an oval racetrack pattern flown by aircraft awaiting further clearance from the air traffic control, especially to land. It is often a predetermined manoeuvre to keep aircraft within a specified airspace during the wait. A standard holding pattern uses right-hand turns and takes approximately 4 minutes to complete (one minute for each 180-degree turn, and two one-minute straight ahead sections). Deviations from this pattern can happen if long delays are expected. at that time, longer laps of usually 2-3 minutes are used. ATC officials pointed out the holding pattern was mostly used to hold back aircraft if the aiport faced clogging but it was also used during inclement weather to keep flights from the storm cells. “Our flight hovered in the air for around 30 minutes before we finally landed. However, we didn’t experience much turbulence and only after landing did we realise that our flight was delayed to keep us safe from the storm,” said a passenger who reached Kolkata from Bangalore on Friday. Outside the airport, the scene was no better with flooded stretches—like, the road on the premises, Chinar Park, in front of Haldirams and part of Jessore —slowing down the traffic to a crawl. A section of flyers headed for the airport was delayed owing to the jam in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/48-flights-delayed-2-diverted-from-8am-to-noon-due-to-thunderstorm/articleshow/85113208.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Nagpur||Few seekers: Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh coal mines fetch lower bids||Nagpur: Mines in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh have fetched lowest bids in terms of percentage hike offered over the reserve price, during the second tranche of coal block auctions for commercial exploitation. Adani Group’s Adani Power Maharashtra Limited got Gondkhairi block at a bid of 9.5% over and above the reserve price. Sunflag Iron and Steel Limited, a company from the city, got Bhivkund block in Chandrapur district for an offer of 9% over and above the reserve price. Another Adani Group company — CG Natural Resources Private Limited — has got two coal blocks in Chhattisgarh for a bid of 6%. CG Natural Resources has been set up for operations in Chhattisgarh. Adani Power Maharashtra has power plant in Tiroda in Gondia district. The bids are invited on the basis of percentage hike offered on reserve price. The reserve price is fixed at 4% of the representative price of the coal block and the latter is calculated on the basis of numerous factors like volume of coal, notified price and imported price channel etc. Interested parties have to bid at a rate over and above 4% of the reference price, explained a source in the sector. There is a major difference in offers received for other mines and those in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. For example, Rauta mine in Jharkhand went for an offer of 75% over the reserve rate. The mine was bagged by Shreesatya Mines Private Limited. Prakash Industries got Bhaskarpara mine, also in Chhattisgarh, for a bid of 55.75% over the reserve price. Two other mines in Jharkhand got an offer of 54.50% and 24.25%. The blocks went to Shreesatya Mines and South West Pinnacle Exploration Limited, respectively. The offer in percentage terms received for the mines in Maharashtra was also substantially less as compared to those located in the state auctioned in the first tranche last year. The Takli Jena Belora and Marki Mangli-II blocks in Chandrapur went to Aurobindo Reality and Yazdani International Private Limited, respectively. Both the companies had bid at 30.75% above of the reserve rate. The blocks in Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh may have fetched lower rates due to lack of enough competition, said professionals observing the development. For example, there were two bidders for the Gondkhairi block which went to Adani. The other bidder was Sunflag Iron and Steel. Sunflag which emerged as the successful bidder for the Bhivkund block had competition only from Aurobindo Realty. There were no bidders for three more blocks located in the region and a single bid was received for one. The offers could have been higher if the number of bidders were more, said a source in the sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/few-seekers-maharashtra-chhattisgarh-coal-mines-fetch-lower-bids/articleshow/85113196.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: OPD, IPD visits still 1/3rd below pre-Covid level||AHMEDABAD: An analysis of outpatient and inpatient departments (OPD and IPDs) at state-run hospitals for July 2019 and 2021 reveal that the numbers dropped by 32.4% or about one-third (from 3.86 lakh to 2.6 lakh) in four major cities this year. While Ahmedabad recorded 37% drop in OPDs, the drop in IPDs was about 18.5%. In other cities, the drop in OPDs varied from 44% in Surat to 19% in Vadodara. For private hospitals, the drop is slightly lower. A representative of Apollo Hospitals said that compared to July 2019, currently the dip in OPD and IPD numbers is about 15% to 20%. “But on the other hand, we have not seen any major drop in surgical procedures or occupancy of ICUs. The numbers have reached pre-Covid levels,” said an official. Namisha Gandhi, vice-president of Sterling Hospitals, said that number of planned procedures are rising. “One of the reasons for the drop in OPDs could be preference of patients to get primary treatment in their vicinity due to the pandemic. City hospitals have a good number of patients coming from other districts of Gujarat and other states for complex procedures,” she said. Government-run hospitals like Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad and Surat record close to 1 lakh patients in OPDs that range from vector-borne diseases to eye, nose, throat, psychiatry, gastric problems, etc. The number could rise with seasonal diseases, said experts. “The current rush in OPDs is primarily for specialized diseases ranging from cardiac to skin issues. Several also come for post-Covid complications,” said a Civil Hospital official. Officials also added that reluctance to approach the medical setting during and after the second wave is also a major reason for the drop in numbers. Thus, the patients often come with severe symptoms as the visit to doctors becomes inevitable, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/opd-ipd-visits-still-1/3rd-below-pre-covid-level/articleshow/85113231.cms||Parth Shastri

The facility is not registered with the Maharashtra State Animal Welfare Board. The police and PETA India’s rescue team found the young dogs, aged 1 to 1.5 years, in a deplorable condition, including constant caging, being kept hungry, and not being provided with necessary treatment for heavy tick infestation. They were also suffering from anaemia. Fearing legal action, the owner of the facility submitted a consent letter to the police, relinquishing the animals to PETA India while agreeing not to keep any other dogs at this facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-ill-pedigree-dogs-rescued-from-kalyan-pet-boarding/articleshow/85117086.cms||Vijay Singh

State director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on Friday evening inaugurated the memorial built at the SSP office in Barnala. In Barnala, 27 police personnel were martyred, while 1,800 personnel laid down their lives across the state, during the terrorism era. DGP Gupta said Punjab, being a border state, had to face internal and external forces bent upon causing disturbances in the state. He said Punjab shared a 550km border with Pakistan, which continued to make efforts to foment trouble in the state. “Under such circumstances, Punjab Police personnel from DIG to home guards and SPOs came forward in making supreme sacrifices to save the state from disintegrating. They authenticated the saying that Punjabis are always at the forefront of making sacrifices,” he said. Accompanied by Patiala Range DIG Vikram Jeet Duggal, DGP said sacrifices made by Punjab Police personnel were unmatched. “I am a direct witness to it as when I joined the Indian Police Service in 1987, the state was passing through the dark phase. When we went into villages to conduct raids I have seen my own security guards being gunned down. But, despite this, many (of them) faced the bullets. It is because of such bravery of the police personnel that Punjab saw peace returning to the state. I bow to sacrifices made by personnel while Punjab was facing bloodshed,” he said. Barnala SSPSandeep Goel said that memorial was dedicated to 27 personnel from Barnala who laid down lives for the unity and integrity of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/in-barnala-memorial-to-cops-martyred-in-terrorism-era/articleshow/85115653.cms||Neel Kamal

The Junior Doctors Association (JDA) alleged that the state government forced the medical college authorities to get their hostel rooms vacated on Friday as a pressure tactic against the resident doctors. The association also garnered support from various junior doctor associations across India that supported the movement. The social media handles of doctors also circulated the video of the meeting of JDA office-bearers with state health commissioner Jai Prakash Shivahare that took place on August 3. The video showed heated exchange between the government officials and doctors over their demands. Sources close to the development said that the state government has made it clear that they don’t want to give in to the demands. “The entitlements are already extended to the doctors. The demand for the 1:2 bond period was for the Covid duty. As the cases have reduced steadily from mid-May, the officials have refused to term the duty period as double for the calculation of bond period,” said an official. Gujarat deputy CM and health minister Nitin Patel on Thursday had already warned the doctors of action under provision of Epidemic Act if they don’t join the duty. The health department has already announced that the period of strike would not be counted for duty and educational experience purposes. “We have faith in our demands and we believe that what’s promised to us should be extended to us. It pains us that we have to fight for it just 1.5 years after the literal showering of flower petals as Covid warriors,” said a JDA member. “We have approached all possible offices to get justice.” Meanwhile, several doctors from various districts were transferred to hospitals such as the Civil Hospital as the medical services got hampered due to the strike. Sources said that some of the patients from OPDs were also referred to other hospitals on Thursday and Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/resident-docs-strike-stalemate-continues/articleshow/85113260.cms||---

Officials recently held a video-conference to discuss the issues and followed it up with a spot inspection last Thursday. Civic officials said that the main reason of waterlogging was the overflowing of Bagjola canal. “Bagjola canal, which stretches almost 38 km, has lost its capacity to flush out excess rainwater due to silt accumulation,” said a civic official. The officials said the drainage line of Patipukur underpass and its surroundings was regulated by the Duttabagan pumping station, which was operated by KMC. “During inspections by engineers, it has been noticed that the drainage line responsible for flushing out the excess rainwater is almost 75% choked with silt accumulated over time and unauthorized tapping of the line at several places. KMDA will clean and revamp the pipes running below Patipukur and Dum Dum underpasses,” said a South Dum Dum Municipality official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/choked-canal-drainage-line-lead-to-flooding-in-patipukur-lake-town/articleshow/85113272.cms||Suman Chakraborti

My wife Murukeshwari and son Ganesh were with me. At night, we heard a horrible sound and were soon swept away in the mudslide. We were engulfed by a wave of water, mud, and rubbles and thought we would die,” says Murukesan. Sixty-six people died and four are still missing after mud, slush and boulders crashed down a slope and flattened the asbestos-roofed line houses occupied by plantation workers. Murukesan, who ran a canteen in Pettimudy and his family were among the only 12 people who survived the massive landslide. Pettimudi in Rajamalai, which is close to Eravikulam National Park, falls under the Munnar wildlife division. The cluster of workers’ quarters was a bustling settlement with a small canteen and a grocery shop as well. Today, the area wears a deserted look covered under heaps of rocks and debris that crashed down from the hills. The eight families that survived the landslide have been provided housing at Kuttiyar Valley but they remain with their relatives at Rajamala near to the estates where they work. On the road to Eravikulam National Park, a few kilometres near the landslide-struck region, a burial ground has been prepared covered with stone graves marked with the victims’ names. There are plans to build a larger memorial. There were as many as 18 children among those who lost their lives in the landslide. Gopika, one of them, who managed to survive the tragedy as she was studying in Thiruvananthapuram, lost her parents as well as 14 other relatives in the landslide. A Plus-One student, she went on to score A plus in all subjects. The landslide occurred around 10:30pm but the outside world came to know about it only after a survivor reached the forest check-post at Eravikulam National Park by 7am the next day and it took another four hours for the rescue team to arrive at the spot. “The bodies were washed over 14km away from the landslide site. One body was recovered from the top of a tree, around 14ft tall,” said Sebinster Francis, a member of a rescue team, adding that lack of communication facilities and the risky terrain had hampered the rescue operations at Pettimudy. A report submitted by former Munnar special tahsildar before Idukki collector pointed out that the government should immediately provide special frequency wireless sets to the revenue department officials. It had also stated that to conduct emergency rescue operations in Munnar region a special rescue force under the revenue department needs to be set up. But a year after the disaster, the recommendations remain unfulfilled. Similarly, authorities had announced they will mark landslide-prone areas in the district for preparing a hazard map and take measures to evacuate people in the rainy season to avoid such tragedies in the future. But experts say the proposal remains in paper. “Several agencies conducted studies after the landslide struck the region. But the government has not yet published any report pointing out the actual reason for the tragedy,” said a senior geologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/one-year-on-pettimudy-and-its-unlearned-lessons/articleshow/85113286.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The allegation was raised by CBI during the hearing on anticipatory bail pleas filed by former police officers accused of framing Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan and another in the spy case. Through the case, ISI derailed the development of cryogenic technology at Isro and India’s technological development on the front became paralyzed for 20 years. This was part of a conspiracy hatched along with enemy nations of India, CBI argued before justice Ashok Menon. At this stage of argument, the court asked whether there is any evidence on ISI’s role in the case. CBI’s counsel submitted that evidence in this regard can be obtained only upon custodial interrogation of the accused. If custodial interrogation is not allowed, it would lead to destruction of evidence, the counsel submitted. A counsel representing RB Sreekumar, a former officer at Intelligence Bureau (IB) who is accused of torturing Narayanan, submitted that a conspiracy involving foreign nations was never alleged at any stage of the spy case. CBI’s counsel submitted that IB had filed a report on the foreign links of Maldivian Fousiya Hassan and others and that the report can be produced before the court in a sealed cover. The court will hear the case again on August 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/paks-isi-had-role-in-isro-spy-case-frame-up-cbi-tells-hc/articleshow/85113369.cms||---

At least five children have lost their lives in the last two months in nearby Baghpat and Roorkee to similar pits, illegally dug and now full of rainwater. Nirbhay (12), his sister Shraddha (10) and their cousin Yug (8) had left for home after working for a while on the family farm, where paddy sowing was taking place in Hajratnagar Garhi area. But they didn’t reach home till Thursday evening. After hours of search, the family spotted three sets of tiny slippers floating on the surface of the muddy water of the pit. “I immediately jumped into the pit and took them out, one by one. They all had drowned and were not responding. We took them to a hospital but couldn’t save them. All our children are gone now, there is nothing worse than that. It feels like we are cursed. Police should take strict action against the brick kiln owner who dug this pit for soil,” said Bhayankar Singh, the father of Nirbhay and Shraddha. Police have registered an FIR against brick kiln owner Mohammed Shabbir under IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) at Hajratnagar Garhi police station on Friday. The accused is yet to be arrested. Station house officer (SHO) Satish Yadav told TOI, “The brick kiln owner was booked for showing negligence as he had left the pit open which caused the death of the children. The bodies of the children were handed over to the family after autopsy.” Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Deepandra Yadav met the family and said that compensation will be provided to them under state disaster response funds (SDRF). Pradeep Mishra, a local resident, told TOI, “Soil mining is rampant in the area. The brick kiln owners openly use excavators for mining soil. They take land on lease from farmers by paying some amount, dig soil and return the land which becomes less fertile and sometimes leads to incidents like the recent one. They have no fear of police or administration because of political support.” On June 23, two boys, 11 and 13, drowned in a similar brick kiln pit in Roorkee. Another three children were found dead in such a pit in Baghpat on May 29. While three children, aged between 7 and 11, fell and drowned in a large pit dug for illegal sand mining near river Sot in Budaun district on June 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-kids-drown-in-pit-dug-left-open-by-brick-kiln-owner-in-ups-sambhal-2nd-such-incident-in-2-months/articleshow/85111215.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Students were all smiles as 70% of the questions were from the syllabus, said sources. The Gujarat State Higher Secondary Education Board is now working to prepare the results and declare them at the earliest, the sources further said. GUJCET is held annually for science students seeking admissions to degree engineering, diploma engineering, and pharmacy courses in government, grant-in-aid, and self-financed institutions in Gujarat. In all, 5,932 blocks in 574 buildings within 34 zones were earmarked for the examination in the state. Only 20 students were accommodated per classroom. The examination was conducted over four hours in four main subjects after reducing the syllabus by 30%. The timing of the examination was 10am to 4pm. The questions were in the MCQ format. A combined test for physics and chemistry was held for two hours. It carried 80 marks or 40 marks for each subject. Biology and mathematics were held as separate exams for an hour with 40 marks accorded to each. A committee which has finalized the norms for engineering admissions, including for those who have cleared Class 12 science with B Group or biology, has fixed the 50:50 weightage for Class 12 marks and the GUJCET score. Earlier, college admission merit lists were drawn up by giving 40% weightage to the percentile in the GUJCET and 60% weightage to the Class 12 (science) board exams percentile. This rule has been changed due to Covid-19 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujcet-kids-happy-to-test-offline-world/articleshow/85113334.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Covered drains & gully pits add to Salt Lake waterlogging woes as canals overflow||Kolkata: Overflowing canals might be the main cause behind waterlogging in Salt Lake, but some residents are themselves to blame for the rising problem. They have blocked drainage channels leading to gully pits. Some have even covered them with marble slabs. As a result rain water has been taking time to recede. A team of engineers sent for spot visit by urban development minister Chandrima Bhattacharya on Thursday discovered this tampering by residents and submitted a report. TOI on Friday reported how Salt Lake residents were staring at a grave health issue with several pockets getting frequently swamped with heavy showers, and stagnant water flowing into their underground reservoirs. Officials of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) said water is flowing back because Kestopur canal has not been dredged for more than a year now. Also, lock-gates between Bagjola and Kestopur canals aren’t functioning since they have not been maintained by the irrigation department. As a result, water from Bagjola canal enters Kestopur canal, raising the level. Taking a tour around Salt Lake, TOI found out that onus of the problem also rests on residents. “Residents have covered their driveways with marble slabs, extending the concretization to the channels and the gully pits as well. How will the water flow into the drainage system if they are covered? This is basic science,” asked an engineer from urban development department. Bidhhannagar commissioner Debashish Ghosh said, “Our men had uncovered these gully pits by removing the slabs. But I believe some of them are back in place and things are back to square one. How will the administration find a solution if there’s no awareness among the residents?”. A retired septuagenarian, Bimal Das (name changed), who has covered the gully pit in front of his house in AE Block, retorted, “How will we park our cars inside the garage if there’s a gully pit staring at the entrance? We have spent money to create this slide for smoother driving in and out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covered-drains-gully-pits-add-to-salt-lake-waterlogging-woes-as-canals-overflow/articleshow/85113303.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Meerut||UP: 3 years after post, 2 booked for sedition||BIJNOR: Three years after a video they allegedly posted and deleted soon after, two men, Mohammad Raees, 25, and Mohammad Waseem, 27, were booked for sedition after the video was uploaded again by someone else this week and shared widely. One of them has been arrested. Raees and Waseem, 27, are carpenters from Sirsa Khumar village in Amroha. Raees works in Gurgaon and had come home a while back. Waseem works in Kerala. In 2018, the two of them — they are friends — had allegedly uploaded a video in which they used “abusive language” when speaking about PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath. Police said the video “denounced India”. “When it was first uploaded, three years ago, those in the village opposed it. They deleted the video then,” Amroha ASP Ajay Pratap Singh said. “Someone uploaded it again now. We are trying to find out who did it and why.” The case comes at a time the Supreme Court is scrutinising the country’s “colonial” sedition laws “meant to suppress the freedom movement”. Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had said last month, “If a police officer wants to fix anybody in a village for something, he can use Section 124A ... Our concern is misuse of the law and the lack of accountability.” In May, Justice DY Chandrachud, on similar lines, had said, “It is time to define the limits of sedition.” While police look for Waseem, a local source said Raees and Waseem may have been on the wrong side of a panchayat poll-driven faction. “There are two groups of political supporters in the village. The opponents of the one they were thought to be close to raised this again and shared the video with cops,” the source added. In the absence of a complaint by anyone else, the police filed a case against them on their own. The FIR was registered at the Amroha Dehat police station by sub-inspector Arun Pratap Singh on Thursday. ASP Singh said Raees, who also goes by Aslam, was arrested and his phone seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-years-after-post-2-booked-for-sedition/articleshow/85111228.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Nagpur||Release Rs435 cr for OBC commission: Bawankule writes to CM||Nagpur: Former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, requesting to release funds for Other Backward Class (OBC) commission within a week. The commission constituted under retired judge Anand Nirgude had sought Rs435 crore and requisite manpower for preparing empirical data of the OBC population in Maharashtra as directed by the Supreme Court. Bawankule, the former BJP MLA from Kamptee, demanded that the commission should finish its collection of empirical data before December this year and submit it to the government so that the OBC reservation in the local bodies is restored by 2022. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government constituted the commission on March 3 after the Supreme Court quashed OBC reservations in the local body elections, clarifying that the 50% quota limit can’t be breached. The government then appointed nine members on the panel on June 15. On June 29, the terms of reference were decided for the commission, and on July 15 a high-powered committee (HPC) was constituted under the chief secretary to help it in meeting its objectives. After the apex court’s judgment, re-elections were declared to about 100 zilla parishad (ZP), 200 panchayat samiti (PS), and hundreds of gram panchayat (GP) seats by the State Election Commission on July 19. However, these were adjourned due to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/release-rs435-cr-for-obc-commission-bawankule-writes-to-cm/articleshow/85113375.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Pune: Greaves Cotton sells 27 acres at Akurdi plant for Rs 320 crore||PUNE: Engine and powertrain maker Greaves Cotton has entered into a memorandum of understanding to sell around 27 acres of excess land at its Akurdi plant, off the old Pune-Mumbai highway, to a real estate developer in a deal valued around Rs 320 crore. Greaves Cotton announced in a filing in stock exchanges on Thursday said they have inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Pune-based realtor, Runal Developers. It said the value of the sale would be paid by Runal Developers in three tranches, with the entire sale to be closed by the end of the current financial year. Runal Developers confirmed the transaction to TOI, but refused to elaborate further. Sources close to the deal, however, said it had been in the works for a few months. The decision to sell the land was arrived at the board meeting held on Wednesday. “Yes, Greaves Cotton has announced the MoU to the stock exchanges. We have not yet decided on how we shall develop the land, whether it will be used for housing projects or commercial development. We will take a call on that after the deal is complete. We chose the land because of its various potentials, including its location,” said a spokesperson from Runal Developers. Greaves Cotton, besides its Akurdi plant, has manufacturing facilities in Aurangabad in Maharashtra, and elsewhere. The sale was one of the largest in recent times due to its value, real estate watchers said. Industry observers added that other companies too have sold excess land in recent years, especially along the old Pune-Mumbai highway stretch. Realtors also sounded optimism about the deal. “We have been saying that Pimpri Chinchwad has all the ingredients of developing its own city structure, especially on the stretch on the old highway, with the 60 feet wide road, underpasses, BRT, and now the Metro as well. There is very good potential for offices as well as for housing on that stretch, as well as for retail. The area along the highway is slowly developing into a commercial hub, with good access from Pune. The rate of this transaction, which has been in discussion for a while, reflects that the market is opening up and there is huge demand for housing and offices, despite the pandemic going on,” said Vineet Goyal, the managing director of the Kohinoor Group. An industry observer in the region said the old highway stretch through Pimpri Chinchwad is one of the most attractive propositions for developers now, as the Pune Metro corridor is coming up in that stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/greaves-cotton-sells-27-acres-at-akurdi-plant-for-rs-320-crore/articleshow/85113358.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati sought replies from the authorities and the company which operates the STP at Pirana after taking cognizance of a news report saying that the company has not been following parameters set for water treatment and yet gets away without penalty. The report also said that despite improper water treatment, the company continues to get the contract for the same. The court noticed that the gutter water is not being treated in accordance with the set norms, rules and regulations since the time the contract came to be awarded in favour of the company. The bench said, “It is very disturbing to learn that polluted water is being directly released into the Sabarmati river.” The court also said that despite flagrant violations at the end of the company, the AMC keeps on awarding the contract in favour of the same company and that too on basis of a single tender. The court has sought response by August 20, when further hearing has been posted on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-on-sewage-water-from-pirana-/articleshow/85113408.cms||---

It was the last time that he saw his sons. Though Nitish’s body was retrieved the next day, Dinesh’s body has not yet been located and Shanmughanadan had been in a desperate search for his son’s body. But on Thursday, he said he is ending the search. For six months after the landslip at Pettimudy, even after authorities winded up search operations he travelled 23km almost every day from Munnar to the landslide site and searched among the rubbles for his missing son. He refused to conduct the rituals usually held 40 days after the death for his son but last week his mind finally accepted the truth, he says. "I went to Rameshwaram and performed all the rituals. He will not come back nor there is any chance of getting his body," he says, adding that he will reach Pettimudy on Friday to perform some rites on the mass graveyard built for the victims to mark the first anniversary of the tragedy. Shanmughanadan said he is yet to receive the compensation announced for the relatives of missing people. Though four persons who have gone missing were included in the list of the dead, certificates are yet to be issued. “I have approached revenue officials several times. They said they have submitted the papers to the higher-ups and that an order needs to be issued,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/father-ends-search-for-missing-son/articleshow/85113397.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Delhi||Delhi: Long wait for longest metro line ends||NEW DELHI: After a wait of two and a half years, the ‘missing link’ of Delhi Metro’s Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) was finally bridged at Trilokpuri on Friday, making it the longest operational corridor of the rail network. The 290-metre section between Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 and Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake was inaugurated on Friday by Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who flagged off the first train via video conferencing. Passenger services began at 3pm with trains traversing the nearly 59-km-long arc from the capital’s northern and north-eastern fringes while connecting all the other Delhi Metro corridors at 11 interchange points. Puri said that though the inaugurated section might be minuscule in length, from the perspective of enhanced connectivity, it would play an extremely crucial role because it allows seamless and end-to-end travel. Kejriwal said, “I remember how we faced a lot of problems during the construction in this area.” He added that Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s managing director Mangu Singh had met him many times to discuss the problems being faced in rehabilitating the people whose land had been acquired. “Everyone cooperated and coordinated to tackle this hurdle and eventually we overcame the difficulties and solved the problems to reach this day when we are throwing open the stretch,” he said. Durga Shanker Mishra, housing and urban affairs secretary, disclosed that the DMRC network would complete 458km in the next four years. With 96km of the network turning ‘driverless’ on Friday, Delhi Metro also had the longest driverless stretch in the world, he said. A total of 43 six-coach trains would be deployed on the corridor. Train services from the Majlis Park to Sarai Kale Khan Nizamuddin and Shiv Vihar to IP Extension sections will be available at a frequency of 5 minutes and 12 seconds, said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. However, only every alternate train would traverse the entire corridor. This means that a commuter could take the train leaving Majlis Park to reach Maujpur and then take a shuttle train to Shiv Vihar, while the next train would go only up to Sarai Kale Khan Nizamuddin and return. Similarly, ne train from the other end of the corridor will return from IP Extension, while the next would go all the way to Majlis Park. Trains on every station of the corridor, therefore, will be available every 5 minutes and 12 seconds at peak hours, but those boarding a train from any station between Sarai Kale Khan Nizamuddin and IP Extension will have to wait a minimum of 10 minutes and 24 seconds to board a train. Also, trains will be run with a temporary speed restriction of 25 kmph on the 1.5 km between Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 and Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake due to non-availability of automated signalling system on this stretch, which is still under commissioning. “The integration of the signalling system of this particular stretch in an already operational line is a challenging task and we expected to commission the system in the next two months, after which the trains will move with regular speed on this stretch too,” said Dayal. The corridor will further be extended from Majlis Park to Maujpur as part of DMRC’s Phase IV project, making it not only the longest metro corridor in India at approximately 70km, but also the only ‘ring corridor’ of any metro rail in the country.

The standing committee headed by chairman Prakash Bhoyar too gave the nod to the works proposed by NMC’s public health engineering department (PHED). Speaking to mediapersons, Bhoyar admitted that work orders to construct 11 ESRs were issued to central government agency Wapcos in January 2020. The cost of the projects then was over Rs19 crore. However, as the department failed to hand over the land required for constructing the ESRs in the last one year, Wapcos refused to construct them. Later, the department had to invite fresh tender and now it will spend Rs57 crore for the same. Bhoyar admitted that no action has been initiated against any official from the department for the delay leading to cost escalation. The standing panel gave nod as already it was late to construct the ESRs which will further strengthen water supply in the city. The standing panel also approved PHED’s proposal to give three-month extension to M/s Shree Sai Bio Organic on experimental basis for producing compost from wet waste. Against a garbage generation of around 1,000-1,200 metric tonnes (MT), NMC is treating only 150 to 200MT for preparing compost. From April to June 30 this year, NMC had earned Rs 1.59 lakh through the sale of compost manufactured at Bhandewadi dumping yard. As per agreement, the firm is paying Rs100 per MT to NMC from the sale of compost. Bhoyar said soon NMC will float tender to treat 600MT garbage per day. The panel also extended the tenure of 80 civic cops for 11 months. NMC will spend Rs2.27 crore towards their remuneration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-spend-rs57cr-more-for-building-11-esrs/articleshow/85113412.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

When she told her husband, he said it would “continue” if she didn’t get him an SUV and Rs 5 lakh from her family as dowry. The woman, 27, filed a complaint on Thursday, on the basis of which an FIR was filed at the Rajabpur police station. Twelve members of her husband’s family were booked for gang rape, cruelty to woman, unnatural offences and voluntarily causing a woman to miscarry under the IPC and sections of the Dowry Prevention Act. “I got married three years ago. My parents had given a lot as dowry. Things were fine initially. After a while, my husband and his family demand Rs 5 lakh in cash and a luxury car. When I refused to press my father for dowry, they started oppressing me,” the woman wrote in her complaint. “When I got pregnant, they forced me to have an abortion. They started beating me up. My husband forced me into unnatural offences. When I moved to my parents’ house, he persuaded me to come back.” She did. “That was when my brother-in-law and his friend raped me. Last week. When I told my husband, he did nothing. He said this is what I would go through until I got them an SUV and the money they’d asked for.” She left for her parents’ place. “We registered a case on the basis of the complaint,” Amroha SSP Ajay Pratap Singh said. “The accused are yet to be arrested.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bro-in-law-his-friend-rape-woman-husband-says-itll-continue-if-she-doesnt-get-dowry/articleshow/85111289.cms||Harveer Dabas

Most of them managed to escape. A 12-year-old boy couldn't. He was surrounded and mauled, and died on the way to a local hospital. The incident took place in Saharanpur's Padli Grant village under Mirzapur police station on Friday afternoon. Locals, including the village pradhan, demanded immediate steps to catch all the stray dogs from the village. Stray dogs' menace is spread across the region, Kamil Ahmed, the pradhan, said. "In our village, over 50 stray dogs are roaming freely. They cause nuisance and even attack people. Today, they attacked and killed a 12-year-old boy. Children and their parents are living in fear. The local administration should pay attention to this incident and take action," Ahmed added. Mirzapur station house officer Bhanu Partap said, "There has been no complaint yet. Appropriate action will be taken if someone approaches the police." When contacted, additional district magistrate SB Singh told TOI, "We are sending a district official to the village to conduct a probe. Further action will be taken accordingly."

---||Ahmedabad||Infant abduction bid: Search for Prashant Kamble on||AHMEDABAD: Chandkheda police investigating a case of abduction bid of an 11-month-old baby and possible human trafficking have started tracking Prashant Kamble, a resident of Pune, as one of the primary accused of the case. Bindu Sharma, the nanny who was apprehended for the offence, was probed on Friday where she put all the blame on Prashant and claimed that she was innocent. “She maintained she did not know the scheme by Prashant and sending her picture with the baby was a mistake. We are yet to ascertain whether she was part of any previous incidents,” said an investigator. “We have contacted Maharashtra Police for their assistance in tracking and apprehending Prashant.” Shockwaves had spread through the city after police prevented Bindu Sharma’s attempt to kidnap the 11-month old baby girl of a Chandkheda-based couple. She had clicked pictures of the infant with herself and circulated them posing as her mother who wished to give up the child for adoption for compensation citing her abject poverty. The incident underscored the vulnerability of couples who hire maids from across the country using online agencies. Cops had said Bindu was in touch with Prashant Kamble from Pune who is involved in human trafficking. He helped Bindu forge adoption papers identifying her as the birth mother and found a Bengali couple in Pune who were keen on adopting a baby. Bindu approached the couple and told them she was forced to give up the baby for adoption as she could no longer take care of the child due to her impoverished condition. The couple bought her story, initiated paperwork and even made a monetary transaction to adopt the baby. However, they grew suspicious when Bindu could not give the baby’s birth date or other details that a mother would know. Based on the documents she had submitted, they called up the police in West Bengal. The cops investigated the matter, got to know of the racket and alerted the Chandkheda police as well as the infant’s family thereby averting a disaster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/infant-abduction-bid-search-for-prashant-kamble-on/articleshow/85113431.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Pedestrian channels, guard rails to check jaywalking||Kolkata: The Kolkata traffic police has formulated a plan to stop jaywalking in four of Kolkata’s most important intersections — Esplanade, Hazra, Jadavpur and Kidderpore. This will include putting up high guard rails around the crossings and specific pedestrian channels. The signalling system will also be planned in such a way so that the pedestrians are treated as an important entity in the entire traffic set-up (just like the motorists) and they are provided adequate time for crossing over from one end of the road to another. Lalbazar has written to civic agencies to go for an overhaul of the road furniture at these crossings with the police asking them to either construct new guard railings or repair the existing ones at key crossings, said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. At Esplanade, cops have also asked for a bus shelter and removal of encroachments. The cops have written to KMC to seal the gap in front of an abandoned bus stop on the eastern flank of the Jadavpur crossing. It has also called for repair of the guard rails at the Kidderpore crossing on two flanks — one towards Garden Reach and the other towards Behala on the DH Road. Similarly, the pedestrian barrier of the north-eastern flank of Hazra crossing also needs to be repaired, said an officer. “It has been observed that the broken railings and guard rails from footpaths at several points in Esplanade crossing allow pedestrians to indiscriminately cross over thus throwing not only their lives but of others into danger. Being the busiest crossing of the city, these gaps need to be identified by joint inspection,” the DCP’s office wrote to the KMC commissioner’s office recently. Similarly, Lalbazar pointed out how the east-bound traffic on Lenin Sarani was severely getting crippled as people stepped on the road for buses. The plea for setting up a bus shelter on Prince Anwar Shah Road near Jadavpur Crossing has also been made. Sources in Lalbazar stated that once all the illegal access points to the road crossings are completely blocked, each concerned traffic guard will teach pedestrians how to follow the pedestrian channel. “The experiment has achieved a considerable success at Chingrighata crossing. There is no reason why it cannot be replicated. Creating pedestrian islands at these spots is not possible due to the sheer volume of traffic all through the day. But, we should devise other alternatives,” explained an officer at the headquarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pedestrian-channels-guard-rails-to-check-jaywalking/articleshow/85113427.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Ngp among 9 dists least at risk of climate agri distress, 11 are highly vulnerable||Nagpur: The district is among nine in the state found to be least vulnerable to climate agricultural distress. However, 6.78% area of the Central Vidarbha Zone has been categorized as highly vulnerable in a research study, ‘Socio-economic vulnerability to climate change – Index development and mapping for districts in Maharashtra’. The study highlights how extreme climate conditions are highly affecting livelihoods and agrarian economy of Maharashtra. It was conducted by Chaitanya Adhav at Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, Haryana, under the guidance of R Sendhil from ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research. The study brought to fore that of the 36 districts in the state, 11 are highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, droughts and dwindling water security. “These districts account for almost 40% of the cropped area across central Maharashtra,” the study stated. Apart from this, 37% of the state’s agricultural area, spread over 14 districts, was found to be moderately vulnerable, which takes the tally to three-fourth of Maharashtra’s cropped regions as high to moderate vulnerable to the prevailing climate crisis. According to the researchers, Nandurbar was the most vulnerable district to cyclones, floods, droughts, changing rainfall patterns and extreme temperatures, affecting its crop production. Other highly vulnerable 10 districts are Buldhana, Beed, Jalna, Aurangabad, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Akola, Amravati, and Washim. The study also lists 14 districts as moderately vulnerable — Dhule, Jalgaon, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Solapur, Osmanabad, Latur, Yavatmal, Wardha, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia and Gadchiroli. “The dominant crops from these districts that will bear the brunt of climate crisis are jowar, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, ragi, cashew nut, barley, and millets,” the study added. Some 6.78% area of Central Vidarbha Zone was designated as highly vulnerable. Adhav said, “Findings show that most of the highly vulnerable districts fall under the central Maharashtra plateau zone. Nine districts including Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Nashik, Satara, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Nagpur and Pune were found to be least vulnerable to climate agricultural distress.” Climate experts have warned that states like Maharashtra need to develop their climate action plans to tackle the crisis and reduce emissions. “Mapping of districts shows that there is an instant need for focused policy efforts to address the socio-economic vulnerability in Central Maharashtra Plateau Zone. Additionally, the policy-making process should include inputs from as many stakeholders as possible before implementation. Ultimately, the outcome of micro-level adaptation strategies should get reflected at the state level,” said Adhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngp-among-9-dists-least-at-risk-of-climate-agri-distress-11-are-highly-vulnerable/articleshow/85113447.cms||Manka Behl
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Global chip shortage delaying car deliveries by two months||AHMEDABAD: Shortage of semiconductors – a key component in manufacturing chips of electronic devices used in auto components, has slowed car production leading to a longer waiting time for new car deliveries. Estimates by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) suggest that new car models across various brands, which are more in demand have a minimum waiting of two months due to supply-side constraints. Pranav Shah, chairman – Gujarat region, FADA, said, “New car deliveries have a greater waiting time ranging from 8-16 weeks. As more and more cars are equipped with electronic features, the requirement for semiconductor chips has gone up in car manufacturing. Carmakers across the globe are struggling for supply of these chips, due to which the growing demand is not met with. On an average, a given local dealership has at least 100 car bookings which are pending delivery.” Shah also said that a similar wait of at least a month is being witnessed for high-end motorcycles too since a month. This is due to the semiconductor shortage which triggered supply bottlenecks. Dealers claim that car models which are fast running tend to have a longer waiting period. “Certain models which are newly launched or some which are high in demand such as SUVs and compact SUVs tend to have a longer waiting period. We have a minimum waiting period of about 8 weeks i.e. roughly two months for cars,” said Surendra Sharma, managing director of an Ahmedabad-based car dealership. Dealers said that shortage of Maruti Suzuki’s cars for some models from mid-sized cars to compact SUVs too is there due to the semiconductor shortage. In fact, earlier this week, Maruti Suzuki India Limited, in its regulatory filing, announced that Suzuki Motor Gujarat (SMG)’s Hansalpur plant will cut production and operate for three days a week for a month, in the wake of the semiconductor shortage. Dealers claim that delayed delivery is causing certain customers to change their buying decision. “Some customers want a faster delivery and therefore, tend to change purchase decisions and opt for another model. At times, we do lose business because customers switch brands. However, there are good number of customers who tend to stick by their preferred model and wait it out for 2-4 months for the delivery,” said an Ahmedabad-based car dealer without willing to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/global-chip-shortage-delaying-car-deliveries-by-two-months/articleshow/85113461.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Man kills father of daughter’s dalit lover in Virudhunagar||MADURAI: Pandalgudi police in Virudhunagar district arrested a man for murdering the father of his daughter’s lover who is from a different caste. The girl’s family belongs to asari community while the boy is a dalit. The victim, Palani, 50, of Kurundamadam village in Aruppukottai taluk, was murdered during an argument between the families. According to the first information report filed by the police, Palani’s son P Kaleeswaran, 24, a driver, was in love with K Madhubala of the same village for seven years. The girl’s family was against it as the boy is a dalit. A few days ago, they sent Madhubala to her grandmother’s place in Thiruthangal. On Wednesday evening, she returned to Kurundamadam and went to Kaleeswaran’s house. “She refused to go back to her place despite Palani and his wife Jothi requesting her to leave as it could become a caste issue. But the girl refused to go to her house,” A Kathir of Evidence, an NGO that conducted a fact-finding study on the turn of events leading to the murder, said. Jothi informed Madhubala’s mother Pandeeswari that her daughter was in their house. Soon, Pandeeswari and husband Karuppasamy went to Palani’s house and asked her to come with them, but she refused. A heated argument broke out between Karuppasamy and Palani when the former abused him naming his caste. Karuppasamy then attacked Palani on his head with a machete, much to the shock of both the families. Kaleeswaran and Jothi pushed Karuppasamy away and the latter suffered minor injuries. Palani was rushed to Aruppukottai GH in a goods carrier and referred to Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai but he died without responding to treatment on Thursday. The police altered the attempt to murder case it filed initially to murder and arrested Karuppasamy. He was also booked under other sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-kills-father-of-daughters-dalit-lover-in-virudhunagar/articleshow/85113530.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Online festival to take a peek into the lesser-known Abanindranath||Kolkata: To celebrate Abanindranath Tagore’s 150th birth anniversary, Victoria Memorial and DAG have collaborated to curate an online festival to highlight the lesser known facets of the icon. Abanindranath at 150 — Bichitra Revisited — a year-long celebration of the icon’s 150th birth anniversary, will begin on Saturday to explore his engagement in the field of story-telling, theatre, dance and art history. The free online sessions will present facets of his life that go beyond the celebration of him being the pioneer of the Bengal School of art. Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH) is the custodian of the Rabindra Bharati Society collection, the single largest collection of works by the artist. For DAG, the artist is central to the foundation of the galleries on Bengal Art at Kolkata’s Ghare Baire. Secretary and curator of VMH Jayanta Sengupta said, “While Victoria Memorial Hall is known for its European and colonial collections, not many know about the collection of Indian art we have. Abanindranath’s iconic works are central to our collection.” This festival will also pay tribute to the spirit of the Bichitra studio, founded by Abanindranath and his brothers in the south verandah of Jorasanko with the support of Rabindranath. This iconic verandah was established as a studio and laboratory by the artist and his brothers, Gaganendranath and Samarendranath. Apart from art classes, this verandah hosted plays, performances, addas and even acts by tricksters. “By bringing together artists, storytellers, dancers and scholars to present their interpretations of the artist’s work through a diverse range events we hope that our audiences can rediscover the artist and his oeuvre through fresh perspectives,” said Ashish Anand, CEO and managing director, DAG. One of the events will travel back in time to the Jorasanko south verandah to revisit the many performances that brought the space to life as well as to look closer at Abanindranath’s enigmatic ‘Mask Series’, through an adda between academicians Ananda Lal and Debashish Banerji. “The basic idea is to invite participants to a virtual veranda. We will begin our conversation with his hilarious recollections of the Jorasanko production in the 1880s. Abanindranath had perceived that every person has a mask. Debashish and I will be discussing which came first – the theatre masks that he did for the Tapati production of 1929 or the two-dimensional paintings that clearly looked like 3D masks of various family members,” Lal said. The workshops will begin with his world of stories, taking inspiration from his Chitrakshar albums where he reimagined alphabets as animals and characters. Under the guidance of nationally recognized children’s book illustrator Proiti Roy and educator and engaging storyteller Arna Seal, participants will take inspiration from his works to weave their own stories and characters. Another session will explore the influences of dance and the critical role of theatre in his work. Odissi dancer Manishikha Baul will demonstrate how the principles of classical aesthetics shaped the figuration of the Bengal School through a performance that interweaves movement and drawing. “While it would have been ideal to celebrate this occasion at our museums, it has been wonderful to see the response online. Through his works Abanindranath’s transports us to magical worlds, leaving behind a legacy of syncretic stories and fables. These stories and images are perhaps the respite we all need in these difficult times.

Trucks, especially those with Punjab and Haryana registration plates, catch his fancy. And amongst them, those carrying hazardous waste, especially plastic -- he spots them from quite a distance due to his prior experience in paper mills where they are headed -- make him take his bike off the stand. Malik chases them, takes photos and alerts the pollution control board officials. His tip-offs have helped the department seize scores of such trucks carrying illegal consignment to paper mills of Muzaffarnagar. Plastic and other waste materials are cheaper than wood. They are used as fuel to heat massive boilers in several paper mills across the district. Malik says, “I have worked in a paper mill. And I have seen how waste from the other states, especially plastic, was preferred because it burns at a much higher temperature facilitating faster heating of the boilers. But, at the same time, it causes a lot of environmental pollution. “After pandemic, in which thousands died, I realised how important a clean environment is for health. Pollution weakens the lungs, which are very crucial for life.” Malik has also received several threats and he has filed police complaints for this. “I will not stop this fight against those who are involved in making air poisonous,” he said. Officials of the pollution control board acknowledge Malik’s contribution. On Thursday night, he spotted a tractor-trolley loaded with the waste of the plastic bags and alerted the authority. But Malik wants the department officials to be more alert and proactive. He said, “Sometimes, officials of the pollution department do not send any official to the spot, or ignore my complaint.” When contacted, an engineer with the department in Muzaffarnagar, Vipul Kumar, told TOI, “Whenever we get the complaint, action is immediately taken. Sumit Malik has provided us with several tip-offs about transportation of such waste. And we have seized trucks and sealed godown after that.” In November last year, teams of the pollution control board, district administration and police had raided and sealed a paper mill after it was found burning waste, such as plastic and rubber.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-farmer-turns-into-environment-crusader-by-night-spots-reports-trucks-carrying-hazardous-waste/articleshow/85111495.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Petitioner Ram Khobragade, a lawyer, also demanded Modi’s disqualification under Sections 123(3) and 123(3-A) of the same Act and directives to the Election Commission of India in this regard. “This petition is not maintainable before this court. It was filed in ignorance of provisions made in Section 80 read with Section 81 of the Representation of the People Act, and also the provisions made in Article 102 of the Constitution of India,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor held. The judges clarified that the petitioner ought to have pursued the remedies provided statutorily. However he approached HC in the background describing himself as an advocate and pursuing occupation of social service. “Therefore, we are of the view that this petition deserves to be dismissed by imposing a cost of Rs1,000. It should be deposited in the account of the High Court Legal Services Sub-Committee here within two weeks. In case of failure, the registrar (Judicial) shall take appropriate steps for coercive recovery of the costs by treating them as arrears of land revenue and for which suitable communication shall be made to the competent authority,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-imposes-rs1k-cost-on-lawyer-demanding-pm-modis-disqualification/articleshow/85113507.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The woman, who lives in Ahmedabad, had married a man originally from Gurugram in Haryana, but settled in Dubai.

She said they told her that they were not happy with the gifts they had received from her family. In January 2020, when the woman and her husband came to her house in Ahmedabad, her husband asked for Rs 5 crore from her father. Her father said he could not arrange such a huge amount.

---||Nagpur||With zero active cases, Bhandara first ‘Covid-free’ district in state||Nagpur: Bhandara district in Nagpur division on Friday officially became the first district in Maharashtra to become “Covid-free”. The lone under-treatment patient in the district for the last three days was declared recovered on Friday morning. Bhandara has been reporting no new cases for the last three days despite conducting average 600 tests daily. It took 15 months for the district to get the “Covid-free” status. The district was one of the worst-hit parts of the state during the second wave with more than 12,800 patients under treatment on April 18. It is a huge number for a rural and tribal dominated district with overall population less than 15 lakh. The district having limited medical facilities witnessed oxygen and hospital bed shortage during the second wave. According to district collector Sandeep Kadam, ‘testing, tracing and treatment’ was the three-point formula they followed rigorously to achieve the “Covid-free” status. According to the collector, the district had done a good job in controlling the first wave and the spread was well under control till mid-February this year. “During the second wave, Bhandara was one of the worst-hit districts. On April 12, we reported the highest 1,500+ new cases. More than 12,800 patients were under treatment at a time. Now, this number is zero,” said Kadam. Giving credit to the “collective effort of the administration and cooperation from citizens”, he said that though there are zero active patients in the district today, the administration and citizens need to stay vigilant. “Even the slightest negligence will not work. Against the backdrop of the projected third wave, the rules need to be followed more responsibly,” said Kadam appealing to people to wear masks, wash hands and follow physical distancing. Bhandara’s civil surgeon Dr Riyaz Farooqui was hopeful that the district will continue to remain Covid-free. “If people continue to cooperate, we can remain Covid-free for a longer period. The last three days have seen zero new cases. In July, there were zero cases on more than 10 days. Mask and physical distancing are the keys to continue this status,” he said. Dr Farooqui further said that his department is ready to face challenge from the projected third wave. “We can delay the third wave if we continue to be cautious. The more it is delayed, lesser will be impact of the third wave,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-zero-active-cases-bhandara-first-covid-free-district-in-state/articleshow/85113559.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

So far, 11 burial urns have been found at Konthagai, which is believed to be the burial site of the Keeladi civilization. According to archaeologists, the dagger is the first of its kind to be found in the region. It was found along with femurs (thigh bones), a skull and an offering pot. The rusted iron dagger has a six-centimetre-long wooden handle. Its steel blade, measuring 40cm, was found broken into two. This dagger is about 5cm in width. A broken portion of the lid of the urn was retrieved from inside it. The urn was filled with soil. Two pieces of the urn lid were found on both sides of the dagger, said deputy director of Tamil Nadu state department of archaeology Dr R Sivanantham, who is heading the excavation in Keeladi. The fact that the wooden handle of the dagger is so well preserved is a rare phenomenon, according to him. It may be recalled that experts from the Madurai Kamaraj University, are in the process of taking samples from the burial urns found in Konthagai for DNA analysis. Meanwhile, another ringwell was traced at Agaram site in Keeladi. The diameter of the ring is about 84cm and the thickness of the rim is four cm. Archaeologists would have to dig further to find the height of this well. The length and breadth of the ring well would be ascertained in the next few days. Excavation was taken up for the seventh time in Keeladi in February this year, and in the three villages, which are its cluster including Agaram, Manalur and Konthagai for the second time. Over 850 artefacts have been found in this phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/iron-dagger-with-wooden-handle-skeletal-remains-found-at-konthagai/articleshow/85113562.cms||---

The examinations are held in seven centres across the district by adhering to stringent Covid-19 prevention norms. The seven centres include the Madurai Central Prison where nine candidates will be writing the examination. Chief education officer R Swaminathan said that nearly 100 department personnel including 50 hall supervisors will be deployed for the supplementary examination duty. The CEO and four district education officers visited the examination centres. Students as well as staff on examination duty are screened with thermal scanners before they step into the examination centre and provided with hand sanitizers. Those who missed their masks were also provided one free of cost and social distance was maintained in the exam halls. Of the 480 candidates who were to appear for the Tamil examination on Friday, 110 (23%) were absent. Education department officials said that the number of candidates who appear vary from one subject to the other as there are candidates who would be writing only one paper and those appearing for multiple papers. Department officials said that the reason for higher percentage of absentees among the private examination candidates in comparison to the regular candidates appearing through schools is that the former primarily comprises employed people who find it difficult to get leave to write the exam, married women and those who work in other places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plus-two-exams-begin-with-covid-19-restrictions/articleshow/85113623.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Cops suspect Dubai link to Ashti betting racket||CHANDRAPUR: The online betting racket busted by Aheri police at remote Ashti village in Gadchiroli district is suspected to have links up to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and some metro cities in the country. Also, with the cops naming 19 more persons from Nagpur, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli, the number of accused in the case up to 29. Aheri police led by SDPO Amol Thakur had busted an online betting den operated in Ashti village in Aheri tehsil on July 30. The cops had rounded up accused Chhagan Madhale, Rajesh Dharmale, Manoj Adetwar, Dravyarao Chandrakar, Sumit Nagrale, Surendra Shekle and Sandeep Gudapwar during the initial raids. Investigations revealed that they were bookies who sought bets on international cricket and football matches. Bets were placed through online betting sites betx1.co and nice777.net. During further interrogation, names of Rakesh Kondawar, Abdul Rajik Khan and Mahesh Allewar from Chandrapur came to fore and they were arrested. Cops have seized Rs21.33 lakh cash and 10 mobile phones from the accused. “The bets were placed with the help of password-protected user IDs, obtained through a server. The arrested accused served as bookies and agents and accepted bets. We are, however, yet to trace the server,” said investigation officer, SDPO Thakur. He said interrogation of the accused revealed 19 more names of accused who are from Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Aheri, Ashti and Sironcha. However, all these 19 accused have gone absconding. “We are confident of arresting them in coming days,” he said talking to TOI. The SDPO claimed police have come across leads hinting at foreign connection to the betting racket, but these need to be substantiated with evidence. He, however declined to reveal information about police moving in to block bank accounts of some accused and suspects in the case at Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and other places. He claimed that PCR of the accused arrested will end on Saturday and they would be presented before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-suspect-dubai-link-to-ashti-betting-racket/articleshow/85113595.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: KIIFB intervention delaying road projects, say MLAs||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) came in for criticism from the ruling front MLAs in the assembly on Friday citing that impractical interventions by the agency in project implementation is causing inordinate delay of various projects. The subject also led to a minor confusion on policy matters between PWD minister P A Mohammed Riyas and revenue minister K Rajan. Raising the matter as a calling attention, MLA K B Ganesh Kumar said that work on Enath-Pathanapuram road was stalled through a stop memo by an official from KIIFB, citing that the work should begin only after acquisition of 13-metreswide land for a road that would be only seven metres wide. This stop memo was issued after the court cleared the work award after a dispute between two contractors and the then PWD minister G Sudhakaran had inaugurated the work. “The land for the required width of road is readily available and work can commence. But now some official from KIIFB has issued a stop memo citing that land has to be acquired for a 13-metre-wide road, only after which the work can begin. There are at least 200 houses and other institutions like religious centres, etc. in the proposed land which would mean that acquisition will take years to be completed,” Ganesh said. He also criticised the survey which is another cause of delay. Backing Ganesh’s criticism, A N Shamseer said that the matter raised by Ganesh should be seen as the general sentiment of all the MLAs in the House. Replying to Ganesh, PWD and tourism minister Mohammed Riyas said that though there are some issues in some places, the general rules cannot be changed and all the MLAs are beneficiaries of projects through KIIFB. He said that the government would think of appointing independent survey for KIIFB projects, for which revenue and survey ministers immediately objected, and said that survey will be done only through the survey department. However, Riyas put the matter to rest immediately by stating that the revenue minister’s comments were based on a misunderstanding and he did not mean to create another survey team out of the survey department. Meanwhile, the ruling front came up with the argument that two ministers cannot come up with contradicting policies in the assembly. However, the matter was put to rest without further discussions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kiifb-intervention-delaying-road-projects/articleshow/85113642.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CID pulled up for delay in Khwaja Yunus custodial death trial||MUMBAI: Coming down heavily on the state CID for the delay in the 2003 Khwaja Yunus custodial death case trial, the sessions court on Friday said that it would be a mockery of justice that no heed has been given to its directions since 2014. “That despite repeated notices and letters to the investigating agency, no action has been taken to pursue the part-heard case in which four police officers are accused,” the court said. Dismissed API Sachin Waze is one of the accused. The trial has been stalled si-nce 2018 after special public prosecutor (SPP) Dhiraj Mirajkar was abruptly removed; no appointment has been made since. “Why is there no progress rep-ort in this case...when there are in others [cases]. This is suspicious,” judge U J More said. A software engineer, Yunus was arrested in the 2002 Ghatkopar BEST bus blast case. Waze and his team had claimed that Yunus had escaped, but in 2017, an acquitted co-accused, a doctor who teaches forensics in a medical college, told the court he had seen Yunus being brutally assaulted in custody and vomiting blood on January 6, 2003. During Friday’s hearing, Taloja jail officials said Waze could not attend the virtual hearing as he had gone before the judicial commission for another hearing. The NIA had arrested Waze in March in the Ambani bomb scare and Mansukh Hiran murder case. Turning down the defence request to produce Waze in person for now, the court said he should be produced via videoconferencing without fail on the next date. State CID superintendent of police Maruti Jagtap, who was summoned to court, submitted that despite efforts made in 2018 and 2021, there was no commun-ication from the state governm-ent in response to the correspo-ndence sent for SPP appointme-nt. “Are these concrete steps? You should pursue…” the judge shot back. “I have perused the roznama for 4 hours and found that no steps have been taken.” The court pointed out that earlier two SPPs had been appointed and both had resigned. It added that it was also a serious issue that despite repeated directions to produce the station diary, no heed was paid. “Why is the case stuck when there is no stay order from the Supreme Court or Bombay high court,” the judge asked. The court also lamented that since the case was pending for a decade, witne-sses’ memory may be affected. The chief public prosecutor, who was summoned, said the case was also delayed due the lockdown and the state CID is now pursuing the matter. “What are they pursuing? At least some officer should come...Nobody turns up. Isn’t that suspicious,” the court said. The prosecution and Jagtap assured the court that a senior CID officer will attend court on every date. A month’s time was sought to pursue the matter regarding the SPP appointment. The court said summons should be issued to Yunus’s mother Ashiya Begum to understand the nature of her petition in the SC and HC. The accused—Waze and constables Rajendra Tiwari, Rajaram Nikam and Sunil Desai—who were suspended in 2004 were reinstated last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-cid-pulled-up-for-delay-in-yunus-custodial-death-trial/articleshow/85117151.cms||Rebecca Samervel

They informed Thirunagar police of their decision to shelter her following which the SI helped her get admission to their home. As the old lady could converse only in Hindi, she was told that she was being taken to a safe place and brought to the home. They obtained details of her home town and names of her relatives. Subsequently, an engineer from Thirunagar, Ravi, helped them locate the owner of a tea stall in Indore. A news reporter there was contacted and further investigations near Noori mosque that the old lady had spoken about helped them identify her grandson. She was then made to speak to her grandson Hyder Ali who was overjoyed to know that she was alive. Ali and friend Mohamed Feroz arrived in Madurai by train on Thursday and said she had gone missing six months ago. She had gone missing earlier once but returned home. Ali said it was not known how she travelled so far this time and they had been looking for her. They were then taken to the Thirunagar police station where the records produced by Ali were verified and they were sent by train to Indore. Vishwanath said that they had borne the cost of travel for the three as there was no direct train to Indore from Madurai. ``This was the first time that we had a case of reuniting family members from such a long distance. It gave us much pleasure,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/indore-woman-70-reunited-with-kin/articleshow/85113635.cms||---

The latest death in the camp was that of Arjun, offspring of elephant Mangala, born on Makar Sankranti on January 15, 2019. Sources said Arjun was with other elephants in the camp during the day. When the herd went close to a stream, Arjun dropped down and died there. Forest officials have kept the cause of death of the young elephant and circumstances leading to its death under warps.

Earlier, 32 months old female elephant Saee had died under mysterious circumstances on August 3, in the same camp. She had stopped feeding on August 2 and her movements had slowed down. Veterinary doctor from Aheri was summoned for her treatment and she had gone into jungle with other elephants later in the night. However, her body was discovered in the forest next morning. Postmortem was carried out the same day. However, officials maintained that cause of death could be ascertained only after receipt of forensic analysis of viscera sample. Three elephants have died in Kamlapur camp in the last 14 months. First among the latest series of deaths was of 4-year-old elephant named Aditya, who had died on June 29, 2020. Aditya had accidentally got struck in mud on June 11, 2020, and was taken out only after hard efforts. However, Aditya’s health deteriorated even after treatment and the jumbo failed to recover. Questions were raised on the caretaking of the elephants at that time too. There used to be 10 elephants in Kamlapur camp till last year. Now, the numbers have dropped to 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-jumbo-death-in-4-days-at-mahas-lone-elephant-camp/articleshow/85113648.cms||Mazhar Ali

Kiran Kumar, who is being tried in connection with the case, was serving as assistant motor vehicle inspector in the Kollam regional office of the motor vehicle department. Transport minister Antony Raju said here on Friday that he is being dismissed from the service for involving in activities which are anti-social, against gender equality and womanhood. He said that his grossly illegal actions and moral turpitude has diminished the image of the government and the motor vehicle department among the general public. He has been dismissed from the service on the basis of relevant rules of the Kerala civil services rules, 1960. As per rule 93(c) of the Kerala government servants conduct rules, 1960, “no government servant shall take or give dowry for his marriage or for the marriage of any member, or dependant, of his family”.

---||Delhi||Delhi: New excise policy may bring in Rs 9,500 crore||NEW DELHI: The revenue of Delhi government is all set to rise exponentially, all thanks to its new excise policy through which liquor retail licences in 32 zones have been auctioned since Thursday. The initial bidding of 20 zones has brought in Rs 5,300 crore in excise revenue and about Rs 8,800 crore is estimated to be earned in the overall bidding process. Delhi government had collected Rs 6,358 crore in financial year 2019-20 under the previous regime by collecting excise on Indian and foreign liquor, VAT from wholesale and retail sales, HCR and retail licensing fees. With the new policy and demarcation of zones for bidding, the amount would reach around Rs 9,500 crore this fiscal. According to the new policy, the priority of Delhi government is to promote consumer choice and availability of popular as well as niche brands. It also aims to curb bootlegging and ensure that there is adequate spread of retail vends across Delhi, so that there are no unserved and underserved areas. To ensure this, a new licence — L-7Z — would be allotted to the highest bidder for a zone. The 272 wards in 68 assembly constituencies are divided into 30 zones. There would be 9-10 wards in each zone and a maximum of 27 retail vends (an average of three) in each ward. The reserve price was set at Rs 221 crore and the tenders were awarded at a premium of 20% with the average bid price being Rs 265 crore. The highest bid was auctioned for the New Delhi zone at a 45% premium for Rs 315 crore. The government has already earned around Rs 5,300 crore in the initial rounds where licences in 20 zones were awarded. The average zone-wise revenue was around Rs 265 crore. If a similar average revenue is received from the remaining 12 zones, around Rs 8,800 crore would be earned. Apart from this, revenue earned from auctions, excise, VAT, import fees, CSDN, HCR licences, wholesale licences and HCR VAT would be approximately Rs 650 crore. This would take the total projected revenue close to Rs 9,500 crore, sources said. Excise Policy 2021-22 is aimed at minimising corruption and providing fair competition in the liquor trade. The tender process forbids an applicant from bidding in more than two zones. The government believes this will bring in more players into the market and prevent monopoly. Under the previous excise regime, the yearly revenue growth rate was 5% to 7%, but under the new policy a growth of around 35% was expected, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-excise-policy-may-bring-in-rs-9500cr/articleshow/85116007.cms||---

While old students are appearing for the exam to clear Class 12, three students from the current year also chose to appear for the board exam. They opted out of the weightage system announced by the state government to calculate Class 12 board examination marks, after the exams were cancelled due to the pandemic. The state government had given the option of appearing for supplementary examination for those who were not satisfied with the marks awarded by giving weightage to their performance in classes 10, 11 board exams besides class 12 practical and internal assessments. A total of 39,000 students across the state had applied for private examinations including special children. Unlike last year, they were also declared all pass and exempted from appearing for the exam. This has left only the old students who want to complete their class 12 by appearing for private examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/board-exam-for-old-students-begins/articleshow/85113649.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Hundreds of people, carrying sticks and bricks attacked the temple, burning parts of it and damaging the idols in Bhong area of Rahimyar Khan district of the province in protest against the release by a court of a Hindu boy, who was held for allegedly urinating in a seminary. A police officer said the boy was arrested last week and booked under the blasphemy laws but subsequently released on bail for being a minor. “The situation got out of control after the court granted bail to the boy,” he said. “What were the administration and police doing when the temple was attacked,” chief justice Ahmed asked IGP Inam Ghani, who was specially summoned to appear before the court. The CJ said the attack has done serious damage to Pakistan’s reputation globally, Geo News reported. Ghani said the “administration’s priority was to protect 70 Hindu homes around the temple”. The assistant commissioner and assistant SP were present at the scene, Ghani added. The CJ was not satisfied and remarked: “If the commissioner, DCP and district police officer can’t perform, then they should be removed.” He observed that it showed that the police did nothing except watch the incident, without realising that it would damage the image of the country abroad. “A Hindu temple was demolished, and just think what they must have felt. Imagine what would have been the reaction of Muslims had a mosque been demolished,” the CJ said. The IGP tried to pacify the bench by saying that the case was registered and clauses of terrorism were added in the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-sc-temple-attack-has-tarnished-countrys-image/articleshow/85118446.cms||---

The four accused had allegedly hatched the nefarious plan to kill Nikhil Prajapati (34) at Nandida crossroads near Bardoli on Thursday. Police investigation revealed that Prajapati, owner of a glass and aluminium panelling shop, started living with a woman who had recently got divorced from 34-year-old Ketan Gondaliya, a farsan shop owner, and a close friend of the victim. Gondaliya, who is the key accused in the case, took offence at the relationship which led to a rivalry between them. Details were shared with the media by Rajkumar Pandian, IGP, Surat range and Usha Rada Desai, superintendent of police, Surat, on Friday. Besides Gondaliya, police arrested Vishal Rathod (28), Hitesh Vaghrai alias Surel (21) and Badal Rathod (20). The fifth accused Sagar Vansfodiya, mastermind of the deadly attack, is still eluding arrest, said cops. The contract to kill Prajapati was given by Gondaliya through Vishal for Rs 2 lakh to the three other accused who executed the plan. Police identified Vansfodiya, Surel and Badal from the CCTV footage that was recovered from the route on which the trio escaped after killing Prajapati. Police also matched call data records, in which it was proved that all were in contact with each other. Prajapati was a native of Shishli village in Porbandar while Gondaliya hails from Dhoraji in Rajkot. The duo were once very close and Prajapati would often visit Gondaliya’s home and chat for hours. Gondaliya’s marriage with Chanda was rocky as the duo often fought with each other and ultimately they got divorced in January. Soon after they parted ways, Chanda went to stay with Prajapati with whom she had a court marriage, police said. “Gondaliya felt offended that his former wife was now living with his close friend and as a revenge planned the murder,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bizman-killed-over-marital-enmity/articleshow/85115341.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Register flats in Indu Aranya in 2 wks: HC||Hyderabad: Coming down heavily on the state housing board for not allowing registration of flats of those who paid the required amounts a decade ago, the Telangana high court on Friday gave two weeks to the housing board to register the flats in Indu Aranya venture in Rangareddy district to two flat buyers. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice A Abhishek Reddy was hearing petitions from R Venugopal Reddy and A few others. Refuting the contentions raised by the housing board for citing losses it suffered on account of the fraud played by the developer, Indu Projects, and the pending arbitration proceedings, a single judge earlier directed the board to register the flats to those buyers who paid the full amount. The board preferred an appeal against this order. The bench made it clear that there was nothing for it to interfere in the order of the single judge. It also called for a list of similarly placed persons who were suffering on account of the fraud played by the developer and the dodging attitude of the housing board. The bench also asked the board not to drag buyers into the endless arbitration issues that have been going on between the board and the developer. “The flat buyers have got nothing to do with your bilateral disputes. You did not take enough precautions while dealing with the developer. That is your headache,” the bench warned the board. It also said that flat buyers were free to proceed against the board if it still delayed the registrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/register-flats-in-indu-aranya-in-2-wks-hc/articleshow/85115494.cms||---

The family was earlier requested by the Indian Embassy in Beijing through an e-mail to give consent for cremation at Tianjin due to the decomposed state of the body. Aman’s uncle Ramkishor Paswan said the Indian government should make arrangements for repatriation of the body by a special air ambulance. “It is not a normal situation. Aman has been murdered in China. He represented India at Tianjin University. The Indian government should take immediate steps for the repatriation,” Paswan said. He added since international flights are suspended in view of Covid pandemic, the Centre should arrange a special flight or an air ambulance to briong back the Aman’s body. “In case of more delay, the mortal remains will get decomposed. We are not in favour of cremation of the body at Tianjin. We want to perform his last rites with Hindu rituals,” he said. Different student organisations in Kerala, Maharashtra and other states, including Bihar, have also urged the central government to ensure that Aman’s body is repatriated to his native place in Gaya, Paswan said. In Gaya, different student organisations of Magadh University staged a peaceful demonstration on Thursday demanding repatriation of Aman’s body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kin-of-gaya-student-killed-in-china-want-repatriation-of-body/articleshow/85112303.cms||---

Resident doctors boycotted all work at emergency, casualty, Covid-19 as well as maternity wards in support of their long pending demands. Protesting docs also received support from intern doctors.Wearing black clothes and holding placards, protestors raised slogans demanding justice from the state government which has hardened its stand against the agitating junior doctors.A day after deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, who also holds the health portfolio, asked the protesting doctors to resume duty warning them that the government shall initiate “strict proceedings” against them , junior doctors were also threatened to vacate hostel premises if the stir continued.Dean of Medical College, Baroda Dr Tanuja Javadekar confirmed that during a video conference the deans have been asked to get rooms of agitating doctors vacated. Of the nearly 600 junior doctors who are on strike, nearly 60% reside in hostels. “If the strike is withdrawn, there will be no question of getting the rooms vacated. Let us see,” she told media persons. “We have decided to continue our strike till our demands are addressed. Our demands are genuine,” said Dr Akash Desai, president of Junior Doctors’ Association of Baroda Medical College. JDA office-bearers from six medical colleges had discussions with officials but the deadlock continued as the top brass of the health department insisted that the junior doctors should withdraw their strike before holding any discussions.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Cabinet rejig on the cards, calls for Dalit deputy chief minister gain momentum||HYDERABAD: The demand for making a Dalit as a deputy chief minister has gained momentum with chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao himself championing the cause of Scheduled Castes by implementing Dalita Bandhu scheme. A cabinet reshuffle has been on the cards after Eatala Rajender was dropped from the council of ministers on May 2. A senior leader in the TRS did not rule out the possibility of a Dalit being made the deputy CM before or after Huzurabad bypolls whenever the cabinet reshuffle happens. Thatikonda Rajaiah and Kadiam Srihari, who were from the SC community, served as deputy CMs in KCR’s cabinet. Though there is only one vacancy to be filled up in the cabinet in place of Eatala who quit TRS and had joined BJP after being ousted from the cabinet, a majority of leaders in the TRS are of the view that KCR may go for a reshuffle by dropping one or two ministers, inducting new members and re-allocating the portfolios. Various SC welfare associations and opposition parties have been demanding either promotion of an existing SC minister as a deputy CM or induction of new candidates from the SC community to the deputy CM post. Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi founder-president Manda Krishna Madiga has demanded that there be at least three more ministers in the cabinet from the SC community in proportionate to their population in the state. “KCR should either promote social welfare minister Koppula Eshwar to the deputy CM post or give it to another SC leader. KCR can at least do this service to the SC community after betraying them by backtracking from his promise of making a Dalit as CM,” Krishna Madiga said. Apart from SC leaders, there is a bright prospect of a BC leader making it to KCR’s cabinet. “Eatala was a Mudiraj bidda and KCR may like to fill up the vacancy with a BC leader,” said a TRS leader. Earlier, there were four ministers from the BC community but the cabinet now has three members only following the ouster of Eatala. The three BC ministers are Talasani Srinivas Yadav, V Srinivas Goud and Gangula Kamalakar. There is one minister each from Kamma (Puvvada Ajay Kumar), ST (Satyavathi Rathod), SC (Eshwar) and Muslim (Mohammed Mahmood Ali) communities and four Velamas — KCR, son KT Rama Rao, nephew T Harish Rao and Errabelli Dayakar Rao. There are six ministers from Reddy community — A Indrakaran Reddy, , G Jagadish Reddy, Singireddy Niranjan Reddy, Vemula Prashanth Reddy, Ch Malla Reddy and P Sabitha Indra Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cabinet-rejig-on-the-cards-calls-for-dalit-dy-cm-gain-momentum/articleshow/85115382.cms||Roushan Ali

In these FIRs, the licensee, Aditya Multicom Company Private Limited, was made named accused. The seized stock was handed over to the “safe custody” of this firm. The seized sand was stored in 10 different places of the area. In the FIR lodged with Nasariganj police station, mines inspector Anjay Kumar alleged that of the seized stock of about 100 lakh CFT sand, only 56 lakh CFT was found during physical verification of the consignment by a team on July 15 this year. “No satisfactory reply came from the company about the shortage of the sand.

The STPs will be built in three phases by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB). On Friday, KTR laid the foundation stone of a 100 MLD (million litres per day) capacity STP at Fathenagar. KTR said that every day over 40% of sewage water was being treated in the city through STPs. Currently, the HMWS&SB was treating 772 out of 1,950 MLD sewage water and only few cities in the country could claim to be doing this, he said. He also urged residents staying near drains and water bodies not to throw garbage and plastic waste to prevent choking and overflowing. HMWS&SB managing director M Dana Kishore said that it was after a gap of 14 years that the board had take up the plan to build 31 STPs with modern technology to treat sewage water in GHMC periphery circles under the comprehensive sewerage master plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-to-get-31-stps-to-treat-waste-water/articleshow/85115435.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 6 lakh farmers to get loan waiver amount in account from August 16||HYDERABAD: Fulfilling its 2018 poll promise on farm loan waiver, the government will release Rs 2,006 crore which will be deposited in the accounts of six lakh farmers from August 16. The state cabinet had last week decided to release the amount to farmers who had availed loans up to Rs 50,000 from banks. “Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao will formally announce the loan waiver on August 15 and the government will release the amount the next day,” finance minister Harish Rao said. The minister along with agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy held a meeting with bankers on farm loan waiver on Friday. During the assembly elections, the ruling party had promised waiver of crop loans waiver up to Rs 1 lakh. Last year, loans up to Rs 25,000 were cleared by releasing Rs 408 crore which had benefited about 2.96 lakh farmers. Harish Rao said the loan amount would be deposited in the farmers’ accounts as per the decision of the cabinet recently. Both banks and officials have to coordinate on this. The state finance minister said that as soon as the amount was deposited in the farmers’ accounts in the name of CM, the beneficiary should get an SMS. The banks should also inform farmers that they are eligible for a fresh loan. Keeping in view of past instances where some banks adjusted the loan amount towards interests, the minister said that this should not be done at any cost. Representatives from 42 various banks participated in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/6l-farmers-to-get-loan-waiver-amt-in-account-from-aug-16/articleshow/85115570.cms||Koride Mahesh

Ten questions, including ones on annual income and family properties, form part of the survey. Districts were given instructions to complete the survey by August 14. The questions cover aspects such as family’s scheduled sub-caste, how many people live in the family, whether the family owns house and how much land parcel the family owns, how many earning members are in the family, what is their educational qualification, how much they earn, whether they work or own a business, what is the net income of the family, how much property is owned by the family and if anyone owns a car or bike in the family. SC welfare minister Koppula Eshwar told TOI that the details were being taken mostly to understand the families’ background. “We will start with the poorest of the poor. Most Dalit families are eligible for the scheme. Depending on the criteria set, only a few families may be left out,” he said. The idea is to cover at least 20 families in each of the villages in Huzurabad assembly segment, he added.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Indefinite strike by PG medicos from Aug 9||Thiruvananthapuram: The post-graduate medical residents in government medical college hospitals will go on an indefinite strike from August 9. The strike has been called for as the government was not ready for any discussion to consider their demands despite their token strike last week. “We are forced to go on an indefinite strike and we will be withdrawing from non-essential services initially, followed by Covid and ICU duties. We are not going to step back until our issues are considered and our basic rights are ensured,” said Dr R Naveen, state secretary of Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association. All post-graduates and superspecialty senior residents will take part in the strike. The state chapter of Indian Medical Association and Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association have affirmed their support to the medicos. “For the past one-and-half years we have been in the forefront of the fight against the pandemic, but till date there has been no support or appreciation from higher authorities. We have been raising our basic issues to concerned authorities for the past six months, but the response was disappointing,” said Dr Athul Ashok, state president of the association. Their demands include decentralization of Covid patient load to peripheral non-teaching institutions and they alleged that the government is destroying the largest medical training facilities of the state by overburdening it with Covid cases. The association is demanding additional human resource recruitment to MCHs through national health mission. The hospitals are going to face acute shortage of hands since the doctors are busy preparing for NEET post-graduate examinations and the current non-academic batch completing their postings. An increase in the number of non-academic senior resident posts has become inevitable. The finance department had approved 76 senior resident posts, but the notification of its allotment has not been issued yet. Other demands include incentives and risk allowances for resident doctors working round the clock without any break, decongestion of MCHs of extra ICU beds that they cannot support due to severe shortage inhuman resources, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/indefinite-strike-by-pg-medicos-from-aug-9/articleshow/85113831.cms||---

Unlike the rural population, there is a stagnation in the city for the vaccination drive for antenatal mothers. In rural areas, pregnant women are heavily dependent on the primary health centres (PHC), and health authorities are making use of the opportunity to vaccinate them.  However, in the city, expectant mothers are relying mostly on private obstetricians. The recent vaccination camps organised exclusively for them saw a poor response and even the patronage in vaccination centres continues to be low. Unlike the first wave, maternal mortality in the second wave was high. The progression of infection and symptoms among the young mothers were found rapid, a source said and added that around 65% to 70% of the maternal mortality in recent months was caused by Covid-19. Hence, the civic body has made the arrangement with obstetricians to sensitise their patients to take the jab. “Vaccinating the expecting mothers is very crucial but there is a fear among them. We are coordinating with obstetrician associations in the city to sensitise the women and vaccinate them at their respective clinics,” city health officer Dr M Yazhini said. Private clinics that have more than 10 pregnant women at a time in their centres can approach the civic body’s health section for support. The sensitisation drive is anticipated to make the expectant mothers overcome vaccine hesitancy.  The civic body said that adequate vials were earmarked to sustain the mobile vaccination programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-forms-mobile-team-to-vaccinate-pregnant-women/articleshow/85113776.cms||Deepak Karthik

The project, at a cost of Rs 28.4 crore will also modernise the extraction, storage and distribution network. The scheme is being executed under the smart cities mission programme and will facilitate round-the-clock drinking water supply to 18 wards. The proposal includes digging up new borewells and improving existing water sources to ensure that the civic body will be able to extract 60 MLD of water from the Cauvery river bed. At present, only 30 MLD of water is being sourced. New reservoirs to store 20 lakh litres of water will be established with a water quality testing laboratory. The collector wells will be improved in two separate packages by a Coimbatore based contractor. The proposal will also revamp the existing 17.5 km pipelines in areas under the smart cities mission covering Rockfort, Thillai Nagar, Melachinthamani, Woraiyur, Thennur and Gandhi market. “Even if we expand the boundaries of Trichy city, we have adequate water drawing sources to fulfil the drinking water needs. Soon, the entire city will get round the clock water supply, the existing water sources will be revamped to meet the required quantum,” municipal administration minister K N Nehru said while inaugurating the work at Woraiyur. For better maintenance and monitoring, the 24 hours water supply scheme will get a SCADA system. Old vertical turbine pumps will be replaced with modern pumps to ensure better water drawing capacity at Periyar Nagar and Kambarasampettai head works. Trichy Corporation officials said that diesel generators will be equipped in the collector wells in order to continue water extraction even in case of a power shutdown. Around 55,155 houses and commercial establishments in 18 corporation wards will benefit from the scheme scheduled to be commissioned in July 2023. The proposal was made by considering the water demands of Trichy city for the next 20-25 years, corporation officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-water-supply-project-work-begins/articleshow/85113796.cms||---

A resident of Naraina in southwest Delhi, Saini often travels to Durgapuri in Shahdara for business and his commute, till Friday afternoon, involved changing metro trains three times or a longer detour through northwest Delhi with two changes. “Now I can just board a train from Maujpur station and comfortably reach home without changing trains,” smiled Saini. “I heard some passengers talk about the train now going non-stop to Majlis Park, but I wasn’t sure. I got down at Welcome and found it to be true.” The 59-km Pink Line from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar is one of the most ambitious corridors built by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. It connects all the existing metro corridors, but a missing portion at Trilokpuri had affected the seamlessness of the travel. The bridging of the gap on Friday presented a huge advantage for people in northeast Delhi and parts of east Delhi. These parts of the city are now directly connected with important transport hubs such as Nizamuddin Railway Station, Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, Anand Vihar Railway Station and ISBT, Delhi Cantt Railway Station and also prominent markets like INA, Sarojini Nagar, South Extension and Lajpat Nagar. Saini wasn’t the only one unaware that the Pink Line had started operating as a single corridor. Mayapuri resident Vimla Devi also discovered the fact only on hearing an announcement at the station. “When I visit relatives in Ghaziabad, I usually change trains at Netaji Subhas Place station on the Red Line corridor. After learning about the new section opening, I used this route today,” she said. Naveen Kumar, who lives in Gokulpuri, northeast Delhi, and commutes daily to the CGO Complex, said, “I usually board the Violet Line at JLN Stadium station, change to Red Line at Kashmere Gate and then take the Pink Line home from Welcome. Now, I only need to change the train at Lajpat Nagar.” Kumar said it was an experience to see the houses cheek by jowl with the track when the train slowed down while crossing the erstwhile ‘missing link’. Rahul Dev, a Ghaziabad resident, said, “This line has made it comfortable for residents of northeast Delhi and Ghaziabad to reach Anand Vihar ISBT and railway station, Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station, even Indira Gandhi international Airport.” There were a few glitches on the first day apart from the restricted speed on the newly opened section. The train doors took more time than usual to open at both Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 and Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/commuters-rejoice-as-majlis-park-replaces-trilokpuri-as-destination/articleshow/85113797.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This sums up the year for Ghatkopar teenager Harsh Vora who took the JEE (Main) test thrice this year, each time to surpass his previous score, and emerge as the Maharashtra topper in the session 3 results announced on Friday night. “I took each attempt as practice to get better. Each test had its ups and downs, but the hardest was the February attempt. Actually, I just made some silly mistakes. In this attempt too, I made one silly error,” Vora told TOI. Vora was the 2019 ICSE third ranker and since then has harbored the desire to sign up at IIT-B’s computer science department and later join Google. And he came closer to his dreams with every JEE attempt. IIT aspirants like Harsh will go on to take the JEE Advanced. The National Testing Agency (NTA) released the results of the JEE (Main) session 3 at 10pm on Friday. Among the all-India rankers, 17 candidates scored a 100 percentile—four each from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, two each from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and one each from Bihar, Rajasthan and Karnataka.

As the antiques were recovered near the surface, archaeological enthusiasts have urged the state government and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to explore the site.According to S Babu, an epigraphist working as an associate professor in a private college, the farmers ploughing the fields in Solaganallur village around 12km from Manachanallur spotted the copper coins in their field. As he had already explored the village where remains of Chola era antiques were found in recent years, the locals informed him. “Two coins recovered from the surface were found to be made of copper. One side of the coin has a lamp and Raj Raja Chola’s image in standing posture, the other side has the image of the king in Arasamarvu (sitting posture),” Babu said. The coins measure 2.5cm in diameter and weigh less than 5g each. Babu compared the coins with similar Chola era copper coins on display in Thanjavur and Trichy museums to ascertain the age of the coins. “The coins could have been released by Rajendra Chola to commemorate his father,” he added.As few fragments of conch bangles, spindles and stone gems were recovered from the same site, the epigraphist said that Solaganallur could have served as a trade hub for the Cholas who ruled the region for centuries. “Since Woraiyur in Trichy had served as the capital of Cholas, there is a possibility to unearth more antiques in and around Manachanallur. We have made similar findings in the past,” said Mani Maran, a Tamil scholar with Thanjavur Sarasvati Mahal library. Babu said that the coins and antiques will be submitted to the archaeological department under Thanjavur Tamil university for further study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-stumble-upon-chola-era-coins-while-plouging-field-in-trichy/articleshow/85113851.cms||Deepak Karthik

Khandelwal, who was busy preparing to leave for Switzerland for his bachelors’ degree course in hotel management, scored marks way below his expectations has CBSE’s moderation of marks scheme to blame.“I scored 94.3% in Class X, 85% in Class XI and in Class XII they awarded me 88%, which is by any standard way below my performance. I have scored 1,430 points in SAT for my higher education and my reserve estimate for Class XII was 92% in all probabilities,” said Khandelwal.His case looks normal until it is known that similar marks were given to 234 students of St Xavier’s School, Nevta, in Jaipur. Over 100 parents and students staged a protest in the school raising banners and slogans demanding a fair probe into the matter.A resident of Nirman Nagar, Aradhya Jain is now uncertain of getting admission in any normal college with a score of 83% in Class XII CBSE commerce. “I was expecting in the nineties in all my test series,” said Jain, who was told by her teacher that due to the marks moderation scheme they have awarded her 75%, else it would have been 90% and above.Eyeing a seat in a premier management school, Charvi Meherwal, feels that her score of 71% despite scoring 91% in Class X and 80% in Class XI would make her ineligible to get any scholarship and admission. “The difference in marks moderation between schools conducting exams for the first time and those conducted several times has cost us dearly. I humbly request the CBSE to award us marks with same moderation scheme in which they had awarded to other schools,” said Meherwal.An official of the school requesting anonymity says, “That for schools holding exam for the first time cannot go beyond the city’s average last year.”Conforming to the anomaly, another school facing the same situation was Happy Public School. Principal K G Vijayvargiya said that CBSE may have given the responsibility of awarding marks to schools, but had tied the hands of the schools. “The moderation formula has allowed our school to give only two students above 90% marks which were based on the reference year of 2019-20,” said Vijayvargiya, who has written a letter to the CBSE seeking clarification.A CBSE official requesting anonymity said that they are aware of the issue and will soon be rolling out a complaint committee to resolve issues. “The details of the committee will be sent to schools as soon as it is formed,” said the official, who confirmed that the board exam for improvement of result would be declared before September 30. TOI repeatedly called up CBSE national coordinator Sanyam Bhardwaj for his comments, but in vain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cbse-class-xii-students-protest-against-moderation-of-marks/articleshow/85113838.cms||---

He was earlier given this post before the Lok Sabha elections and he had resigned from it following differences with the KPCC leadership. Muraleedharan had then criticized the KPCC leadership for not discussing party issues at the party forum and had also complained that all the decisions were being taken in the party by just a few leaders. With Muraleedharan’s re-appointment, speculation that he is being considered for the UDF convener post has ended.

---||Delhi||Privatisation of power: Losses go down to 7.5%||New Delhi: The last month marked 19 years of privatisation of power distribution in Delhi. In these nearly two decades, the capital saw its power demand grow by two and a half times and the aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses, primarily caused by theft, came down from 55% to 7.5%. Privatisation of the Delhi Vidyut Board took place in 2002. The national capital’s power demand has increased from a power demand of 2,879 MW back then to 7,409 MW in 2019 – an increase of 157.3%. At the time of privatisation, AT&C losses in the national capital were over 55% and in east and central Delhi, the losses were as high as 63%. The figure came down to 8% by last year and currently stands around 7.5%. According to sources, AT&C losses and power outages were the primary reason for privatisation. According to the ministry of power’s Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) website, AT&C losses in other states are much higher led by J&K, which is 67.7%, Chattisgargh (40.45%), Madhya Pradesh (26.31%), Uttar Pradesh (24.89%), Maharashtra (20.76%), Rajasthan (20.47%), Andhra Pradesh (19.39%), Punjab (18.99%), Karnataka (13.8%) and Tamil Nadu (12.46%). According to discom sources, reduction in AT&C losses has saved Delhi’s discoms and their consumers over Rs 1.2 lakh crore in the past 19 years. Sources said that at present, each percentage of AT&C loss reduction saves Delhi consumers around Rs 250 crore. While Delhi’s power demand has grown considerably, the capital has seen no electricity tariff hike since 2014. According to sources, power purchase costs have increased by over 300% from 2002, while retail power tariff has increased by 91% in the corresponding period. Sources said the savings by way of AT&C losses have provided cushion to the Delhi discoms to ensure business continuity in the absence of tariff hike even though cost has increased. The revenue gaps (regulatory assets) of the Delhi discoms have reached Rs 51,646 crore as of March 31, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/privatisation-of-power-losses-go-down-to-7-5/articleshow/85113881.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi assembly to go to SC against NCT Act changes that diminish its powers||NEW DELHI: Delhi assembly will move the Supreme Court against certain provisions of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, which has “curtailed the powers of the assembly”, speaker Ram Niwas Goel revealed at a press conference on Friday. Goel accused the central government of usurping the powers of the assembly and, through the amendment, impinging on the powers of the various assembly committees. The amendment Act was cleared by both houses of Parliament in March despite the resistance of the opposition parties. The amended Act was notified on April 27. “The assembly has decided to move the Supreme Court against the decision,” announced Goel. “We will challenge certain provisions of the Act that curtails the powers of the committees of the assembly, not the entire Act itself.” The speaker said it was up to the state government to take a call on whether the entire Act would be challenged. “I cannot comment on that,” Goel said. The speaker said that in July, the Supreme Court had given a verdict in favour of the Delhi assembly committee on peace and harmony, which was examining the role of Facebook in the February 2020 northeast Delhi riots. “This ruling came after the Centre notified the GNCTD (Amendment) Act. In its order, the court clearly said the assembly and its committees had the power to conduct inquiries and issue summons,” pointed out Goel. Goel also said that on March 29, 2018, the lieutenant governor had written to the then law secretary, who in turn, informed the assembly that questions related to reserved subjects couldn’t be entertained. The speaker said the assembly accordingly couldn’t make laws on the reserved subjects, despite discussing such subjects from 1993 to 2018. He said that MLAs Somnath Bharti and Bandana Kumari had asked two questions in the House on services and police, both reserved subjects, but the answers couldn’t be provided. “This matter will be sent to the assembly’s Privilege Committee,” Goel said, adding that the assembly would make this “act of not answering such questions” the base of its approach in the Supreme Court challenging the provisions of the GNCTD Act. “I have faith in the judiciary and I hope that the Supreme Court will restore the powers of the assembly,” said Goel. He said Delhi assembly was soliciting legal opinions. Goel also pointed out that on July 4, 2018, the Supreme Court had held that the LG was bound by the “aid and advice” of the council of ministers except on the issues of public order, police and land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/assembly-to-go-to-sc-against-nct-act-changes-that-diminish-its-powers/articleshow/85116148.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||HC seeks status reports from cops on Tahir’s bail petitions||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday asked police to place “all status reports” on the bail applications moved by former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain in cases relating to the northeast Delhi riots last year. Justice Yogesh Khanna, who was hearing four bail applications by Hussain in separate FIRs registered at Dayalpur police station, said that he will hear arguments by parties after the court received status reports in all cases. Hussain’s counsel told the court that police have filed status reports in two cases. “All status reports should be brought on record. We can have it later. Send status reports to the registry,” the judge said and listed the cases for hearing on August 18. The court also noted that its record for the data contained only one status report. All the cases relate to the alleged offence of rioting in Dayalpur during the riots of February 2020. Two of the FIRs also concern the injuries suffered by two people on account of a riotous mob pelting stones, throwing petrol bombs and firing gunshots from the terrace of Hussain’s house and allege commission of offences of attempt to murder and violation of Arms Act. Notice on one of these two bail applications was issued by Justice Khanna on July 13.

For the first time, in the excise policy for 2021-22, the government had allowed setting up of micro-breweries in the state. When asked, a senior official of the excise department said the department is yet to issue rules for brewery licence. Despite calls and text messages, excise commissioner did not respond to queries. But according to the industry, two restaurants have already started setting up the breweries in Jaipur city. While the government included in the policy of giving licences for micro-breweries, bars and restaurant have not shown interest. Sources in the liquor trade said, “The lockdowns have been one of the reasons why the bars, hotels and restaurants have not shown interest. But the government is silent on this segment even though it included offering licences in the policy.” There are many cities in India where micro-breweries are operating, offering beer freshly brewed with different flavours and concoctions. In some cities, the freshly made beers are also supplied to other bars and restaurants. Being a tourist state, micro-breweries could be a new attraction for the tourists. But it is yet to take off right now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-reduces-excise-duty-for-micro-breweries/articleshow/85113891.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Student’s age, Class 10 score key for admission in Rajasthan University||JAIPUR: A student’s date of birth and Class 10 score will determine the admission to the constituent colleges of the Rajasthan University (RU). The formula will be applicable in case two and more students have a tie in terms of their Class 12 percentage in the admission list. The admission process in RU will start from August 9. TimesViewThe criteria of considering the birth date and Class 10 scores in case of a tie/draw in the admission merit list to constituent colleges of the Rajasthan University (RU) are problematic and not consistent with logic. As per the birth date norm, an older student can be considered eligible for admissions over a younger student. Experts say the weightage given to entrance tests and Class XII scores are the universally accepted norms. In case it is difficult to compile the admission merit list based on the entrance test, the next option is to consider a student's performance in three main subjects. If a tie situation continues, preference should be given to those applying in the same stream. The norm for selecting an elder student is one that's not only illogical but one remotely related to any academic benchmark.The formula has been introduced since 98.98% of students in Class 12 of Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) have secured marks 60% and above making hundreds of students scoring the same percentage and even the same scores in all subjects. Going by the formula almost 98,000 students in Jaipur district alone has secured first division and above marks, majority of them will contest for 7,000 seats in six constituent colleges of the RU—Maharani’s, Maharaja’s, Commerce, Rajasthan, Law I and Law II. RU’s admission coordinator, Professor SL Sharma, defending the move says that the result has made it obvious that there must be hundreds of students with the same percentage. “This is the best method to deal with the unprecedented situation. It will ensure that those with consistent performance will be selected in a situation of a tie,” said Sharma. The formula has been introduced by the RU but it is expected that other university to follow the same rule. Head of Department, Sociology, Rajasthan University, Rashmi Jain, feels that the ideal situation is to have an entrance test. “The entrance test requires time and resources which any of the institutes don’t have. The formula of age is prevalent in many national level competitive exams where a merit list has to be prepared. Secondly, both the formulas will be used only in cases we have a tie like situation not on every 7,000 seats,” said Jain. The higher education expert doesn’t seem to agree with the RU. Puneet Sharma, a higher education expert, feels that the formula is inappropriate which is based on past performance. “The formula may not cause any problem in the premier institutions where the cut-off is 90% and above. What about the average cut-off in average colleges which revolves around 60%-80%? My assessment says that off 98.88 who have scored 60% and above score, around 80% of them have scored in 60%-80% marks,” said Sharma. He added that this formula is a perfect recipe for creating mess and injustice to several students in the vast majority of colleges which fall in the average category. Experts are expecting a rise of 4%-6% in the cut off marks in most sought colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/students-age-class-10-score-key-for-admission-in-ru/articleshow/85113875.cms||---

Some leaders have taken strong offense over remarks made by Moyeen Ali Shihab Thangal, the son of party state president Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal, and have demanded action against him for publicly lashing out at Kunhalikutty. The party is also wary of the fallout if the issue is allowed to exacerbate further. According to party sources, the high power committee meeting would discuss disciplinary action against Moyeen Ali. It is also learnt that party district president Panakkad Syed Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal will hold a meeting of Panakkad family members before the organizational meeting. The Panakkad Thangal family, the first family in IUML, is much revered by party cadres, and so the party leaders find the issue particularly sensitive. Also, any disciplinary action against Moyeen Ali needs the consent of his father and party supremo, Hyderali who is currently under treatment in Kozhikode. Meanwhile, the issue related to party mouthpiece Chandrika daily took a new turn on Friday with the surfacing of a letter written by Hyderali Thangal in March, entrusting Moyeen Ali the responsibility to sort out the issues at Chandrika. Moyeen Ali, the national vice-president of MYL, had on Thursday alleged in a press conference that all financial transactions related to IUML for the past 40 years has been carried out by Kunhalikutty himself and that the Thangal family does not have the tradition of dealing with funds. The outburst by Moyeen Ali came after the Enforcement Directorate issued summons to Hyderali Thangal as part of their probe into alleged transactions of unaccounted money through Chandrika’s bank account. Hyderali Thangal was summoned in his capacity as chairman and managing director of Muslim Printing and Publishng Co Ltd, the daily’s publishers. He alleged that the organization was getting focused on one individual and even the state committee members were silent fearing Kunhalikutty. In a sign of the seriousness of the issue, Kunhalikutty rushed to Malappuram on Thursday night itself, skipping the assembly session on Friday. Senior leader E T Muhammed Basheer will reach Malappuram for the meeting on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-brass-to-meet-for-damage-control/articleshow/85113996.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Generally, hundreds of painted storks come to Delhi zoo by August 15, while the first set of storks are known to reach the capital in the first week of August.  Zoo officials said all preparations are in place to ensure that a large number of these birds — along with other migratory species — can nest on the zoo premises. Fish will also be added to the waterbodies once large numbers arrive. Delhi zoo is one of the largest nesting grounds for painted storks, with over 1,000 storks nesting through the winter. Hundreds of new storks also hatch on the zoo premises and stay there until the summer, before departing, while some continue to stay behind and make the zoo their home. A zoo official said that over 35 painted storks were recorded on the zoo premises on Friday. “Numbers should exceed 150 by next week and as the season changes, more and more arrive by the end of August,” said an official. The waterbodies at the zoo act as an open nesting ground for these painted storks, with signages and boards installed around the periphery, informing visitors about these migratory birds and other species, which arrive at the zoo every winter. “Unlike our other birds which are in cages, these migratory birds roam freely around the zoo, but are considered a key part of the zoo each year. Visitors particularly come at this time of the year to see them nesting in large numbers,” said an official. Ramesh Pandey, director of Delhi zoo, said, “The first few painted storks have already arrived and we will see great numbers in the next couple of weeks.” The zoo reopened for visitors from August 1 and has been operating in two shifts of four hours each. While the morning shift runs from 8am to 12pm, the afternoon shift operates from 1pm to 5pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/winged-guests-start-arriving-for-annual-break/articleshow/85113969.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The elder brother of a student who had taken a gap year as she was hoping to score above 50% in CIS so that she can be eligible for qualifying National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, said, “My younger sister appeared for the HSC board exams in 2020, in which she scored 58% marks overall. However, she failed to score 50% (in physics, chemistry and biology) and was not eligible for 2020 NEET qualification. She applied to re-appear for the board exams in 2021 in order to make sure she obtains the qualifying marks for NEET. She received her hall ticket but due to Covid the exams were cancelled. Due to this, she will remain ineligible for NEET 2021. We expect the board to either update the mark sheet like other regular students using the internal assessment method or request the state board to conduct the re-examination as soon as possible.” Priya Shinde, secretary of the Pune division of state board, said, “Under the class improvement scheme, students get two chances to appear for the exam. Since there were no exams in February-March 2021, these students would be given a chance to appear in the supplementary exams whenever they happen and then in the next regular board exams which will be held in 2022.” Mahendra Ganpule, representative of the state teachers’ body, said the CIS students have got a raw deal this year due to the cancellation of the board exams and not being eligible for assessment using the internal assessment method applied for regular students this year. “CIS scheme is for students who are unhappy with their board marks and want to improve. The students need to appear for board exams again in all the subjects that he/she had appeared for during the first attempt and not just the subjects in which they wish to improve their marks. The student gets the liberty to choose from the best performance as the final mark sheet,” Ganpule said. Dinkar Patil, chairman of the board, said, “There were 2,453 candidates this year who had applied for CIS. They will be allowed to appear for the supplementary exams, the schedule of which will be declared soon by the board.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-2000-pupils-wait-for-state-boards-word-on-class-improvement-scheme/articleshow/85113950.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Fringe areas hope Pune Municipal Corporation will rid them of unpaved roads||PUNE: Good roads for hassle-free commute after decades of rough rides is among the primary wishes of residents of the 23 villages merged in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits. In reality, it will be a struggle to provide such infrastructure for the cash-strapped civic body. A road network of around 700km would have to be built for improved traffic and transport management in these areas. The civic body would have to look for options like offering credit notes to get such works going. The public-private partnership (PPP) model would also be an alternative . Many of these areas don’t have internal roads. Some areas have roads, but they are in a pathetic condition, and connectivity to PMC areas is still poor. “After the merger, roads in the fringe areas are the responsibility of the civic body. The civic administration will construct the roads and the planning will be done accordingly,” V G Kulkarni, head of PMC’s road department, said. Non-availability of funds can be addressed with initiatives like PPP. “But, not all the newly merged areas can benefit as developers may not show interest in the projects for the least developed villages. But due to lack of funds from building permissions from villages, options like credit notes will have to be explored,” a senior PMC official said. PMC has initiated a proposal for civic areas. It has been approved by the standing committee. According to the docket of the proposal, the developers will have to make sure that they will take possession of land from private owners, if those lands are not available with PMC already, using TDR or FSI. At least 80% land should be in possession of the developers for allocation of these notes. The roads and bridges proposed to be built through this initiative located in Hadapsar, Kharadi and Mundhwa areas. “The development plan will be drafted by PMRDA. leading to complications of planning the DP road. If the road plans are done by one authority and execution is by another, it may cause coordination issues. Clarity on the roles of both PMC and PMRDA in road construction and maintenance is a must from the state government,” a senior PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fringe-areas-hope-pmc-will-rid-them-of-unpaved-roads/articleshow/85113917.cms||---

Though there has been a dip in the number of new Covid infections, the fresh cases in Nagaur, Pali, Alwar and Udaipur are a cause of concern. “In the past one week, fresh cases have been reported from the districts where earlier there were no cases. This includes Banswara, Alwar, Nagaur and Pali. Thus, we have asked the district collectors and CMHOs to be vigilant and to ensure proper contact tracing and to identify containment zones, if needed. We have found that in the fresh cases in these districts, those found positive had a travel history,” Sidharth Mahajan, secretary, medical and health told TOI. Mahajan added that in these districts, directions have also been issued to increase testing as per the requirement. “If testing in these districts was decreased due to the dip in the cases, now they can be increased if needed,” he added. Twenty persons tested positive for Covid in the state on Friday bringing its overall tally to 9,53,793. No death has been reported due to Covid. State’s overall toll stands at 8,954. Districts which reported new cases are, Jaipur (6), Udaipur (4), Nagaur (2), Sawai Madhopur (2) and one case each was reported from Alwar, Churu, Dausa, Jaisalmer, Pali and Rajsamand. The state is now left with 233 active cases. Authorities stated that Nagaur, Pali and Sawai Madhopur have started witnessing cases, thus the authorities have to be vigilant. “In these districts, since majority of the fresh cases that have been witnessed had a travel history, thus contact tracing is a must,” said an officer. “Active cases are also increasing gradually. We can’t be complacent and should continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-dept-asks-collectors-cmhos-to-start-contact-tracing-identify-containment-zones-if-needed/articleshow/85113935.cms||---

I was fascinated with the Peshwa architecture that can be seen in the city. In November 2020, I was appointed to do the interiors for a friend’s house. I wanted to give it a balance of modernity and old world charm, which is how I came up with the idea of using items from the last century and refurbishing them with the element of utility,” said Kshirsagar, the graduate from Abhinav Kala Mahavidyalaya. He purchases vintage items, such as old doors, window frames, key holders, brass and copper fittings, chairs and lamps, from markets like Juna Bazaar and Timber market in Pune, and its counterparts in different cities in Rajasthan and Gujarat. He buys them from personal collectors too. “I started off with key holders and lamps. I try to maintain the integrity of the item as much as I can. The only new things I use in the process of refurbishing are nails and screws,” he said. The artist’s inspiration for this project arises from the lack of action to preserve items that are 100 years old, or older. “In the early 1900s, lithographs of Raja Ravi Varma’s were popular among the general public and many homes had it. As fashion changed, these lithographs were discarded or just given away. Only a few items such as dinnerware and kitchen tools were passed down through generations, but even that has become a rarity now,” he said. Kshirsagar’s first project was a wall piece made from a door from the last century that is accentuated with brass figurines. Each item takes somewhere between one and three months to refurbish, depending on the visualisation, skill and labour needed to finish the item.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/artist-collects-vintage-items-turns-them-into-modern-products-decor/articleshow/85114028.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Dehradun||We’ve always been discriminated against, say Dalits in Oly star Vandana’s village||Roshnabad: About two months ago, Rahul Kumar set up a roadside eatery in Roshnabad. It was on the village thoroughfare. Then one day, a group of dominant caste men asked him to shut it down. “They said their cars couldn’t pass if a Dalit’s establishment was on the way,” Kumar, 20, told TOI on Friday. Caste schisms run deep in this village of 3,000-odd people, home to Vandana Katariya, India’s first woman to score a hat-trick at the Olympics. The houses are stacked along clear caste lines — the Dalits huddle along the Shiv Temple lane and the dominant Pals live on the opposite side of the road. Everyone mostly sticks to their side. On Wednesday, three men from dominant castes allegedly harassed Vandana’s family with casteist insults after the Indian women’s hockey team lost to Argentina in the semi-finals. While the incident shocked the nation, Dalits at Roshnabad said it wasn’t new to them. “It is not the first time we have been oppressed. We are often targeted for small things,” said Kumar. Vandana’s brother Shekhar Kataria added, “We treat everyone with respect but the dominant castes seem to hold a grudge against us. After what we went through, not one person from the upper caste in our village came to talk to us. Things could have been resolved had they tried to reach out. But they didn’t.” Dalits in the village said prevailing caste dynamics were entrenched in 2004, when industry hub Sidcul came up. “Before that, Pals were landowners and we, the workers. With Sidcul, the dominant castes had a windfall after selling off their land for industrial units and became property dealers. We remained workers, and the economic gap widened,” said a Dalit local. Mithun Kataria, 21, a daily wager, added, “Most Dalits work at Sidcul and some run small businesses. We are nowhere nearly as powerful as the dominant castes.” Those from the dominant caste TOI spoke to largely said they harbour no ill-will. “We had good relations with the Dalits in our village. We want peace,” an upper caste man who didn’t want to share his identity said. “We want a fair trial.” But while Dalits in the village said they had grown more aware about their rights over the years, those from the dominant caste saw it as a “problem”. “They have become too conscious of their caste,” said Binder Pal. “Yet, we stood by Vandana’s family and continue to do so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/weve-always-been-discriminated-against-say-dalits-in-oly-star-vandanas-village/articleshow/85111746.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Similar symptoms of seasonal flu and nCoV take a toll on mental health of kids||PUNE: The number of cases reported on a daily basis across the state may be receding, but the second wave of the pandemic has taken a toll on young children as they find it difficult to differentiate between symptoms of Covid-19 and seasonal flu. A concerned parent took to social media stating, “Corona(virus) has had some serious impact on the mental health of our children. My 12-year-old has a cold and fever and has become paranoid when she started to feel unwell but kept insisting that she was fine. Once she couldn’t hide it anymore, she started crying and saying that she is scared.” Another parent, whose 9-year-old also had flu-like symptoms and has fully recovered, said, “My daughter is prone to catching a cold during this season every year, but this time she refused to go to the doctor because she was convinced that she would have to be hospitalised. As parents, we realised that for over a year we have either been watching the news about the Covid-19 situation or talking about acquaintances, who have been infected or passed away due to the infection. It has taken a toll on our children.” Developmental psychologist Yajyoti Singh believes that parents must talk to their children and address their concerns to avoid the anxiety paradox. “The more you suppress the anxiety, the more it will bounce back. Apart from monitoring the child’s health closely, parents should also frankly discuss the coronavirus with them to de-stigmatise the disease. Especially the age group of 8 to 12 years, who are neither children nor teenagers yet, try to be adult-like and camouflage the fact that they can’t fully process information. Asking them how they feel, helping them process the information they possess and clearing their doubts will help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/similar-symptoms-of-seasonal-flu-and-ncov-take-a-toll-on-mental-health-of-kids/articleshow/85113973.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Delhi||Delhi: After rain delay, Connaught Place smog tower ready to help in pollution fight||NEW DELHI: The anti-smog tower in Connaught Place is complete and expected to be inaugurated by August 15.  However, a two-year pilot study to check its effectiveness will commence from August 12 with both IIT Delhi and Bombay testing its efficacy in bringing down PM 2.5 and PM 10, an official said. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), which is overseeing the work, said the structure was ready, however, delays to begin testing occurred due to rains in the past two weeks, leading to waterlogging around the smog tower and its access road. Testing is now set to commence around August 12, with initial data to be analysed by DPCC before a monthly report is released. DPCC said the project duration was set at two years and 10 months, with 10 months fixed to set up the tower. Following this, a pilot study was to begin, which would analyse the effectiveness of the tower. “IIT Bombay carried out a preliminary testing, but this was all done in the lab. The actual on-ground testing and data will only be produced from next week. All components have been assembled and the smog tower is ready to function,” said a DPCC official. The pilot study aims to determine how the tower will perform under different atmospheric conditions and times of the year, DPCC said. “We will be able to determine how big its radius is and how much reduction is occurring every hour in terms of PM 2.5 and PM 10. There will be a concrete data, which will be analysed monthly,” said an official. The tower, which is slated to be over 20-metres in height, was approved at a cost of Rs 20 crore by Delhi Cabinet in October last year to improve the air quality in a radius of around 1km, the official said. It is being built in collaboration with IIT Bombay and University of Minnesota. Last month, a second smog tower – funded by the Centre and built by Tata Projects in collaboration with the University of Minnesota — was also inaugurated and is expected to become operational around the same time. The Anand Vihar smog tower stands at a height of 25 metres and has been built using Adaptive Clean Air Network (ACAN) technology, which can influence an area of 1 sqkm, the official said. Tata Projects said the total air flow through ACAN was estimated to be 960 m3/s, with a system filtration efficiency of 90%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-rain-delay-cp-smog-tower-ready-to-help-in-pollution-fight/articleshow/85114073.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Delhi||DDMA seeks intense testing for Covid-19 to avoid surge||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority asked civic authorities to undertake aggressive and targeted surveillance and testing for Covid-19 and address any trends of a coronavirus surge. Experts at Friday’s DDMA meeting asked the health department to undertake an advanced sero survey that considers extended epidemiological dimensions in order to identify susceptible pools and augment the genome sequencing efforts to establish ways of prioritising Covid vaccination. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal chaired the DDMA meeting to review the Covid situation in Delhi and the city’s preparedness for the coming months. Also present were chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain and minister Kailash Gahlot, the chief secretary, Niti Aayog’s Dr VK Paul, Delhi police commissioner, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and professor Balram Bhargava of ICMR. It was suggested at the meeting that the comfort provided by the current controlled situation should be utilised for undertaking an advanced serological survey that takes into account extended epidemiological dimensions so as to identify susceptible pools and augment the genome sequencing efforts with the aim of prioritising vaccination for different groups. “The health department has been advised to plan an advanced sero survey with extended epidemiological dimensions,” said a government official. The experts appreciated the efforts undertaken to achieve and maintain the current Covid status under which the overall positivity rate has consistently remained below 0.1% for a very long time following the peak of a resurgent wave towards the third week of April. DDMA stressed upon continued vigil and caution because when the Covid situation remains under control for a long time there are chances that the district authorities will become complacent and let slip the rigidity of the vigil. Any laxity in vigil and caution could trigger a surge in infection. The experts suggested that all steps relating to preparedness for any probable surge of infections, in terms of hospital infrastructure and oxygen and drugs availability, should be put in place and operationalised by August-end. DDMA also reiterated the need for continuing testing, treating and tracking strategy and ensuring constant vigil and strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour. During a recent review of the pandemic situation in the city, the health department was asked to ensure commissioning of all PSA oxygen plants, liquid medical oxygen storage tanks and cryogenic bottling plants latest by August 31 and make provisions for adequate buffer of medicines for treating Covid and black fungus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddma-seeks-intense-testing-to-avoid-surge/articleshow/85116244.cms||AlokKNMishra

The ATM kiosk did not have any security guard. According to preliminary probe, the suspects entered the ATM centre covering their face and cut the wires attached to the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera. The ATM was uprooted in 10 minutes and loaded into an SUV. When contacted, superintendent of police Rakesh Kalasagar said, “The crime appears to be the work of professional gang. We have got some clues and are working on them. In an attempt to zero down on the suspects, police teams have reached out to the outposts on the highways of state borders and efforts are on to crack the case.” Kalasagar said earlier this week he had held a meeting with representatives of several banks and asked them to get the vulnerable ATMs manned by security guards, but nothing was done on this front. An officer privy to the probe said the modus operandi of the theft is no different from that have been committed in different parts of the state by gangs suspected to be hailing from Harayana. Police said due to their knowledge of handling and disassembling of ATMs, the suspects easily open the machine and take the cash. Later, the machine parts are dumped as scrap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/atm-containing-rs-43l-uprooted-by-burglars/articleshow/85109580.cms||Mohammed Akhef

This will be used for the payment for the procurement of coir through coirfed, for procurement of coir products through coir corporation, income support scheme and production incentive. Speaking while distributing the welfare and development schemes in the sector at a function in Chungom in Alappuzha on Friday, Rajeev said that an agreement for Rs 120 core has been made with the local bodies regarding laying coir geo textiles. This will be linked to MGNREGA scheme, he said. The minister also inaugurated the welfare pension for two months given by the government through Coir workers welfare board. The government provided for Rs 24.48 crore for this. The pension of Rs 3,200 for the months of July and August are being distributed using this. Around 76,500 workers will get the benefit of this pension, he said. The minister also said that following the second lockdown, the members of the Coir workers welfare fund board were being distributed an aid of Rs 1,000 each. Already 40,000 workers have got this fund, he said. The usage of the coconut husk produced in the state has risen to 18%. Currently 35% of the coconut fibre we require is being produced here itself. Efforts are being taken to increase this to 45%, the minister said. The coir production, which was only 7,000 tonnes in 2015-16, has increased to 25,000 tonnes, he said. This will reach 30,000 tonnes in the future, he said. Later in the day, the minister flagged off the first Casnub bogie built at the Autokast in Cherthala, a public sector company. It is part of the five bogies built for the Northern Railway. The bogies were sent to the Central Railway workshop in Amritsar. Autokast is the first public sector undertaking to build Casnub bogies for the Railways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-to-spend-rs-53cr-in-coir-sector-min/articleshow/85114141.cms||---

Of these, two were rescued on Friday. The animals have been shifted to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. The department said it received complaints about nilgais moving on the road for the past few days that may get injured by vehicles. These nilgais were rescued from the area near IGI Airport, on the link road with Dwarka Expressway. “As there was an open space there before ongoing construction of Dwarka Expressway, many nilgais have been living in the area. However, as they strayed into the road, we feared that they may get hurt or die if they were hit by a vehicle. The rescue was done by the forest team of the west division on receiving complaints from a contractor of NHAI. No animal was found to be injured,” said an official.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-five-days-six-nilgais-rescued/articleshow/85114138.cms||---

The name means ‘a warrior princess’ in Arabic, which is what she is. “This small bundle of joy is nothing less than a warrior for us. Her mother was hospitalized with severe Covid for almost 49 days, with 22 days on an invasive ventilator. She was given every possible drug, steroid, and medication during this hospitalization. We were least hopeful for a normal baby after such heavy medication. But thanks to the doctors and the almighty, we were blessed with her,” said Jeetendra, who works as an engineer in Mumbai.Neelima was 26 weeks pregnant with her second child when she got infected with Covid-19, during the worst phase of the second wave in mid-April. It was difficult even to get a hospital bed for her at one point. Finally, she was admitted at Alexis Hospital where pulmonologist Dr Manoj Pethe and gynaecologist Dr Rashmi Shinde took charge. “Her lungs were fully white. She required tracheostomy and ventilator support. In the later phase, she suffered from several infections. Prolonged hospital stay, severe Covid pneumonia, heavy medication — everything was against the baby’s normal growth,” said Dr Pethe. “We were least hopeful about Neelima’s baby. Our focus had always been on saving the mother first. Her condition was so critical that we treated her as if she was not pregnant,” said Dr Rashmi. Neelima was admitted with 70 SPO2 and severe symptoms of Delta infection. “We don’t have the genome sequencing of this case, but the way her condition deteriorated in just 2 or 3 days was the biggest indicator that it was a Delta virus infection. She took almost a month and a half in the hospital to recover,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. In that particular phase of April-May, Delta patients with prolonged hospitalization hardly survived, he said. Finally, Neelima was discharged from hospital while still on oxygen support. Regular weekly follow-up of the baby’s growth was maintained. “As she completed 37 weeks, we performed surgical delivery. A pleasant surprise to all of us, the baby was absolutely fine with all her reflexes. Her weight obviously was a bit less, but she cried normally, stayed with her mother for four days in the hospital, and was discharged,” Dr Rashmi said.Now, the mother and baby are both doing well since almost a month. Family members have selected the name Kahira for the baby and are now preparing to have a decent naming ceremony.DEFEATING COVID BEFORE BIRTH29-yr-old woman, 26-week pregnant, had severe Covid Mother went on ventilator; doctors thought she would not surviveMother and baby fought 49-day-long battle in ICUMother was given a lot of medicines on ventilator to ensure her survivalFinally, she was saved, but doctors were sceptical about the baby’s growthLast month, the mother delivered healthy baby girl||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/warrior-girl-who-fought-covid-from-mothers-womb-is-hale-and-hearty/articleshow/85111778.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In August 2019, the state cabinet had approved allotment of a 6,480 sq ft plot in Bandra (E) on a 30-year lease to TTD, which manages Lord Venkateswara temple in AP. The land was allotted on an annual lease rent of Re1. Last year, TTD applied to government for deletion of the reservation as the land has been allotted for construction of a temple. It proposes to construct a small Tirupati Balaji Mandir, information centre, e-darshan counter and book-selling building. While government allowed deletion of reservation in public interest, BMC said it would result in substantial modification of DP-2034 and attracts provisions of Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act. The state urban development issued a notification inviting objections/suggestions to the modification of plan within 30 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/police-station-may-give-way-to-temple-in-bandra-e/articleshow/85117196.cms||Clara Lewis

The upgrading ceremony of RTI to NIRT is proposed to be conducted at the institute in virtual mode during next week. Training being one of the major functions of Rubber Board as envisaged in the Rubber Act 1947, an exclusive department for training was constituted in 1994 and a full-fledged infrastructure established in 2000 with the mandate to provide state-of-the-art technological training and develop competent human resource to the stake holders of the rubber sector in the country. Since then, the institute had been executing various activities in this line and has contributed significantly towards technology updating, quality improvement, ancillary income generation, value addition, skill development, employment generation, empowerment of weaker communities, capacity building of clusters, etc. Launching of long-duration academic programmes like degree, PG diploma and certificate courses in plant science and rubber technology disciplines in affiliation with reputed universities giving more thrust to skilling, formulation of niche programmes in collaboration with centres of excellence and professional bodies at national and international level to bring change management for self-reliance, empowerment of clusters through business development, promotion of value addition, knowledge marketing through international programmes, etc. are some of the future priorities of the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/union-govt-renames-rubber-boards-training-institute/articleshow/85114228.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Social forestry RFOs, joint director at loggerheads||Nagpur: The social forestry department (SFD) joint director SD Wadhai and the range forest officers (RFOs) in the Nagpur circle are at crossroads over the allegations of irregularities in pre-plantation operation (PPO) works in their ranges. The SFD, Nagpur circle, consists of Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara and Nagpur. The Forest Rangers Association Maharashtra (FRAM), in a memorandum to PCCF (HoFF) and PCCF (social forestry), Pune, on August 3, demanded immediate transfer of Wadhai, failing which the RFOs will go on mass leave from August 9. Based on documents, TOI, had reported on August 3 that Nagpur circle CCF P Kalyan Kumar has set up 13 separate committees to probe these irregularities. Wadhai, during his site inspection in May-June, had found several lapses in PPO works and asked DFOs concerned to take action. However, countering the allegations, FRAM has said that PPO works for roadside and block plantations for the 2021 monsoon season were done as per the estimates and were carried out between December 2020 and March 2021. The works were done as per the guidelines issued by the CCF office on February 20, 2018. “As per the mandate, the joint director should have conducted an inspection in March. From June 7 to 13, there was satisfactory rainfall and hence, plantation works were started. But Wadhai conducted a site inspection on June 8, 15 and 21, when there was growth of grass and thorny shrubs near the plantation sites due to rains. Therefore, these sites did not look clean,” FRAM said. “The joint director has dubbed all the RFOs in the SFD as corrupt and threatened to suspend them and register FIRs. It is becoming difficult to work under Wadhai,” the association added. FRAM further said that Wadhai had directed not to carry out plantation works without evaluation. In Ramtek range, the drive has been stopped without any reason. This is the right time to take up plantations, otherwise the survival rate of saplings to be planted will be poor. Reacting to the FRAM complaints, Wadhai reiterated, “I joined on April 29, so how was it possible to conduct the inspection in March? The aspect of cleaning of plantation sites has been added in PPO works in 2015, and since then many fake estimates are being prepared in this item. There is a provision of 45 man-days in it.” “Secondly, an inquiry committee has been constituted by the CCF himself after getting convinced by making site visits. If the RFOs have not done any wrong, the inquiry will give them a clean chit. Why put pressure on senior officials when the probe is still in process?” Wadhai said. The SFD joint director added, “The RFOs affiliated to FRAM should act in a democratic and constitutional way. I stand by my action. In May, I had sought a report on PPO works from all the ranges but it was not submitted. It has been submitted in July.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/social-forestry-rfos-joint-director-at-loggerheads/articleshow/85111792.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

While checking of foreigners is in full swing, those found without documents are being detained. The Red Fort and adjacent areas have been brought under a security cover. An anti-drone system would be in place in the next few days, while occupants of every house in Walled City areas like Chandni Chowk would be verified. Police have placed containers to block the view of Red Fort at certain places in view of the protesting farmers, while over 200 extra CCTV cameras have been installed. A special control room would be made to monitor the feeds, apart from C4i. On Independence Day, a seven-layered security structure would welcome visitors to the Red Fort grounds during which they would be scanned for body temperature and oxygen saturation levels. Policemen at the sole entry and exit gate would wear personal protective equipment and frisk guests in an isolation chamber. The number of visitors has been reduced to a third this year. People have been advised to arrive earlier than usual to undergo health and security checks. Face shields and masks would be mandatory. A special booth would be created for visitors to remove their masks for a facial scan. Police have appealed to visitors to stay away if they have had Covid-19 symptoms in the past two weeks. Ambulances would be on standby to take anyone with symptoms to hospital. This time, the entire Olympics contingent would be sitting while the Prime Minister gives his speech from the ramparts. Owing to the pandemic, seating arrangements and all Covid-related protocols would have to be followed. Several mock and riot drills were carried out across the city to check the reaction time of security establishments. Meanwhile, in Outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar, 11 foreigners staying illegally in the country were arrested. On August 4, a special drive to verify foreigners was launched in Chander Vihar. In all, 11 foreign nationals, including 10 from Nigeria and one from Ivory Coast, were found living without a valid passport or visa. Six were residing in Chander Vihar, one in Tilak Nagar, one in Dabri, one in Vikaspuri, one in Nawada and one was from Tamil Nadu. They have been booked under Section 14 of Foreigners Act and sent to judicial custody. In July, 14 foreigners were arrested for staying illegally. Four FIRs were registered against the landlords for providing accommodation to them without valid documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/i-day-security-cops-launch-strict-check-on-foreigners/articleshow/85114334.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Expedite all Rem black marketing cases, HC to trial courts||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday directed all trial courts to dispose of cases related to black marketing of Remdesivir, used for treating critically ill Covid patients, on merit as expeditiously as possible. “We are issuing these directives with the hope that expression “as expeditiously as possible” would not be misunderstood as granting infinite time in the matter. The directives have been passed afresh as the time limit set earlier by this court has seen its expiry long back,” said a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor. While disposing of suo motu application regarding delay in completing trials related to Remdesivir black marketing cases, the bench relied upon probe report filed by sessions judge and affidavit filed by amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, who clarified that the presiding officers had no role in the delay, but it was caused due to variety of factors. “Overall, upon consideration of sessions judge report, Roznamas of all the cases, and also the amicus’s affidavit, we find that no blame could be placed on the shoulders of any of the presiding officers in conduct of trials,” said the judges. “No doubt, Maharashtra government complied with the directives issued by HC in appointing a special prosecutor (Jyoti Vajani) without delay. But, such a prompt step did not prove to be effective in the face of various challenges that arose and dealt with by the presiding officer, some of which were narrated earlier,” they added. On June 22, the HC had expressed anguish over the delay in trials and ordered a “fact-finding” probe against former and current sessions judges, presiding over them. On Friday, the justices said after going through the sessions judge’s report and also copies of the daily order-sheets, they found that there were several factors which contributed to the delay in disposal of several cases which were committed quite promptly by the judicial magistrates to the concerned judges. “One of the factors indicated that HC order was challenged by some accused before the Supreme Court.

Chandra said there were regular complaints from commuters, mostly office-goers, who were frustrated waiting at bus stops for 30-45 minutes during peak hours, especially during monsoon. Chandra has directed 26,000 BEST drivers, conductors, bus inspectors and senior officers to strictly maintain a frequency of “maximum 15 minutes”. In case of violation, there could be a review and also departmental action, if the reason is not genuine. Barring incidents like massive traffic snarls or natural disasters, like floods, BEST drivers will have to ply buses at intervals of three to 15 minutes. Chandra said a lot of planning will go in rationalisation of bus routes, depot management, deployment of buses through live tracking from the control room at Wadala, expedite all repairs and maintenance to ensure maximum fleet on road and make it a practice not to have buses back to back (arriving almost same time at a stop) on any route. Bus inspectors will also be equipped with gadgets to inform the control room of crowds at any bus stop, said an official. Chandra said he is also looking at introducing dedicated bus lanes for Mumbai after liaising with other agencies like BMC, traffic police and RTO. Transport expert Ashok Datar said: “There should be a dedicated corridor for buses along the Western Express Highway which witnesses huge jams and delays bus journeys in the suburbs.” Experts from the Mumbai Mobility Forum plan to meet Chandra and propose special lanes at Haji Ali and from Sion to Priyadarshini, and a kerb side bus lane from Haji Ali to Kandivli via the sea link.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/from-sept-max-15-min-bus-service-frequency-in-mumbai-best/articleshow/85117215.cms||Somit Sen
---||Delhi||Delhi: 4 smugglers held with Rs 50 crore drugs||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested four people on charges of drug trafficking and seized 12kgs of heroin worth Rs 50 crore in the international market. The smugglers had allegedly created a secret cavity under the footrest of their truck to hide the packets of drugs. The truck and several mobile handsets used by the accused have been seized. According to DCP (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav, the arrested men have been identified as Mohammad Abdur Razzak and Mohammad Idrish Ali from Manipur, Sachin from Delhi and Shehnawaj from Bareilly. Razzak is the head of the syndicate and was from Manipur’s Thoubal. Many members of the cartel are at large and raids are being conducted to nab them. The accused have also allegedly told the police how heroin is being pumped into North-Eastern states of the country from Myanmar, taking advantage of the porosity of the international borderline. “The main supplier in Manipur would collect the raw material to prepare heroin from hilly areas from the border area along with some militancy-affected parts of Manipur around Saikul and Thoubal. Opium is cultivated illegally in those parts, which was processed into a pure form of heroin at makeshift labs and transported to different parts of India,” DCP Yadav said. For the last 3-4 years, the cartel was transporting big consignments of heroin to Bareilly from Manipur for further distribution in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other parts of the country. The syndicate was finally busted after a team from the northern range, comprising ACP Jasbir Singh and others, received information regarding the cartel that operated on the route and ferried drugs using trucks. On Thursday, cops received information about the movement of one such truck at Rajapuri and laid a trap. Two suspects were arrested with 10kgs of heroin. Two others, including the kingpin Razzak, were arrested in north Delhi on another tip-off. Shahnawaj told the police that he would travel in his truck to hilly areas of Manipur and Assam, especially Guwahati, to procure heroin from Razzak and his men. Meanwhile, Razzak confessed that he had established links with drug suppliers in Myanmar, illegal producers of opium in Manipur and drug peddlers operating in UP and Delhi and organised his inter-state drug cartel. He used to receive huge consignments of crude heroin from Myanmar. As border areas are not fenced and dense forest exists along the borderline, so the suppliers from Manipur easily crossed the border and entered Myanmar to procure crude heroin from suppliers. The cops also explained that the crude heroin of Myanmar is of superior quality and cheaper than the heroin manufactured in India. That is why the Myanmar-produced drug is in high demand internationally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-smugglers-held-with-rs-50cr-drugs/articleshow/85116346.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 2 held for fraud related to delivery of food & liquor||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police have arrested two men for allegedly duping people on the pretext of delivering food, sweets, liquor and other items on behalf of renowned supply chains. The arrested men have been identified as 24-year-old Tarif Khan and Taufiq (22), both residents of Bharat Pur in Rajasthan.  A new Maruti Brezza, four mobile phones, 28 SIM cards and Rs 16,000 cash has been recovered from them. The two had set up a business and bought a JCB with the stolen money in Telangana, police said. Police had received a complaint from a man who said he was cheated out of Rs 82,500. The complainant was looking for a service that delivered food packets for a retirement programme in his office and had contacted a mobile number on the internet, promising home delivery from a renowned sweet shop. The complainant was sent a barcode by one of the accused posing as an employee of the sweet shop for advance payment of the order. However, on scanning it, Rs 82,500 were deducted from his account in four different transactions. Deputy commissioner of police (North) Anto Alphonse said that technical analysis found that the money was transferred into bank accounts in Punhana, Mewat. “Technical investigation revealed that fake mobile numbers from Odisha were used in the crime, showing locations at Mewat in Haryana, Bharatpur in Rajasthan and Khamman in Telangana. The mobile number on which victim had called was registered and uploaded on several renowned websites for home delivery of liquor in Maharashtra and Karnataka,” the DCP said. The numbers were kept on surveillance and both the men were arrested. Earlier, the accused used to cheat through online exchange of e-commerce products but during lockdown, they came to know that people were looking for liquor as shops were closed. They uploaded mobile numbers on various websites for home delivery of liquor and food items and cheated people, the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-held-for-fraud-related-to-delivery-of-food-liquor/articleshow/85116389.cms||---

FTAP said it would wait and see if the authorities relax restrictions in fresh orders. The protests will resume on Monday if the status quo is maintained. “On Friday, we met the mayor who assured us that he will take our demands to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who we hope will address the issue on Saturday,” FTAP secretary Mahendra Pitaliya said. Traders want the current deadline of 4pm to be pushed by three hours. “Nobody goes to non-essential shops before 11am, while essential shops do business from 7 am,” FTAP president Fatehchand Ranka said. Manoj Sarda, president of Pune Wholesale Hosiery Readymade Garments Association, said crowd control will not be a problem. “Crowds will have to be dealt with in the days leading to Diwali when people do festive shopping,” he said. On Friday, around 200 retailers and mall employees gathered outside Amanora mall in protest. Per Shopping Centres Association of India, the curbs have cost the sector Rs15,000 crore and affected 80% of the jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-hit-pause-on-protest-for-the-weekend/articleshow/85117203.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

In Nagpur, the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC) laboratory already has the facility to test for Zika virus. On Wednesday, Dhruv Pathology and Molecular Diagnostic Lab in city has also started testing samples and became the first and only private lab to test samples for Zika virus. Experts told TOI that more labs may come in future if needed. “Labs having infrastructure for RT-PCR test for Covid-19 can conduct the Zika test if supplied with the testing kits through the NIV. More labs may start if state detects more cases of Zika,” said Dr Meena Mishra, Professor and Head of the Department, Microbiology, AIIMS, Nagpur. “We have these testing kits and have already tested a few samples from city. The relief factor is that all of them tested negative,” said Dr Shailendra Mundhada, director of Dhruv lab. IGGMCH is also testing samples for Zika virus on regular basis. A senior official from the microbiology department of IGGMC told TOI that divisional health authorities hand over samples to the lab if they test negative for both dengue and chikungunia. Aedes aegypti, a mosquito that transmits dengue and chikungunya viruses also transmits Zika virus. The RT-PCR test is the standard test for the detection of Zika virus too. After a three-member central team visited Pune earlier this week, Maharashtra has decided to start testing every negative dengue/chikungunya sample for the virus. According to officials, testing was anyway going on but only select samples with travel history to Zika affected regions used to be sent for testing in labs. Now onwards, testing will be conducted locally at six labs in Maharashtra. IGGMCs lab will cater not only 11 districts of Vidarbha but also almost half of Marathwada too. NO NEED TO PANIC Zika is a moderate disease All samples tested negative till date in Vidarbha 80% patients do not get any symptoms 20% have moderate flu-like symptoms One can recover by drinking enough water, taking rest Having a simple paracetamol tablet also works in most cases||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-gets-second-lab-to-test-zika-more-to-come/articleshow/85111902.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Aurangabad||Don’t act on revised select list till Aug 12: HC to MPSC||CLEARED SKHER Aurangabad: The Bombay high court has issued directives to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission to not to act on the revised selection list till August 12. Division bench of Justice Sadhana Jadhav and Justice Surendra Tavade has scheduled the next hearing of a petition for August 12 citing that ‘It would be necessary to grant time to the additional government pleader to take proper instructions.’ It was after the Supreme Court quashed and set aside the Maratha (SEBC) reservation, Maharashtra government took a policy decision to allow the Maratha candidates to avail benefit of EWS (economic weaker sections) category candidates vide Government resolution dated December 23, 2020 and May 31, 2021. The government retrospectively allowed SEBC candidates to change their category to EWS category by making it applicable to the pending selection process where appointment orders were not issued. Some EWS category candidates, who were selected earlier from the category for posts in recruitment process held by MPSC and other departments, were unhappy. Some of these candidates moved to the HC and challenged the decision. Senior counsel Rajendra Deshmukh and lawyer Sayyed Tauseef Yaseen contested that the state government’s move had a direct impact on the prospects of the EWS category candidates, who were selected earlier from the category for different posts being filled either through MPSC or for revenue department’s post of talathi, posts in Maharashta State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd as well as Maharashtra state education board departments. The said policy decision of the government giving retrospective benefits of EWS category to SEBC candidates and revised list was challenged before the principal seat of the Bombay High Court by filing writ petition on ground that rule of the games once played cannot be changed subsequently, the said decision is arbitrary and in complete violation of article 14 of the Constitution of India. Lawyer Sayyed told TOI, “The matters were heard before principal seat at Bombay on August 5, wherein the HC stayed to the revised list published by MPSC in accordance with the new policy decision of the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dont-act-on-revised-select-list-till-aug-12-hc-to-mpsc/articleshow/85109770.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||BJP VP slams city cops over gangrape, suicide cases||Nagpur: BJP vice-president Chitra Wagh came down heavily on Nagpur police, alleging inaction over two recent crime-related incidents. Wagh said reports of gangrape of a girl and a suicide following alleged physical assault by police clearly show that crime situation in the city is grim. Wagh said, “We met with city police commissioner over these issues. Since it’s a matter of investigation, we did not probe him on how they are proceeding, but it’s shocking that such incidents have occurred.” She said the gangrape case of the girl, after being picked up from a busy square, is shocking. “I visited Mayo Hospital square today and it’s clear that the area is extremely busy. The girl was picked up from this spot and gangraped. Then she was brought back to the same spot, picked up again, and subjected to the same ordeal,” she said. “That entire area is under CCTV surveillance, so how is it possible that no one from the police noticed? Isn’t the purpose of having CCTVs to prevent such incidents? Also, the FIR was registered two days late and two of the accused are still absconding,” said Wagh. The BJP leader also visited the family of Mahesh Raut, who ended his life. She said the family claimed that the man took this step after being assaulted by cops. Wagh said, “Raut had called the police control room for a legitimate reason. Later, he either did not or could not pick up the cops’ phone. For this, Raut was assaulted in front of his neighbours and humiliated. His family claims that this was the reason for Raut to end his life. But we have been told that he did so because of some domestic reasons.” Wagh said in both cases, police did not show the urgency which was required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-vp-slams-city-cops-over-gangrape-suicide-cases/articleshow/85111946.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Aurangabad||Cannot charge, try for MCOCA without substantive crime: HC||CLEARED SKHER Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has quashed and set aside the orders of the Special MCOCA court at Aurangabad stating that mere charging and trying for the offence punishable under sections of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) without any substantive crime is ‘not sufficient’. The special MCOCA court in December 2016 had convicted 12 people and slapped them with 12 years of imprisonment. It had also imposed Rs 5 lakh fine on each of them. The order was challenged before the HC, where Justice Mangesh Patil ruled, “Merely being involved in several crimes without being involved in any other crime to elevate the continuing unlawful activity to the case of organized crime as defined under section 2 (1) (e) [for organized crime], would not be sufficient.” The gang led by one Darasingh alias Maruti Viklya Bhosale on the night of January 16, 2001 committed an armed dacoity at a hamlet of sugar cane cutters in Kothewadi of Pathardi in Parbhani district and even gang raped four women. Following the incident, 17 accused were arrested and tried for criminal conspiracy, gang rape, molestation and dacoity and sentenced to imprisonment in June 2005. A couple of years after the conviction in the case, Parbhani police moved a proposal with slapping of stringent sections of MCOCA against the accused already convicted for the crime. The charge sheet in MCOCA was filed in July 2007. After the trial before the MCOCA special court at Aurangabad, special Judge SS Gosavi in December 2016 convicted 12 accused and sentenced them. Representing the convicts, lawyer Nilesh Ghanekar specifically pointed out that ‘even though the appellants have been involved in several crimes, they have been duly tried for all those crimes and irrespective of the decisions in those cases, all these previous crimes have been used to merely demonstrate as to how they have been engaged in continuing unlawful activity as defined under MCOCA.’ Justice Patil set aside the MCOCA special court’s conviction order while ruling that ‘the appellants could not have been convicted and sentence only for the offence punishable under Section 3(1)(ii) and 3(4) in the absence of any substantive crime so as to constitute an organized crime’ and stated that special court has not considered all these aspects and has convicted and sentenced the appellants merely for being involved in continuing unlawful activity which in itself is not an offence which is made punishable under the MCOC Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cannot-charge-try-for-mcoca-without-substantive-crime-hc/articleshow/85109804.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||CM: Finish sewerage links on time, ensure 24x7 water supply||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting on Friday to review the action plan for Delhi Jal Board projects, including 24x7 water supply, 100% water pipeline connectivity, extending sewerage services and cleaning the Yamuna. The CM directed the officials to make sure that the 100% sewerage connectivity project is completed within the stipulated timeline. He said, “Officers should have a complete understanding of the on-ground reality and what we can deliver. We will not make any false promises to the people. While improving infrastructure, we need to ensure that we supply water 24x7 to the households.” A government official said that several projects are being undertaken to clean the wastewater and drains flowing into the Yamuna. “Agencies have taken up in-situ treatment of wastewater and quality improvement of ‘effluent parameters’ of existing Sewage Treatment Plants STPs. The plants’ capacities are being augmented by installation of additional aeration systems and other measures,” the official said. During the review meeting, the status of piped water supply in unauthorised colonies and pilot project areas was also discussed. Government officials claim that out of 1,799 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, a water pipeline network has been laid in 1,633 colonies and piped water supply has been released in 1,573 colonies. “The supply is yet to be notified in 60 colonies. The balance number of uncovered colonies is 166,” an official said. The pilot projects for 24x7 water supply are being undertaken in Malviya Nagar, Nangloi and Mehrauli-Vasant Vihar. “These cater to 12% of the Delhi population. The projects will be completed by March 31, 2022,” the official said. An additional 11% population will be covered under 24x7 projects being taken up under the command of the Chandrawal Water Treatment Plan. A DJB official stated that notification for sewerage connectivity to 55 colonies has been recently issued. “Twelve colonies in Badli were commissioned and the notification in the process increased the number of colonies from 561 to 573,” the official stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-finish-sewerage-links-on-time-ensure-24x7-water-supply/articleshow/85114367.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Caste violence rises in Uttarakhand; it’s awareness, says DGP||DEHRADUN: Eating beside dominant caste men and entering a flour mill where upper caste men were present have killed dalits in Uttarakhand. The Vandana Katariya case, in which the Olympic hockey star’s family allegedly faced casteist abuse, is the latest in what has been a series of such caste atrocities in the hill state over the past few years. Latest National Crime Records Bureau data showcases registered against caste-based crimes rose an alarming 45% in one year, from 58 in 2018 to 84 in 2019, the fifth-highest increase in the country and much more than the national average of 7%. Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar attributed it to “awareness”. “Caste crimes have not increased. Reporting has, because of rising awareness,” he said. But sociologists differ. Rajputs and Brahmins together make up 60% of the state’s population, while Dalits constitute about 19%. The dynamics have, consequently, always skewed in favour of the dominant castes. The state’s first organised Dalit movement was the Tamta Sudhar Sabha in 1905 — it later became the Kumaon Shilpkar Sabha in 1913 — a representative of the Shilpkar caste, who were not allowed to enter temples and kept out of the Army and police. They started the Dola Palki Andolan, or the palanquin movement, in 1923, seeking the right to use horses and palanquins — finally granted after 18 years. “It is evident that caste plays an important role in the socio-political space of Uttarakhand. Every political party keeps an eye on caste math. At the societal level, there is a high degree of caste consciousness,” said Dr Ravi Bhushan Pandey, a professor of sociology at DAV PG College in Dehradun.  Naveen Prakash Nautiyal, a retired sociology professor from the Garhwal University added, “Caste-based identification is quite prevalent still. The Vandana Katariya case showed that caste-based violence is not restricted to economically weaker sections.” Days ago, a Dalit girl at Latau village in Dehradun was allegedly asked to wash dirty utensils by dominant caste men, who said it was “their job”. “When they found out my sister had filed a complaint with the SDM, some upper caste men came to our farm and destroyed our crops,” said Arvind Kumar, the girl’s brother. There have been a spate of such cases over the past few years. In 2019, a Dalit man, 23, died after he was allegedly beaten up by dominant caste men because he ate before them at a wedding reception. In 2016, a Dalit man, 35, from Bageshwar was beheaded for using a flour mill before upper caste men and making it “impure”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/are-caste-atrocities-going-up-in-ukhand/articleshow/85111961.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The accused had claimed the child had been repeatedly walking into his house and disturbing him while he was reading a spiritual book. “The sole testimony of the victim is not cogent, trustworthy and is under the influence of the mother. In examination in chief, the victim deposed that she had reported the incident to her sister and the sister told her mother,” the court said. The court said it is common that a mother will quarrel with a neighbour when her child is scolded for playing. “It is not surprising that children play in buildings and senior citizens get disturbed. The touch was from a distance. It was therefore not seen that it was with a sexual intent. In my view the evidence is not inspiring confidence. The cross-examination of the victim shows due to the quarrel, the mother told her to tell like this,” the court said on Thursday. It further said the child was bound to cry if removed from a house. It was the prosecution’s case that on November, 18, 2018, around 5.30pm, the girl went out to play with her friends. Half an hour later, two of her friends informed her mother that the neighbouring “baba” (grandfather) had done something bad to her daughter. The mother then went and brought her daughter home and inquired with her. The girl disclosed that while playing hide and seek, she went to hide in the house of the accused. She said the accused was sitting on the chair and reading a book. The child alleged the accused then sexually assaulted her. The child and her mother deposed in court. Referring to the child’s testimony, the court said, “The cross-examination of the victim shows the mother fought with the accused. The victim deposed when the quarrel took place, my mother told me to tell like this to the police. Thus, the circumstances show the complainant had fought prior to lodging a complaint. Thereafter, on instructions of the mother, the child gave a statement to the police,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-no-sex-abuse-senior-wanted-kid-to-leave-home-in-mumbai/articleshow/85117228.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The forest department is also taking action under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act. TOI had reported about the matter on August 6. A forest official said, “After we received a complaint, our staff inspected the site and found that some trees had been damaged in the trenching process. We have issued a restraining order to PWD on Friday and action is being taken in the matter.” PWD officials did not respond to the queries of TOI. Verhaen Khanna, founder of New Delhi Nature Society, who had lodged a complaint with the forest department in the matter, said, “When I revisited the site on Thursday, I found that the trenching work was still underway and alerted the forest department.” Khanna had initially lodged the complaint on the helpline number of the forest department that roots of some trees were cut for trenching work, which is being done by the PWD workers on both sides of the road on Bhairon Marg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restraining-order-on-pwd-for-damaging-trees-in-lutyens/articleshow/85114402.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Residents in war of words over ownership of Tughlaq-era tomb||NEW DELHI: Accusations and counter-accusations are being exchanged over the Lal Gumbad, a Tughlaq-era structure in the neighbourhood of south Delhi’s Panchsheel Park. The residents of the abutting Sadhna Enclave allege that a family is encroaching on the complex, while the claimed co-owner of the land insists the plot has been a property of the family for many decades and they had only now cleared it of garbage. Land near Lal Gumbad, a Tughlaq-era tomb in Malviya Nagar which was awarded one Bigha by a Delhi court in November to a private ownership who are now doing construction work on the surface on Monday. (Photo: Tarun Rawat)Land near Lal Gumbad, a Tughlaq-era tomb in Malviya Nagar was awarded one Bigha by a Delhi court in November to private ownership. (Photo: Tarun Rawat)Also known as Rakabwala Gumbad, or the tomb of iron rings, the red sandstone structure was built in 1397 as the tomb of the 14th century Sufi saint, Sheikh Kabir-ud-din Auliya, a disciple of Shaikh Raushan Chirag-i-Delhi. The domed structure, despite being a protected monument, is, the local residents claim, “a hub of anti-social activities”. However, the residents of Sadhna Enclave are now more concerned about the structure itself.  While a Delhi court decreed in November last year that the plot of land measuring 1 bigha 13 biswas had been in the possession of the Jain family since 1978, the residents claim steel fencing has been put up around the land and construction activities are under way in violation of the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1951, which prohibits anyone, including the owner or occupier of a protected area, from constructing anything within the protected area or carrying on mining, quarrying, excavating, blasting or any operation there without the permission of the central government. The hubbub began in June when garbage was removed from the complex and bricks were laid, leading the Sadhna Enclave RWA to believe this was the first step in erecting a permanent structure on the Lal Gumbad complex. Sudhir Gupta, RWA president, claimed, “Our colony shares a common wall with the plot on which Lal Gumbad and its cluster monuments stand. We are very concerned that the integrity of the historical structure is being compromised because the ground is being flattened after a fence was put up around it. Trees are also being chopped down and clearly construction work has begun in violation of laws.” While Gupta added that a JJ colony had sprung up in the area adjoining the Lal Gumbad, Sunil Jain, co-owner of the land, rebutted all charges of encroachment. He told TOI, “The land has belonged to our family for several decades and we only cleaned up the rubble and the garbage there. In fact, I am creating vegetable patches on the land.” He claimed that the Ancient and Historical Monuments Act permitted crop cultivation in protected areas. As for the RWA’s allegations of fence erection and tree felling, Jain maintained, “No tree has been harmed and the fence has been there for many years. If we hadn’t put up the fence for security, the slum colony would have encroached on our land.” Speaking to TOI, an Archaeological Survey of India official said, “We have received complaints related to the Lal Gumbad and the allegations of construction on the complex. We will start an inquiry into the matter soon.”  In response, Jain said that he would “fully cooperate with the authorities” in the probe because “we are not doing anything illegal”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/residents-in-war-of-words-over-ownership-of-tughlaq-era-tomb/articleshow/85116487.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Rajkot||Second phase of Ring Road-2 to ease Rajkot’s traffic woes||RAJKOT: Second phase of Ring Road-2 from Kalavad Road to Gondal Road will be inaugurated on Sunday, giving a major respite from frustrating traffic snarls. This 11.2 km two-lane road with three overbridges has been constructed at a cost of Rs 26 crore. Chief minister Vijay Rupani will dedicate this road virtually on Sunday. This road will ease the traffic burden on 150 feet Ring Road where traffic jams are an order of the day during morning and evening peak hours. The second portion will be useful for traffic coming from Gondal and going towards Jamangar, Morbi and Kutch. Moreover, the daily traffic of Shapar-Veraval industrial area and Metoda GIDC will be diverted on this road. An overbridge is under construction at Gondal Crossroads which will be useful in diverting the traffic at this junction.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 76-year-old priest gets life term for raping two minors||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has awarded life term to a 76-year-old temple priest for raping two minor girls, noting that he did not even care for the faith attached to his office as a priest and desecrated the place of worship where the children should have had a safe space. Additional chief metropolitan Magistrate Vijeta Singh Rawat observed that the 76-year-old man committed offences upon children within the sacred precincts of a temple and that the court would also be failing in its duty if such a predator is set free. “No remorse was expressed at any stage of the trial. In the facts and circumstances of this case, if leniency is shown, this court would be letting down the children who have fought all odds to pursue the matter. These survivors have been scarred for the future,” the judge said, while sentencing the convict Vishwa Bandhu. The judge also stressed that such habitual sexual predators cannot be trusted as the convict also desecrated the temple where the children should have had a carefree and safe time. Bandhu was convicted of the offence in February this year. The court in its July 16 order also quoted from famous poet Maya Angelou’s book I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and said that it captures the pathos created when the dignity of a defenceless child victim is violated by an adult through his violent act of contempt. “Then there was the pain. A breaking and entering when even the senses are torn apart. The act of rape on an eight-year-old body is a matter of the needle giving because the camel can't. The child gives, because the body can, and the mind of the violator cannot,” the court cited the passage.  It ruled out any scope for the priest’s reformation as extremely vulnerable victims were preyed upon by him despite his old age. “Considering that minor children aged about 7 and 9 years had been repeatedly raped by the convict irrefragably speaks volumes about the depravity and proclivity in the mindset of the convict, which is an aggravating circumstance,” the order stated. The court sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for life and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for rape, with Rs 10, 000 fine for criminal intimidation. The judge also granted Rs 7.5 lakh as compensation to each of the victims to secure their emotional and mental health and ensure that they have unhindered education equipping them for a safer future.

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: 595 yet untraced after jumping parole, furlough||AURANGABAD: As many as 595 prisoners, who were among tens of hundreds granted parole and furlough from different prisons in Maharashtra in the past three decades, have failed to return to the jails. Most of the absconders are convicts facing life terms in serious offences like murder, dacoity and rape. The absence of photos of the prisoners who have jumped parole and furlough is proving to be a major challenge for the police. In each case, an independent offence has been registered with the respective police stations, but the state police have been unable to zero down on these absconders. Last month, the state prison department submitted a comprehensive data about the absconding inmates, updated till April this year, to the state home department as well as to the director general of police’s office. Additional director general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh told TOI, “Police are exploring all available legal resources as well as options to nab these prisoners. Though the absence of photos of a large number of absconders is a challenge, police have started initiating action through respective tehsildars or appropriate authorities against those who stood guarantee for these prisoners.” A total of 333 inmates have jumped parole while 262 have jumped furlough from the 14 central, district as well as open prisons of Maharashtra. Authorities said the list of absconders does not include inmates who have been granted emergency parole due to the pandemic. The emergency parole of those released during the pandemic period has been automatically extended. Nagpur central prison has recorded 120 absconding inmates, Amravati central prison 126, Morshi open prison just one, Yerwada central prison 108, Kolhapur central prison 44, Yerawada open prison two, Aurangabad central prison 61, Nashik Road central prison 113, Paithan open prison 17, Dhule district prison two, Mumbai central prison three, Thane central prison two, Ratnagiri special prison two and Gadchiroli central prison one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/595-jail-inmates-who-jumped-parole-furlough-in-state-still-untraced/articleshow/85109866.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Vadodara||Brother of Godhra train carnage convict nabbed||VADODARA: The crime branch sleuths on Friday nabbed Ayub Zarda and one more man from Godhra for producing fake solvency certificates at Vadodara central jail. Ayub is brother of 2002 Godhra train carnage convict Salim Zarda who is lodged in the jail. The police said that two more persons involved in the fraud are yet to be nabbed. “We arrested Ayub and Kanti Vasava while Iqbal Belim and Aslam Chuchla are yet to be arrested. Ayub had produced the fake solvency certificates in the name of Vasava and Belim, and the duo knew about the fraud. Aslam had prepared the fake certificates,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime). The Vadodara central jail officials had filed a complaint against Ayub at Raopura police station on Tuesday after they learnt that he furnished forged solvency certificates. The Gujarat high court had given a 21-day parole to Salim and ordered him to deposit Rs one lakh and two solvency certificates of Rs one lakh each in June. Ayub went to the Vadodara central jail on June 30 and produced two solvency certificates of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 15 lakh. When the jail officials asked him to show the Aadhar card of the persons whose solvency certificates he had produced, Ayub told them that the cards were deposited at the jail’s gate. He told them he will get the identity cards but never returned. The jail officials grew suspicious as the solvency certificates were of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 15 lakh against the required amount of Rs one lakh. They got the solvency certificates verified from the mamlatdar’s office in Godhra and learnt that the documents were fake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/brother-of-godhra-train-carnage-convict-nabbed/articleshow/85115000.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vaccine crisis: Kolkata Municipal Corporation Covishield centres to stay shut indefinitely||KOLKATA: Non-availability of vaccines is forcing the KMC health department to keep its 102 Covishield clinics and 50 Covishield mega centres shut indefinitely. A zero stock at the Ballygunge depot had compelled the civic brass to shut its 102 Covishield clinics and 50 mega centres on Friday. Vaccination in Kolkata dropped to around 24,000 on Friday, which is less than half of its average vaccination numbers over the last week. Struggling to cope with an acute dearth of Covishield vaccines, the KMC on Friday sent a special requisition to the state health department to send vaccines vials at the earliest so that the civic body could reopen its Covishield clinics and mega centres. According to state health department, a consignment of 3.5 lakh doses of Covishield is expected to arrive on Saturday. Another 6 lakh doses of Covaxin is also expected to reach Bengal on Saturday. As per the state data, there were 15 lakh doses on Friday, out of which 8 lakh were Covaxin and the rest Covishield. Bengal received 1.7 lakh Covaxin on August 1 and 3.7 lakh Covishield on August 3. “We are hoping to receive fresh stock by Sunday afternoon. If we manage to receive a fresh supply of Covishield vaccines we have requisitioned for, we shall reopen all our clinics and mega centres accordingly. Otherwise, the citizens’ wait for the Covishield doses may get longer,” said a KMC health department official. However, KMC continued to administer Covaxin doses from its 38 clinics and Roxy Cinema building. “We have administered around 13,000 Covaxin doses from our clinics on Friday,” a KMC health department official said. Before the KMC decided to shut the Covishield clinics on Thursday, each of the civic body’s 102 clinics was administering 200 doses (on an average) daily for the past two weeks. Besides, the mega centres were administering over 400 doses every day. A section of KMC officials associated with the vaccination process conceded that the ‘forced closure’ of the Covishield clinics and mega centres would result in a huge backlog of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-crisis-kmc-covishield-centres-to-stay-shut-indefinitely/articleshow/85112025.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Pay 50% of fees in 3 weeks, or students may face ouster: HC to defaulter parents||Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court on Friday asked defaulting parents to pay up 50% of their outstanding school fees in the next three weeks or risk strong action when it takes up the matter again on September 2. Non-payment can lead to students being de-rostered from online or physical classes and even their removal from the school rolls. The HC has asked the schools to inform parents within a week on their dues since March 2020, based on the court’s last October’s order, directing schools to accept 80% of the tuition fees due to the ongoing pandemic. A division bench of Justice I P Mukerji and Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya said: “Within three weeks, at least 50% of the claimed amount should be paid, irrespective of any dispute with regard to the claim of the school. Any dispute regarding the claimed amount is to be resolved later.” The HC also said if the parents failed to pay till the time it hears the case again, it will consider three options: permit the schools to suspend the instruction to the students in all forms, online and physical; remove the name of the students from the roll of the school without further notice; for those students who have taken the school final or higher secondary examination and qualified, a direction is to be made to the respective Boards to suspend their qualification and certificates till the fees are paid. The bench said: “We are sad and annoyed to know that although the economic situation is much better now than in 2020 and that most people have learnt how to adjust their lives to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, quite a significant number of parents and guardians of the students of various schools and other teaching institutions have taken advantage of this order by not paying the school fees at all.” The court said if it took into account the total amount of unpaid school fees, it will run into several crores of rupees. The HC said it had been told that several defaulting parents “are government servants who have suffered no loss of pay during this pandemic.” The court was also told that several “parents and guardians have the ability to pay the school fees but are deliberately not paying the dues of the teaching institutions.” The HC said: “there is need to balance the need of the teaching institutions against the need of the students. The innocent students, we feel, should not be made to suffer for their errant parents and guardians. At the same time, the economic loss of the teaching institutions should also not be ignored.” The schools are “finding it very hard to maintain themselves.” They have to pay their staff, incur expenses for maintenance of infrastructure and also incur other expenses to keep the institution functional. “We expect that reason will prevail with the defaulting parents and guardians,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pay-50-of-fees-in-3-weeks-or-students-may-face-ouster-hc-to-defaulter-parents/articleshow/85112001.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Delhi||HC notice on firm not paying claim amount after death in Covid||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has sought responses of Delhi government and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on a plea by a woman and her two minor children challenging an insurance firm’s decision not to pay the entire insured amount on her husband’s death after contracting Covid-19. Justice Rekha Palli issued a notice to Delhi government, IRDA, National Insurance Company Ltd and Fortis Hospital at Shalimar Bagh, where the woman’s husband died during treatment last year. The court asked the authorities to file their replies within four weeks and listed the matter on December 12. The plea filed by Delhi resident Sunita Goel and her two children said her husband held a mediclaim policy, Parivar Mediclaim Policy, of the insurance company and the sum insured was Rs 5 lakh. The petition, filed through Anupam Dwivedi, said the woman’s husband, Gulshan Kumar Goel, contracted Covid in the last week of June 2020 and was hospitalised days later on June 30 at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, and he expired on July 7, 2020. The hospital raised a bill of Rs 5.33 lakh, which was paid by the woman as the insurance company committed a breach of policy terms and escaped from its liabilities of paying the hospital expenses to the extent of the sum insured, the plea claimed, adding that the hospital later refunded Rs 1.95 lakh on grounds that it was charged extra. It added that later, the firm only reimbursed Rs 1.31 lakh to her on grounds that according to the rates fixed by the government, the total bill amount should have been Rs 1.44 lakh. The petitioners have also sought a compensation of Rs 25 lakh from the insurance company and the hospital. The family has sought a direction to the insurance firm to reimburse the hospital bill amount, or as an alternative, the hospital be asked to return the money to her. The plea further sought to direct IRDA to take strict action against the insurance firm for violating its guidelines, framed for insurers to include the expense incurred on hospitalisation and treatment of Covid-19 patients, and to ensure its compliance.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Panel accepts ex-CP plea, adjourns proceedings||MUMBAI: The one-man commission of inquiry led by Justice K U Chandiwal that is probing allegations levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against then home minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday adjourned the proceedings to August 18 following a writ petition filed by Singh in high court against the panel’s inquiry. The commission was expected to record the statement of Singh on Friday, followed by the statements of Deshmukh, his then private secretary Sanjeev Palande, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze and ACP Raju Bhujbal. Singh’s lawyer Sanjay Jain submitted before the commission that since the former police chief had moved high court challenging continuation of the commission and the matter would be taken up in the week commencing August 9, the ongoing proceedings should be adjourned. The commission accepted the plea. Deshmukh’s lawyer Anita Castellino opposed Singh’s application for adjournment on the grounds that no copy of the writ petition had been served, the commission had a time-bound schedule of six months and there was no stay on the proceedings from any competent forum. Palande’s advocate Ninad Naik contended Singh was trying to dodge cross-examination. He said Singh had to face prosecution in other cases at different police stations and he was avoiding the consequences of those FIRs. The commission declined to comment on Naik’s contention. However, it pointed out that Singh or his advocate was required to provide a copy of the writ petition to other parties in the proceedings within 48 hours. In his March 20 letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Param Bir Singh had alleged that Anil Deshmukh had set Waze a target to collect Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners in Mumbai. Following the letter, while Deshmukh stepped down as minister, a commission of inquiry was set up on March 30 to probe the allegations. Singh had objected to the proceedings on the ground that the issues raised by the commission were already adjudicated by the high court and the Supreme Court, and as such nothing survives. Justice Chandiwal had rejected Singh’s plea, saying the CBI probe and the probe under a Commission of Inquiry Act are different issues and that no court has observed that the ongoing probe is uncalled for. Justice Chandiwal in his order had said, “No astrologer is required to verify a dividing line between the object under the commission of inquiry act and investigation under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code for penal consequences. The commission has a basic purpose to assist the state government to determine further course of action in such matter of public importance...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-panel-accepts-ex-cp-plea-adjourns-proceedings/articleshow/85117235.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Kolkata||No stock issues, jab drive on at pvt hosps||Kolkata: Even as administration of Covishield remained suspended across some government hospitals and several civic centres remained shut in Kolkata on Friday, it was a picture of contrast at private hospitals that administered around 200-300 doses each on an average, a vast majority of which were Covishield. Unlike the government stock that has apparently dipped, most private hospitals are left with enough to last 2-3 weeks more and many have deferred new requisitions. Peerless Hospital, for instance, is planning its next requisition in mid-August and the volume of doses to be sought could be a small one. “We still have 7,000 doses in stock and since the number of recipients has dropped sharply since mid-July, we won’t need a large consignment. The number of recipients has dropped to 300 from 500-plus. We will still apply to make sure we have enough when the 18-45 age group return for their second dose in September-October,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. AMRI Hospitals has 20,000 Covishield doses in stock and has decided to wait till August 15 to decide on the next requisition. The hospital is now administering 1,000 doses daily across its three centres. “Consumption has gone down over the last two weeks, so we will wait and watch. In case there is a spurt in recipients due to the shutting down of government CVCs, we might seek another 50,000 doses. Or else, 20,000 would be enough for us,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. At Belle Vue Clinic, too, number of vaccinations has dipped to 150-200 a day from more than 400 till a couple of weeks ago. It has left the hospital with enough to stock to last the whole of August and possibly even longer, according to vaccination nodal officer at Belle Vue Suranjan Ghosh. “We are now planning to requisition for the September-October period when the rush for second dose could peak,” said Ghosh. Charnock Hospital had initially planned to administer 1 lakh doses but scaled it down after demand dropped. “We are administering 200-350 doses daily but have enough to carry on for some weeks,” said managing director Prashant Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-stock-issues-jab-drive-on-at-pvt-hosps/articleshow/85112040.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Besides, the health department of the CBD is spreading awareness among residents of the town about the precautionary measures that need to been taken to control the menace of mosquitoes. With the onset of monsoon, viral diseases have started spreading in the city. Though the CBD had taken up various preventive measures like cleaning various parts of the town, collecting discarded tyres, etc. during the pre-monsoon period, the cloudy weather and frequent drizzles have led to the rise in water-borne diseases. Over the past few weeks, there has been a significant rise in dengue and chikungunya cases in the city as well as the district. Many patients are visiting the CBD dispensary seeking treatment for water-borne diseases. Taking serious note of the same, the health department has taken up the task of sanitation and spreading awareness among citizens. Under the guidance of CEO Ajay Kumar and deputy CEO Sanjay Sonawane, medicines are sprayed in the morning hours and fogging is being done in the evening on a daily basis. The spraying activity is taken up in areas such as Hadola, Saha Chawl, Sanjay Gandhi Nagar, Sonewadi, Shigve Bahula , Charanwadi, old and new Station Wadi, Vijay Nagar, Dagad Chawl, Lam Road, Om Shanti Nagar, Rest Camp Road and Cantonment Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cbd-boosts-fogging-to-keep-dengue-chikungunya-at-bay/articleshow/85109970.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The petition alleged that the Centre has not followed the directions issued by the apex court on police reforms case by appointing Asthana just four days before his retirement. “It is submitted that the post of Commissioner of Police in Delhi is akin to the post of DGP of a State and he is the head of the police force for the NCT of Delhi and therefore, the directions concerning the appointment to the post of DGP passed by this court in the Prakash Singh case had to be followed by the central government while making the impugned appointment. However, the same have been given a complete go-by,” the petition said. Referring to alleged violation of SC guidelines, the petition said Asthana did not have a minimum residual tenure of six months and no UPSC panel was formed for appointment of Delhi Police Commissioner and the criteria of having a minimum tenure of two years has been ignored. “That the high-powered committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and Leader of Opposition, in its meeting held on May 24, rejected the central government’s attempt to appoint the same IPS officer as the CBI Director on the basis of the six-month rule as laid down in Prakash Singh case, his appointment to the post of Commissioner of Police, Delhi must be set aside on the same principle,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bhushan-moves-apex-court-against-asthanas-appointment-as-top-cop/articleshow/85114533.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Fuel stations in city may run dry after tanker strike||Kolkata: A fuel crisis in the city seemed imminent with a stir by oil tankers disrupting the supply line from Mourigram depot of Indian Oil Corporation. The tankers are protesting against a downward fare revision and disbanding of 70 tankers. The supply from Mourigram caters to central and north Kolkata and the northern suburbs, Howrah, parts of Hooghly and North 24 Parganas. The stalemate continued at a meeting between the tankers’ association and IOC on Friday with the oil marketing company seeking seven days to resolve the issues. The tankers’ association has refused to withdraw the strike. “IOC has informed the state on the supply situation in the wake of the strike. On Friday, IOC officials met the transporters’ body in Howrah and requested them withdraw the strike. But they refused to suspend the strike unless a tender that had been floated was cancelled,” an IOC spokesperson said. Though fuel stations in Kolkata still have stocks, some stations in Howrah and Hooghly went dry. IOC has stepped up supply from Budge Budge, Halia and Durgapur depots to bridge the demand-supply gap. “If the strike continues, Kolkata will get affected. Some fuel stations may dry up in a couple of days,” said West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association vice-president Snehasish Bhowmik. In its statement, IOC said: “On August 5, a section of petroleum transporters went on a flash strike at Howrah terminal by putting up blockade. The agitation was reportedly started after IOC floated a tender of transportation of petrol/diesel from Howrah terminal by tankers.” According to the tankers’ association, IOC has abruptly cut 70 tankers from the list of its supply line and reduced the fare from Rs 2,800 to 2,100. “This move will result in a massive livelihood loss of more than 2,000 people,” said West Bengal Tankers’ Association general secretary Ajit Kumar Das. “We have told IOC that we can continue the supply with the old fare and made an appeal not to cut off 70 tankers from the list,” he added. Currently, 196 tankers supply fuel to retail outlets from the depot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fuel-stations-in-city-may-run-dry-after-tanker-strike/articleshow/85112062.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Civil Surgeon Ashok Thorat on Friday said the patients’ inflow has gone down following the drop in the positivity rate in the rural parts of the district. The administration has, however, decided to keep the entire staff strength at the hospital's Covid wing intact to be prepared for any further wave of the pandemic. Thorat said with the decline in the number of cases, the administration has instructed the medical officers of various rural hospitals across the district to send the critical Covid people to the civil hospital. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) website records revealed that there were 8,185 Covid beds in 186 hospitals under the civic body. These beds include the 200 at the Covid wing of the civil hospital. Of the total beds in the hospitals, only 446 are currently occupied. Covid cases started steadily declining in the city from mid-May. Of the 24 dedicated Covid health centres that were set up in the rural parts of the district, only 10 are treating the people infected with the virus and the rest have started admitting non-Covid patients. When the pandemic was at its peak in the district during end-April, there were over 28,000 active patients in the city limits and over 17,000 in the rural belts. These patients were either admitted to hospitals or in home quarantine then. As on August 5, the district has 1,421 active patients. So far, 4,03,117 patients have been infected with Covid-19 in the district. As many as 3,93,516 Covid patients have so far recovered and 8,528 succumbed to the contagion. Senior officials of the Nashik civil hospital said the cases began to subside all over the district after mid May. Since then, the infection rate has been under control and the district health machinery is taking preventive measures to ensure people contracting the infection are immediately brought under treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/20-covid-beds-at-nashik-civil-hosp-occupied/articleshow/85110013.cms||Santosh Sonawane

This is as good as putting conditions on the court to take up his bail application,” said a bench of Justices Prasanna Varale and Nitin Borkar. His wife Sabina filed a petition for police protection and to quash an FIR against her by Lakdawala’s daughter-in-law.  On July 28, HC directed Arthur Road prison to arrange for him to inform his children’s advocate Asadali Mazgaonwala if he is willing to opt for mediation to amicably settle disputes with Sabina. “His bail application is pending and if he is released on bail, he will be in a position to explore mediation,” said Mazgaonwala.

Recently, Haryana government turned down the request of further extension to two HCS officials, who have already completed three years of deputation in the Chandigarh administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/major-departmental-reshuffle-chd-gets-news-aeo/articleshow/85112120.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Post-jab fever not risky for pregnant women, says Docs||Mumbai: Fear of fever is one of the biggest reasons behind vaccine hesitancy of expecting mothers, said gynaecologist Nikhil Datar, and explained why post-immunisation fever is not risky for them. “There is a crucial message that we need to spread. The fever after immunisation is the body’s immune response and largely harmless. They shouldn’t confuse it with the fever one gets after an infection,” said Datar. The fear is more among women in the third trimester, said Goregaon gynaecologist Sudhir Naik. “Many getting the vaccine in the second trimester worry that the second dose would come in the third trimester. We tell them the fever would be no different from the one they suffer during regular bouts of cold and cough,” he said. Little is known about how the drive is faring in the rest of the state as districts are not keeping a count. Dr Raj Gehlot, health officer of Chandrapur, called the response “mixed”. Officials from three more districts confirmed they have not been asked to maintain data. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said CoWin does not capture pregnant women data. He added that daily reporting will not be possible from 4,000 sites. The Centre had said on July 30 2.3 lakh pregnant women had taken the vaccine across India. States leading the chart were TN (78,838), followed by AP (34,228), Odisha (29,821), MP (21,842), Kerala (18,423) and Karnataka (16,673). Since then, TN has vaccinated 1.9 lakh pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-post-jab-fever-not-risky-for-pregnant-women-says-docs/articleshow/85116596.cms||---

To control the spread of infection, public worship would be prohibited at all places of worship on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from August 9. Stalin said medical experts had unanimously batted for reopening of schools. “Experts said that staying at home for several months without going to school causes great stress among children and a large learning gap in society. They also pointed out that online classes are not available to most children,” he said. The school education department has been told to take up the preliminary work. The infectious disease has been brought under control due to the effective measures taken by collectors, corporation commissioners and police in areas where public gather. Awareness is also on the rise after state-wide programmes were launched last week. The chief minister said the health and family welfare department would release standard operating procedure for medical colleges. The students and faculty members of medical colleges have already been vaccinated as they are treated as health staff.

We will meet again,” he said. Patil said there was massive loss of human lives, agriculture crop and houses in the recent floods in the coastal Konkan region, but the financial assistance provided by the NDA government was meagre, even assistance from the NDRF is awaited. “It was quite shocking that neither the Prime Minister nor the home minister found time to visit the state for on-spot st-udy of the situation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/on-cong-foundation-day-sonia-and-rahul-to-attend-rally-in-mumbai-city/articleshow/85117265.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The plan was to be executed by August 3 midnight, which was the last day of Martyrs’ week observed by the CPI(Maoists) in Bihar and other left wing extremism affected states. Nandan Mandal, an alleged overground worker of Maoists, had made a phone call to his brother-in-law in Ghogha, Bhagalpur, on August 3 night and told him at least four times during their conversation that Maoists would blow up the Bhagalpur railway station. Knowing that his call was being intercepted, Nandan mentioned Bhagalpur station just to divert the attention of security personnel and agencies from Jamalpur railway station and a tunnel nearby in Munger, their main targets, Munger ASP (operation) Raj Kumar Raj on Friday told TOI over phone. He said the Maoists had planned to to come down from the hills to blow up the Jamalpur station and the tunnel and kidnap the RPF men guarding it. “The Bihar police Special Task Force had intercepted Nandan’s call to his brother-in-law. He was traced very soon in Munger and detained for interrogation during which he revealed the Maoist plot, which was foiled,” the ASP said. “It might have become a major issue had they succeeded. The Maoists had planned to demand ransom of several crores of rupees from the government to release the RPF men, if kidnapped. They had conducted recce and come to know that two men guard the tunnel at a time in different shifts,” he said. He said during interrogation, Nandan confessed to have ringed thrice Maoist area commander Bahadur Kora, who lives in the Kharagpur hills with armed cadres. “Bahadur would have come down from the hills with armed men to execute the plot. However, Nandan could not get connected to Bahadur and they could not reach on time. Till then security personnel traced Nandan near Amjhar hills in Munger and detained him for interrogation,” he said. Bariyarpur police station SHO Amrendra Kumar said Nandan was arrested on Thursday. A pistol, two live cartridges and Maoist letter pads were recovered on his confession from the jungles. “An FIR against Nandan, Vijay Rajak, Bahadur alias Nakul and other unknown Maoists has been registered with Bariyarpur police station for hatching a conspiracy to blow up Jamalpur railway station, a tunnel and kidnap RPF men guarding it,” the SHO said. The SHO said Vijay has already been arrested in another case in Munger in June. He said Vijay and Nandan used to meet Bahadur frequently and supply him food and other logistics. “Nandan was promised good rewards had the plan succeeded,” he said. Meanwhile, the ASP said the conspiracy was hatched in a meeting at Vijay’s house in Bariyarpur a few months back. “Vijay is also a Maoist OGW. Nandan was his right hand. There were at least four more men who had attended the meeting,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoist-plot-to-blow-up-jamalpur-rly-stn-kidnap-rpf-men-foiled/articleshow/85112147.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Dhaba gets fired at by 3 over ‘bhindi ki sabzi’||JAIPUR: Three youths in an inebriated condition fired at a refrigerator in a highway dhaba near Kotputli after the staff could not serve their favourite dinner dish - ‘bhindi ki sabzi’. Kotputli deputy SP Dinesh Kumar Yadav said, “At least a dozen youths had arrived at Sharma Dhaba located next to Kotputli powerhouse on NH-48 at 9.30pm on Thursday. The youths asked the staff to prepare ‘bhindi (okra) sabzi’. The staff replied that the dish was not on the day’s menu because the kitchen did not have the vegetable in the stock. The angry youths were affronted and let out a stream of invectives at the staff. They left with a dire warning of “dekh lenge” (we will see). Three of the youths from the group returned to the same dhaba a few hours later. Shortly after 12.30am, they fired one shot from a country-made pistol that struck the refrigerator of the eatery. The accused hurriedly snatched Rs 78,000 from the shop’s cash box following a scuffle with the staff and manager Mukesh Kumar Sharma. As per the police, the three suspects then scurried off into the culverts of Sabi river. Senior police officials, led by DSP Yadav, rushed to the place with heavily armed police teams. They laid a cordon and began searching for the accused. “All the accused were arrested and taken out from the culvert,” Yadav said. The accused have been identified as Om Prakash alias Omi (23), a resident of Nangal Panditpura in Kotputli; Vijay Gurjar (19), a resident of Mohalla Badabas near Kotputli; and Sumer Kumar alias Kalu (20), a resident of a locality behind the powerhouse in Kotputli. Police said the accused were heavily drunk and had threatened the staff that if they don’t cook 'bhindi ki sabzi', they would teach them a lesson. The Kotputli police are examining the criminal record of the accused. On Thursday, another similar firing incident had taken place in the Kotputli area when a student, suspended from his school, had fired at a teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dhaba-gets-fired-at-by-3-over-bhindi-ki-sabzi/articleshow/85114614.cms||---

The demand was raised by the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM) during a recent meeting with assistant labour commissioner Varun Benniwal. In the meeting, a Mandal delegation suggested that if any dealer closes his business, he should inform the labour department in writing and surrender his licence. They suggested an amnesty scheme and a chance of minimum six months for those who have not registered or renewed their commercial establishment under the Shop Act for any reason, without penalty or challan. They also underlined the need to make all services of the labour department available online.

Opened by district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha, the plant will expedite creation of the Sita Lake on a vast expanse of wetland, which has turned into a dumpyard along the river Saryu. Talking to TOI, Ayodhya municipal commissioner Vishal Singh, said, “A Lucknow-based private firm has bagged the contract to recycle waste from the wetland through a segregator. Organic waste, refuse-derived fuel (RDF) waste and inert waste will be separated for other use. The municipal corporation will hammer out an agreement with cement companies, which would buy RDF waste to manufacture cement.” National Green Tribunal had ordered disposal of 80,000 metric tonnes of waste accumulated on the site parallel to 14 Kos Parikrama to conserve wetlands along the Saryu. And the process has kickstarted with the opening of the waste disposal plant, said Singh. Talking to TOI, Ayodhya mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay said, “After the site is cleared of waste, we will develop it into Sita Lake, which is part of the town’s beautification project. Solid waste management coupled with a mammoth tree plantation drive is our top priority.” Sand and concrete are examples of inert waste and will be used by the municipal corporation to revamp roads, while organic waste will be ploughed into agriculture use, said the municipal commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sita-lake-site-in-ayodhya-to-be-cleared-of-80k-mt-waste/articleshow/85116614.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Police said the toll could have been higher if it wasn’t for the habit of the building residents to sit outside in the afternoons. An East Delhi Municipal Corporation spokesperson said that the building was 30 years old and new columns were being erected. “Three people were injured while a passer-by on the road below was killed,” said an official. “The road was cleared of the debris by three JCBs. The municipal corporation commissioner has directed action to be taken against the junior engineer and assistant engineer concerned if lapses are found on their part.” According to the cops, the police control room received a call around 1.30pm about the incident. “The house is owned by Dhani Ram, 65. Along with his wife, Anaro Devi, 65, and Rajkumar, 64, who was sitting near the tree, he was rescued and shifted to GTB Hospital,” said Sanjay Kumar Sain, DCP (Northeast). “The rescue operations undertaken by National Disaster Relief Force and Delhi Fire Service went on till the evening. The body of Kanti Lal, 60, was recovered from the debris and taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. A case has been registered and investigations are under way.” Dhani Ram lived in the building with his wife and two sons and their families. The fire department, NDRF and police searched for survivors and even brought sniffer dogs to locate missing persons. “There were shops on the ground floor. Four people were suspected to be buried under the debris. The body of one of them was recovered by the local residents before the arrival of the fire department. Others were rescued later,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service. Investigating officers said a wheat-mill was running on the ground floor at the time of the collapse, but most senior citizens living in the double-storied building had gathered near a tree as usual and escaped serious harm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-storey-house-collapses-in-ne-delhi-60-yr-old-dies/articleshow/85139025.cms||---

The submission on Friday by senior counsel Avtar Singh Rawat appearing for the agency came just two days after an affidavit filed by the NHAI had said that it was planning to build 21 animal passes and bridges for the passage of animals in the region. The structures would protect animals that would be affected by its road widening project as part of the 210-km-long Dehradun-Delhi expressway, it had said. NHAI had also informed that bamboo plantations would be done to funnel animals through these passes. But on Friday, the counsel presented the amended proposal which mentioned a flyover. The submission came as the division bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma was hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) highlighting the environmental impact of the project. The Centre has said the six-lane expressway would cut travel time between Delhi and Dehradun by over half — from five hours to two. Environmentalists, meanwhile, are worried about a 19.7-km section between Ganeshpur (UP) and Dehradun that goes through forests. Most of it is in UP, except the 3.4-km stretch in the eco-sensitive zone and reserve forests of Shivalik hills. The NHAI counsel presented some pictures of the region as well as a short-summary of the authority’s plans and steps it has taken following the Wildlife Institute of India’s (WII) report on the effect of the project. The bench, however, asked the counsel to present all the facts related to the impact of the project through an affidavit so that they become a part of the judicial record. The case will now be heard on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nhai-to-build-flyover-on-3-4km-stretch-of-delhi-doon-eway-that-passes-through-reserve-forest/articleshow/85110129.cms||Prashant Jha

As per the police, gun traffickers from nearby states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana, offer a wide range of illegal firearms. “A functional albeit rugged katta can cost up to Rs 12,500. But a shiny pistol with some semi-automatic features can be purchased for Rs 30,000,” an official told TOI. A common katta of a 315 bore can fire one shot at a time before it needs to be reloaded, an illegal pistol, on the other hand, can fire up to seven shots in a single round. The official added that the gun traffickers thrive on “mouth publicity,” to fetch a new clientele. Many of these firearms are used in settling old grudges, avenging a hurt, or intimidating a rival. The police said that buying cartridges for an illegal weapon is a tricky business. “There are trained gunsmiths who can replenish empty brass shells with explosive chemicals,” the official said, adding that people who have licensed firearms also smuggle out cartridges after reporting them as missing on official documents. The police officials, however, believe that some markings on the cartridges can help the investigators. “All cartridges should come with serial numbers or bar codes on the body of the cartridges’ box, just to easily trace its origin,” said superintendent of police, Kota, Vikas Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/illegal-arms-smugglers-continue-to-thrive-in-raj/articleshow/85114612.cms||---
---||Dehradun||In 9 U’khand dists, 60% of posts of child specialists lie vacant amid third wave fears||Nainital: Amid fears of a third wave of Covid-19, an RTI reply has revealed that at least 60% of posts of child specialists are lying vacant in nine districts of the state. Just last week, the Uttarakhand health department had estimated that at the peak of the third Covid-19 wave in the state, at least 60 children would likely require hospitalisation daily. In an affidavit filed in the high court, health secretary Amit Negi had said that the state would need 600 paediatric beds, with 240 of them in the ICU and 360 beds in the ward. The reply to the RTI, filed by Dehradun based Sustainable Development for Communities (SDC), also revealed that 60% of posts of gynecologists are lying vacant in nine districts in Uttarakhand while half of all specialist doctors’ positions have not been filled. In many cases, specialist doctors have been tasked with administrative duties. “Right now, we need the services of these doctors more than ever. Rather than engaging them in administrative tasks, they should be utilised in making the public sector more robust and accessible,” said Vidush Pandey, a member of the SDC. The researchers who prepared the report said the data not only shows that access to mental healthcare is a big challenge in the state -- 11 districts are without psychiatrists -- but the absence of any public health expert in as many as four districts make the planning for the impending third wave even more difficult. Haridwar – the district with the highest population – has only 45 specialist doctors against the sanctioned posts of 105. The numbers are worse in hill districts of Chamoli, Pauri, Almora and Pithoragarh where more than two-thirds of the posts of specialist doctors are vacant. While Chamoli has only 17 specialist doctors against the approved 62 posts, Pauri has 42 even though it needs over 150 doctors. In Almora only 49 doctors are working against the need for 127 and in Pithoragarh only 22 doctors are working even though the state needs 60.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-9-ukhand-dists-60-of-posts-of-child-specialists-lie-vacant-amid-third-wave-fears/articleshow/85110131.cms||Prashant Jha

Previously the fitness certificate could be obtained from anywhere in the state as long as the vehicle was registered in Rajasthan. Officials claimed that this was done to ensure that unfit vehicles do not get the certificates using untoward measures as well as maintain transparency in the system. Mahendra Soni, transport commissioner, said, “We had issued the order regarding this a while back but now changes have been made in the software thereby which the vehicle owners will not be able to download the certificate if they have not gotten the fitness test of the vehicle done from the same district where it was registered. There were incidents where people were using sources to get even unfit vehicles get the fitness certificate from the centres where they knew people but now that will not be possible anymore.” Officials claimed that there were also instances when a vehicle was not even taken to the fitness centre but declared fit and this recent initiative is a pilot project, the response of which will be analysed in couple of months. There are around 70 private fitness centres in Rajasthan which is the highest number in the country. It takes between Rs 2- Rs 4 crore to get a fitness centre running which is allowed only after a third party inspection. Due to the pandemic, the central ministry extended the validity of vehicle related documents such as driving licence (DL), registration certificate (RC), fitness certificate and permits till September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vehicle-registration-centres-can-only-issue-fitness-papers/articleshow/85114632.cms||---

High drama was witnessed when members of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) blocked the Kharar-Mohali flyover for nearly 30 minutes after the police stopped them from protesting outside a BJP office in Desumajra in Kharar. Sources said farmers, led by BKU (Lakhowal) state president Jaspal Singh Niamia and block president Gurmeet Singh Khunimajra assembled outside the complex and raised slogans against the BJP. After receiving information about farmers attempting to gherao the BJP office, DSP Gursher Singh rushed to the spot and cordoned off the area with heavy police deployment. Gursher said the police did not allow farmers to enter the BJP office and ensured maintenance of law and order. Incensed farmers blocked the Kharar highway at the flyover.

The Shahpura police of Jaipur (Rural), has identified the accused as Bishan Lal alias Vishnu (20) and Roshan Kumar (24). According to the superintendent of police, Shankar Dutt Sharma, the complainant had alleged in his FIR that he had given Rs 6 lakh to Bishan Lal to buy an owl. The complainant had hoped to sell the owl to another party for Rs 45 lakh. The money was paid to the accused on July 1. A week after taking the money, Bishan Lal claimed that the owl was dead and there was nothing that he could do. “The complainant demanded his money back, so Bishan Lal asked him to meet him near Lilka river where Bishan Lal handed over the cash to the complainant and left,” Sharma said. When the complainant began counting the cash, he found that barring a few notes of Rs 500, all other currency notes in the bag were fake, with a stamp from some toy bank. The complainant followed Bishan Lal’s car. The accused hit into the complainant’s bike to evade him and fled. The Shahpura police formed a special team to track down the gang and arrested the duo on Thursday night. According to Sharma, the police are making efforts to check if Bishan Lal had roped in other members in his gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ullu-gang-busted-2-held-for-duping-people-for-rare-owls/articleshow/85114656.cms||---
---||Dehradun||3.5 lakh displaced Bengalis welcome move to drop ‘East Pakistan’ tag from documents||Dehradun: A day after the Uttarakhand government said it would stop stamping “East Pakistan” on caste certificates issued to Bengalis who had migrated to the hill state from erstwhile East Pakistan, members of the community welcomed the move and said their decades-long struggle to “truly belong” has finally ended. For years, the 3.5 lakh-strong community has argued that the tag of “East Pakistan” on their documents has been a source of “embarrassment” while also depriving them of a “sense of belonging”. “It wasn’t just our ancestors whose certificates carried this tag, even the caste document for children like me, who were born here in India, had the stamp,” said Uttam Datta, a businessman, whose family had moved from Noakhali in erstwhile East Pakistan to Rudrapur in 1964. Datta told TOI that he was relieved that their future generations would no longer face the embarrassment he did. “It hurt me every time to look at that document,” he said. Sanjay Bachar, vice president of Bengali Kalyan Samiti, is also among those born in India, but whose certificates have an “East Pakistan” stamp. “This was a blot on our community and we are relieved the government will do away with this exercise. We have fought for this for over 20 years,” he said. Lakhs of Bengali families had migrated to Uttarakhand between 1956 and 1970, many of them from border areas of Khulna, Jessore and Faridpur. A majority was relocated in Udham Singh Nagar district. Over the past decades, they have staged frequent protests to get the stamp removed from their caste certificate — a document meant to certify that an individual belongs to a particular religion, caste and community and which is required to avail of government schemes and benefits. On Thursday, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said that the formal announcement to remove the stamp from caste certificates would be made by the state cabinet. “I’m aware of problems faced by people in my home district. It is a long pending demand. The state cabinet will soon make this announcement,” he said. Notably, Dhami's decision to drop the tag has come when Uttarakhand is scheduled to go to polls next year. The move may help BJP consolidate its base among Bengali voters, who constitute a sizeable population in Dhami's home turf of US Nagar district. Earlier, Dhami had met with Saurabh Bahuguna, BJP MLA from Sitarganj, and members of the Bengali community. “It is a shame that East Pakistan is still being mentioned in caste certificates. Neighbouring Uttar Pradesh has already stopped this practice around 15 years ago. In 2018, we had approached the then CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, but it did not bear fruits. Now CM Dhami has assured us that this change would be brought,” said Bahuguna. Two-time former legislator from Rudrapur Premanand Mahajan said that in at least five states, the displaced Bengalis had been accorded the Scheduled Caste (SC) status. “We had made a similar request in Uttarakhand. In 1988, N D Tiwari, the then chief minister of UP, agreed but the benefits of SC category were given to our children only for educational scholarships,” said Mahajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-5-lakh-displaced-bengalis-welcome-move-to-drop-east-pakistan-tag-from-documents/articleshow/85110149.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Nagpur||PM assures to resolve issues of EPS-95 pensioners||Nagpur: Raising hope for over 67 lakh pensioners, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured a delegation of National Agitation Committee (NAC) that he would look into their long pending demands and resolve them. The Buldhana-based NAC, representing Employee Pension Scheme 1995 (EPS-95) pensioners, met the PM on Thursday and submitted their list of demands. Their meeting was facilitated by Mathura MP and renowned Bollywood actress Hema Malini, who also accompanied the delegation to the PM’s office at Parliament in Delhi. Led by NAC national president Ashok Raut, the delegation apprised Modi of several problems faced by petitioners due to the meagre pension received by them. This was their second meeting with the PM on the issue. The last one was held on March 4, 2020, where the aggrieved pensioners held a detailed discussion with him, and he had assured to positively look into their issues. However, due to Covid-19 virus outbreak, nothing progressed for over a year. “As soon as we entered his office, he said he was aware of our subject discussed in the last meeting. We requested him to make an announcement of providing succour to over 67 lakh pensioners by making an announcement to hike pension during his Independence Day speech on August 15. He, however, said it couldn’t be done in haste, as there are procedures to follow, but we shouldn’t worry,” Raut told TOI. Modi then called minister of state at Prime Minister’s office Jitendra Singh, to discuss the matter in detail with the delegation and concerned ministries and remove all bottlenecks for increasing their pension. Singh then took them to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who listened to their grievances patiently, but didn’t commit anything. “We requested her to increase the government contribution in EPS-95 as done in other pension schemes like NPS. The EPS-95 pensioners in the country should be saved and their dignity be restored. We asked her how can EPS-95 pensioners survive on such a low pension?” said Raut, who was accompanied by NAC general secretary Virendra Singh Rajawat and chief advisor Pandurang Patil. EPS-95 Pensioners’ Demands * Minimum pension should be Rs7,500 with dearness allowance (DA) * Option of higher pension on actual salary as per EPFO’s March 23, 2017 letter * Providing free medical facility for all pensioners * Non EPS-95 retired employees may be included in scheme * Approve Rs5,000 monthly pension in ongoing Parliament’s monsoon session||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pm-assures-to-resolve-issues-of-eps-95-pensioners/articleshow/85110162.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: RTO to look into verification process of online cab drivers||JAIPUR: The transport department has decided to look into the verification process of the drivers who are recruited by the online cab services. The move comes after department officials received informal complaints about misbehaviour of the drivers. The cab services have been asked to give the details about the process followed to check the background of the taxi drivers within three days' time. This was initiated by senior officials of Jaipur RTO. Rakesh Sharma, RTO, Jaipur, said, “A meeting was held with the representatives of Uber after we received few complaints that the drivers had misbehaved with the passengers. These cab services have an online system where most of the times, the customers do not give explicit reason for low rating to a driver due to the apprehension of being identified. Even the cab companies mostly take the registration details of the vehicles and the licence information of the driver. We want to prevent any major mishap from happening and because of this I have asked Uber for information about the way that they check the background of the drivers in three days' time." The officials claimed that majority of the victims of misbehaviour do not given any formal complaint. But, keeping the safety of the passengers, especially women as well as children, in mind they will take up the matter with other online cab services as well. "While companies take the commission per ride, it has to be ensured that passengers are safe at any given time. The licences for the drivers are issued by the RTOs and necessary action can be taken in case there are any instances of misdemeanour. After Uber, we will ask Ola also for similar details about the background check process," added Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rto-to-look-into-verification-process-of-online-cab-drivers/articleshow/85114638.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Daily biomedical waste halves to 18 ton from May-June 2020 Covid peak||MUMBAI: With the second Covid wave ebbing, Mumbai’s biomedical waste generation has dropped by around 50% since the pandemic peak in May-June 2020. From a maximum of 36 tonnes per day, it is around 18 tonnes per day in June-July 2021. Maharashtra topped the country in biomedical waste generated daily last year, according to health ministry figures. Before Covid, around 12,000 to 14,000 kg of biomedical waste used to be generated in Mumbai every day, and all of it was incinerated in Govandi. Used syringes, bandages, amputated body parts and other human and animal bio-waste generated during medical treatment and research are categorised as biomedical waste. Doctors said since Covid treatment doesn’t involve any surgery, it should not generate much biomedical waste. The bulk of the waste consists of PPE kits, masks and gloves. Better segregation of the waste at source in hospitals has helped reduce the quantity, said officials. According to the new Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines, food leftovers from hospitals are no longer treated as biomedical waste. It is treated as part of regular solid waste. Also, many regular surgeries were pushed back due to the pandemic. Last December, the CPCB also instructed that PPE kits and masks need not be incinerated; they can be shredded, disinfected and recycled. Of the 18 tonnes of biomedical waste being generated per day, around 6 tonnes are PPE kits and masks. In Mumbai, SMS Envoclean has been appointed to collect and dispose of all biomedical waste from both public and private hospitals. The company charges Rs 100 per kg for its services. Despite the fall in waste generation, the company still has to deploy 90 vehicles since PPE kits and masks take up a lot of space. “Now the biomedical waste collection and disposal is well organised and under control. There are no heaps of bags lying at any hospital. The segregation of waste at hospitals has improved a lot. Last year, even solid waste related to Covid patients were being packed in biomedical waste bags. Once regular surgeries begin, we are expecting a slight increase,” said Amit Nilawar, who heads SMS Envoclean. Waste that contains human remains is transported in yellow bags, and red bags are used to put contaminated waste like PPEs and masks. White bags are used for sharp objects like syringes and knives. Doctors said biomedical waste means it is hazardous, so Covid doesn’t make any difference. Even HIV/AIDS patient’s waste is equally risky and has to be properly disposed of. While the CPCB has made bar codes mandatory on all biomedical waste bags, only around 10% of hospitals in Mumbai are doing so. Even BMC hospitals are not bar-coding their waste leading to delays in collection, sorting and disposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-bio-waste-halves-to-18-ton-from-may-june-20-covid-peak/articleshow/85116703.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Truck falls into 300ft gorge, teeters on rock; Kasara squad rescues 3||KALYAN: Three people were rescued after a truck they were travelling in fell into a 300-foot-deep gorge at Kasara along the Mumbai-Nashik highway around 4am on Friday. One person -- cleaner of the truck -- died on the spot. The vehicle, which was carrying cement blocks from Nashik to Mumbai, veered off the highway, dove into the gorge and was left teetering on the cusp of a rocky surface, about 100 feet below from where it had fallen into the valley. The accident took place as the brakes of the truck failed, the police quoted the truck driver as saying. A team of volunteers who have helped in many such cases was roped in to carry out the rescue. “The operation was indeed difficult,” admitted an official from Kasara police station. Nine volunteers of the private squad called ‘Disaster Management Team — Kasara’ descended into the valley which is perched between Padgha and Igatpuri. Besides mountain-scaling equipment, they carried hammers, jimmies and rods to prise open the door of the truck, said Sham Dhumal, leader of the rescue team. While the rescuers climbed down, a human chain comprising officials of the local police station and the highway police helped in the operation. It took at least three hours to extricate the three and to bring the body of the fourth person onto the highway, said Manoj More, another team member. An ambulance, which had been kept waiting, transported the rescued persons to a government hospital in Igatpuri. Driver Yogesh Padle (35) has sustained “serious” injuries while the two loaders on the truck -- Amit Kulkarni (35) and Shiva Karki (32) -- have also suffered injuries. The deceased has been identified as Gokul Bodke (31). Rescuers said that his head possibly dashed against a huge rock that jutted out of the mountainous surface. All four occupants of the vehicle are from Nashik, the police said, adding that the truck continued to remain in the ravine till Friday evening and could not be pulled out. A rescuer said that the heavy load of cement possibly kept the vehicle clinging where it was. “If not, it could have slid deeper into the valley,” said the rescue team member. While heavy rain hampered the rescue operation, the rescuers also had to brave venomous snakes lurking along the rocky path. Deputy superintendent of Thane rural police Navnath Dhamake and senior police inspector Keshav More expressed their gratitude to the rescue team of Disaster Management Team – Kasara. The volunteers, who are mostly from Kasara, are acquainted with the topography of the mountainous range. Each of them has his occupation. “Our team’s mission is to save people in that crucial time. We do not charge anything for this work,” said team leader Dhumal. “So far, we’ve saved 198 lives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-truck-falls-into-300ft-gorge-teeters-on-rock-kasara-squad-rescues-3/articleshow/85117270.cms||Pradeep Gupta

Referring to the stories, the state rights panel said, “The UHRC has taken suo motu cognizance under Section 12 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1963.” The section empowers the commission to take up cases of alleged human rights violation. “Taking note of the matter, we have asked the Haridwar SSP to investigate the case, submit a report within four weeks and inform the commission about steps taken,” UHRC member Ram Singh Meena told TOI. Meanwhile, two Twitter accounts were suspended on Friday after Katariya flagged them on her verified social media accounts. “My family and I are going through a very tough time. Thanks to everyone for (their) support. It’s a humble request to some people to not increase my troubles. I am seeing people making my fake accounts and sharing tweets from them on my behalf,” (sic) she posted on Instagram and Twitter. “I am requesting you all to report the fake accounts, (those) pretending to be me and not entertain them. Times are really tough so kindly don’t make it tougher for me and my family,” she tweeted. Katariya is the first woman hockey player from India to score a hattrick at the Olympics. Recognising her achievement, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami announced a Rs 25-lakh reward for the forward. He said, “We are extremely proud of Katariya and her significant contribution to the national side. She has brought laurels to the state and the country.” He added that the state will get a new sports policy to “help youth prepare and showcase their talent at the international level.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/toi-impact-ukhand-rights-panel-orders-probe-into-vandana-katariya-kin-caste-abuse-case/articleshow/85110192.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: KGMU’s old students failing to clear MBBS to get "two mercy attempts"||LUCKNOW: MBBS students at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) who have not been able to clear examinations for the last 8-27 years will get “two mercy attempts”. Those who fail in these two attempts will be expelled. The decision was taken by the KGMU’s executive council on Friday. Currently, there are 20 such students who have not been able to clear the course as they either failed or did not appear for the examination. The oldest among them is a student who took admission in 1994, followed by another who joined in 1997. The remaining students are from batches between 2000 and 2013. Of the total, 10 have been failing in the fourth year of MBBS for several years, while eight have not been able to clear the first year so far. Two students are stuck in second and third years. These students have been failing in subjects like surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, and paediatrics. Most students belong to backward classes or rural backgrounds and had difficulty in understanding the subjects. Some of them even alleged discrimination and lodged a complaint at the chief minister’s portal. The charge, however, was vehemently denied by KGMU which also submitted written evidence of fair play. Till 2019, KGMU had no rule on how many times a student can appear for examinations. After consulting the National Medical Commission (NMC), it was decided that every MBBS student will have to clear all examination within 10 years and only four mercy attempts will be allowed thereafter. Those who fail in all the attempts will be debarred. However, this rule was implemented from 2019 onwards and did not apply to students enrolled earlier. Later, a committee was constituted to resolve the issue. “After thorough discussion, we decided to give two mercy attempts to these students. We understand that they are weak and need extra attention. The university will provide remedial classes to clear doubts. Extra classes may also be arranged on the request of students,” said KGMU VC Lt Gen Prof Bipin Puri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmus-old-students-failing-to-clear-mbbs-to-get-2-attempts/articleshow/85116724.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held a meeting with irrigation department officials to discuss the strategy to be adopted at the board meetings apart from hearing on Krishna water issue in the Supreme Court and Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on August 9. The state government has demanded full board meetings of both Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) before the coordination committee meetings. The government expressed its inability to attend the proposed coordination committee meetings of both the boards on August 9 due to court cases. The CM asked the officials to emphasise the government’s stand at the boards’ meetings. He said the government would not go back and compromise on the state’s rightful share in river waters and farmers’ interests. The CM has also decided to hold another meeting on August 8. Previously, the tribunals had clearly stated the rights of Telangana on Nagarjuna Sagar dam, carryover of unutilised waters in a water year and also accounting of drinking water. “But the decisions and awards were not being implemented till now,” the CM said. It has been decided to stress these points at board meetings. He also discussed elaborately on previous judgments on water sharing between the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-to-raise-earlier-tribunal-decisions-at-river-board-meets/articleshow/85114676.cms||---

A division bench comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Ajay Tewari has issued the notice to the Centre after hearing an application filed by Lawyers for Human Rights International (LHRI). The applicant has sought directions to open the sealed report submitted by Punjab. “The report contained the response of the state of Punjab on the report submitted by then STF chief Harpreet Singh Sidhu, who was asked by the court to go through the report submitted by then ED assistant director Niranjan Singh. The matter relates to drug mafia operating in the state of Punjab, which has international tentacles and needs to be dealt on urgent basis since it affects the life of Punjabi youth,” the applicant has submitted. According to the applicant organisation, one of the most important issues which needs to dealt with by this court on priority basis is prosecution of drug mafia members regarding which status reports have been filed by both STF and Punjab. “The sealed reports which have been filed by Niranjan Singh and STF as well as by the state of Punjab need to be opened and considered by this court for consideration of the drug mafia which allegedly involves allegations against the present MLA Bikramjit Singh Majithia which has been initiated on the orders of the HC be taken to its logical conclusion,” the applicant NGO had submitted. During the hearing of the case, additional solicitor general of India Satya Pal Jain accepted notice on behalf of the Union government and assistant solicitor general of India Chetan Mittal accepted notice on behalf of the ED to respond the applicant’s contentions. The matter has now been adjourned for November 15 for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/drug-haul-hc-notice-to-centre-punjab-over-opening-of-sealed-reports/articleshow/85114682.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Ban in place, but Chinese manjha still in demand for Independence Day ritual||NEW DELHI: The Chinese manjha and its variants may have been banned in Delhi since 2017, but it still continues to be sold in markets around the capital. Its sales gather pace around Independence Day. Delhi Police has seized hundreds of kilograms of rolls this week from Lal Kuan Market in coordination with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India. PETA has said a majority of these raids were conducted by the police early in the week and the animal rights organisation helped the cops identify possible areas and shops where the banned glass-coated thread for kites could be up for sale. Four offenders were booked under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. “Multiple shops were identified and an undercover team of the police conducted the raids,” said a PETA official. Through a January 10, 2017 gazette notification, Delhi government had banned the sale, production, storage, supply, importation and use of all forms of manjha in the capital. The ban exists in order to prevent harm to humans, birds and other animals as well as to the environment. The notification permits flying kites only with a cotton thread free of any materials designed to increase its sharpness or strength. “We commend the action taken by Delhi Police to book the offences under stringent provisions of the law and to seize the illegal manjha. This will go a long way towards protecting the lives of humans, birds and other animals,” said Pradeep Ranjan Doley Barman, PETA India’s advocacy associate. “Most people would choose to use only plain cotton kite strings if they knew that doing so would spare fellow humans and other animals serious injuries and even death,” he added. Last August too, the police, after receiving complaints from PETA India, had seized around 100 kg of the banned manjha from shops in Chand Mohalla. Similarly, in 2019, raids were conducted in Sadar Bazar and Bara Hindu Rao in North Delhi and Madhu Vihar in East Delhi. The complaints were again filed under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which has a provision for a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh and a jail term of up to five years. Thousands of birds are killed every year after being cut or trapped by manjha. In July this year, a motorcyclist was seriously injured by the sharp manjha and another motorcyclist died in Timarpur after his neck was slashed by it in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ban-in-place-but-chinese-manjha-still-in-demand-for-i-day-ritual/articleshow/85139110.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The department will check if the landslides are connected to the recent floods that occurred in Goa. Sawant, flagging off a new fire and emergency services vehicle for Ponda region, said that the scheme Aapada Mitra will be rolled out in Goa from September. Under the central government scheme, 400 volunteers from Goa will be trained to assist the state machinery during natural disasters, like the recent floods. The state will make a provision to provide such Aapada Mitra and Aapada Sakhi volunteers with a honorarium, said Sawant. “We have signed an agreement with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). We will select 400 volunteers from Goa across the 12 talukas. They will receive 15 days’ training from fire services and Gipard. They will be trained in all services required under fire services. These volunteers will work for the next three years under the NDMA. They will only get insurance from the NDMA. But Goa government is ready to provide them with honorarium,” said Sawant. He appealed to youngsters in the state to avail this opportunity to train in emergency services and to appear in good numbers for the interviews for selection to be conducted from next month. “In Goa, we will have 400 volunteers, 200 each in North Goa and South Goa,” said director of fire and emergency services Ashok Menon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wrd-to-study-cause-of-sattari-landslides-cm/articleshow/85114661.cms||---

When TOI visited some of the eateries in the city, it saw several consumers turning away due to their poor hygiene. Sugarcane juice stalls offer the juice in attractive glasses resembling beer mugs. “The vendor dips the serving glass in a bowl of water in which he has been dipping it for hours. He neither uses soap nor replaces the water in the bowl used for washing the glass. When I asked him to clean the glass properly, he once again rinsed it in the same bowl,” said a shocked woman. She cancelled her juice and left the pushcart near the collectorate. A shop in Bibikulam selling soup to walkers did not hesitate to pour it back from a man’s tumbler to the common measuring cup when he asked to add more salt after tasting it. The shopkeeper used the same to serve the next person without washing. In small hotels such as the ones in Bibikulam one could find the server cleaning the table with one hand and collecting leftovers with the other. The waiter-cum-cleaner then hurriedly waves his hand under a tap before taking a plate from a tub of water. Simultaneously, he dips a steel tumbler into a can of drinking water. Both the plates as well as the tumblers are not washed but only dipped in a tub of water. A star hotel in the city that offers a buffet system did not have servers. “When we collected the plate from the rack, the person before me touched my plate and I touched the plate of the next consumer. Who knows who is infected,” said D Suchi, 29. Eateries justify it saying they don’t directly serve in plates but use butter paper or banana leaves on them and hence rinsing would do. They claim that they are unable to hire more workers as a cost-cutting measure due to the pandemic and the turnout of consumers is very less. In such a situation, consumers suggest use of disposable plates and paper tumblers. Madurai corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said they will ask the food safety and sanitary teams to look into the aspect of unhygienic practices in eateries. The teams that are already engaged in checking compliance with Covid-19 norms will be asked to look into these aspects. Necessary action will be taken against violators. On use of disposable cups, he said the civic body is firm on not permitting banned items such as cups with plastic coating. Those that are not banned, such as paper cups without plastic coating, can be used, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/unhygienic-practices-in-eateries-add-to-worries/articleshow/85112282.cms||---

Since July 19, as many as 395 schools have started physical classes with an addition of 171 schools in the past one week across the district. The schools are being allowed to reopen only after a village-level school committee decides so. “As many as 395 schools of the 852 schools across Nashik district have reopened. In addition, there are 14 schools that have been closed because of emergence of Covid cases either in schools or villages,” Vaishali Zankar, secondary education officer, Nashik Zilla Parishad. A village-level school committee can allow the reopening only when there is no active case in the village for at least 30 days. The schools also have to get all the infrastructure sanitised, physical distancing measures for children have to be in place and the RT-PCR tests of the teachers have been conducted. In the beginning, when the schools were allowed to start functioning by the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), the number of schools willing to reopen was 332. Of these, 208 had began functioning. The numbers rose to 224 by August 2. Then, recently, the education officer, Nashik Zilla Parishad had ordered closure of 14 schools in various talukas due to emergence of Covid cases. Five schools were closed as the teaching staff, non-teaching staff or students were found positive, while nine schools were closed because of the villages reporting fresh covid cases. As many as 12 teachers, one non-teaching staff and three students were tested positive for the infection. The schools that are now functioning have about 74,000 students on roll and the attendees are around 36,000. Parents have to give written consent to send their children to school. “The attendance is hovering around 45 to 55 percent,” the officer stated. The schools across the state have been shut since March 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. Many schools started and continue to offer online education. But there has been a growing demand about reopening of the schools at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/171-more-schools-reopen-in-nashik-distict-in-5-days/articleshow/85110204.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Reopening in sight as schools to start anti-spitting campaign||MUMBAI: In what is being seen by educational institutions as a first step towards reopening of physical classrooms, the state wants schools to begin an anti-spitting campaign and educate students too. Spitting in public places has been banned as it is viewed as one of the causes for the spread of coronavirus. A government resolution issued on August 5 gives principals the power to fine those found spitting in and around schools. Officials in the state education department are likely to reopen schools for Class V and higher classes. The fear of the third wave targeting children, though, has parents jittery. Schools began in the online mode on June 15. A month later, Class VIII to XII reopened in rural areas that had zero Covid cases. School principals told TOI there is buzz around reopening of schools for secondary students. Last November, barring Mumbai, schools had reopened for Class IX to XII. This January, schools outside Mumbai had reopened for Class V to VIII. All schools were shut by mid-March due to the second wave. Education officials in Mumbai are trying hard to reopen higher classes as a pilot project. “Students have suffered huge learning losses with no physical schools since last year. We have to start somewhere,” said an official. Parents’ consent will be mandatory for a students’ classroom presence. Teachers have been told to communicate with parents about getting children back to school. Teachers have been told to include sessions on personal hygiene and anti-spitting campaigns before the start of online classes. Schools have to put up signboards against spitting. Teachers, staff and parents found spitting can be fined Rs 200. A repeat offence can invite a penalty of up to Rs 1,200. Currently, few teachers conduct online classes from their schools. Last May, the state had made spitting an offence. In Mumbai, the police in April this year began taking action against those spitting in public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-reopening-in-sight-as-schools-to-start-anti-spitting-campaign/articleshow/85116745.cms||Sandhya Nair

Referring to Modi’s tweet that Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award was being renamed after Major Dhyan Chand following a public opinion, Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy and former MP V Hanumanth Rao demanded that the NDA government at the Centre retain the name of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for the Khel Ratna Award. Terming the renaming of the award as “cheap politics” by Modi government, Revanth said the central government could have instituted another award in the name of Dhyan Chand. In a separate statement, Hanumanth Rao said Rajiv Gandhi was known for encouraging youth, sports and games. “The prime minister could have renamed Narendra Modi stadium in Motera (Gujarat) after Major Dhyan Chand. The Modi government could have bestowed Bharat Ratna on the hockey legend,” Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-congress-flays-renaming-of-rajiv-khel-ratna-award/articleshow/85114732.cms||---

Dr PD Gandal, Nashik region’s deputy director of health, said though the supply of vaccines has increased, it is yet to reach the optimum level. “Supply of vaccines has increased steadily since the vaccination programme began on January 16, 2021. As soon as the vaccines arrive they are dispatched to the districts,” he said. Till date, the division has received 51.75 lakh doses — 42.96 lakh doses of Covishield and 8.79 lakh doses of Covaxin. Of these 50.48 lakh doses have been administered to the beneficiaries. Gandal pointed out vaccines were initially distributed as per demand and consumption, but it was soon revised to distribution based on estimated number of beneficiaries. “The practice was immediately modified due to which if the vaccine stock was unused the next consignment was supplied keeping the available doses in mind,” Gandal said. Accordingly, because of its huge population, Nashik district was the biggest beneficiary. Nashik district has so far received 18.02 lakh of vaccines, including 2.39 lakh doses of Covaxin, and 17.23 lakh doses have been administered. Similarly, Ahmednagar received 12.78 lakh doses (2.76 lakh Covaxin), Jalgaon 9.50 lakh (1.29 lakh Covaxin), Dhule 6.48 lakh (1.55 lakh Covaxin) and Nandurbar received 4.96 lakh doses (0.78 lakh Covaxin) The officer also pointed out that the capacity of the division was to administer over 1 lakh doses per day, but all depends upon the availability of the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-divn-received-most-vaccine-doses-in-july/articleshow/85110233.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Addressing a press conference, Khaunte said that chief minister Pramod Sawant is trying to fool locals ahead of the coming assembly elections. “The bill appears to have come to protect those involved in land grabbing and illegal encroachment,” said Khaunte. Showing scepticism about the government’s intentions, Khaunte demanded that the government should call for a public hearing and consider all the suggestions made. He said that the Bill lacks clarity. The former revenue minister also questioned the validity of the Goa Mineral Development Corporation Bill, 2021 which will pave the way for formation of a state-run mining corporation in Goa. “Under which provision of the MMDR Act, 1957, will the corporation be formed? Did the state government take permission from the Centre for forming a corporation?” said Khaunte. “The MMDR Act does not provide for a state to form its independent Act for mineral development.” Khaunte said that formation of a mining corporation through a law is in contravention to the MMDR Act and rules.  “The corporation is an eye-wash to resume mining activity in Goa. It is formed without application of mind as the government is not yet prepared to auction mining leases as not a single block of mining is identified yet,” said Khaunte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bhumiputra-bill-may-help-land-grabbers-encroachers-khaunte/articleshow/85114696.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Trichy||Trichy corpn forms mobile team to vaccinate pregnant women||Trichy: Trichy corporation in coordination with private clinics in the city has arranged a mobile team with dedicated health workers to vaccinate pregnant women who are hesitant to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Unlike the rural population, there is a stagnation in the city for the vaccination drive for antenatal mothers. In rural areas, pregnant women are heavily dependent on the primary health centres (PHC), and health authorities are making use of the opportunity to vaccinate them. However, in the city, expectant mothers are relying mostly on private obstetricians. The recent vaccination camps organised exclusively for them saw a poor response and even the patronage in vaccination centres continues to be low. Unlike the first wave, maternal mortality in the second wave was high. The progression of infection and symptoms among the young mothers were found rapid, a source said and added that around 65% to 70% of the maternal mortality in recent months was caused by Covid-19. Hence, the civic body has made the arrangement with obstetricians to sensitise their patients to take the jab. “Vaccinating the expecting mothers is very crucial but there is a fear among them. We are coordinating with obstetrician associations in the city to sensitise the women and vaccinate them at their respective clinics,” city health officer Dr M Yazhini said. Private clinics that have more than 10 pregnant women at a time in their centres can approach the civic body’s health section for support. The sensitisation drive is anticipated to make the expectant mothers overcome vaccine hesitancy. The civic body said that adequate vials were earmarked to sustain the mobile vaccination programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-forms-mobile-team-to-vaccinate-pregnant-women/articleshow/85112300.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Hyderabad||As forest fires rise sharply in Telangana, tigers too face the heat||HYDERABAD: Telangana has reported an increase in forest fires, particularly in Amrabad Tiger Reserve (ATR). Around 1,423 forest fires have been reported in last seven months in the tiger reserve. In the state, 12,132 forest fires were reported from November 2019 to June 2020, whereas the number has gone up to 18,237 forest fires in the last seven months. The number of forest fires varies yearly depending on various natural and anthropogenic reasons, including accumulation of combustible materials such as dry leaves and twigs, officials said. The Forest Survey of India (FSI) sends forest fire alerts to all registered users on this alert system. The number of forest fire alerts sent by the FSI during the last five fire seasons in Telangana shows an increasing trend. As per a report from the state government, ground fire was observed with no damage to existing flora and fauna, including the big cats, in ATR. The state government in its report to the Union ministry of environment and forest said: “Around 11,000 km of cattle-proof trench has been taken up throughout the state in the last five years which not only helps in protection and improvement of soil moisture, but also acts as a fire break. In case of ATR, 732 km of cattle-proof trench has been dug up.” Field officers are provided with a list of fire vulnerable forest areas obtained through spatial analysis to effectively plan fire lines and take up mitigation measures. Around 15,000 km fire lines had been completed till 2020-21 throughout the state, while 1,200 km of fire lines with five meter width had been created and maintained in the ATR. Apart from the existing base camp watchers and strike force members, additional fire watchers and 45 quick response teams were engaged in highly vulnerable areas for four months in hired vehicles for faster movement. Around 52 watch towers have been constructed at vantage points to locate and monitor forest fires throughout the state. Twelve such towers have come up in ATR alone, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-forest-fires-rise-sharply-in-t-tigers-too-face-the-heat/articleshow/85114705.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: MPT offers discounts to attract new container feeder vessels||PANAJI: In a bid to ensure continuity of the container feeder vessel, Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) has decided to grant substantial discounts to any shipping firm that starts new feeder services. To encourage immediate resumption of container vessels, MPT has waived off the vessel charges for the maiden port call for container feeder vessels. Sima Marine had announced that it had discontinued its container vessel service from MPT from August 3 due to the lack of adequate volume and other infrastructural barriers. “With this bold business decision of the port management it is announced that MSC India is contemplating putting its own vessel shortly for it’s own EXIM containers,” said chairman of MPT Rajiv Jalota. Jalota said that other feeder vessel operators have also shown interest in starting a coastal export import feeder service at MPT. Recently, Maersk Line asked its customers to stop taking container bookings from MPT after Sima Marine discontinued the feeder service. The move has had a “very negative impact” on the entire value chain of containerized trade in Goa. After trade bodies and industry stakeholders raised an alarm, MPT took up the issue with the feeder operator and container agents and Jalota assured that all possible measures would be taken to retain the container service. “Apart from the adequate volume challenge, there is also a challenge of a reliable and efficient shore crane (Harbour Mobile Crane) at MPT Goa. The port has decided to address this issue in a short time frame probably through Sagarmala Funding route or any other suitable means,” said Jalota. MPT held a meeting on Thursday where it was agreed to announce a slew of discounts for feeder vessels along with additional discounts for the next three months for container vessels during the seafood export season. Jalota said that discounts are not sustainable for the long term and the only way to ensure regular container service is by generating substantial volume of containerized cargo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mpt-offers-discounts-to-attract-new-container-feeder-vessels/articleshow/85114725.cms||---

The announcement came after a Congress meet, catching education officials unaware. Schools across nine educational board divisions opened for classes 8 to 12 from July 15. Online schools across the state had started from June 15. Sources said Gaikwad had met CM Uddhav Thackeray to discuss the reopening of schools from class 5 onwards and also about schools within municipal limits. A final decision is expected after another meeting with the CM next week. Education officers said the worry is parents’ unwillingness to send children to classrooms. Data from schools that reopened in July show only 10% students attended offline classes across rural Maharashtra. In the Mumbai division, 24 schools in Thane district and 108 schools in Palghar districts reopened in July. Only 0.3% students in Thane and 2% in Palghar attended . In Mumbai district, no school has reopened since last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-classes-5-8-may-restart-from-aug-16-in-covid-free-villages/articleshow/85116778.cms||Sandhya Nair

Laying the foundation stone of various developmental works for 12 villages in Yeola taluka worth Rs 10.27 crore, Bhujbal asked the officials to refrain from delaying the developmental works under any circumstances. “The developmental works that have been sanctioned and allotted funds should be carried out within the stipulated time. The authorities should personally look into the execution of these works and ensure they are completed without any delay,” he said. Nashik zilla parishad president Balasaheb Kshirsagar and other office-bearers were present during laying of the foundation stone. The guardian minister said the developmental works had taken a beating in the recent past due to financial problems, but slowly things have started moving now. The government aims to carry out development work against all odds, be it Covid, floods or anything else. “The works are gradually picking pace. Henceforth Covid will not be an excuse for delaying any developmental works,” said Bhujbal, adding while doing the work no one should compromise on Covid appropriate behaviour.Bhujbal also appealed to the people to get vaccinated and protect themselves against Covid along with following all preventive measures even if they are fully vaccinated. The works to be carried out include setting up of water filter, construction of a bridge over the river, concreting of roads, development in localities housing the scheduled caste population in various villages, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-wants-all-development-work-to-be-on-fast-track/articleshow/85110294.cms||---

The roads connecting the villages to the market places have been damaged to a large extent making it difficult for people to carry out their activities related to agriculture and in case people require medical help. “The roads have given away to the rain. The same is with Javulke Vani – Materewadi road in Dindori taluka. It looks like water ponds constructed in the road,” said Sanjay Chaudhary, a resident of Dindori taluka of the district. “The rain has not been as severe like last year. It has just rained for some time and the condition of the roads has depleted. At sections, they do not exist,” said Asif Patel, a businessman. The situation is similar in Niphad taluka. While the road connecting Ojhar and Chandori is under construction, the authorities have failed to maintain the rest of the part. “It is difficult to mark out the existence of the road at some places. The two-wheeler riders have to risk their lives while travelling on these roads. The authorities of the Public Works Department (PWD) are turning a blind eye towards our basic demands of motorable roads,” said Sagar Ahire, a resident of Niphad taluka. “The places where the rain has taken a break and areas are dry, the repair works will be carried out immediately,” assured a senior PWD official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/intermittent-rainfall-damages-roads-in-rural-parts-of-nashik-motorists-fume/articleshow/85110261.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Erosion of hill slopes intensifying landslides||KERI: Instability of hill slopes due to erosion and sudden down movement of rain water containing debris material are among the causes of the recent massive landslide at Satre in Sattari taluka, experts say. The landslide occurred in the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary, on the left of the Chandsurya Ghat, going from Satre to Parwad. The landslide started from the top of the hill and a part of the loose material, along with huge boulders and pebbles moved away, forming a channel. Though the area where the landslides took place is far from human settlement, forest clearance undertaken in the past for slash and burn agriculture in Satre as well as in Chikhale and Parwad of Karnataka have intensified landslide instances. A wildlifer who visited the area recently, Vitthal Shelke, told TOI, “ Due to torrential rain, the huge boulders lying on the hill slopes have undergone chemical weathering, thereby accounting for movement of slurry soil and loose rocks down the slope.” Keri resident Gajanan Shetye said that due to the landslide a large quantum of sediment, along with rainwater, is moving into the Kalasa nullah, which eventually empties in to the Mhadei river at Uste. Apart from this, there is also the immense ecological damage. “The landslide has been responsible for uprooting a large number of trees as well as vegetation thereby causing environmental loss,” Vithoba Gawde said. Nandkumar Kamat, a scientist associated with the Goa State Biodiversity Board said, “Full aerial surveillance and mapping using drones as well as ground truthing by a joint team of officials from the forest department and the water resources department (WRD), using the help of local stakeholders must be undertaken.” He said there is also a need for full mapping of the mud flow. “The forest department must undertake contour binding, slope stabilisation measures and tree plantation to stabilise eroded hill slope while WRD must build temporary check dams and sediment traps to stop mud flow entering the main river channel.” Further, he said that officials must also investigate the matter on the Karnataka side, above Satrem village, to ascertain the extent of deforestation, soil erosion and sediment flow in Goa through streams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/erosion-of-hill-slopes-intensifying-landslides/articleshow/85114754.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

According to the ministry of civil aviation, the revenue had reduced from Rs 36 crore in April-June 2019 to Rs 10.6 crore during April-June 2021. Minister of state for civil aviation VK Singh said: “Before the Covid-19 pandemic, India was one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world. Domestic air passenger throughput (total footfalls at airports from domestic flights) grew by 21.5% in 2016-17, 18.3% in 2017-18 and 13.1% in 2018-19. Thereafter, domestic throughput fell by 61.7% in 2020-21 due to the pandemic.” The minister said the domestic air passenger market was expected to double over the next few years if the impact of the pandemic comes down. About 75% of AAI-operated airports were incurring losses, the government said. The number of domestic passengers had reduced from 128 lakh in January 2020 to 77 lakhs in January 2021 and from 124 lakh in February 2020 to 78 lakh in February 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/airports-in-andhra-suffered-26-cr-loss/articleshow/85114756.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar made the observation while adjourning a bunch of petitions filed on behalf of activists Mahesh Raut, Anand Teltumbde, Surendra Gadling and Sudhir Dhawale opposing the special NIA court approving the Taloja prison authorities’ request for transferring 10 accused in the case, all male, to other prisons across the state and the actions of former Taloja prison superintendent. The petitioners said that the activists, arrested for alleged Maoist links, were not heard before the court order was passed. The HC said both sides need to be heard in the matter and adjourned to next Wednesday after public prosecutor Aruna Pai sought time till next Wednesday. When advocate Vijay Hiremath for Raut began by saying that his client has been transferred from Taloja to Mumbai Central prison, but is yet to be shifted, Pai sought time and the bench said, “All the time accused are complaining in Taloja jail, then why do you want to stay there?” The HC, in an oral dialogue with the lawyers, said, “Throughout the allegation is that jail authorities are not taking proper care, not giving basic facilities, there are not good conditions, there is overcrowding…Covid. Now when they (prison authorities] want to transfer some of them...this challenge is raised. It is all very confusing,” the bench said, smiling. Hiremath said that since Raut has not been shifted yet, there may be a stay granted on the transfer till next date. The bench asked advocate R Sathyanarayanan, who appeared in the petition filed by Teltumbde’s wife Rama and two others, “Is it the case that once they are taken out they cannot be brought back to the prison?” Sathyanarayanan smiled. The HC bench said, “The public prosecutor wants time; we will have to give it. Will pass orders after hearing both sides.” When Hiremath again requested for a stay, the bench said, “If you insist more, we will reject your prayer today itself.” The former Taloja prison superintendent had said that through their lawyers and family members, the accused were making “false complaints” to put pressure on the jail administration. On April 1, special NIA Judge D E Kothalikar allowed the transfer request, though the order is yet to be implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/elgar-case-accused-opposing-jail-transfer-order-paradoxical-in-mumbai-court/articleshow/85117305.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Lucknow||Covid-apt steps a casualty at OPDs of Lucknow hospitals||LUCKNOW: Government-aided hospitals in the city are unable to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour at their outpatient door (OPD) facilities, a TOI reality check found on Friday. The negligence poses a threat to patients at a time when the third wave of pandemic is looming large. TimesViewPeople have started wearing masks, but social distancing has not yet become an integral part of their ‘new normal’. Both must be followed for protection. Extra care is required in hospital OPDs because probability of transmission is higher at these places as people suffering from various ailments come in contact with each other. Any illness reduces immunity and makes one vulnerable to infection. Transmission becomes easy if anyone in the crowd is Covid-19 positive.In the last two days, 18 patients who visited Balrampur Hospital’s OPD for treatment of ailments other than Covid-19, were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus infection during the screening prior to consultation. A visit to Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS), King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Civil Hospital, Balrampur Hospital and TB hospital found that though most patients and their attendants wore masks, social distancing and hand hygiene was missing. No social distancing was maintained at OPD registration counters and Covid testing and report collection centres. No facility of hand sanitization was also available at any counter in these hospitals. Director, Civil Hospital, Dr Subhash Chandra Sundariyal said, “We will run more registration counters from Saturday. Timing of registration will also be increased. This will help in checking overcrowding.” CMS, TB Hospital, Anand Gupta said, “Instructions have been given to staff to ensure Covid protocols.” RMLIMS spokesperson Prof Srikesh Singh said, “Extra guards would be deployed to check laxity.” KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said, “We have directed guards not to allow anyone without a negative RT-PCR test report.” Patients wait for hours due to server snag:Patients had to wait for three hours in queues for registration at RMLIMS due to a snag in the server. A liver patient from Chinhat, Anjali Awasthi, started feeling nauseatic while standing in the queue to take her Covid RT-PCR report. “I am not well but I have been standing here for last two hours,” she said. RMLIMS spokesperson Prof Srikesh Singh said there was a technical fault which was later resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-apt-steps-a-casualty-at-opds-of-city-hospitals/articleshow/85116813.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Coimbatore||Tirupur continues to top state in daily Covid-19 death count||Coimbatore: Tirupur has been reporting around five Covid-19 fatalities a day for the past couple of days, topping the state in the number daily toll.Health officials, however, said it wasn’t a matter for concern as the fatalities that occurred in the district in the past were being added to the daily bulletin, pushing up the numbers. But it can’t be denied that increase in industrial activities with the return of guest workers is posing fresh challenges to the textiles hub.Tirupur had reported 39 Covid-19 deaths in the past 10 days, while Coimbatore recorded only 30 fatalities during the period, despite logging the highest caseload in the state. At 17, the toll was even fewer in Chennai during the period.On Thursday too, Tirupur topped the state with five Covid deaths, followed by Coimbatore (4) and Chennai (3). It is to be noted that Tirupur was free of Covid deaths until a few days ago. The scenario changed after July 25 and it reported the highest daily toll of six on July 31. In the past six days, the district had reported five deaths daily, except on Wednesday, when only one person had succumbed to the virus.K Jegadeesh Kumar, deputy director of health services, Tirupur, confirmed that the rise in daily Covid deaths in the bulletin didn’t correspond to the actual deaths in a day. He said the deaths shown in the bulletin had occurred some three months ago. “The data is released only after three rounds of audit. That’s why the delay.” While the daily Covid cases mostly remained between 90-95 in Tirupur, there were signs of a possible spike for three days by July end, when it logged more than 150 cases. But the caseload had come down below 100 in the past few days, Jegadeesh said.Pointing out that failure on part of industrial units in Coimbatore to follow standard operating procedures had led to Covid clusters, sources said Tirupur hadn’t reported any such incidents recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tirupur-continues-to-top-state-in-daily-covid-19-death-count/articleshow/85114795.cms||Sampath Kumar

After noticing the near-empty oxygen cylinder, the driver of the ambulance and the attendant left the vehicle on the road and fled, leaving the patient struggling to breathe, the man’s family has alleged. A probe was initiated into the incident by the health department on Friday. Nand Kumar, a resident of Gararpura village under Soron police station, was suffering from lung infection and admitted to Ashok Nagar community health centre. He was referred to the Aligarh Medical College on Thursday evening after his condition worsened and he had difficulty breathing. Kumar’s mother, Shakuntala Devi, told TOI that the oxygen cylinder in the ambulance ran out within 20 minutes. “We had hardly travelled 5 km when oxygen ran out. The driver and attendant left us in the ambulance when we asked them to arrange for a new oxygen-equipped vehicle. My son died in front of my eyes.” According to Kumar’s brother, Awadesh, they paid Rs 1,200 for the 108 ambulance which is supposed to be a free service by the UP health department. “My brother died because there was no oxygen in the ambulance. We also asked passersby to help us transport my brother to the hospital, but no one came to our aid. We have filed a police complaint," he said. Police said action would be taken based on findings of the health department. Deputy superintendent of police R K Tiwari said, “It is a case of alleged medical negligence so we will take action based on the health department’s investigation.” Chief medical officer Dr Anil Kumar said the deceased was a patient of tuberculosis and was referred to Aligarh for better treatment. “We have initiated a probe into the incident and sought response from the ambulance service manager. Appropriate action will be taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/27-yr-old-man-in-up-dies-as-govt-ambulance-runs-out-of-oxygen-driver-flees-probe-on/articleshow/85110338.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt adopts wait-&-watch stance on restaurants||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said the government will review the effects of the relaxations in Covid curbs given in the first phase before taking a decision on extending the dining-in deadline of 4pm for restaurants and bars. A delegation representing all major restaurant and hotel owner associations met Thackeray on Friday evening, demanding relief for their businesses as well. Earlier this week, restrictions on shops and outdoor activities were relaxed, but no relief was extended to restaurants, malls and theatres. “We want to start everything smoothly. In the first phase, we have relaxed restrictions on outdoor movement and activities but we have to be careful about indoor activities,” said Thackeray. The Covid task force members suggested restaurant owners should vaccinate their staffers and reduce the use of AC. Malls and the retail establishments inside them have also expressed disappointment over not being allowing to operate despite best Covid protocols in place. “Malls have been closed for over four months. It has led to huge losses of over Rs 15,000 crore and is likely to have eroded over 1.5 lakh direct jobs,” said Mukesh Kumar of the Shopping Centre Association of India. Malls in the state generate a business of Rs 40,000 crore and contribute Rs 4,000 crore in GST every month, the association said. The prolonged closure is hurting more than 2 lakh people employed in about 50 malls in the state. It has a domino effect — on an average, a mall has 200 retail stores and over 5,000 business entities associated with it as suppliers and vendors. Kumar said all mall staff, including retailers and third-party vendors, have been vaccinated. “The stringent Covid measures followed by malls make them far safer compared to high streets and other markets where hardly any safety protocols or Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-adopts-wait-watch-stance-on-restaurants/articleshow/85116827.cms||Bhavika Jain

Artists have completed the maiden work on the walls of the corporation’s central zone office building. The work, which started last Saturday, was finished on Thursday.The initiative was conceived by corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara. A list of places to be beautified by paintings has been shortlisted by the corporation. Recently, representatives of Catalyst Street Festival selected the suitable places. While many themes were discussed, those approved by the commissioner will be painted soon, corporation sources said.The civic body has identified 10 to 12 places for the initial phase, Sunkara said. “We want to bring more about Coimbatore's heritage and culture. Apart from walls, we are planning to cover places alongside arterial roads. We are trying to tie-up with resident welfare associations to do more work,” he told TOI.Founder of Catalyst Street Festival K Phanikumar said a theme depicting the lifestyle of ancient Tamils was chosen for the first work. “Artists involved in the work are from the city. Many of the walls have posters. However, the one where we completed the work did not have any,” he said. “We are going slowly, concentrating one at a time as cleaning the wall and making it ready for painting is a time-consuming process. If the work is carried out hastily, it would not last.”The organization has worked in similar projects in cities such as Chennai and Bengaluru, Phanikumar said.The civic body will soon rope in more people to make walls lively, an official said. “We aim to not only make the places attractive, but also informative. A private school has taken up the Kalloori Nagar Park at Peelamedu to paint freedom fighters. The children, who visit the park, will get used to our leaders.” Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran took to Twitter to congratulate the civic body for the initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-to-get-colourful-one-wall-at-a-time/articleshow/85114799.cms||V Devanathan

---||Ludhiana||We look into rights issues, so under watch, say Punjab activists||TARN TARAN/JALANDHAR: Human rights activists and lawyers Jagdeep Singh and Jaspal Singh Manjhpur had always suspected that different government intelligence agencies might be snooping on them, so they were not surprised when their names cropped up in the Pegasus snooping row. According to Randhawa, forensic examination of his mobile phone by Amnesty International’s security laboratory had confirmed that it was under surveillance through Pegasus spyware. "My work is to probe and look into the human rights violations by the government which means I pinpoint the government-sponsored malpractices and wrongdoings … and it was expected that the government would be spying on me," said Randhawa while talking to TOI on Friday. Similarly, Majhpur said, "I have always presumed that my phone was being heard by the intelligence and the security set-up." Randhawa who is legal advisor to a human rights organization Khalra Mission Organization (KMO) said, "It could be Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) or any other agency.’’ He said KMO had in the past submitted complaints with Amritsar police commissioner and International Court of Justice claiming that Operation Bluestar -- army operation carried out to flush out the militants holed up inside Golden Temple -- was not only illegal but a genocide. "We have been carrying out investigations into several cases of human rights excesses committed by the government, including forced disappearances and human rights violations," said Randhawa. KMO patron Paramjit Kaur Khalra said, "I apprehend that the mobile phones of KMO’s office-bearers, including me, have been compromised by Pegasus, but nothing will frighten us or impede us from doing our humanitarian task." Manjhpur, whose name had been mentioned as a possible candidate for surveillance in mid-2018 as per the latest report by The Wire on Pegasus snooping case, said that he was called by Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) to Delhi around the same time and informed that he was already under high surveillance. Manjhpur had remained counsel for most booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and by National Investigation Agency (NIA). He is also defence lawyer in cases against UK national Jagtar Singh ‘Jaggi’ Johal. The Wire has also clarified that as Manjhpur’s phone was not available for a forensic test, it could not be confirmed whether he was subjected to an attempted attack or if it was compromised by Pegasus. But he said, "I went to Canada in April 2018 and on my return I was called by the IB and RAW officials to Delhi in June or July 2018. They did not hint that my phone was under surveillance but they had everything else on me including what I spoke in private and public meetings during my visit to Canada in April 2018," he told TOI on Friday. "The intelligence officials also said that a Canadian ‘agency’ was asking them to take action against me and warned that I shouldn’t be visiting Canada again or else I would face action there...," he said. "Snooping on an advocate is also a breach of privacy between a lawyer and his client," alleged Manjhpur, who himself was booked under UAPA in 2009, but was acquitted in 2014. 4 names from Punjab till now Four names from Punjab have so far come to fore as targets or potential targets of Pegasus spyware. Before names of human rights advocates Jaspal Singh Manjhpur and Jagdeep Singh Randhawa came up, those of two journalists focusing on Sikh issues, Jaspal Singh Heran, editor of Punjabi daily Pehredar, and Bhupinder Singh Sajjan who runs his own YouTube channel had come out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/pegasus-snoopgatewe-look-into-rights-issues-so-under-watch-say-pb-ctivists/articleshow/85114826.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The motive came to light after the crime branch of the Pune rural police on Friday arrested three persons, who posed as police personnel and robbed four employees of a courier firm in wee hours of Tuesday. The arrested trio, Bhosale, Tushar Tambe and Bharat Bhangar, are all residents of Shirur tehsil. The police are checking if the arrested tri had any previous crime records. Inspector Padmakar Ghanwat of the local crime branch, who headed the investigation, said, “The main conspirator, Bhosale, had started a small eatery in Satara district but had to close it because of the pandemic. He was struggling to pay instalments of the car and return money that he had borrowed from people and relatives. That’s why he hatched the plan of robbery. We have established the involvement of three other suspects, who are on the run.” The police said making quick money was the main motive of the robbers. They had intercepted the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation bus near Patas toll plaza, brought the courier employees down and robbed the valuables and cash the latter were supposed to deliver at a firm’s offices in Mumbai and Bhiwandi. The police have recovered cash, jewellery, and a car and motorcycles used in the crime from the suspects. “Bhosale had buried Rs91 lakh in his farm, which we have recovered intact,” said Ghanwat. The police received a specific tip-off about one of the robbers from their informers. The then worked on some clues and cracked the case. To execute their robbery plan, the suspects studied the work pattern of the courier firms’ employees. They had also travelled with them a couple of times in the recent past, said the police. Superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said, “The traders from Latur, Solapur and some other districts send their money and jewellery to Mumbai through these courier services. They don’t use digital platforms for their transactions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/highway-robbery-planned-after-loss-of-livelihood-cops/articleshow/85114866.cms||---

The loan amount given to weavers from Tamil Nadu accounted for Rs 207 crore, whereas the loan given to all other states was Rs 159 crore, according to Goyal’s reply in the parliament. In his query, Vaiko had sought details on status of National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP), whether there was a shortfall in the achievements under the programme, reasons for the shortfall and efforts to reverse that trend. Goyal said that during the last three years 1,438 weavers benefitted from central government’s skill development scheme while 9924 weavers were trained in other parts of the country.

However, fatalities in the state increased. The state reported 5,539 cases and 187 deaths on Friday, taking the total tally to 63.41 lakh cases and 1,33,717 deaths. In more positive news, the city's daily positivity rate dropped below 1% (0.9%) on Friday with 34,284 tests carried out. While 309 cases were registered in Mumbai on Friday, the tally increased by another 283 cases due to a data reconciliation exercise. The overall Covid tally in Mumbai has thus increased to 7,36,862 so far. The daily toll has been steady below 10 for months, with eight deaths registered on Friday.The number of critical patients in the city has dropped below 500 to 484 as compared to four times the number until two months back. The number of active patients in the city has dropped below 5,000 and the number of people in home quarantine has dropped below 50,000 to 47,277. “Covid cases are low now and there are no clusters in the city. There are fluctuations in cases at the ward-level from time to time that we notice because of our close monitoring, but these are not statistically significant,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. Officials say there has been a dip in cases in Kolhapur, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, which may be due to disruption of Covid norms of testing and tracking. However, Ahmednagar and Satara are still reporting high cases, almost twice the number that Mumbai is reporting. A large chunk of deaths on Friday were reported from Aurangabad district (70), which officials attributed to reconciliation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-and-mumbai-continue-to-see-a-dip-in-cases-fatalities-in-state-rise/articleshow/85116864.cms||---

The Mathigiri police identified the deceased as J Mohan, 40, his wife M Ramya, 33, daughter M Hanmaya, 8, and mother J Vasanthakumari. They were residing at Swarnabhoomi layout near Mathigiri. A police officer said Mohan was engaged in online trading, which was running on huge losses. “He had borrowed lakhs of rupees from banking and non-banking sectors and various people. And he was not in a financial position to repay them. So, he, along with other family members, decided to commit suicide.” On Thursday night, the officer said, Mohan seemed to have fed food mixed with poison to his wife, daughter and mother, before suffocating himself to death by covering his head with a polythene cover. “They had switched on the television before committing suicide.” On Friday morning, the neighbours heard the television sound but didn’t see any of the family members coming out of the house. “Some of them knocked on the door of the house and there was no response. They informed the Mathigiri police.” The officer said Vasanthakumari was found dead in a bedroom on the ground floor of the house, while the bodies of Ramya and Hananya were found a bedroom on the first floor, where Mohan’s body was also found. The bodies were sent to the government hospital at Hosur for postmortem. Deputy superintendent of police Murali (Hosur sub-division) sub-inspector Chitaras and other police personnel visited the house. “Mohan had left a suicide note. He said he was in deep debt and hence taking this extreme step along with his family members,” the officer said.

---||Kochi||Woman doctor on duty attacked||Thiruvananthapuram: In yet another incident of attacks on doctors in the district, two men assaulted a woman doctor at the Fort Taluk Hospital here on Thursday night. Police arrested Rasheed of Karimadom Colony and Rafeeq of Vallakadavu in the connection with the incident. Dr Malu Murali was attacked by the accused who had come to the hospital for getting treatment for their injuries. “I had asked them how the injury had occurred. This provoked them and they tried to attack me. They even caught on my dress and tried to tear it off,’’ said Dr Murali. A security personnel who came to her aid was also attacked. By the time police reached the hospital, the two had fled the scene. The hospital employees said that the accused were permanent nuisance in the region and have made similar issues in the past also in inebriated conditions. Meanwhile, the hospital employees boycotted duty on Friday morning and said that they would join duty only after the arrest of the accused. They joined back for duty only after police officers communicated to the district Kerala government medical officers’ association representatives (KGMOA) about the arrest. However, KGMOA has warned that they would be forced to go on strike across the state if the government was not ready to provide security for doctors in hospitals. Education minister V Sivankutty who reached the hospital assured action against those who attacked the doctor. “It is unfortunate that doctors are facing such attacks. They are in the forefront of the fight against the pandemic and they are doing their best service to the people. Such incidents are condemnable and the government would take strict action against those who indulge in such criminal activities against the healthcare workers,’’ he said. In the backdrop of the recent rise in attacks against doctors, it has been decided to install CCTV cameras in all government hospitals with casualty facilities in the district. District collector Navjot Khosa announced this decision in the working committee meeting of the National Health Mission (NHM). The decision to install CCTV cameras comes particularly in the wake of the attacks against doctors in Parassala Taluk Hospital and Fort Taluk Hospital. The CCTV cameras will be installed at the entrance points of the hospitals. NHM has been entrusted with the responsibility of CCTV installation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/woman-doctor-on-duty-attacked/articleshow/85112405.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Purpose of gaushala purely charitable not commercial: Min||Chandigarh: Taking a dig at the opposition for politicising “social work” like gaushala, Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu termed the allegation levelled against him as totally baseless. He said the allegations have been made for vested political interests as they (opposition) don’t have any issue to raise in front of the people of Mohali constituency against him. In a press conference at Bal Gopal Gaushala Welfare Society, Sidhu said the land is purely dedicated to the well-being of abandoned bovines, not for commercial purposes. “If anyone wants to know the purpose, he may visit the site to see the commercial activities running here,” he said. Questioning the allegations by his political rivals, the minister said, “Is building a gaushala a mistake? I made a commitment with the people of Mohali that I would make this city free of stray animals so that road mishaps could be prevented and precious lives of innocent people and animals saved.’’ Society trustee Anurag Aggarwal said more than Rs 1 crore has been invested till date in the construction of the cowshed and the money has been donated either by trustees or raised from people through voluntary donations. The society aims to provide a diagnostic-cum-health centre and a community hall here for use of the poor and all these facilities shall be provided free of cost. The total budget for this would be more than 5 crore. Meanwhile, former Punjab legislative assembly speaker Bir Devinder Singh and ex-minister Bikram Singh Majithia have demanded a CBI inquiry into the alleged land grab attempt by Sidhu. The land in question is Balongi panchayat land where a cattle pound has been set up. During his public meeting in Mohali recently, Majithia said, “Balbir Sidhu has grabbed panchayat land worth crores in Balongi and now, in connivance with his brother, as mayor of Mohali, is going to legalise his garbbed land by including Balongi into MC limits. We demand a CBI inquiry into the matter.” On the similar lines, Bir Devinder said, “A mega land scandal involving the Punjab health minister has come to the fore, in which a suspicious trust, headed by Balbir Singh Sidhu, has usurped the common panchayat land of Balongi village in Mohali district, worth Rs 100 crores, with the active connivance of minister for rural development and panchayats Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. To legalise it, he is also including Balongi into MC limits, which must be probed by CBI.” He said the panchayats department had also allowed construction of a banquet hall and a diagnostic centre on the land given to Bal Gopal Gau Basera Society Trust, headed by the health minister ostensibly to run a ‘gaushala’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/purpose-of-gaushala-purely-charitable-not-commercial-min/articleshow/85114894.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Factory workers move to labour court over ‘low’ wages||Roorkee: More than six (out of 27) worker unions of Laksar-based Cavendish Industries Limited (CIL), a tyre manufacturing factory, have approached the Haridwar district labour court over ‘low’ wages. The members of the unions have alleged that while the unit has doubled its production over years, the wages have remained static. A new wage policy, under which workers would get a hike of Rs 5,000, was to be implemented in January this year but the plan was shelved due to a lack of consensus among worker unions. “Our previous wage agreement was signed in 2018 when the factory was producing 250 metric tonnes of rubber per day whereas it is producing around 500 metric tonnes of rubber this year. Factory management had doubled the production but not our salary,” said Nishant Kumar, general secretary of a worker union of the plant. Meanwhile, Dhiraj Sharma, the HR head of CIL, told TOI, “We never forced any worker to work extra hours but we did increase their wages by Rs 5,000. For now, we will await the court ruling. If the judgment suits us, we will implement it. If not, we will approach the higher court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/factory-workers-move-to-labour-court-over-low-wages/articleshow/85110410.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Kolkata||Sons in US, woman dies in empty flat||Kolkata: The decomposed body of a 64-year-old woman, who lived alone at a flat on Ibrahim Road in Ekbalpore, was recovered on Thursday evening. The woman, Kaji Aziza Firoz Siddiqui, was found lying dead on her bed. The woman used to step out of her home for daily needs and she never let anyone know of the state of her mind for living alone during the pandemic as her two sons, who are settled in the USA, did not visit her for a long time, according to neighbours. The caretaker of the four-storey building, where the woman lived, became doubtful as she was not seen for four days. “She used to speak with the caretaker a lot, calling him up to her second floor flat. Around 4.30pm on Thursday, some of us had a foul smell emanating from her house. We informed the Ekbalpore police about the matter. Cops broke open the door and found the woman’s decomposed body,” said a neighbour, Md Shahrukh, adding that her sons had not met her for the last five years. However, cops said the woman had been in touch with her sons. “We have managed to trace Golum Gous Siddiqui, brother-in-law of the woman who used to communicate with her along with her sister. We asked him to come to the flat immediately as he stays nearby,” said an officer. In the presence of some locals and the woman’s relatives, the door of the house, which was locked from inside, was broken. The woman was rushed to the SSKM Hospital. A post-mortem is being conducted to ascertain the actual cause of her death that, prima facie, appears to be of sudden illness. “We found that the woman was preparing to cook something. Although a cardiac failure may be reason behind her death, we want to ascertain that the death was not a fallout of Covid,” said an officer of Ekbalpore police station. “We are trying to contact her sons. We are speaking to the neighbours to ascertain whether she had been under any mental stress for being forced to live alone,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sons-in-us-woman-dies-in-empty-flat/articleshow/85112430.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Chetna Kerure, joint managing director, PMPML, told TOI, “Plans are afoot to start the cargo service after finalising a plan by this month after which the service will be launched with the board’s approval.”He said all the 108 buses, earmarked for good transport, have completed their running age. “As per the norms, buses which have run for more than 10 years or more than 7lakh km are auctioned as scrap. They can be modified into goods carrying vehicles,” he added.Earlier, PMPML chairman-cum-managing director Laxminarayan Mishra said that they were planning to start a cargo transport on the lines of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). “While working as a collector in Ratnagiri, I had seen MSRTC buses transporting Alphonso mangoes to and from the district. The MSRTC has been successful in goods transport business and we, too, can do the same,” he had said.“Since the PMPML’s jurisdiction is limited to Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and some rural areas, we are targeting to start the service at these places. We can use the modified buses and deliver the goods. The PMPML will have a non-fare revenue source,” another official said.The PMPML fleet consists of 1600 buses, out of which only 1,000 buses are currently operational daily due to the pandemic. “Though the daily income of the transport body has gone up during the last few days, fewer buses on road due to restrictions is a concern, and we need to find ways to increase the revenue,” he said.Altogether 1100 MSRTC buses have been converted into goods carriers and they have been plying across the state for a year. It was decided that 25% cargo of the state government would be transported by Maha Cargo, the cargo arm of the MSRTC, which earns around Rs60crore from this service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-mulls-cargo-service-after-msrtcs-transport-biz/articleshow/85114930.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Will CET for Jr college admissions stay? Result on August 10||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Friday reserved its verdict on pleas against holding of a Common Entrance Test (CET) for junior college admissions on August 21. Students will know on August 10 if CET stays or goes. While closing the matter, a bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla enquired about the consequences of allowing the pleas to quash the May 28 notification for a CET based on the SSC board syllabus. A petition against CET was filed by Ananya Patki, an ICSE student, and intervention pleas made by four IGCSE students. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said admissions would be given to all students, but those who want colleges of their choice must take the CET. Ananya’s petition said the CET violated her right to life and equality. The AG, however, said, “Article 21 does not give you the right of choice.” Ananya’s father, advocate Yogesh Patki, said if CET "is to give SSC students first preference, it is clear discrimination.” Senior advocate Mihir Desai, for IGCSE students, said, “The subjects of IGCSE and ICSE are different from SSC.” The AG said 10.75 lakh students had registered for CET, CBSE students were second highest. He said the CET is a policy decision taken due to the pandemic and boards had consented. However, CBSE’s advocate said it wanted the CET to be postponed for next year. The judges said if medical and super-specialty courses have NEET because of few seats and when the State says there are enough seats, why should there be a CET. “If nobody will be deprived then what is the purpose of CET? What are you going to achieve?” asked Justice Dhanuka. The AG replied, “Seats in preferred colleges are limited. If I have to honour the golden rule of merit then I have to judge the merit of everybody on a common yardstick.” Desai said young students are expected to physically appear for CET. The judges said the latest SOP shows 11 districts are badly affected and students there could miss CET. The AG said Covid protocols will be followed and students can take CET at the nearest center. “Parents who are not allowing their children to step out of the door-frame of their flats for 2 hours of exams, can take them for 3 hours to restaurants,” he added. When the judges asked Desai about consequences of granting relief, he replied, “If CET goes, you go back to CAP that was going on for ten years. CET was an additional criteria for CAP and suddenly brought in.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-cet-for-jr-college-admissions-stay-result-on-aug-10/articleshow/85116895.cms||Rosy Sequeira

While Shia cleric Maulana Saif Abbas said inter-religion marriages were not valid in Islam, Sunni cleric Maulana Sufiyan Nizami suggested that youngsters should marry within their own faith to keep controversies at bay. “Marriage between a Muslim and a non-Muslim is not validated in Islam. If a couple wants to get married, one of them should convert. If one wants to convert to Hinduism, one may do so and get married under the Special Marriages Act, but marrying and following two different faiths is not valid in religious terms,” Maulana Saif Abbas said. Maulana Sufiyan Nizami added that the statement by AIMPLB was the need of the hour since since Muslims were being accused of maliciously converting women of other faith to Islam by marriage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/more-clerics-back-inter-faith-marriage-stand/articleshow/85116885.cms||---
---||Kochi||Road to Ponmudi hill station reopened||Thiruvananthapuram: The road to Ponmudi hill station, which was closed for tourists citing safety concerns over damages suffered during heavy rains, has been reopened before the maintenance works were carried out. The authorities have started allowing tourists to visit the upper sanctuary of the hill station from Thursday. It was in the first week of June that the road suffered damages following incessant rains. The road between hairpin curves 11 and 12 suffered damages at several spots after the earth under it eroded. This resulted in depressions forming on the road surface. The rainwater kept seeping in through the gaps formed by soil erosion whenever it rained, posing a risk of caving in of the road. Besides this, crash barriers at hairpin curves 18 had also collapsed during the rain. The district administration acted quickly and banned entry of tourists to the hill station to avoid potential tragedies. But, it was only a week ago that the public works department (PWD) received administrative sanction from the government to float tender for carrying out maintenance works. Police said that though the road to the hill station was opened again, the entry was granted under strict conditions. “There are two parameters to be fulfilled to gain entry to the upper sanctuary. Either the individual must produce a Covid negative certificate, which is not older than 24 hours, or a certificate of getting both doses of vaccination,” said Nedumangad DSP M Anilkumar, under whose jurisdiction Ponmudi hill range comes. He said that the forest department officials would be conducting checks in this regard at their check post at Kallar on the foot of the hill range. The DSP also said that the movement of vehicles would also be regulated using traffic cones. At the spots where the roads are damaged, vehicular movement is allowed through only one lane, which is unaffected. Addressing safety concerns, the DSP said that though vehicles of tourists were not allowed entry, KSRTC buses were still conducting services to Ponmudi during this period as there were people living there. So far, the regulations put in place have turned out to be good. When contacted, PWD officials concerned said that they expected to start the work within a week. “Now that the administrative sanction has been received, procedures such as inviting tender and allocating contracts will be completed swiftly,” said a PWD official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/road-to-ponmudi-hill-station-reopened/articleshow/85112426.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan

Meanwhile, welcoming the cabinet decision on the new rules in the eligibility criteria and the format of the examination and conducted and the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission (JSSC) for recruitment of third and fourth-grade employees, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said the move will give a boost to job aspirants from backward classes. He said, “The rules will entail applicants to be eligible for third and fourth-grade job vacancies if they pass their matriculation examination only from schools in Jharkhand. It is a historic decision. It will ensure jobs to candidates from SC, ST and OBC communities from the state.” JMM also welcomed the new JSSC examination format, which will replace the preliminary and the main examinations with a single examination. “It was observed that in the past six years, candidates who failed to clear the preliminary examinations knocked at the doors of the judiciary and as a result, the main examination was shelved. The new examination format will be free of flaws and it will help clear the backlogs in recruitments,” Bhattacharya claimed. BJP, however, said the new rules are appeasement politics of the incumbent government. “The new regulations have done away with the mandatory paper in Hindi. Not only this is an insult to the ‘Raj Bhasha’, but it will also affect lakhs of aspirants who come from Garhwa, Palamu and other districts,” BJP state spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo claimed. “While Urdu has remained in Paper-II under the new rules, Hindi and Sanskrit have been removed. Bhojpuri and Angika languages have also been removed from Paper II and will affect lakhs of aspirants in Palamu, Garhwa Sahibganj and Godda districts. This itself speaks volumes of the government’s minority appeasement mentality,” Shahdeo said. Under the new regulations approved by the cabinet, Paper-I will comprise Hindi and English while Paper-II will be based on tribal and indigenous languages in which an applicant must score a minimum of 30% to qualify. Paper-III will comprise general knowledge. The final merit list will be issued on the scores of Paper-II and Paper-III, cabinet secretary Vandana Dadel had said on Thursday. BJP also claimed that state candidates from the general category will miss out on appearing in the exams if they appeared for their matriculation exams outside Jharkhand. “Our party will protest against these new regulations. The contours of our protests will be decided by the senior leadership soon,” Shahdeo claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-bjp-spar-over-recruitment-rules/articleshow/85112859.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Salima and Nikki were in the Indian women’s hockey squad which narrowly missed out on a bronze medal to Great Britain at the ongoing Tokyo Olympic Games. Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren tweeted: “Even though the women’s hockey team missed out on bronze medal, their performance was amazing. Jharkhandi players who are a part of the team will be given Rs 50 lakh each by the government and their native houses will be converted into Pucca homes.” Nineteen-year-old Salima, who is a resident of Badkichapar village under Sadar block of Simdega district, was the team’s mainstay in its quest for an Olympic medal this year. Salima earned accolades for her stick-work and successfully earned a penalty against Great Britain in Friday’s match, which in turn gave Indian team a crucial equalizer. Nikki hails from Murhu block in Khunti district. In June this year, Soren had announced a cash reward of Rs 2 crore for Jharkhand’s athletes if they came home with a gold medal, Rs 1 crore for silver and Rs 75 lakh for bronze. A day before their semi-final clash, Salima and Nikki’s family members were handed over cheques for Rs 5 lakh each for taking part in the Games. Besides Salima and Nikki, archer Deepika Kumari secured a berth at the Tokyo Olympic Games, but crashed out of team and individual events. “Though the state government had awarded cash prizes for medal winners, the previous decisions were amended keeping in mind the commendable efforts our girls put up at the Games. I salute the national women’s hockey team,” Soren said in a statement. “By entering the semifinals, the team proved that it has what it takes to lock horns with any team in the world. I congratulate each player, the coaches and the support staff,” he said. Soren also pledged that his government was committed to provide every possible assistance and facilities to promising sportspersons of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/soren-announces-rs-50l-pucca-homes-for-salima-nikki/articleshow/85113514.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||People in rural belt overcome vaccine hesitancy, help state cross milestone||Gumla: Taken the vaccine? Now, convince others to take it too. Sudarshan Gope, member of Jagratoli ward under Kuhupath panchayat of Ghaghra block in Gumla, said he did just that. On the day Jharkhand achieved the remarkable feat of vaccinating one crore people, the contribution of the state’s villages cannot be ignored. Overcoming the initial fear and hesitancy, villagers are now more than eager to take the jab, queuing up for vaccines voluntarily, thanks to the aggressive campaign launched on social media. “Earlier, there were apprehensions but since I attend meetings with the administrative officials, they asked me to take the first shot in front of the villagers, which worked wonders,” Gope said. As of date, 85-90 per cent per cent of the eligible population in the village comprising around 120 families have taken at least their first shots. Ajay Kishore Mishra, a teacher in the village, said there were instances when the vaccinators ran short of doses as the number of people in the queue was more than expected. The vaccination is carried out at the Anganwadi centre, a dilapidated building but is a buzz of activity on days of vaccination. To avoid wastage of manpower and time, the ward member talks to the villagers and, according to their convenience, fixes a day in the week when the vaccinators are invited. “That way when they come they need not wait for people to come and during one visit many people get their jabs,” Gope explained. Similar has been the approach of villagers in Basua under Gumla block where around 75 per cent people in the eligible category have taken at least their first jabs. Dharmendra Oraon, a farmer, who heads the family of 16 members, was initially worried about falling ill or developing fever due to the vaccine, which would have hampered their work in the fields in the peak of the agrarian season. “My children go to school and they seem to be more informed. They showed us videos and we thought of giving it a try,” Dharmendra said. He along with wife went to take the jab first so that even if they fell ill, others in the family would be able to take care of the farming. “None of us had fever, so after a week, I asked my sister-in-law to also take the jab,” said Suman Orain, Dharmendra’s wife. The family said they had heard about a few people who had fever but their experience was good. “We are feeling safer, at least mentally and now don't fear interacting with outsiders as well,” Suman added. In all the 11 blocks of Gumla, vaccination coverage in the age group of 60 and above has been maximum with Basia recording a 79 per cent coverage. Around 41 per cent of people of all age groups in rural Gumla is vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/people-in-rural-belt-overcome-vaccine-hesitancy-help-state-cross-milestone/articleshow/85112906.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The schools made sure that all the guidelines issued by the state government last month were followed properly. The schools checked the consent forms signed by their parents, allowing their wards to come to school. At the Ranchi zila school, the teachers made sure that every student underwent thermal scanning before entering the campus and maintained social distancing while inside. They were asked to wear a mask and the school gave away masks to those who were spotted without one. School principal Deepa Chaudhary said, “Our primary focus at the moment is ensuring safety for the students and staff and the students are very cautious about their health.” A class XII student named Bhupesh Kumar Mahto said, “Although offline classes are necessary for understanding a subject better, we are still afraid of getting infected. We are maintaining social distancing and keeping our interaction with others during class to the bare minimum.” Rita Kumari, who is the principal of Bariyatu girls’ high school, said, “We are following all the government-issued protocols to the tee. Out of the 90 students who attended class today, four arrived without wearing a mask. The school provided it to them. Although attendance on the first day was 25%, the situation is likely to improve in the coming days.” Nikita Kumari, a student of Bal Krishna High School, said that she was happy to see her friends after such a long gap but did not engage in any interaction with them.

---||Kolkata||#MyHandloomMyPride: Sari lovers reveal the story behind their favourite weaves||The handloom has been the backbone of traditional Indian textiles since time immemorial. And even today, when mechanised looms churn out thousands of tonnes of fabric every day, handloom weaves are still close to the wearers’ hearts because of the unique quality of the fabric and the traditional designs. As we celebrate the sixth National Handloom Day today – a day to commemorate the Swadeshi Movement, generate awareness about and promote India’s handloom industry — we speak to a few Kolkata-based sari connoisseurs about #MyHandloomMyPride — their favourite handloom weaves and how they take care of their prized possessions. Over to them: ‘I waited for my first Dhakai Jamdani’I can’t have enough of Dhakai Jamdani saris. I love them because they are airy, detailed, lightweight and full of history. I’ve lost count of how many I own but each one is a prized possession. My maiden Jamdani had to be extremely special, so I waited till my very first visit to Bangladesh, which finally materialised during the shoot of Moner Manush. The shoot took us to remote villages where I had the golden chance to visit local jamdani workshops and meet the weavers. It was an eye-opening experience where I learnt that the speciality of Jamdani saris lies in weaving in a way that the motifs appear to be floating on the muslin surface. I can never forget the red and white Dhakai Jamdani sari I wore to the 2011 Cannes red carpet. Care tips1. When it comes to taking care of saris, my mother knows the best. She stores my Jamdanis in separate cloth (mulmul) bags and keeps them away from light 2. After wearing them, I always dry my saris in shade 3. My mother hand washes my saris with a diluted mild detergent if needed — Paoli, actress‘I find Gorod saris extremely classy and elegant’I’m from a traditional Bengali family, so my love for saris, especially traditional Bengali handlooms ones, runs in my veins. From my childhood, I’ve seen women in our family wear laal paar Gorod during Durga Puja. I’ve always loved the purity of this silk handloom sari. I also find Gorod saris extremely classy and elegant. They add a dimension to your look. I remember my first Gorod was a gift from my mother — a beautiful sari with a copper border with kantha stitches on it. I have kept that sari aside with care. In fact, I preserve all my saris carefully, be it Jamdani, Benarasi, Gorod or Tussar. Care Tips1. I usually wrap them in soft mulmul and keep them in a wooden cupboard 2. Underneath the saris, I put dry neem leaves to keep away moisture and dampness — Madhuboni Chatterjee, danseuse‘Benarasi saris are timeless’Ihave a special place in my heart for Benarasi saris, especially the pure zari ones. I inherited my first Benarasi from my mother’s collection. A pure Benarasi sari may cost a fortune but are heirlooms and each heirloom carries its own legacy. They are among the finest saris in India and are known for their gold and silver brocade or zari, fine silk and opulent embroidery. The weavers spend days weaving a Benarasi and it truly reflects the element of art in the craftsmanship. The best thing about Benarasi saris is that they are timeless and not controlled by fashion trends. Care tip1. I store my Benarasi saris by wrapping them in mulmul sheets and every six months, I take them out to air them — Ekavali Khanna, actress‘A zari Kota sari reminds me of my childhood’My favourite Indian handloom weave is the zari Kota. I love it as it’s lightweight and simple. And most importantly, it originates from my native state Rajasthan. So, every time I see a zari Kota sari, I’m reminded of my childhood, where I saw my grandmother wearing Kota sari regularly. This red sari, a combination of zari Kota with bandhani, is my most favourite and it’s like a breath of fresh air in my wardrobe’s collection of zari Kotas. It drapes like magic and the fall of the sari is beautiful. Care tips1. Store it in a washed white soft mulmul fabric 2. Don’t spray perfume directly on the sari 3. Wear it often so that it gets the much-deserved airing and lasts long 4. Keep changing the fold of the sari from time to time 5. Keep a pouch of dry neem leaves inside the fold of your sari to keep insects at bay — Dolly Jain, celebrity sari stylist‘Baluchari saris are my prized possessions’I was born and brought up in New Delhi and had no idea about the existence of Baluchari saris back then. By chance, I picked up a Baluchari sari for a special occasion. What attracted me to it was the use of human and animal motifs in the brocade on the border and pallu and it was seamlessly done in a story telling style. I got to know more about these saris after shifting to Kolkata, I later collected more Balucharis and even have a dress made in this weave. These saris are some of my most prized possessions. Care tips1. Always dry clean the saris 2. Store them in a white muslin cloth so that it doesn’t get spoilt by dampness and moths 3. Never store them in plastic bags — Reena Dewan, artist and social entrepreneur||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/myhandloommypride-sari-lovers-reveal-the-story-behind-their-favourite-weaves/articleshow/85101461.cms||Ruman Ganguly

Singh is on dialysis since 2019 and claimed that he ran from pillar to post for eight months to obtain an NOC from the government that would have enable his wife Durga to donate one of her kidneys to him. The couple’s son, Mohit, a civil services aspirant studying in New Delhi, have returned home to help his struggling parents. Out of job for the last two years, Singh said he and Mohit travelled to Ranchi multiple times to meet officials of the state department of health, medical education and family welfare to secure the NOC. “We have an NOC from the office of health minister Banna Gupta in Jamshedpur but it does not have his signature or his seal,” he said. He pleaded, “Doctors at the CMC hospital in Vellore where I am getting treatment have advised for an early transplant. I have saved up Rs 8.50 lakh for the kidney transplant surgery after selling valuables and gold ornaments of my wife. I have not approached the government for funds. I only need the NOC.” Singh added, “If the government cannot provide me the NOC, it should allow me to end my life.” Singh was a private sector employee and is struggling to run his family, which comprises his wife and three children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-suffering-from-renal-failure-pleads-for-euthanasia/articleshow/85112703.cms||B Sridhar

---||Ranchi||Govt forms tribunal to hear demolition cases||Ranchi: A day after the Jharkhand high court directed the state government to constitute a tribunal which will act as an appellate authority to hear representation from aggrieved parties who have been issued notices by Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) for demolition of illegal structures, the government on Friday constituted a tribunal within the Ranchi Regional Development Authority and notified district and additional sessions judge Ramesh Kumar as the chairman of it. Talking to TOI, state urban development secretary Vinay Choubey said: “We have appointed a sitting judge and all necessary steps would be taken to implement the court’s orders at the earliest.” The high court on Thursday, while hearing an application filed by the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) which challenged the demolition notices issued by the civic body to hundreds of buildings in Upper Bazar area, had directed that natural justice should prevail in all such cases. The court directed the state government to constitute a tribunal within a week so that the petitioners can be given a chance to challenge the order before the appellate authority. Upon contact, FJCCI president Praveen Jain Chabra said: “We moved the court as there are buildings which were constructed around 50 years ago when there were no by-laws and the approval of a map wasn’t required. We had appealed to the court to direct the government for bringing in a policy for regularizations. We have been provided with the relief that we can approach the tribunal.” The civic body issued demolition orders to over 200 buildings after declaring the structures as illegal as they have been constructed without an approval of a map by a competent authority. Upon contact, a senior RMC official preferring anonymity said that the high court hasn’t put a stay on the orders issued by the civic body for the court appreciated the fact that RMC is a competent enough authority to take decisions in such matters. “We have never said that people who do not agree with the orders cannot approach a higher authority. Instead we have been saying that there is a provision under the Jharkhand municipal act which provides a 30-day period for appeal against the order passed by the civic body. Having said that, the orders passed by us aren’t wrong as the court didn’t say that they were.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-forms-tribunal-to-hear-demolition-cases/articleshow/85113670.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Surat||Surat: Four arrested for chopping woman’s hair in public||SURAT: Police arrested four persons including two women for allegedly thrashing a tribal migrant worker in full public view in Tatithaiya of Kadodara GIDC police station limits and also for chopping off her hair. According to police, one of the accused had doubts on the victim of having an affair with her husband which led her to public humiliation with the help of others. A video of the incident went viral on social media. Police arrested Sakanti Masaniya, Gauravi Ramu, Kailash Mevada and Vinod Mishra for thrashing, intentional insult, criminal intimidation among other charges. The complaint was lodged by the 19-year-old labourer from Madhya Pradesh who had come to Tatithaiya in search of work. In her complaint, the victim alleged that she was at her rented accommodation when accused came there and started inquiring about her husband while accusing her of having an affair with him and started abusing her. Later, the accused woman also pulled the victim out from her home and took her to the road where she began to berate her for the alleged wrongdoing in front of a garment shop in Soni Park. The accused was beating her when another accomplice, Mevada, reached the spot and handed a scissor to Masaniya to chop off the victim’s hair. While Ramu held the victim, Masaniya chopped off the tresses while a fourth accomplice, Mishra, threatened to kill the victim if she ever had any more affairs with anyone. “Police registered an offence and arrested the accused immediately. The woman targeted the victim over suspicion of an affair,” said a police officer in Kadodara GIDC police station. The accused will be produced in court on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/four-arrested-for-chopping-womans-hair-in-public/articleshow/85115371.cms||---
---||India||Uttarakhand to liberate its migrant Bengalis from 'East Pak' stamp||DEHRADUN: A longstanding demand of over 3.5 lakh members of the Bengali community that had migrated to the hill state from erstwhile East Pakistan has been fulfilled after the Uttarakhand chief minister announced that the government would stop stamping "East Pakistan" on caste certificates issued to them. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said, "I'm aware of problems faced by people in my home district. It is a long pending demand." Dhami's decision comes ahead of next year's state polls and may help BJP consolidate its base among Bengali voters, a sizeable chunk in Dhami's home turf of Udham Singh Nagar district. Earlier, Dhami had held discussions with Saurabh Bahuguna, BJP MLA from Sitarganj, and members of the displaced Bengali community. "It is a shame that East Pakistan is still being mentioned in caste certificates. Neighbouring Uttar Pradesh had stopped this practice around 15 years ago," Bahuguna told TOI. "In 2018, we had approached the then CM but the meeting did not bear fruit. Now, Dhami has assured us that this change would be brought," he said. Lakhs of Bengali families had migrated to Uttarakhand between 1956 and 1970, many of them from the border areas of Khulna, Jessore and Faridpur. A majority was settled in Udham Singh Nagar. Over the past decades, they have staged frequent protests to get the stamp removed from their caste certificate - a document meant to certify that an individual belongs to a particular religion, caste and community and which is required to avail of government schemes and benefits. On Friday, members of the community said their decades-long struggle to "truly belong" has finally ended. "It wasn't just our ancestors whose certificates carried this tag, even the caste documents of people like me born here in India had the stamp," said Uttam Datta, a businessman, whose family had moved from Noakhali to Rudrapur in 1964. Datta said that he was relieved that their future generations would no longer face the embarrassment he did. "It hurt me every time to look at that document," he said. Sanjay Bachar, vice president of Bengali Kalyan Samiti, is also among those born in India, but whose certificates have an "East Pakistan" stamp. "This was a blot on our community and we are relieved the government will do away with this," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttarakhand-to-liberate-its-migrant-bengalis-from-east-pak-stamp/articleshow/85118625.cms||Kautilya Singh

The opposition bloc, led by Rahul Gandhi, participated as visitors in the 'Kisan Sansad' organised by the protesting farmers in the form of a "mock Parliament" where they held discussions on the "kala kanoon (black laws)". Later, Rahul told reporters that government's offer of a discussion in Parliament on farm laws was not acceptable and it would have to revoke the three laws. "The Opposition today [Friday] met the farmers and expressed support in their fight against the 'kala kanoon'," he said. Rahul also said that discussions must be held on the Pegasus snooping scandal as it was a serious matter with "Prime Minister Narendra Modi having put spyware in the phones of Indians". The visit to Jantar Mantar was significant as the protesters, since the beginning, claimed that they wanted to keep their agitation apolitical and have aggressively discouraged parties during last seven months since they collected at the borders of Delhi. The political leaders on Friday too were not seated on the protest dais nor did they address the gathering. The decision to join the protest was taken in a meeting of floor leaders of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in Kharge's chamber on Friday morning. Among the participants of 14 parties were Mallikarjun Kharge, Ambika Soni, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (Congress), Sanjay Raut (Shiv Sena), TKS Elangovan (DMK), Manoj Jha (RJD), Elamaram Kareem (CPM), NK Premchandran (RSP), Binoy Viswam (CPI) and Mohammed Bashir (IUML).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-support-farmers-rahul-led-oppn-joins-stir-at-jantar-mantar/articleshow/85118678.cms||---

The BJP had won four seats uncontested earlier and polls were to be held for eight seats. Given the strong majority that the ruling party enjoys in the civic body, it was expected that the party would sail through effortlessly. The BJP had put up eight candidates even as the Congress had put up only one. The Congress putting up a token fight knowing well that it did not stand a chance to win. In the election where each corporator was to cast eight votes, BJP has 69 corporators in the civic body. Congress has merely seven. Six of the winning candidates got 69 votes each even as two got 68 votes. The Congress candidate got 56 votes. The ruckus took place as one of the corporators had used tick marks and then overwrote to change them to cross marks for voting. Ideally, a corporator has to use only cross marks for voting. The Congress raised an objection to this. When some Congress workers who were not counting agents entered room, BJP members objected to this. The Congress too objected to presence of BJP members in the counting room leading to arguments. After a lot of arguments, it was decided that the two votes cast by over writing will not be considered. This is the reason why two BJP candidates got one vote lesser than the other six. It is for the first time after the BJP came to power in VMC that the municipal school committee does not have a single corporator from the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ruckus-during-vmc-school-committee-polls/articleshow/85115217.cms||---

The colleges are Cambridge Institute of Technology, Bengaluru; Tontadarya College of Engineering, Gadag; BLDE College of Engineering, Vijayapura; SJC Institute of Technology, Chikkaballapur; and Coorg Institute of Technology, Ponnampet. VTU said around 25 colleges have expressed interest in offering courses in Kannada. Colleges are likely to start the programme in four major streams — civil, mechanical, computer science and electronics — and permission will be given for an intake of 30 or 60 students. Offering higher education in regional languages has been recommended by the National Education Policy. All India Council of Technical Education permitted engineering colleges to offer undergraduate engineering courses in 11 regional languages — Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam, Bengali, Assamese, Punjabi and Oriya. The prime minister recently inaugurated 14 colleges in eight states which offer engineering courses in regional language. “Curriculum translation has begun. Since the first year is common for all branches, Kannada curriculum will be ready for academic year 2022. The university will also train teachers,” said VTU vice-chancellor Karisiddappa. AICTE has mandated that only colleges accredited to National Board of Accreditation can offer these programmes. “Our government colleges are not accredited. We are writing to AICTE to provide relaxation in this regard,” the V-C added. According to the university, several students who complete schooling in Kannada study PU in English. When they come to engineering colleges, they struggle because of lack of language proficiency. “Engineering in Kannada will be a relief for such students,” the V-C said. Whether graduating in Kannada medium will affect students’ job prospects, the V-C said: “Of course not. In fact, these students will have an added advantage because they have in-depth knowledge of the subject while learning it in mother tongue and learning technical terms in English. This has been happening in developed countries. We are expecting an increase in enrollment in regional languages in 4-5 years,” he added. Over the years, faculty across colleges in the country observed that students struggle with new concepts in engineering education due to the change in medium of instruction. “Each student comes from a different socio-economic background and not all have the same exposure to English. Language should not be a barrier for any student to develop a scientific temper.

---||Goa||Goa: Ruckus in Congress office over induction of former Velim MLA into party fold||MARGAO: Congress workers from Velim created a ruckus at the party’s district office in Margao on Friday evening and disrupted the programme organised to induct former Velim MLA Benjamin Silva into the party fold. The protesting workers were agitated for not being taken into confidence by the Congress leadership before deciding to induct Silva, whom they accused of working against the party during the zilla panchayat elections held earlier this year. Congress ZP member from Velim, Julio Fernandes and Seva Dal functionary Antonette Dias was among those who were the most vocal in targeting the party leadership for inducting D’Silva by “ignoring the sentiments of the local party workers”. The protests have to be viewed against the backdrop of emergence of Velim sarpanch Savio D’Silva and Congress party’s South Goa district president Joe Dias as frontrunners for the party ticket from Velim constituency. GPCC president Girish Chodankar and leader of opposition Digambar Kamat were at the receiving end of the party workers’ fury. Chodankar sought to placate frayed nerves stating that the party hadn’t promised a ticket to anybody even as he urged all anti-BJP forces to join Congress to defeat BJP in the 2022 elections. “Benjamin wasn’t in Congress earlier, and so he may have worked against the party,” Chodankar said. “As per the party’s national policy anybody is welcome to join the party. The party needs to be strengthened to defeat BJP, as Congress is now the only option for all Goans,” he said. As regards the issue of tickets, Chodankar said, “The party leadership will take extra care while giving tickets. Multiple surveys will be conducted to determine the credibility of the candidates. We want to restore discipline in the party. Indiscipline in any form will not be tolerated.” Later speaking to reporters, Silva said that he joined Congress with a view to strengthening the party and refuted allegations that he didn’t work for Congress in the last ZP polls. Silva, who had contested the 2012 assembly elections as an independent, had defeated Congress candidate Filipe Neri Rodrigues. “There was an anti-Congress wave then. I later extended support to BJP after consulting the people as we wanted development in our constituency. The development is there for all to see,” Silva said. In the 2017 assembly elections, however, Silva, contesting as a BJP-backed independent candidate, lost to Congress candidate Rodrigues. “There’s lot of development work left to be done in Velim. Now that I have joined Congress, I will now demand the party ticket for the 2022 assembly elections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ruckus-in-cong-office-over-induction-of-former-velim-mla-into-party-fold/articleshow/85113982.cms||---

The aircraft was on a training sortie with no VIP on board. No damage to the plane or injuries were reported. Sources at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) said two private (chartered) jets scheduled to land at HAL were diverted to KIA following the runway incident. According to sources, the AI-1 mainly used by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and by the President and the Vice-President of India took off from New Delhi at 3.48am on Friday and landed at HAL airport at 8.32am. “There was no VIP on board and this was a routine sortie. The aircraft flew over Bengaluru before safely landing at HAL airport this morning. And then, it had to take off to return to Delhi. There was no incident per se, the pilot while taxiing before the take-off, took a left turn instead of right at the turning pad. He immediately stopped and now the ground staff is trying to bring the aircraft back to the parking bay or tarmac from where he can taxi again and take off. There’s no problem with the aircraft and nobody was injured,” a senior official from HAL told TOI. The aircraft stuck off the runway after the pilot taxiing it took a left turn instead of right at the turning padThe incident occurred around 11am on the HAL runway. The specially retrofitted aircraft equipped with a top-end missile defence system remained stuck till Friday evening, possibly due to the absence of towing equipment and vehicles at HAL to muscle out large commercial jets, which had to be brought in from KIA. HAL spokesperson Gopal Sutar told TOI: “The trainee pilot stopped at the turning pad and there was no overshooting of the runway. There were no commercial passengers in the aircraft.” “The Air India One often flies into KIA and the HAL airport as part of its training exercise as it is important for IAF pilots flying the wide-bodied VVIP aircraft to test on commercial flying conditions like the city airport to be acclimatised to all conditions and safety steps when leaders are on board. And as part of a regular drill, the AI-1 had come to the city,” a senior officer at KIA said. The runway at HAL airport, sources said, was ordered closed until 11am Saturday with scheduled flights diverted to KIA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pm-narendra-modis-private-aircraft-on-training-sortie-stuck-off-hal-runway-in-bengaluru/articleshow/85118747.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Rajkot||Rs 1,500 crore incentives of Saurashtra exporters stuck for 18 months: RCCI||Rajkot: An incentive amount of a staggering Rs 1,500 crore of Saurashtra exporters eligible under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MIES) has been stuck for past 18 months, the Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) has stated. In a detailed representation regarding problems being faced by exporters made to the union commerce ministry on Wednesday, RCCI sought immediate release of the incentives to boost exports. The export of Rajkot’s engineering sector is positive but according to traders if the several problems are solved they are able to compete strongly at international level which will earn more dollars to the country and also increase the profit of exporters. MEIS was repealed from January 1, 2021 but the government did not pay incentives under this scheme from April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Under this scheme, the government was providing incentives of 3-5% on various products of export. The receipt of incentive was used in paying import duty and exporters were allowed to sell this receipt to importers. The central government then replaced MEIS with Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP), but the rate of refund under this scheme has not been announced. As a result, exporters don’t know how much benefit they will get and therefore they can’t quote prices to international buyers. Parth Ganatra, vice-president, RCCI said, “Exporters of all commodities of Saurashtra, be it engineering, ceramics, brass etc, are facing this problem. We requested the government again to resolve these issues to boost the industry, especially when the economy is in distress due to the pandemic.” RCCI also urged the ministry to immediately announce the rates under this scheme. The representation stated that an unprecedented hike in freight charges and various raw materials are gnawing at their profits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rs-1500-crore-incentives-of-saurashtra-exporters-stuck-for-18-months-rcci/articleshow/85115703.cms||---
---||Goa||Former minister & 2-time BJP MLA Mahadev Naik joins AAP||Panaji: Former industries minister and two-term Shiroda MLA Mahadev Naik joined Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday at a formal event in New Delhi. AAP national convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, along with power minister Satyendar Jain, welcomed Naik into the party. Naik served as a BJP MLA for 10 years till 2017, before joining Congress ahead of the 2019 assembly bypoll, which he lost. “(We) welcome Mahadev Naik to the AAP family. We will work together to serve the people of Goa and give them a better quality of life,” Kejriwal said. Naik was officially inducted into AAP by Jain and AAP MLA Atishi Marlena, who is the party’s Goa in-charge. After BJP inducted former Congress MLA Subhash Shirodkar, Naik was slowly edged out, and, sore with the BJP leadership, he joined hands with Congress to defeat Shirodkar in the bypolls. At that time, Naik and his supporters accused BJP and then BJP state president Vinay Tendulkar of not taking them into confidence before accepting Shirodkar into BJP. Naik is expected to contest the 2022 assembly elections for AAP from Shiroda, where he pulled around 12,000 votes out of the 22,807 cast in 2012. In the 2019 Shiroda bypolls, Naik got just 2,402 votes when BJP fielded Shirodkar against him and Deepak Dhavalikar of MGP. “AAP has made a difference in the politics and governance in Delhi. I am hopeful that the party will bring in the same changes in Goa,” Naik said. His joining AAP comes at a time when AAP is gearing up for Goa’s assembly polls. Goa AAP convener Rahul Mahambre was present in Delhi when Kejriwal welcomed Naik. At present, AAP does not have a single MLA in the 40-member Goa legislative assembly. Naik has joined AAP at a time when the Kejriwal-led party is speculated to be in talks with MGP. Naik was industries minister in both, the Manohar Parrikar and Laxmikant Parsekar government, till 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-minister-2-time-bjp-mla-mahadev-naik-joins-aap/articleshow/85114005.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: In Olympic star Vandana Katariya's village, dalits allege bias||ROSHNABAD: About two months ago, Rahul Kumar set up a roadside eatery in Roshnabad. It was on the village thoroughfare. Then one day, a group of dominant caste men asked him to shut it down. "They said their cars couldn't pass if a dalit's establishment was on the way," Kumar, 20, told on Friday. Caste schisms run deep in this village, home to Vandana Katariya, India's first woman to score a hat-trick at the Olympics. The houses are stacked along clear caste lines and everyone mostly sticks to their side. Shocking! Casteist slurs, abuses thrown at Olympic star Vandana Katariya’s familyOn Wednesday, three men from dominant castes allegedly harassed Vandana's family with casteist insults after the Indian women's hockey team lost in semi-finals. While the incident shocked the nation, Dalits here said it wasn't new to them.  "It's not the first time we've been oppressed," said Kumar. Vandana's brother Shekhar said, "We treat everyone with respect but the dominant castes seem to hold a grudge against us. After what we went through, no one from the upper caste came to talk to us." The Uttarakhand Human Rights Commission on Friday took cognizance of TOI reports on the incident and asked the Haridwar SSP to file a report, adds Kautilya Singh from Dehradun. Meanwhile, two Twitter accounts were suspended after Vandana flagged them on her verified social media accounts. "My family and I are going through a very tough time.... It is a humble request to some people to not increase my troubles. I am seeing people making my fake accounts and sharing tweets from them on my behalf," (sic) she posted on Instagram and Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-olympic-stars-village-dalits-allege-bias/articleshow/85118797.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Bhatkal man held for suspected IS links||MANGALURU: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted searches in Bhatkal, Uttara Kannada district, and arrested a man suspected to be linked to the Islamic State. The arrested man, Jufti Jawhar Damudi, is the brother of Adnan Hasan Damudi, who was nabbed in 2016 for alleged IS-related activities. Adnan is under detention in a separate NIA case. NIA said a case was registered in New Delhi on June 29 in connection with an IS conspiracy to radicalise and recruit youths. Jufri is suspected to be ‘Abu Hazir Al Badri’, a key operative involved in translation of IS magazine Voice of Hind and spreading other terrorist propaganda online. IS terrorists operating from various conflict zones, along with members in India, have created a network by assuming pseudo-online identities to recruit youngsters, NIA said. Jufri was allegedly in touch with the IS leadership currently operating out of Afghanistan and Pakistan. He had created multiple IDs on encrypted chat platforms and was part of several online propaganda channels of IS. During the searches in Bhatkal on Friday, NIA sleuths recovered digital devices like cellphones, hard disks and SD cards. NIA had held multiple searches in Jammu & Kashmir on July 11 and arrested three accused, Umar Nisar, Tanveer Ahmad Bhat and Rameez Ahmad Lone, all residents of Achabal in Anantnag. On Wednesday, the agency conducted simultaneous searches at five locations across India, including three in Kashmir, Bengaluru and Mangaluru, and arrested four operatives. From Ullal, sleuths picked up Ammar Abdul Rahman and Shankar Venkatesh Perumal from Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/man-held-for-suspected-is-links-in-karnatakas-bhatkal/articleshow/85118798.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt forms panel to plan school opening||NEW DELHI: The AAP government has received over 33,000 emails in response to its call last month for suggestions on reopening of educational institutions from students, parents and teachers. About 68% of those who sent their views were in favour of reopening schools while 83% wanted colleges to reopen. Some wanted both schools and colleges to resume functioning. During the series of parents-teachers meeting held recently at Delhi government schools, 90% of the 8 lakh parents who attended these meetings said that they wanted the schools to re-open. In the backdrop of this huge feedback from the people, DDMA on Friday decided to set up a committee of experts, with officials of education and health departments as members, to evaluate and finalise a detailed plan on the reopening of schools and other educational institutions. Panel to develop SOP, talk to all stakeholdersThe schools in Delhi have been closed since March 2020 due to the spread of Covid-19. In between, for classes IX to XII, the schools had been opened for completion of practical/project work. According to the government, a final decision on the reopening of the schools will be taken after the committee submits its report. The issue of reopening of educational institutions was discussed in detail during the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting. It was chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Dr VK Paul from NITI Aayog, Dr Randeep Guleria from AIIMS and Prof Balram Bhargava from ICMR, besides others. Sisodia expressed his concern over how the closure of schools for over a year had led to a major loss of learning and stressed that now it was time to reopen the schools. “The committee will finalise a detailed plan and develop a standard operating procedure, evaluate the preparedness of the schools to adhere to and implement SOPs, vaccination of teachers and staff of the schools, address concerns of parents of the students and involve all stakeholders in this decision,” said a government official. A few states have already opened their schools. While Punjab has opened all schools, Haryana has opened for students of classes IX to XII. Bihar and Himachal Pradesh have opened for students of class X and XII. Uttarakhand, too, has opened for a few classes and will be opening for the rest on August 16. Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, too, are in the process of re-opening of their schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-forms-panel-to-plan-school-opening/articleshow/85118801.cms||---

The accident occurred when the family was returning home after the boy was treated for appendicitis at a hospital in Sangareddy town. The deceased were P Vivek (6), his parents Ambadas (42) and Padma (30) of Sangaipet village, their friend U Luka (45) and his wife Deevena (42) of Rangampet village in Medak district. The accident occurred at 2.20 pm and all the occupants of the car died on the spot due to high-speed collision. Luka was behind the wheel. Jogipet police said Vivek’s parents asked Luka, brother of a priest, and his wife to accompany them and pray for quick recovery of Vivek. “Luka swerved to the right side of the road while trying to overtake a vehicle and dashed into the truck coming in the opposite direction,” Jogipet police said. It took some time for cops to recover the bodies from the mangled car. Police said Luka was booked in several negligent driving cases earlier.

The bodies were shifted to the local government hospital for postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/five-killed-as-car-crashes-into-truck-in-sangareddy/articleshow/85115460.cms||---
---||India||Apex court: Do not terrorise judges with voluminous petitions||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court sent out a loud message to all client-impressing advocates - Do not file voluminous petitions to terrorise the Judges and risk getting the hearing adjourned." Finding it difficult to go through a 51-volume appeals, each running to over 100 pages, filed by Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation against against a Bombay HC's judgment rejecting its petition challenging Telecom Regulatory Authority's New Tariff Order (NTO 2.0), a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant said, "The Supreme Court engaged trucks to carry these volumes of appeals to Judges residences to enable them read it and get prepared with the matter." "You cannot terrorise us by filing volumes and volumes of appeals. In this case there are 51 volumes in one petition. You sit together and file a single short convenient volume giving a synopsis of the issue to be adjudicated," the bench told senior advocates Darius Khambatta, Neeraj Kishan Kaul, Gopal Jain, Amit Sibal, who appeared for the appellants. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi with advocate Sanjay Kapur for TRAI said that it is a short issue and TRAI will file a two-page synopsis for the Judges' convenience. But, the CJI-led bench said, "You wait. Let them satisfy us with the merits of their appeal." The bench ordered - "We direct senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in all the matters to make a convenience volume of all the documents, in consultation with senior counsel for the respondents well in advance and circulate the same." The bench adjourned the hearing to August 18. IBF, an umbrella organisation for TV broadcasters, has challenged a Bombay HC judgment upholding TRAI's NTO 2.0, which set a cap of Rs 12 from the existing Rs 19 on pay channel prices. It was to ensure that an effective a-la-carte choice was available to distributors without being handicapped by perverse pricing of bouquets by broadcasters at wholesale level, said. TRAI justified its move as one in “public interest”. It had raised concerns over broadcasters creating bouquets with one or two leading channels and filling it with other less popular channels or even free-to-air channels, making it difficult for consumers to choose channels. The bench faced a similar situation in the appeals filed by Amazon and Flipkart against a decision of Karnataka High Court allowing an antitrust probe against the e-commerce majors by the Competition Commission of India. The CCI had acted on a complaint by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM) and Confederation of India Traders allegations that the e-commerce firms were abusing their market dominance and giving preference to select sellers and offering deep discounts after entering into anti-competitive agreements. Based on the 2019 complaint, the CCI had last year asked its director general to launch a probe into the alleged violation of Section 3 of the Competition Act. The CJI-led bench said, "Again volumes and volumes of petitions are filed. We know it is to terrorise us and not to allow the Judges to read it." Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said he had difficulty in going through the several volumes of petition and requested for adjournment to Monday. The CJI said, "What about us? We too need to read not only these volumes but other petitions listed before us today. But we are ready with the matter." Appearing for the e-commerce majors, senior advocates A M Singhvi and Sajan Poovayya agreed to file short synopsis of the appeals. SC adjourned hearing to August 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/apex-court-do-not-terrorise-judges-with-voluminous-petitions/articleshow/85118840.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The projects include Miralam tank in Hyderabad, Ramappa lake in Mulugu district, Bayyaram lake in Mahabubabad district, Ghanpur anicut in Medak, Ibrahimpatnam tank in Rangareddy district and Singa Samudram cheruvu in Rajanna Sircilla district. The International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) had invited nominations for WHIS recognition. Telangana confident of getting recognitionWe have sent six proposals and hopefully, we will get recognition for all the sites,” Sridhar Rao Deshpande, OSD (irrigation) in CMO, told TOI. For the 2021 ICID nominations, the last date was June 30, and a decision on WHIS recognition will be taken at the 72nd international executive council meeting of ICID in Morocco (Nov 24-30). On ICID parameters, an official said: “It should be an example of engineering marvel or excellence at the time of construction, unique in some positive way and reflect cultural tradition or a civilisation of the past and bear an outstanding example of management over a long period of time.” The ICID had recognised irrigation anicut Sadarmatt in Nirmal’s Medampally village and Pedda cheruvu in Kamareddy as WHIS during its 69th international executive council meeting in 2018. Sadarmatt anicut was built during 1891-92 across Godavari on the left bank, downstream of Sriram Sagar Project, to provide irrigated water to 13,100 acres. Pedda cheruvu was built by the Nizams in 1897.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/six-telangana-tanks-lakes-vying-for-world-heritage-tag/articleshow/85118729.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||Father can’t force child to use his surname: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday said that every child has the right to use the mother’s surname and a father can’t impose his will in this regard. “A father does not own the daughter to dictate that she should use only his surname. If the minor daughter is happy with her surname, what is your problem?” the court observed. It was hearing a plea by a minor girl’s father seeking directions to authorities to have his surname, and not her mother’s, reflect in the daughter’s ID documents. ‘All kids can use mom’s surname’Refusing any relief, justice Rekha Palli declined to pass any direction and wondered why the father moved court for such a direction. The court said every child has a right to use his or her mother’s surname and courts can’t intervene in such matters to force the father’s will upon a child against his or her wishes. During the hearing, the man’s counsel submitted that his daughter was a minor and could not decide such issues on her own, and that the child’s surname was changed by his estranged wife. He claimed that the change in name will make it difficult to avail insurance claims from the insurance firm as the policy was taken in the name of the girl with her father’s surname. But the court dismissed these as apprehensions and termed the plea “misconceived”. It nevertheless disposed of the petition granting liberty to the man to approach his daughter’s school to get his name recorded in the school records as the father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/father-cant-force-child-to-use-his-surname-delhi-high-court/articleshow/85118923.cms||Abhinav Garg

In the first phase, 30 air-conditioned ambulances with all live-saving devices will move to Bangladesh from the Petrapole border. During his trip to Dhaka in March, Modi had promised to provide the ambulances to help ferry patients in crisis and sent vaccines to Bangladesh soon after inoculations started in India. The mangoes of “Haribhanga” variety — a species of Bangladesh origin which is produced in Rangpur area — is a major delicacy as it has more fleshy part than other mangoes and for which it was sent to India, a Bangladesh diplomat said. The Indian high commission in Dhaka had written to the SDO Bongaon on Wednesday so that the ambulances are allowed to reach the Petrapole Customs check post on a priority basis. Sanjay Jain, second secretary (projects), Indian high commission, Dhaka wanted quick clearance of the ambulances. Kartick Chakraborty, secretary, Petrapole clearing agents’ association, said they were happy that India was sending the ambulances and it was being sent without any delay. Abhijit Mukherjee, superintendent of Customs at Petrapole, said everything was being made ready for the first consignment of the gift of ambulances to Bangladesh. He added that the ambulances will roll out on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/india-sending-109-ambulances-to-bangladesh-as-a-goodwill-gesture/articleshow/85115087.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Former Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee meets Abhishek, triggers buzz||KOLKATA: Former Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee, who had defected to BJP ahead of the assembly polls, had a half-an-hour meeting with Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee at the latter’s Camac Street office on Friday. Trinamool did not react to the development. Rajib too could not be reached for comments. The former minister had been sending feelers to TMC after his poll loss in Domjur and had issued statements questioning the BJP. The meeting on Friday triggered fresh speculation over his ‘ghar-wapsi’, but it would largely hinge on if and how the TMC is able to pacify the party’s rank and file who fought a bitter battle against Rajib and may resist his return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rajib-meets-abhishek-triggers-buzz/articleshow/85114990.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Two semesters, two exams for both ICSE and ISC||KOLKATA: The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which conducts the ICSE (Class X) and ISC (Class XII) board examinations, on Friday announced a decision to bifurcate each of the exams into two semesters, with the first semester exams to be conducted in November this year in online mode and the second semester in March/April 2022 either online or offline, depending on the Covid numbers. Each semester would cover approximately 50% of the syllabus. The decision was taken in view of the “continuing pandemic situation in the country and the disruption in educational activities... due to closure of schools”, the council said in a communique to school principals signed by Gerry Arathoon, its chief executive and secretary. CBSE, too, had on July 6 announced a similar decision to bifurcate its exams, adding its scheme would be continued beyond the pandemic. According to the notification, the first semester exam for both classes X and XII would comprise multiple choice questions (MCQ). This would be held online. The second semester could be either online or offline, which the council will announce later, taking a call based on the prevailing pandemic situation. “There will be no overlapping of syllabus and the final marks will be given on the basis of performance in both exams,” said a source. The question papers for each semester will be 80/100 marks for ICSE and 70/80 marks for ISC, in accordance with the maximum marks allocated for the theory component of each subject. However, the weightage of marks for each semester — to be finally used for computing the board results — would be brought down to half. ISC candidates will also have practicals and projects, for which the marks weightage remains the same. If the situation permits, ISC practicals will be held in school. The council has asked schools to maintain a proper record of these assessments and said it may even ask schools to send samples of work done by candidates. For ICSE candidates, internal assessment will also be taken into account, in addition to semester exams. Schools will be required to upload marks for practicals, project work, internal assessment and SUPW grades by a specified date at the end of each semester. While CISCE will conduct the two semester exams in classes X and XII, it has clarified that it will not be involved in the examinations for classes IX and XI. La Martiniere for Boys principal John Stephen said there would be a “curtailment” of teaching time. “We already have pre-Puja exams; now, there will be a post-Puja exam also.... We will have to somehow make up for it. I believe the council will employ its IT team to structure the MCQ question paper in a way that there will be automated correction,” he added. Heritage School principal, Seema Sapru, said: “We have already counted that there are 43 days before the Pujas, by which time a lot of ground will have to be covered.” Father Rodney Borneo, principal, St Augustine’s Shyamnagar, felt the new measures would bring much-needed relief to students reeling under an online overload.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-semesters-two-exams-for-both-icse-and-isc/articleshow/85116624.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

In March, a single-bench judge of Delhi high court headed by Justice Midha had noted that emergency arbitrator's (Singapore International Arbitration Centre: SIAC) interim award needs to be complied with in India. This had put a stay on the Rs 24,700-crore proposed deal between Future Group and Reliance Retail. "Future Retail is advised that it has remedies available in law, which it will exercise," said a Future Group spokesperson. "Future Retail intends to pursue all available avenues to conclude the deal to protect the interests of its stakeholders and workforce." "Future Retail has the option to file a special leave petition against the HC order before the SC or appeal a review petition in the same SC bench," said a person familiar with the development. "The interesting thing to understand is, what is Amazon's game plan given the current Indian FDI rules. Amazon needs to answer this question on their future plans with FRL," he said. Amazon, however, is waiting for the emergency arbitrator's ruling that is expected within a few weeks. SIAC had set up a tribunal to look into allegations by Amazon that Future Group had not maintained its contractual obligations by engaging with Reliance Retail for the deal. Before the deal, Amazon had bought a 49% stake in Future Coupons, a Future Group entity for Rs 1,500 crore. Future Coupons holds around 7% stake in Future Retail that gives Amazon direct stake of around 3.5% in Future Retail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/future-retail-may-file-special-leave-petition/articleshow/85118966.cms||John Sarkar

---||Kolkata||Bengal: CO2 leak on highway sparks panic in Burdwan||BURDWAN: Leaking carbon dioxide from a tanker on NH-2 sparked panic in East Burdwan’s Telepukur area early on Friday. Some people complained of mild breathing problems, but there were no aggravated medical emergencies till police and firemen brought the situation under control. Around 5am, thick, white fog-like clouds enveloped the carriageway and brought traffic to a grinding halt on Durgapur Expressway. According to police, a valve in a tanker carrying liquid carbon dioxide from a plant in Lucknow to a beverage factory in Dankuni developed a snag, leading carbon dioxide in liquid form to leak from the cryogenic container. Traffic police immediately closed NH-2 and also the Burdwan-Arambagh route. The leak was plugged following 30 minutes of concerted efforts by the tanker driver, cops and firemen. The tanker was then shifted to safety before traffic resumed on the highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/co2-leak-on-highway-sparks-panic-in-burdwan/articleshow/85115541.cms||Mohammad Asif
