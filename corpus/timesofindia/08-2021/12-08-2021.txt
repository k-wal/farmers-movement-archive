---||Hubballi||Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi, Kalaburagi corporation polls on Sept 3||BENGALURU/HUBBAALLI: The State Election Commission on Wednesday announced that long-delayed elections to Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi and Kalaburagi city corporations will be held on September 3 and results will be declared on September 6. Though results have no immediate impact on the state government, the elections will be a big test for new chief minister Basavaraj Bommai as the party is facing polls for the first time under his leadership. How the party performs at the hustings could set the tone for upcoming elections to zilla and taluk panchayats and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. Since the three corporations are in north Karnataka where JD(S) has no marked presence, it will be a direct fight between the Congress and BJP. While the BJP had emerged as the single largest party (one seat short of a simple majority) in the 82-ward Hubballi-Dharwad corporation in 2013, the Congress came victorious in Kalaburagi which has 55 seats. In the 58-ward Belagavi corporation, elections were not held on the party lines as per a pre-poll understanding among leaders from the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hubballi-dharwad-belagavi-kburagi-corpn-polls-on-sept-3/articleshow/85262634.cms||---

The suspended newspaper, Uhuru, is owned by the country's ruling party Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM), which has in effect been in power since 1961. The ban came after Uhuru on Wednesday on Wednesday a front-page story, "I Don't Have Intentions to Contest for Presidency in 2025 - Samia." "President Samia Suluhu Hassan has not said any information that she does not have intentions to contest for presidency in 2025," Gerson Msigwa, Tanzania's director of information services and chief spokesperson said in a statement. Hassan took office in March following the death of predecessor John Magufuli, nicknamed "the bulldozer," who downplayed the severity of Covid-19 and banned several newspapers during his six-year administration. Since taking office, Hassan has indicated a change in course, urging public vigilance on Covid-19 and instituting measures to curb its spread. In April, she said the government would re-instate media outlawed by Magufuli. Soon after, however, officials clarified that only online television would benefit from the measure but that banned newspapers could reapply for their licences. The ruling CCM party said Uhuru's board had already suspended three top officials managing the newspaper, including the CEO, over the story. The party was investigating what happened, CCM general secretary Daniel Chongolo told reporters. The suspension would last for 14 days and Uhuru could file an appeal to the minister of information, Msigwa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/tanzania-suspends-newspaper-for-story-on-president-it-calls-false/articleshow/85253230.cms||---

According to updated details on clinical trial record site clinicaltrials.gov, the study will now enroll an estimated 13,275 participants, nearly double the earlier target of 6,975 participants. In July, Moderna said it was in discussions with the US food & drug administration to expand the study with an objective to enroll a larger safety database, which increases the likelihood of detecting rarer events. The company's vaccine, which received its emergency authorization for people aged 18 and older in the United States in December, is currently under an FDA review for use in adolescents. Rival shot from Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech was authorized for ages 12 to 15 years earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/moderna-doubles-size-of-covid-19-vaccine-pediatric-study/articleshow/85253799.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||MEA: 998 illegal agencies offering jobs abroad; 29 are in Karnataka||BENGALURU: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) has flagged 998 illegal agencies recruiting people for jobs abroad from across the country. The list includes 29 agencies from Karnataka. The ministry has now asked state police to initiate action against them. These agencies are not registered with MEA as required and some of them face charges of cheating aspirants. Victims of these agencies raised complaints with MEA, seeking action against them. The list from the ministry has been shared with the regional protector of emigrants offices for further action. The same information will be shared with state police, who will carry out investigation. Delhi has 166 such firms, followed by Tamil Nadu (151) and Maharashtra (119). A source the office of the protector of emigrants here said while operating without registration is illegal, many of the agencies have been found to be charging exorbitant rates from aspirants and cheating the public of several lakhs of rupees. Several FIRs have already been filed in different police stations across the country and with protector of emigrants offices. The 29 firms in Karnataka have their office addresses in Bengaluru, Shivamogga, Mangaluru, Mysuru, Bhatkal and Belagavi. Some firms have addresses in other states, but their bank accounts are operational in Karnataka. According to sources, foreign job frauds are seeing a rise in the state, especially in coastal areas where aspirants are being duped by some agencies. Most of the gullible are being cheated with UAE job offers and the agencies are collecting thousands of rupees. The agencies are supposed to offer technical support, healthcare and other jobs in Gulf countries, but they rarely do so. The Covid-19 situation led to more instances of cheating as Indian healthcare workers are in demand globally. In Bengaluru, multiple FIRs were registered against firms which allegedly deceived job aspirants by taking huge sums of money. Shubham Singh, protector of emigrants, Bengaluru told TOI that according to Section 10 of Emigration Act, 1983, no person can function as a recruiting agent without a valid certificate. “In Karnataka, the office has shared details with the director general of police’s office for further action. We are also looking into several complaints; the registered agencies can charge up to a maximum of Rs 30,000,” Singh said. “We are investigating cases where unregistered companies are offering jobs abroad and cheating the public. At present, 33 authorised recruitment agencies are operating in the state,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mea-998-illegal-agencies-offering-jobs-abroad-29-are-in-karnataka/articleshow/85254356.cms||Kiran Parashar

A case has been booked against the dog dealer under IPC section 428 for causing mischief by killing or maiming an animal of the value of Rs 10 and above. “We have issued a notice to the suspect,” they said. Woman underwent surgery and asked dealer to look after puppiesComplainant Ramya (name changed) told cops she had bought two Shih Tzu puppies from the dog dealer in Wilson Garden in January. “I found his number online and he sold two Shih Tzus to me. Meanwhile, I underwent a leg surgery and was finding it difficult to look after the puppies. On July 25, I handed over the puppies to the dog dealer, requesting him to look after them,” she said. As part of the deal, Ramya was supposed to pay the dog dealer Rs 250 per day and he had to show them to her every day on video call. “For the next two days, I called him several times, hoping to see my puppies. But he would say he was outside. On July 28, he returned one puppy to me saying the other had died and he had cremated it near his house in Wilson Garden. He didn’t provide a proper explanation and has been avoiding my calls,” her complaint copy said. Ramya said the dead puppy’s name was Sweety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-accuses-dog-dealer-of-killing-shih-tzu-puppy/articleshow/85254583.cms||---
---||World||Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani tries to unite warlords as Taliban advance||ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani flew to Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday morning to rally his forces and to brainstorm with warlords, other private militia commanders, top security officials and politicians on how to stop a relentless Taliban advance that has seen nine provincial capitals fall to the insurgents in less than a week. Frequent security meetings have been held in Kabul’s presidential palace in the last two days, after which it was agreed that a joint command centre would be formed for "public uprising forces" to better manage, equip and strengthen them in the fight against the Taliban. This idea was first floated by Abdullah Abdullah last week. In Mazar-e-Sharif, Ghani, his aides and senior security officials met former Balkh governor Atta Mohammad Noor and the warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum to discuss the defence of the city. The loss of Mazar would represent the complete collapse of the government’s control over the north, a bastion of anti-Taliban militias. After arriving in Mazar, Dostum issued a warning to the approaching Taliban, AFP reported. "The Taliban never learn from the past," he told reporters, vowing to kill the insurgents. "The Taliban have come to the north several times but they were always trapped. It is not easy for them to get out." The Taliban have so far captured the provincial capitals Faizabad, Farah, Pul-e-Khumri, Sar-e-Pul, Sheberghan, Aybak, Kunduz, Taluqan and Zaranj. All the leaders that Ghani has met in the last three days have exercised significant influence for decades in parts of the war-ravaged country. Among the prominent leaders who had attended the meetings in Kabul were Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the Afghan High Council for National Reconciliation; Abdul Rab Rasul Sayyaf, Mohammad Yunus Qanooni, the warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, former vice-president Mohammad Karim Khalili, second vice-president Mohammad Sarwar Danesh, presidential adviser and head of the People’s Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan Mohammad Mohaqiq, and a senior member of the Hizb-e-Wahdat, Sadiq Mudabir. "Political leaders of the country unanimously agreed on mobilisation, strengthening and the rapid equipping of public uprising forces within the framework of the government to fight the Taliban," presidential spokesman Latif Mahmoud was quoted by Afghan media as saying. During the meetings, the leaders stressed the Herat model would be followed in other parts of the country. In Herat, the militants had entered the city but were driven out by the militiamen with the support of Afghan forces under the command of 75-year old Ismail Khan. Sources said that a decision was also taken to appoint key political leaders to the command centre. The political leaders, sources confided, will focus on mobilisation of people in various areas to fight the militants. "The politicians involved in the matter will determine how many forces they can mobilise and in which areas they will fight the Taliban," Afghan government sources said, adding that political leaders had suggested to Ghani that he entrust a great part of military responsibility to Dostum. The meeting, an Afghan official said, discussed coordination between the defence and security forces, mobilisation of public uprising forces and the launching of clearance operations in cities that have fallen to the Taliban since Friday.

---||World||Pakistan NSA blames Indian, Afghan social media accounts for anti-Pakistan propaganda||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan claimed on Wednesday that social media accounts were operated from India and Afghanistan to malign Pakistan as Kabul had failed to halt the territorial gains of the invading Taliban. Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf, flanked by information minister Fawad Chaudhry, said at a press conference that attempts were being made to blame Pakistan for Afghanistan’s failures. "A targeted, deliberate and conscious disinformation campaign has been constantly run by accounts in India and Afghanistan, some of which are linked to the state apparatus, in order to defame Pakistan in the international arena," Yusuf claimed. The NSA claimed the five top themes used by the elements involved in anti-Pakistan propaganda are to discredit the Pakistani government and military, fan sub-nationalism, target the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), keep Pakistan on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list and blame Pakistan for all the chaos in Afghanistan. Yusuf said senior Afghan officials, including his Afghan counterpart, were involved in such campaigns, adding that the government would expose everything through data. Earlier, the information minister claimed that Twitter trends, analysed by Pakistan government teams from June 2019 to August 2021, showed that India led the top trends against Pakistan and that the biggest player to have helped India was PTM (Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, a Pashtun rights group) and its activists. Giving a breakdown of a few trends allegedly based on disinformation, Chaudhry said the PTM had initiated 150 trends, consisting of 3.7 million tweets, against Pakistan in the last two years. The PTM, the minister said, had also actively supported Baloch activism and, on August 14, 2020, the hashtag ‘#BalochistanSolidarityDay’ had trended, allegedly with massive support from India, with around 150,000 tweets posted with the hashtag by Indian activists in a single day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-nsa-blames-indian-afghan-social-media-accounts-for-anti-pakistan-propaganda/articleshow/85254691.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Morocco, Israel sign deals to mark historic visit||RABAT: The foreign ministers of Morocco and Israel signed three accords on Wednesday during the first visit by a top official from the Jewish state since ties were normalised last year. Nasser Bourita and his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid signed agreements on political consultations, aviation and culture. Lapid told reporters the accords would "bring our countries innovation and opportunities for the benefit of our children - and their children - for years to come". Israel and Morocco struck a deal last year after then US president Donald Trump recognised Morocco's contested sovereignty in Western Sahara. "Today, we are restoring peace, restoring friendship," Lapid said. Morocco was the fourth Arab state to establish ties with Israel last year after the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan. The move infuriated the Palestinians, as it shattered the longstanding Arab consensus that there should be no normalisation until Israel agrees to a comprehensive and lasting peace. Bourita said that during his talks with Lapid the situation in Israel and the Palestinian Territories was raised. "King Mohammed VI insists on the need to break the current impasse and resume negotiations, as the only means of reaching a solution based on two states living side by side on the 1967 borders," Bourita said. The monarch had reassured Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas after the normalisation of ties that Morocco would continue to support the Palestinian cause. "It is urgent that measures be taken today to restore confidence and maintain calm, to open a political horizon to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," Bourita said. Lapid said he preferred to focus on the normalisation of ties between Israel and Arab countries. "Something is happening in the region," he said. On Thursday, Lapid will officially open Israel's diplomatic representation in the capital Rabat. The American embassy in Rabat called Lapid's visit "a major step forward", in a message on Twitter. "Strengthening this relationship will create new opportunities for peace and prosperity to flourish in the region," the embassy added. It listed the "real benefits" created including "direct commercial flights, economic cooperation, and the opening of liaison offices". Before the Bourita-Lapid meeting, the Israeli delegation visited the royal mausoleum, where kings Hassan II and Mohammed V are buried. Lapid is also expected to visit the Beth-El synagogue in Casablanca on his two-day visit, the Israeli foreign ministry said. "Proud to represent Israel during this historic visit," Lapid wrote on Twitter, just after his flight operated by Israeli national airline El Al landed. His visit comes a little over two weeks after direct flights were launched between Israel and Morocco. Since then, the first Israeli tourists have flooded into Morocco's tourist magnet Marrakesh, and into Casablanca. Before the pandemic, between 50,000 and 70,000 Israeli tourists - mainly of Moroccan origin - had visited annually, albeit by transiting through third countries. The North African country hosts the Arab world's largest Jewish community of some 3,000 people. They are the remnant of a once much larger community. Some 700,000 Jews of Moroccan descent now live in Israel. Morocco and Israel maintained liaison offices in the 1990s, before closing them during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, that raged from 2000 to 2005. Lapid's visit to Rabat follows a June trip to the United Arab Emirates, where he inaugurated the new Israeli embassy in Abu Dhabi. It comes just days before Israel is due to require all travellers returning from Morocco to quarantine following a review of the risks of Covid-19 infection. Last December Israel and Morocco signed agreements on water, aviation and finance, when a delegation of Israeli officials arrived on a first direct flight between Rabat and Tel Aviv. And in July, the two countries signed a cyber defence cooperation accord in Rabat. Lapid's trip comes after rights groups last month accused Morocco of having used the Israeli spyware programme Pegasus. Rabat strongly denied the reports and said it was suing the rights groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/morocco-israel-sign-deals-to-mark-historic-visit/articleshow/85255063.cms||---

---||World||Covid: Oregon issues mask mandate, warns of hospital surge||PORTLAND: Governor Kate Brown on Tuesday announced a statewide indoor mask requirement due to the spike in coronavirus hospitalizations and cases, warning that the state's health care system could be overwhelmed. Beginning Friday, everyone who is 5 years or older in Oregon (regardless of their vaccination status) will be required to wear masks in indoor public spaces. Brown had urged local officials to implement their own mandates, but almost none did. The newest coronavirus health and safety measure in Oregon applies to all indoor public spaces, including businesses, grocery stores, indoor entertainment venues and gyms. In addition, people older than two years old will be required to wear masks on public transit. There are some mask exemptions for activities, including eating, drinking, swimming and organized sports. The mask mandate comes as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations spiral out of control, reaching record numbers for the state. On Tuesday, 635 people were hospitalized in Oregon because of coronavirus, surpassing the state's previous record of 622 people hospitalized during November's surge when vaccine doses were not yet available. Health officials warned that, without new health and safety interventions in place, coronavirus hospitalizations would far exceed Oregon's health system capacity in the next several weeks. "Oregon is facing a spike in Covid-19 hospitalizations, consisting overwhelmingly of unvaccinated individuals, that is quickly exceeding the darkest days of our winter surge,'' Brown said. "When our hospitals are full, there will be no room for additional patients needing care, whether for Covid-19, a heart attack or stroke, a car collision, or a variety of other emergency situations.'' Throughout the pandemic, health officials have described Oregon as a success story as it has had some of the lowest coronavirus case and death rates nationally - largely in part because of the state's strict restrictions, which were lifted at the end of June. As the delta variant began rapidly spreading across the state last month, Brown turned to county officials giving them local control on whether or not to implement mask mandates. "From the beginning of this pandemic, city and county leaders have asked me for local control and the ability to make local public health decisions when it comes to Covid-19,'' Brown said. Earlier this month, the governor announced that masks would be required in K-12 schools and in any indoor state agency building. In addition the state health authority made a statewide recommendation that people, vaccinated or not, wear masks while in indoor public spaces, but again stopped short of reinstating an indoor mask mandate. As coronavirus cases spiked, there continued to be inaction by nearly all of the state's counties. A few counties issued mask mandates for county agency buildings. However only one county, Multnomah, announced a mask requirement for all public indoor spaces. The Associated Press reached out to each Oregon's 36 counties this month to ask about plans to implement mask mandates. Out of the 16 counties that responded, nearly all indicated that they were concerned about the rise in coronavirus cases but only one had issued an indoor mask mandate and most gave a resounding "No'' when asked if they had plans to issue one. "At this point, those who are most likely to adhere to a mask mandate are already vaccinated, so I'm not convinced new mandates will be all that effective in containing the Delta variant,'' Gilliam County Judge Elizabeth Farrar Campbell said. While county officials said they felt the decision to implement mask requirements should be a local decision, some health officials urged the governor to issue a statewide mandate as hospitals became overwhelmed with an influx of Covid-19 patients. "OHSU believes the entire state should be masking,'' Renee Edwards, the chief medical officer at Oregon Health & Science University, said Monday. "I recognize this is being decided at a local level, but every community's actions will lead to consequences at a state and even a global level.'' In a final call to action, Brown met with county leaders and elected officials last week and urged them to institute mask requirements. "The latest science is clear: although unvaccinated individuals are more likely to contract the disease, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people can spread the Delta variant,'' Brown said. "Masks are a simple and effective way to make sure you are not unknowingly infecting your friends, family members, neighbors, and colleagues.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-oregon-issues-mask-mandate-warns-of-hospital-surge/articleshow/85254595.cms||---

The mostly white mock temple will be on show in Mexico City's bustling main square, the Zocalo, close to the ruins of the real Templo Mayor, where the Aztecs venerated two main deities with elaborate pageantry and sacrificial offerings. The temple was destroyed by Spanish forces after their 1521 conquest and subsequent razing of Tenochtitlan, which became Mexico City. A colonial-era Roman Catholic cathedral was built next to where the temple once stood, using many stones from the toppled shrine. At 16 meters (52 feet) high, it will be the biggest ever replica of the Templo Mayor, according to Mexico's culture ministry. Archaeologists say the original temple was as high as a 15-story building. "For the (Aztecs) it was the center of the universe. It was the point at which one could enter the underworld and the different celestial levels," said Argel Gomez, the ministry's general festival director. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday will attend a ceremony at the Zocalo commemorating five centuries since the fall of Tenochtitlan to Hernan Cortes, the leader of the Spanish invaders. Lopez Obrador had previously sought an apology from Spain and the Vatican for human rights abuses committed during the conquest of what is modern-day Mexico.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexico-builds-replica-aztec-temple-to-mark-500-years-since-spanish-conquest/articleshow/85255290.cms||---

The spat erupted last month when Taiwan, which China considers to be part of its territory, said it was setting up a representative office in Vilnius under the name "Taiwan" instead of "Taipei" an act Beijing interprets as a diplomatic insult. In protest, the Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday demanded that Lithuanian Ambassador Diana Mickeviciene be recalled, and said it would withdraw the Chinese envoy to Lithuania. Mickeviciene had just travelled back to the Chinese capital when she was told she would have to return to Vilnius as soon as possible. "I have just arrived in Beijing, to be informed that I am being asked to leave," she told AFP in an email late Wednesday. Mickeviciene added she has to undergo a mandatory 21-day quarantine "but will be leaving once it is over and I am able to move". Lithuania's foreign ministry expressed regret over Beijing's decision. "While respecting the principle of one China, (Lithuania) is determined to develop mutually beneficial relations with Taiwan," the ministry said in a statement. The European Union echoed the "regret" at Beijing's response, which marked the first time China has recalled an envoy from a member of the bloc over a Taiwanese office. China's foreign ministry reiterated Wednesday that the establishment of an office under the name Taiwan "severely harms Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, and severely violates the One China Principle". "China has the right and should make a legitimate and reasonable response," spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. China tries to keep Taipei isolated on the world stage and rejects any official use of the word "Taiwan" in case it lends the island a sense of international legitimacy. It cut official contact with Taiwan and ramped up diplomatic pressure after the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who rejects Beijing's stance that the self-ruled island is part of "one China" and instead views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/lithuania-envoy-in-beijing-to-leave-china-over-taiwan-dispute/articleshow/85255628.cms||---

State department spokesman Ned Price made the comments as envoys from the United States, China, Russia and other countries met in Doha with Taliban and Afghan government negotiators in a bid to break a deadlock in peace talks. The Islamist insurgents pressed offensives across Afghanistan that have overrun at least eight provincial capitals, and a US defense official, citing US intelligence, said they could isolate Kabul in 30 days and possibly take it in 90 days. Speaking at a briefing, Price said the Taliban are violating "the letter and the spirit" of the February 2020 US-Taliban deal for a withdrawal of all American troops from the United States' longest war. The Taliban committed to intra-Afghan talks on a peace accord that lead to a "permanent and comprehensive ceasefire," Price said. "All indications at least suggest the Taliban are instead pursuing a battlefield victory." "Attacking provincial capitals and targeting civilians is inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement," he said. The Taliban deny targeting civilians. The United States has not fulfilled some of the commitments it made in the deal, including withdrawing all of its forces from Afghanistan by May 1. The last are due to depart by August 31. Price noted that US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad and his Russian, Chinese and Pakistani counterparts and officials from other countries and international organizations began talks in Doha with the Taliban and Kabul negotiators on Tuesday. "It is our intention to forge consensus and to have the international community speak with one voice" on the need for a peace deal, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/taliban-appear-intent-on-battlefield-victory-state-department/articleshow/85256384.cms||---

During the peak of the second wave in April, the number of cases had gone up to 11,600, the highest so far ever since the pandemic struck. Cases went on an upswing from 700 active cases on February 8 to reach 11k by April 4 when daily cases were recorded at 1,441, the highest single day till date, which has dropped to below 100 now. The substantial dip in active cases has led to the closure of as many as 10 Covid care centres. The NMMC has kept the Cidco Exhibition Centre Covid care facility open for fresh admissions. The recovery rate has also improved to 97.24% in NMMC areas. This has also surpassed the recovery rate of the pre-second wave period. The recovery rate went down to 88% soon after the second wave picked up in March and part of April. Active cases dipped to 958 now, leading to zero occupancy in as many as 10 Covid care centres out of 15. The recovery rate was 97% in February, the highest recovery percentage before the second wave which dropped steadily to 88% by early April. Falling of daily cases started there after commensurate with increase in recovery numbers. According to NMMC sources, the number of recoveries daily has surpassed the number of daily new cases with effective containment measures. Out of 958 active cases now, as many as 285 people are being quarantined at Covid care centres and 215 in home isolation whereas the rest are being treated at covid hospitals. NMMC sources said that Vashi Exhibition centre Covid-19 facility is well equipped with all facilities to cater to the needs of Covid-19 affected people and remaining centres will remain closed until 80% of the available beds are occupied at the Exhibition centre. “Now we have recorded a 97.24% recovery rate with the help of various containment measures and monitoring of safety protocols across the city. The situation is improving every passing day. However, we have to be very cautious in view of the possible third wave, which may hit anytime from now,” said NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar. The number of daily positive cases has dropped significantly and is now in the range of 40 to 80.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/active-covid-cases-drop-to-below-1000-in-nmmc/articleshow/85256607.cms||B B Nayak

Police have arrested the manager and owner of the lodge. A trap was laid by the team at Roma Lodge near Rohinjan toll post on August 9 and a 26-year-old decoy customer was sent to the lodge. The decoy customer demanded a prostitute, who took Rs 2,000 and provided a woman in a room of the lodge. The decoy customer then sent an SMS to the senior inspector waiting with his team outside the lodge for conducting a raid. The police team then raided the lodge and rescued the woman. The cops searched the lodge and found five more women in the premises, who were being provided for prostitution. When questioned, the rescued woman told the police that out of the Rs 2,000 given by the customer, Rs 500 is given to her and the remaining Rs 1,500 is kept by the lodge manager and owner. Hence, the duo accused were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/six-women-rescued-from-prostitution-racket-at-taloja-lodge-two-arrested/articleshow/85256693.cms||George Mendonca

---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Sub-inspector and constable booked for Rs 4.5 lakh graft||NAVI MUMBAI: The APMC Police has registered an FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act against a police sub-inspector and a constable, attached to the APMC police station. The PSI had allegedly demanded Rs 4.5 lakh as bribe for not making an employee of grain trader Chandulal Gajra, an accused, in a case of embezzlement registered under section 408 of the IPC by Gajra on July 11. The grain trader had alleged that his employees were involved in embezzling Rs 5 lakh from his office by manipulating the accounts. DCP (Zone-1) Suresh Mengade said, “Accused PSI Pankaj Mahajan has been transferred to police control room and a departmental inquiry has been initiated against him and his aide constable Sunil Pawar.” In July, complainant Yogesh Bhanushali (28) had met PSI Mahajan at APMC police station, seeking bail for his two friends arrested in the case registered by Gajra. Mahajan told Yogesh that his friend Vishal Bhanushali, an employee of Gajra, too will be arrested in this case. Mahajan allegedly asked Bhanushali to mediate and demanded Rs 1.5 lakh for a senior police officer and Rs 3.50 lakh for himself to ensure that Vishal is not arrested. Hence, Bhanushali mediated and gave Mahajan a sum of Rs 1.4 lakh, which was arranged by Vishal. As, Mahajan kept demanding the remaining Rs 3.5 lakh for himself, Bhanushali lodged a complaint at Thane ACB office with inspector Suresh Chopade. On July 30, the ACB team laid a trap outside APMC police station, but it was not successful, as Mahajan and his aide Pawar noticed an electronic voice recorder device hidden by Bhanushali inside his vest, while they were having conversation in which Mahajan claimed he had accepted Rs 1.4 lakh for a senior police officer and demanded Rs 3.5 lakh for himself. The device was provided by the ACB for verification of the complaint. When the duo questioned Bhanushali about the device, he tried to run away. But he was chased and caught by Mahajan and Pawar. Bhanushali then gave the voice recorder to ACB inspector Chopade. The conversation recorded in the device allegedly confirmed the bribe demand by PSI Mahajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/sub-inspector-and-constable-booked-for-4-5-lakh-graft/articleshow/85256703.cms||George Mendonca

The quake was at a depth of 65.6km, the USGS said. Broadcaster CNN reported the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) as initially saying damage and aftershocks were expected. There were no early reports of significant shocks or damage, however. Phivolcs also said there was tsunami threat to the country, while the US national weather service and Hawaii emergency management said there was no risk of a tsunami for the US West Coast or Hawaii either.

On Tuesday, the government had informed the Lok Sabha that two ‘outsiders’ had purchased two properties in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019. Rai said that after August 5, 2019, all provisions of the Constitution of India were made applicable to J&K, which necessitated changes in existing laws in the UT by Adaptation Orders, so as to conform with the provisions of the Constitution of India. Apart from adapting the land laws, the Jammu and Kashmir Big Landed Estates Abolition Act, 1950 – which transferred land to the tillers and prescribed a limit to right of ownership of 182 standard kanals (22.75 acres), was repealed. In its place, another legislation i.e. The Jammu & Kashmir Agrarian Reforms Act, 1976, was brought for transfer of land to tillers which is in force. This Act prescribes ceiling restriction of 100 standard kanals (12.5 acres), Rai informed the House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/non-agricultural-land-in-jammu-kashmir-can-be-transferred-to-outsiders-says-government/articleshow/85256937.cms||Bharti Jain

---||World||Sudan 'to hand over' Bashir for international war crimes trial||KHARTOUM: Sudan will hand longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court along with two other officials wanted over the Darfur conflict, officials said Wednesday. Bashir, 77, has been wanted by The Hague-based ICC for more than a decade over charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Sudanese region. The United Nations says 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million displaced in the Darfur conflict, which erupted in the vast western region in 2003. The "cabinet decided to hand over wanted officials to the ICC," Foreign Minister Mariam al-Mahdi was quoted as saying by state news agency SUNA, without giving a time frame. The cabinet's decision to hand him over came during a visit by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, but it still needs the approval of Sudan's ruling sovereign council, comprised of military and civilian figures. On Wednesday, Khan met the sovereign council's leader, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, its deputy chair. Daglo said Sudan "is prepared to cooperate with the ICC", SUNA reported. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who also met Khan, said Wednesday that "Sudan's commitment to seek justice is not only to abide by its international commitments, but it comes out of a response to the people's demands". It remains unclear if Bashir would be extradited to face trial in The Hague, or could remain in Sudan. Volker Perthes, UN Special Representative to Sudan, said Wednesday that the ICC "can help" with the "establishment of (a) Special Court for Darfur", without giving further details. The transitional authorities have previously said they would hand Bashir over, but one stumbling block was that Sudan was not party to the court's founding Rome Statute. But last week Sudan's cabinet voted to ratify the Rome Statute, a crucial move seen as one step towards Bashir potentially facing trial. ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah did not comment on the announcement, saying Khan was "in Khartoum to discuss cooperation matters", but that the prosecutor would hold a press conference on Thursday afternoon. In Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price praised Sudan's decision, saying handing over Bashir "would be a major step for Sudan in the fight against decades of impunity". In December, Washington removed Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, and later also vowed to clear the country's arrears with the World Bank. Bashir, who ruled Sudan with an iron fist for three decades before being deposed amid popular protests in 2019, is behind bars in Khartoum's high security Kober prison. He is jailed alongside two other former top officials facing ICC war crimes charges, ex-defence minister Abdel Rahim Mohamed Hussein and Ahmed Haroun, a former governor of South Kordofan. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Bashir in 2009 for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, later adding genocide to the charges. Bashir was ousted by the military and detained in April 2019 after four months of mass nationwide protests against his rule. The former strongman was convicted in December 2019 for corruption, and has been on trial in Khartoum since July 2020 for the Islamist-backed 1989 coup which brought him to power. He faces the death penalty if found guilty. Sudan has been led since August 2019 by a transitional civilian-military administration that has vowed to bring justice to victims of crimes committed under Bashir. The Darfur war broke out in 2003 when non-Arab rebels took up arms complaining of systematic discrimination by Bashir's Arab-dominated government. Khartoum responded by unleashing the notorious Janjaweed militia, recruited from among the region's nomadic peoples. Human rights groups have long accused Bashir and his former aides of using a scorched earth policy, raping, killing, looting and burning villages. Khartoum signed a peace deal last October with key Darfuri rebel groups, with some of their leaders taking top jobs in government, although violence continues to dog the region. But after years of conflict, the arid and impoverished region remains awash with automatic weapons and clashes still erupt, often over land and access to water. Last year, alleged senior Janjaweed militia leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd al-Rahman, also known by the nom de guerre Ali Kushayb, surrendered to the court, where he faces charges of murder, rape and torture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/sudan-to-hand-over-bashir-for-international-war-crimes-trial/articleshow/85257758.cms||---

Before the passport can be created Ottawa needs to agree on a common approach with the 10 provinces and three northern territories, which are responsible for inoculations against Covid-19. It "is a key step forward in ensuring Canadians will have the documents they need once it is safe to travel again," immigration minister Marco Mendicino told reporters. The European Union has a vaccine passport system that allows people to travel freely within the region. A number of other countries are working on vaccine passports for both domestic use and international travel. Canada has one of the best inoculation records in the world.

---||India||How India put together first standalone UNSC session on maritime security||NEW DELHI: At least two previous attempts to address the issue of maritime security in the UN Security Council went nowhere. Vietnam had tried to push it in April 2021 and Equatorial Guinea in February 2019, without success. In the lexicon of current global politics, “maritime security” is code for Chinese actions in the South China Sea. Being extraordinarily sensitive to this, China has nixed previous attempts. India was determined to make an impression in its month at the helm of the UNSC, and used its considerable diplomatic heft to put together the first standalone session on maritime security, which went beyond piracy and crime. The final presidential statement which was adopted set out a framework of existing international laws to govern activities at sea — from UNCLOS to the SUA Convention and a host of others in between. By reaffirming these laws, the message was that enforcing a rules-based order was something countries would push. The final presidential statement didn’t try to over-reach sticking to subjects that would be acceptable to all members. Indian negotiators were at work on document for the past couple of months, trying to get everyone on board. Territorial sovereignty issues don’t find mention, neither does illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, both of which were objected to by China. Chinese fishing militia has been linked to overfishing in seas as far away as South America, while China’s aggressive island building and bullying in South China Sea has made all of south-east Asia nervous. However, since almost all the speakers dwelt at length on the issue of territorial sovereignty and the importance of UNCLOS, it wouldn’t have pleased the Chinese. That was also why Beijing was represented by deputy permanenet representative Dai Bing, as a deliberate snub to India and the proceedings. The outcome document re-established the primacy of international law – UNCLOS, as the legal framework applicable to activities in the oceans, including countering illicit activities at sea. The outcome document also focused on strengthening cooperation for maritime safety and security, including against piracy and armed robbery at sea and terrorist activities, as well as against all forms of transnational organised crimes and other illicit activities. The other deliverables include stressing freedom of navigation and protection of cross-border infrastructure. PM Narendra Modi personally wrote to all the heads of government to attend the session, which is established courtesy. Of the P-5, Putin was the only attendee at that level, which the Indian side appreciated as a significant gesture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-india-put-together-first-standalone-unsc-session-on-maritime-security/articleshow/85257957.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||World||Texas governor's ban on mask mandates dealt second legal blow||Texas Governor Greg Abbott's statewide ban on mask mandates has hit its second legal setback, as a judge in Dallas County temporarily blocked it from being enforced amid a nationwide rise in new coronavirus cases.  The temporary order by Judge Tonya Parker issued late on Tuesday allows officials in the state's second-most populous county to require masks indoors, despite Abbott's July order against such mandates. A hearing on Aug. 24 will determine whether to extend the temporary order.  The top elected official in Dallas County, Judge Clay Jenkins, who sought the court order issued late Tuesday, said preventative steps such as mask-wearing are needed to combat a spike in new cases of Covid-19.  "Models predict ongoing dramatic increases in cases and hospitalizations over the coming weeks that will exceed the peak earlier this year unless behavior change takes place," he said Tuesday on Twitter.  The Dallas Independent School District had already defied Abbott's order, saying on Monday that it would also require masks.  Earlier on Tuesday, another Texas court granted an order at least until Monday that enables officials in San Antonio and Bexar Counties to require that masks be worn in public schools.  Spurred by the Delta variant, the country's coronavirus cases have spiked to their highest levels in more than six months, according to a Reuters tally. New US cases have increased more than five-fold over the past month with the seven-day average hitting 118,000 on Tuesday.  Oregon and Washington state are also grappling with surges in cases and hospitalizations as the outbreak spreads beyond the epicenter in the US South.  On Tuesday, Oregon reported both a record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients as well as its largest one-day increase in cases, with over 2,300 new infections.  Oregon Governor Kate Brown on Wednesday is expected to announced all state executive branch employees must be vaccinated, and she is also expected to reimpose a statewide indoor mask mandate, according to local media reports.  In neighboring Washington, cases and hospitalizations have climbed sharply so far in August.  Three sparsely populated counties have asked the state health department to send a "strike team" after Covid infections tripled in Ferry and Stevens counties and doubled in Pend Oreille County in the past two weeks, straining the local hospitals.  Of those new cases, 97.4% were in residents not fully vaccinated, according to the website of the Northeast Tri County Health District, which requested the state assistance. Southern epicenter The Covid outbreak is still the worst in Southern states based on new cases and hospitalizations per capita in recent weeks.  Arkansas, Florida and Louisiana are all reporting record Covid-19 hospitalizations in recent days. On Tuesday, Mississippi reported a record one-day rise in cases of nearly 3,500 and the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients is nearing the record the state set in January.  Abbott and fellow Republican Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida have faced local uprisings against their statewide orders that prevent local officials from deciding whether to require that masks be worn.  Florida's Broward County school board on Tuesday flouted an order by DeSantis that outlaws mask requirements in the state, prompting the administration of US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to say it was considering supporting the school districts financially if DeSantis retaliates against them by withholding funds from officials' salaries.  Over the past seven days, Florida had the country's second-highest rate of new infections based on population, while Texas had the 10th highest, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Florida set a record for the number of Covid patients hospitalized for 10 days in a row, with 15,449 patients on Wednesday, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/texas-governors-ban-on-mask-mandates-dealt-second-legal-blow/articleshow/85258102.cms||---

She had spoken of the threats she had received from the men, the court said, and the statement which came after that could not, therefore, be taken at face value. “The statement in favour of the accused cannot negate those made earlier. What she said in her complaint to the police, statement to the magistrate and the doctor (who examined her) remain consistent. It is only during cross-examination that she changed her statement,” additional district and sessions judge Nirdosh Kumar said in the verdict. “She had clearly said earlier that the men had threatened to kill her if she told anyone.” On October 28, 2014, the woman had stepped out to get fodder for her cattle. “Around noon, three men from her village, Chaman (Singh), Omvir (Singh) and Amit (Singh) came by, abusing her verbally and asking her where she’d hidden a sack of sugar. When she said she didn’t know anything, they accosted her. Chaman threw her to the ground and pointed a gun at her. Then they gang-raped her,” the prosecution had told the court. She went home and told her mother-in-law. They filed a police complaint and the three men were booked for gang-rape, criminal intimidation and robbery. In 2016, the court proceedings began. The woman then recorded her statement before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, in which she said she had been gang-raped, her gold earrings ripped off her ears and threatened against telling anyone “or she would be killed”. When she was cross-examined four months later, she said she didn’t have her glasses on when she was gang-raped and couldn’t identify the men. “But the judge, Nirdosh Kumar, referred to several cases and Law Commission observations on why witnesses turn hostile. He mentioned that ‘threat and intimidation’ is one of the main reasons for hostility of witnesses in cases of sexual offences against women in India,” additional district government counsel Santosh Srivastava told TOI. “The court also said she is a widow from a rural area and has no one to stand by her. In such a situation, it is easy for the accused to pressure her into backing off.” The court said, “It is evident that a helpless, poor widow was gang-raped at gunpoint … The men are convicted under sections 376(g) (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC … The survivor must be charged under Section 344 of the CrPC (giving false evidence).” The convicts have to pay Rs 20,000 each as a fine, failing which a year’s imprisonment will be added to their sentences.

---||World||Taliban denies killing civilians, calls for independent inquiry||The Taliban on Wednesday denied targeting and killing civilians during an offensive against Afghan government troops, calling for an independent investigation and seeking to assure Afghans that "no home or family shall face any threat from our side." The Islamist militants issued a statement after the United Nations said more than 1,000 civilians had been killed in the past month and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that since August 1 some 4,042 wounded people had been treated at 15 health facilities. Taliban fighters have stepped up their campaign to defeat the US-backed government since April as foreign forces started to withdraw after 20 years of war. The group has seized eight provincial capitals in the past week, raising fears of a return to power of the hardline group. Taliban spokesperson, Suhail Shaheen, said in a statement that the group "has not targeted any civilians or their homes in any locality, rather the operations have been undertaken with great precision and caution." He instead blamed Afghan government troops and foreign forces for any civilian deaths. The United States refuted the Taliban's denial of responsibility. "There is, everywhere you look, compelling data points, evidence, imagery of the violence, the bloodshed, the potential atrocities that the Taliban are committing," US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. "We have see it with our own eyes, from some of the footage that's emerging." The Taliban proposed that a team made up of the United Nations, ICRC and other aid groups accompany their representatives "to conduct an impartial and independent investigation into the latest events." A spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Afghanistan's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since the start of the year nearly 390,000 people have been newly displaced by the Afghan conflict with a "huge spike" since May, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Wednesday. "Between July 1 and August 5, 2021, the humanitarian community verified that 5,800 internally displaced persons and arrived in Kabul," Dujarric said. Foreign forces aim to be completely out of Afghanistan by September 11. US-backed Afghan forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 for refusing to hand over al Qaeda's Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-denies-killing-civilians-calls-for-independent-inquiry/articleshow/85258213.cms||---

The massive landslide between Chaura and Nigulsari, along NH-5 in Kinnaur district, occurred at about 12.30 pm. The death toll is likely to increase as around 50 people were feared trapped under the debris and around 30 others are missing. On July 25, a mountain-slide near Batseri village, in Kinnaur, had killed nine people. “Search and rescue operations have been initiated on a war-footing. A large number of casualties are expected. The landslide is still active, which has made operations very risky and difficult,” Bhawanagar SDM Manmohan Singh said. Kinnaur deputy commissioner Abid Hussain Sadiq said 15 persons had been rescued. Rescue efforts were suspended due to darkness later in the evening and will resume early Thursday morning. The Dogra Scouts will assist in the search for a missing HRTC bus and a Bolero SUV feared buried in debris along the steep slopes. Following Wednesday’s landslide, a 200-metre stretch of the Kinnaur-Shimla national highway was initially blocked by rubble. While NH-5 has been cleared, traffic movement had not begun when reports last came in. According to Kinnaur district administration officials, three small vehicles and one tipper (truck) were recovered from the spot. CM Jai Ram Thakur said a rescue operation had been launched from both sides of the landslide site and efforts were on to rescue those trapped under the debris. He said Army teams and two helicopters had been called in to speed up the rescue operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/10-killed-30-missing-in-second-himachal-pradesh-landslide-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/85258278.cms||---
---||World||Hochul: NY government's office won't be toxic workplace on my watch||ALBANY: Suddenly propelled to lead New York, Lt Governor Kathy Hochul vowed on Wednesday to set a better tone in state government after the sexual harassment scandal that spurred Governor Andrew Cuomo's resignation. "Nobody will ever describe my administration as a toxic work environment,'' Hochul said in her first news briefing after the Democratic governor announced his resignation. She said there would be no place in her administration for any Cuomo aides who were implicated in unethical behavior by the state attorney general's investigation of his behavior toward women. Hochul, a 62-year-old Democrat from western New York, is set to become the state's first female governor in two weeks, following a remarkable transition period in which Cuomo has said he will work to ease her into a job that he dominated during his three terms in office. Hochul has had a political career spanning from a town board to Congress, and as lieutenant governor, she has spent much of her time crisscrossing the state for ribbon-cuttings, announcements and other events. Still, she is unfamiliar to many New Yorkers, and she took the opportunity Wednesday to reintroduce herself and assure them: "I'm ready for this.'' "I'm more prepared than anyone could possibly be for this position,'' Hochul said. While championing such Cuomo-era accomplishments as laws raising the minimum wage and requiring paid family leave for millions of private-sector workers, Hochul strove to put distance between herself and the governor. She said she didn't spend much time with him and hadn't been aware of any of the alleged improprieties later described in state Attorney General Letitia James' report. Cuomo announced on Tuesday that he would step down rather than face a likely impeachment trial after James, a fellow Democrat, released a report concluding he sexually harassed 11 women. One accused him of groping her breast. Cuomo, 63, denies that he touched anyone inappropriately and said his instinct was to fight back against claims he felt were unfair or fabricated. But he said that with the state still in a pandemic crisis, it was best for him to step aside so the state's leaders could "get back to governing.'' Hochul purposely kept a modest profile as lieutenant governor in a state where Cuomo commanded and demanded the spotlight. Hochul shares some of Cuomo's centrist politics but is a stylistic contrast with a governor famous for his love of steamrolling opponents and holding grudges. She's well-liked by colleagues, who say voters shouldn't confuse her quiet approach under Cuomo with a lack of confidence or competence. "People will soon learn that my style is to listen first, then take decisive action,'' she said. Before sharing a ticket with Cuomo, she was a county clerk who opposed the idea of allowing unauthorized immigrants to apply for driver's licenses, an idea that would become law during Cuomo's administration. Asked Wednesday about what is known as the Green Light Law, Hochul said her position "has now evolved, and that evolution coincides with the evolution of many people'' in New York. "I'm proud of supporting that law,'' she said. It remains to be seen how involved Cuomo will be in state government over the next two weeks, or how he'll manage handing over authority, something he has rarely ceded during his time in office. His circle of advisers has shrunk, but his closest aide and policymaking partner Melissa DeRosa, a familiar face at Cuomo's side during his televised coronavirus briefings, will remain until his departure, after having announced her resignation from the administration Sunday. For days after James' report came out last week, Cuomo insisted to those close to him that he could weather the storm, but even his closest outside advisers told him it would be impossible. Cuomo was privately frustrated that few people were willing to defend him publicly and pressed his attorney and remaining advisers to question his accusers' credibility, according to a person with direct knowledge of the governor's final days in office. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the private, sensitive conversations. Cuomo decided he would resign after DeRosa quit, the person said. By late Monday night, Cuomo told a small number of his closest advisers that he was planning to resign, the person said. But Cuomo had kept the announcement very close, opting not even to tell other senior Democrats in New York. Leaders in the state legislature have yet to say whether they plan on dropping an impeachment investigation that has been ongoing since March, and which had been expected to conclude in the coming weeks. In addition to examining his conduct with women, lawyers hired by the state Assembly had been investigating whether the administration' manipulated data on Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes and whether Cuomo improperly got help from his staff writing a book about the pandemic. Republicans have urged the Democratic-controlled legislature to go ahead with impeachment, possibly to prevent Cuomo from running for office again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/hochul-ny-governments-office-wont-be-toxic-workplace-on-my-watch/articleshow/85258298.cms||---
---||World||Higher but still slim odds of asteroid Bennu slamming Earth||CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA: The good news is that scientists have a better handle on asteroid Bennu's whereabouts for the next 200 years. The bad news is that the space rock has a slightly greater chance of clobbering Earth than previously thought. But don't be alarmed: Scientists reported Wednesday that the odds are still quite low that Bennu will hit us in the next century. We shouldn't be worried about it too much, said Davide Farnocchia, a scientist with NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who served as the study's lead author. While the odds of a strike have risen from 1 in 2,700 to 1 in 1,750 over the next century or two, scientists now have a much better idea of Bennu's path thanks to NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft, according to Farnocchia. So I think that overall, the situation has improved, he told reporters. The spacecraft is headed back to Earth on a long, roundabout loop after collecting samples from the large, spinning rubble pile of an asteroid, considered one of the two most hazardous known asteroids in our solar system. The samples are due here in 2023. Before Osiris-Rex arrived at Bennu in 2018, telescopes provided solid insight into the asteroid, about one-third of a mile (one-half kilometre) in diameter. The spacecraft collected enough data over 2 1/2 years to help scientists better predict the asteroid's orbital path well into the future. Their findings published in the journal Icarus should also help in charting the course of other asteroids and give Earth a better fighting chance if and when another hazardous space rock heads our way. Before Osiris-Rex arrived on the scene, scientists put the odds of Bennu hitting Earth through the year 2200 at 1 in 2,700. Now it's 1 in 1,750 through the year 2300. The single most menacing day is Sept. 24, 2182. Bennu will have a close encounter with Earth in 2135 when it passes within half the distance of the moon.  Earth's gravity could tweak its future path and put it on a collision course with Earth in the 2200s _ less likely now based on Osiris-Rex observations. If Bennu did slam into Earth, it wouldn't wipe out life, dinosaur-style, but rather create a crater roughly 10 to 20 times the size of the asteroid, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defence officer. The area of devastation would be much bigger: as much as 100 times the size of the crater. If an object Bennu's size hit the Eastern Seaboard, it would pretty much devastate things up and down the coast, he told reporters. Scientists already are ahead of the curve with Bennu, which was discovered in 1999. Finding threatening asteroids in advance increases the chances and options for pushing them out of our way, Johnson said. One hundred years from now, who knows what the technology is going to be, he said. In November, NASA plans to launch a mission to knock an asteroid off-course by hitting it. The experimental target will be the moonlet of bigger space rock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/higher-but-still-slim-odds-of-asteroid-bennu-slamming-earth/articleshow/85258293.cms||---
---||World||Hackers return $260 million to cryptocurrency platform after massive theft||LONDON/SINGAPORE/HONG KONG: Hackers behind one of the biggest ever cryptocurrency heists have returned more than a third of about $600 million in digital coins they stole, blockchain researchers said on Wednesday. Poly Network, a decentralized finance platform that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, announced the hack on Twitter, posting details of digital wallets to which the tokens were sent.  The value of the coins in the wallets was just over $600 million at the time of the announcement, according to blockchain analysts.  Poly Network, which allows users to swap tokens across different blockchains, later urged the hackers to return the stolen funds to several of its digital addresses, saying it planned to take legal action.  Roughly $260 million worth of cryptocurrency has been returned to Poly Network in a range of coins, according to separate analyses by blockchain forensics company Chainalysis and crypto tracking firm Elliptic.  The hackers exploited a vulnerability in the digital contracts Poly Network uses to move assets between different blockchains, according to Chainalysis.  A person claiming to have perpetrated the hack said they did it "for fun" and wanted to "expose the vulnerability" before others could exploit it, according to digital messages shared by Elliptic and Chainalysis.  It was "always the plan" to return the tokens, the purported hacker wrote, adding: "I am not very interested in money."  The hackers or hacker have not been identified, and Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the messages.  Tom Robinson, Elliptic's co-founder, said the decision to return the money could have been prompted by the headaches of laundering stolen crypto on such a scale.  An executive from cryptocurrency firm Tether said on Twitter the company had frozen $33 million connected with the hack, and executives at other crypto exchanges told Poly Network they would also try to help.  "Even if you can steal cryptoassets, laundering them and cashing out is extremely difficult, due to the transparency of the blockchain and the broad use of blockchain analytics by financial institutions," said Robinson.  Poly Network did not respond to requests for more details. It was not immediately clear where the platform is based, or whether any law enforcement agency was investigating the heist.  Spokespeople for the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The size of the theft was comparable to the $530 million in digital coins stolen from Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck in 2018. The Mt Gox exchange, also based in Tokyo, collapsed in 2014 after losing half a billion dollars in bitcoin.  The Poly Network attack comes as losses from theft, hacks and fraud related to decentralised finance (DeFi) hit an all-time high, according to crypto intelligence company CipherTrace.  At $600 million, however, the Poly Network theft far outstripped the $474 million in criminal losses CipherTrace said were registered by the entire DeFi sector from January to July. The thefts illustrated risks of the mostly unregulated sector and may attract the attention of regulators.  DeFi platforms allow parties to conduct transactions, usually in cryptocurrency, directly without traditional gatekeepers such as banks or exchanges. The sector has boomed. over the last year, with platforms now handling more than $80 billion worth of digital coins.  Proponents of DeFi say it offers people and businesses free access to financial services, arguing that the technology will cut costs and boost economic activity. But technical flaws and weaknesses in their computer code can make them vulnerable to hacks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/hackers-return-260-million-to-cryptocurrency-platform-after-massive-theft/articleshow/85258465.cms||---

On August 9, tourism minister G Kishan Reddy told Lok Sabha: “The ministry has requested states/UTs to double vaccinated passengers from carrying RT-PCR reports at the time of inter-state travel.” As of now, some states allow fully vaccinated travellers to enter without negative RT-PCR reports. But states such as West Bengal (for travellers from Mumbai, Pune and Chennai), Karnataka, Goa, Chhattisgarh ask for mandatory RT-PCR negative reports irrespective of the travellers’ double vaccination status. Brar said the ministry was trying to convince all states to adopt the uniform protocol — not to mandate the RT-PCR tests for the fully vaccinated travellers who provide their final vaccination certificates. The ministry had a meeting with representatives of the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality and all state governments on August 5, with discussions mainly focusing on harmonisation of travel protocols during the Covid-19 pandemic. “States such as Sikkim and Maharashtra are allowing travellers from other parts of the country on the basis of full vaccination and not on RT-PCR test reports. In principle, all the states that were part of the meeting had agreed that this was a logical option,” said Brar. The ministry will also hold a meeting with health and and civil aviation ministries to gauge how the uniform protocol could be taken ahead and more relaxations could be worked out for the travellers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/skip-rt-pcr-for-travellers-with-full-vaccination-government-to-states/articleshow/85258410.cms||Neha Madaan

On Wednesday, KA Hidayathulla, joint secretary to the government, urban development (coordination), issued the order, stating structures standing in buffer zones of tanks, lakes and rivers should be removed to provide a healthy environment. While lake and tank encroachments are a major concern, BBMP is yet to deter mine the extent of encroachment. Chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said, “As per government directions, lake encroachments will be cleared.” B Reddy Shankar Babu, special commissioner (lakes), admitted many tanks and lakes have been encroached but they are yet to ascertain numbers. A survey will be done and action initiated, he added. The move comes after the HC on July 14 directed the urban development department to issue directions to all municipalities to ensure removal of illegal constructions on tanks/lakes and their buffer zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-bbmp-clear-lake-river-encroachments/articleshow/85258733.cms||---

This comes a day after the Supreme Court order stipulating that no case against an MP or MLA could be withdrawn without the consent of high courts. A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka pointed out that as per directions of the apex court, legality of the actions taken by the state government after September 16, 2020 for withdrawal of prosecution against a sitting or former MP/MLA will have to be considered and for facilitating the same, the state is required to furnish details. The bench added that in view of the binding nature of the orders passed by SC, the state government will have to scrupulously follow the said directions. It pointed out that the August 31, 2020 order passed by the state government will not apply to withdrawal of cases against sitting or former MPs and MLAs. It may recalled that on Tuesday, while dealing with a PIL filed by advocate Ashwani Kumar Upadhyay, the Supreme Court had made the consent of high courts mandatory for withdrawal of cases against lawmakers. “In view of the law laid down by this court, we deem it appropriate to direct that no prosecution against a sitting or former M.P./MLA shall be withdrawn without the leave of the high court in the respective suo motu writ petitions registered in pursuance of our order dated September 16, 2020. The high courts are requested to examine the withdrawals, whether pending or disposed of since September 16, 2020, in light of guidelines laid down by this court,” a three judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by CJI NV Ramana observed in its order. In fact, based on another September 16, 2020 order of the top court, the high court had registered a suo motu PIL and a special bench was also constituted to hear all pending criminal cases involving sitting/former legislators (MPs and MLAs), particularly those wherein a stay has been granted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-give-info-on-dropping-cases-against-leaders/articleshow/85258734.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka breaches 4 crore mark in Covid testing||BENGALURU: Karnataka has achieved another milestone in the fight against the pandemic with Covid-19 tests crossing the four crore mark on Wednesday. A huge majority — 81.4% — have been via the RT-PCR method. The state now has 3,338 swab collection centres and 252 Covid-19 testing labs. It has been a long journey from mid-2020 when the state faced a severe shortage of RT-PCR testing machines. They were eventually mobilised from microbiology testing labs of universities and agriculture and veterinary colleges. Karnataka had breached the 3-crore mark on June 3 and has conducted one crore tests in the past 69 days. Health minister K Sudhakar said the state is the third in the country in the number of tests conducted. Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing, Covid-19 task force, said the state is now equipped to handle any viral pandemic that could occur. “Testing capacity is robust now. Credit should be given to all the technicians, microbiologist, data entry operators and swab collectors,” he said. Dr Manjunath said the focus should now be on genomic sequencing and the need is to enhance random sequencing of samples from the present 5% to at least 10%. “To examine periodic mutations of the virus, we need to enhance genomic sequencing. It’s a laborious process and requires well-trained staff and technical experts.” Dr V Ravi, virologist and member of the Covid Technical Advisory Committee, who was instrumental in setting up Covid labs in Bengaluru in early 2020, said: “There was enormous support from the government in arranging for testing kits and reagents. We are well positioned now.” Of the total four crore tests, over 3.2 crore were via RT-PCR. Over 2.5 crore tests, or 63%, were conducted in government labs while private labs accounted for over 1.4 crore tests. Authorities say coordination between the health and family welfare department and medical education department helped in establishing RT-PCR facilities in all 63 medical colleges in Karnataka. The state currently has the capacity to conduct 1.8 lakh RTPCR tests a day, including more than a lakh samples in government labs. “Authorities ensured training and mentoring for start-up labs to enable them to function to their fullest capacity quickly. All arrangements were made to provide essential human resources, kits and consumables to run laboratories in three shifts,” a health department release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-3rd-state-to-conduct-4cr-covid-19-tests/articleshow/85258737.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 5 lose over Rs 1.8cr after investing in pvt firm||BENGALURU: Five persons from various places in Bengaluru alleged that four people running a private firm in Jayanagar cheated them of lakhs of rupees after promising to get them good returns against their investments. Jayanagar police registered five cases of cheating against the suspects based on a complaint filed by the victims. The victims told police the gang promised them 3% to 8% returns per month. Believing that, they invested over Rs 1.8 crore. Recently, they learnt they had been conned. Amit Prakash Tripathi, 46, of Doddanekkundi told police a man identified as Rakesh asked him to invest money in his firm, which would invest it in businesses and earn good profit. He promised 7% to 8% returns per month. Tripathi initially invested Rs 1 lakh and then Rs 75 lakh, apart from Rs 3.5 lakh of his wife’s money on May 23. He asked the suspects how to check details of his fund and they provided a mobile application. He found his fund value was zero on June 4. “I approached the suspects and they told me their company had incurred huge losses and hence my fund was zero.

Nandakishore Joshi, 48, of JP Nagar alleged the same gang cheated him of Rs 35 lakh, while Sandeep Singh, 52, of JP Nagar lost Rs 10.8 lakh, Shesh Prasad N, 42, of Rajarajeshwarinagar Rs 48 lakh and Pavan Kumar NN, 40, of JP Nagar Rs 7.4 lakh. “We have asked the complainants to provide more documents regarding the allegations,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/5-lose-over-1-8cr-after-investing-in-pvt-firm/articleshow/85253382.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: BJD seeks law to end 50% cap on quota, demands caste-based census||BHUBANESWAR: The BJD on Wednesday demanded a central legislation empowering states to do away with 50% cap on reservation and conducting caste-based census for socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC)s. On a day Rajya Sabha debated and passed the 127th constitutional amendment Bill meant to restore states’ rights to decide on their backward class list, a delegation of BJD MPs met Union home minister Amit Shah and submitted a memorandum in support of their demands. “A detailed scientific database is very much required with regards to SEBC/OBC category for formulation of accurate reservation policy for holistic development, welfare and upliftment of these categories of population,” the memorandum by the BJD MPs to Shah said. Pointing out that the Supreme Court and the various high courts have struck down quota for OBCs on the ground that the policies were made without any scientific data base of the OBC population, the regional party demanded appropriate columns in the Census 2021 form for their identification The BJD said it wants to provide 27% reservation to SEBCs/OBCs but courts have repeatedly struck down the move on the ground of quota exceeding 50%. Odisha had passed a law in 2009 — The Odisha Reservation of Posts and Services (For Socially and Educationally Backward Classes) Act, 2008 — to provide 27% quota to backward classes. The Orissa high court struck it down in June 2017 stating that the overall percentage of reservation can’t go beyond 50% in the existing scenario. On the same ground, the HC in April 2018 stopped the state from reserving 50% seats in urban local body election for OBCs. Earlier, participating in the OBC Bill debate in Rajya Sabha, BJD members Prasanna Acharya and Amar Patnaik pressed for caste-based census and central laws to ensure OBCs get their due share in jobs and education. “The courts are rejecting the state laws on OBC quotas because there is no scientific data on their numbers and status. Our contention is that a caste-based census can address that,” Acharya told TOI. Amar said true welfare of OBCs can happen only after it is known “for whom” and “for how many”. “While the first requires a caste census and enumeration, the latter may require breaching the ceiling of 50%. Naveen Patnaik has acted on both. We are the first in the country to start our enumeration. We also want central law to empower states to breach the ceiling as the SC (in Indira Sawney case) has set that ceiling and is unwilling to revisit,” Amar said. Responding to the BJD, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said when the HC struck down the Odisha law, nothing had prevented it from going to the Supreme Court. “You (BJD government) only have pretension. Fifty-two per cent people in Odisha belong to the backward classes. Only Lord Jagannath knows what’s in your mind,” Pradhan said while participating in a debate on the OBC Bill in the Upper House. Pradhan said, “When the Mandal Commission recommendations on quota was implemented in the 1990s, then Odisha government, led by Biju Patnaik, had moved the Supreme Court against it. Now the BJD leaders are saying they want to hike quota, but their hands are tied.” Earlier, Odisha as well as Maharashtra had requested the Centre to enumerate SEBCs in the census. Odisha has started the OBC enumeration on its own after the Centre rejected its demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/bjd-seeks-law-to-end-50-cap-on-quota-demands-caste-based-census/articleshow/85250751.cms||Ashok Pradhan
---||India||India and Australia 2+2 talks likely next month||NEW DELHI: India will hold a series of high-level bilateral talks with Australia when its foreign minister Marise Payne and new defence minister Peter Dutton visit India next month for the 2+2 dialogue with their counterparts S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh. The two countries, which are close partners now, are working on the dates for the meeting, as per reports. The engagement will come after a standalone visit to India last week by former Australian PM Tony Abbott, who is now the special envoy for trade and investment. In a piece he wrote after his visit and meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Abbott had said, “Because trade deals are about politics as much as economics, a swift deal between India and Australia would be an important sign of the democratic world’s tilt away from China... Although currently not as rich as China, as a democracy under the rule of law, and as the world’s second-largest producer of steel and pharmaceuticals, and with its own version of Silicon Valley, India is perfectly placed to substitute for China in global supply chains.” The two nations are working on getting a trade and investment deal through, which has acquired greater importance in the aftermath of India walking away from RCEP, as well as the new economic-strategic realities brought to the fore by the Covid-19 pandemic. India has signed with Japan and Australia an agreement to build resilient supply chains. Though Abbott is clearly keen on pushing the India relationship, he puts the blame for the “sub-par trade relationship” mostly on our high tariff structures and ponderous systems. As members of the Quad grouping, India and Australia have borne the brunt of China’s wrath in the past year — India on the border in eastern Ladakh and Australia facing a Chinese boycott of its coal, barley, and wine exports. Strategically they have been closer than before. In fact, Modi will meet Scott Morrison at the first in-person Quad summit in Washington, scheduled tentatively in September this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-and-australia-22-talks-likely-next-month/articleshow/85259215.cms||---

Locals say heaps of garbage on vacant sites and open drains in the city outskirts play a dominant role in pigs strengthening their numbers. “Despite our insistent pleas, for the last two years, GVMC has been saying they are on the job,” said Y Swati, a resident of Durganagar in Madhurawada. GVMC has imposed a ban on pig rearing in the corporation limits but many people are involved in it, especially on the outskirts. “Pigs do not need maintenance. Leftover food from roadside shops, eateries, open spaces near apartments, leftover portions of meat, fish and chicken from shops is a strong pull for pigs to stray into various areas,” said a GVMC employee. The Greater City has around 2,000 families depending on pig rearing and breeding. “There is money in it. And no need for investment. These families let pigs roam the streets. Pigs can cause pulmonary impairment leading to breathing disorders,” said Kesav, a doctor in Mithilapuri Vuda Colony, said. GVMC which has a population of roughly 24 lakh, has only two shooters to address the pig menace. Faced with public ire, the GVMC has now brought in teams from Madurai, Kadapa, and Pulivendula to tackle the pig problem. The most affected areas are under Zone I, Zone 5 and Zone 6, including Gajuwaka, Anakapalli, Madhurawada, Kommadi, PM Palem, Vambe Colony, Nagarampalem, Mithilapuri Vuda Colony, Bhimili and Pendurthi. K Sastry, chief medical officer, GVMC, told TOI, “We have been taking support from police as the people rearing the pigs gather in large numbers while catching and shooting the pigs. GVMC has issued a notice to the farmers and warned of fine and punishment if pigs roam in residential areas or colonies within the city limits,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-struggles-to-control-pig-menace/articleshow/85251647.cms||Siva G

New buildings will also be constructed at two Ayurveda and a homeopathic college in the state. The additional chief secretary of the health department, Pratyaya Amrit, told TOI on Wednesday, “The construction of an Ayush hospital at Nawab Manzil in Patna City has started and it is likely to be ready in a year and a half.” Talking about the Ayurveda colleges, Arvinder Singh, the special secretary of the health department and executive director of the Ayush Samiti, pointed out that two new buildings would come up at the government Ayurveda colleges in Begusarai and Darbhanga. “A new building will also be constructed on the campus of the government-run Rai Bahadur Tunki Sah Government Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur,” he added. The state government has also increased the number of undergraduate (UG) seats in Ayurveda and Unani colleges. “The Rajkiya Unani Medical College in Patna has increased the number of UG seats from 40 to 125 and introduced postgraduate (PG) studies in five different subjects. The Rajkiya Ayurvedic College has also added more UG seats and PG programmes,” Singh said, adding that the process of appointment of 3,270 Ayush doctors was also underway. Earlier, chief minister Nitish Kumar had launched the Bihar Ayush Chikitsak’s website and the Ayush Teleconsultation app on Tuesday. ‘1,069 docs, GNMs being trained’: State health minister, Mangal Pandey, said on Wednesday that the process of deployment of Ayush doctors and GNMs at health and wellness centres had begun. “As many as 1,069 Ayush doctors and GNMs are being imparted training through the learner support centres of the Indira Gandhi National Open University,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/50-bed-ayush-hospital-to-come-up-in-city-soon/articleshow/85250968.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Though a flag is hoisted on the VMH grounds twice a year on Independence Day and Republic Day, it is not unfurled on the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style marble edifice that was conceptualized by Indian viceroy Lord Curzon to commemorate Queen Victoria. The VMH was designed by architect William Emerson who also designed Mumbai’s Crawford Market and Allahabad’s All Saints’ Cathedral. On the occasion of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s 125th birth anniversary on January 23, the VMH had been virtually draped in the National Flag during a projector mapping show. But this is the first time a Tricolour of gigantic proportions will be rolled down the northern facade that faces the Maidan on the 75th Independence Day. The flag will be strung up on the VMH terrace using a web of wires. The flag’s top edge, measuring 150ft, will be around 70ft above the ground while the bottom edge will be 20ft above the ground with enough headroom to leave the entrance to the hall unblocked. Inside, an exhibition on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is underway. “The 150ftx50ft flag weighing 70kg, made by the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, will cover a large portion of the VMH facade. An HMI team will arrive on Thursday to fix the wires on the terrace with the perfect tautness and tension to ensure the top edge of the flag remains straight and does not sag. When rolled down on August 15, it will be a sight to behold,” said VMH curator Jayanta Sengupta. Indiatourism Kolkata is collaborating in the event. HMI principal group captain Jai Kishan said the 7,500sqft National Flag was conceived to pay a tribute to all freedom fighters on the anniversary of Indian Independence and had been unwrapped on Mt Renok in west Sikkim on April 25 by a team of 125 HMI students who climbed four peaks in 125 hours over four days as a tribute to Netaji on his 125th birth anniversary. “To carry the flag, we made it in three segments of 50ftx50ft that we then joined at the summit. The exercise was aimed to inspire people with some positive vibes during these negative Covid times,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/7500-sq-ft-national-flag-to-drape-victoria-on-75th-i-day/articleshow/85253355.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Patna||Ganga maintains rising trend in Patna||PATNA: People in hundreds of villages lying on the north and south of the Ganga in at least 10 districts have been badly hit by the floods caused by this river, as the water level continued to rise fast and steady for the last three days. Apprehending the further increase in the water level of the Ganga, water resources department has kept sand-filled bags at vulnerable points along the Gandhi Maidan-Danapur road from Golghar up to Digha to block the seepage through the Patna protection wall. The lower parts of the capital city on the north of the Patna protection wall have already been flooded. The district administration has shut the Digha lock gate and pressed into service eight motor pumps to flush out the river water from Gosai Tola and some other low-lying areas. The lower parts of Patna, Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon along the southern bank of the river presented a grim picture. Further, the north and south Bihar rivers have begun to cause worries about backwater effect and the lingering of the floods. The water level rose further above the danger level by 28cm and 26cm at Allahabad and Varanasi, respectively, implying that the situation is unlikely to ease in the next week along the downstream of the Ganga in Bihar. On Wednesday, the water level rose by 15cm at Buxar in the west and 9cm at Kahalgaon in the east. In Patna, the water level increased by 27cm at Digha and 15cm at Gandhi Ghat, as well as 12cm at Hathidah. Overall, the Ganga was flowing 83cm above the danger level at Digha on Wednesday, 1.30 metres above the danger mark at Gandhi Ghat and 1.18 metres above the red line at Hathidah. The Punpun was flowing 1.77 metres over the danger mark on the south-eastern outskirts of Patna. The water level was 1.26 metres above the danger level on Tuesday. Even as other major rivers like Bagmati and Burhi Gandak in north Bihar were flowing below the danger level, the water discharge through Birpur barrage across Kosi, through Valmiki Nagar barrage across Gandak, besides Indrapuri barrage across Sone, showed increasing trend on Wednesday. With the Ganga in spate and flowing above the danger level all along its downstream, Khagaria, Purnia and Katihar districts, as well as northern parts of Bhagalpur district, have started showing signs of backwater effect. The same is the situation in the Punpun river basin on the outskirts of Patna. River Kosi and its tributaries flowing through Katihar, Khagaria and north Bhagalpur district are expected to register the backwater effect. People of Katihar in the basin of Libri, a tributary of the Kosi that flows through Purnia and Katihar districts, were worried that the backwater effect might result in the flooding of the areas. The water level at Farakka barrage in West Bengal rose by 14cm on Wednesday and was placed at 89cm above the danger level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-maintains-rising-trend-in-patna/articleshow/85251147.cms||Abhay Singh

He said the HC order was onlyan interim stay and government will explore legal options to deal with it. “The probe against ED was announced by government based on legal opinion and deliberations. Probe order was issued when the agency crossed its limits. Central agencies, including ED, were misused (by Centre) during elections,” he added. Vijayaraghavan said there was a massive upsurge of public sentiment against ED when it hindered government’s day-to-day activities. Government set up a judicial probe when it was denied opportunities to exercise the powers given to it by the Constitution. “Legal issues don’t evaporate just because the ED managed to get a stay order from HC. Government can still present its case before the court. Some court orders are accepted as such. More legal options will be explored in other cases. These are natural developments. There is no need to make a controversy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-convener-hc-order-not-a-setback/articleshow/85255809.cms||---
---||Business||Yes Bank seeks partners for asset recast company||MUMBAI: Yes Bank has invited bids from potential partners for a proposed asset reconstruction company that will undertake recovery of bad loans. Management consultancy firm Ernst & Young is assisting the bank in the process. In an advertisement on Wednesday, the private bank invited applications from investors with assets under management of at least $5 billion and possessing substantial experience in the distressed asset space. According to bankers, given the $5-billion assets under management eligibility criteria, it will be largely global distressed asset funds that will qualify. Yes Bank had collapsed under the weight of bad debts in March 2020 and was placed under a moratorium by the RBI. Although Yes Bank was part of a consortium of lenders in most of the default cases, it was the worst hit because its exposure was disproportionate to its size and the bank had a presence in almost every major stressed asset. It was reconstructed through a government-notified scheme with banks led by SBI bringing in significant capital. Given the complexity of recovering from large defaulters, Yes Bank’s new management had pursued setting up an asset reconstruction company from the time it took over in early April 2020. Addressing analysts in a post-results call last week, the bank’s MD & CEO Prashant Kumar said that it had made a cash recovery of Rs 5,000 crore last year, and the recoveries were much more than the provisions. “The kind of effort that the engagement with those NPA customers which we have made during the last year — and which continued — I think would give us much better recoveries during the current fiscal year, and our recoveries would also result in significant gain on the P&L and there would not be any need to make any additional provision for this,” said Kumar. The bank had total gross non-performing exposures of Rs 38,821 crore at the end of June 2021 as against Rs 39,034 crore in the previous quarter. “On the recovery side, our specialised stressed asset management team of about 100 professionals have demonstrated a significant track record of cash recoveries. He added that the team is divided into two parts — core resolution & recovery team, and support function. “We expect to have cash recoveries of Rs 5,000 crore in the current financial year,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-seeks-partners-for-asset-recast-company/articleshow/85254212.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Interim pleas challenging Mansas chair’s reinstatement dismissed||Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday dismissed interim applications filed along with appeal petitions challenging reinstatement of Ashok Gajapathi Raju as chairman of Mansas Trust and Simhachalam Temple Trust Board. Sanchaitha Gajapathi Raju and the state government sought interim stay on the single judge order which set aside the GOs issued appointing Sanchaitha as chairman of the trusts. Arguing on behalf of Sanchaitha, senior counsel C V Mohan Reddy said the single judge did not consider the rules which prescribe the tenure of the chairman of the trust. He said the appointment of Sanchaitha was made according to rules as the tenure of the incumbent chairman ended. The government issued the GOs appointing Sanchaitha as chairman as she was a member of the founder family and, hence, there was no violation of rules. Mohan Reddy pressed for an interim stay on the ground the GOs were set aside without considering the situation. He argued there was a procedural lapse in taking over of the post by Ashok Gajapathi Raju as he did not take oath before assuming the office of chairman which is a mandatory requirement. Arguing on behalf of Ashok Gajapathi Raju, senior counsel D V Sitharama Murthy said the single judge set aside the GOs as they were arbitrary and unilateral. He contended the argument of procedural lapse, saying there was no need to take oath as it was not a fresh appointment but a reinstatement of existing appointment by the high court. Considering the arguments on both sides, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya said they were not inclined to stay the single judge order and dismissed the interim applications. The high court directed the respondents to file counters and posted the matter for final hearing in December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/interim-pleas-challenging-mansas-chairs-reinstatement-dismissed/articleshow/85251682.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Tej, on late Tuesday night, went live on his Facebook page named, ‘Second Lalu Tej Pratap Yadav’ and criticized the media for showing him and his family in bad light. Challenging the media, he said, “I will call my lawyer and get an FIR lodged. I will sue you in a defamation case. What Tej Pratap says, he does that,” he said, even naming several mediapersons. He also expressed his anger for highlighting the poster issue. “During the assembly election, the party posters had no photo of my father, mother, Misa ji and myself. That time the media was not raising this issue. Sometimes Tejashwi’s photo is not there, sometimes mine or Misa Ji’s is missing,” he said while referring to a big poster put up by the RJD before the assembly election with Tejahswi only and none else from the Lalu family. Even at that time, the media had highlighted the issue. Tej even alleged that such posters with one or the other family member missing were being put up by his opponents. Trying to show bonhomie with his younger brother, he added, “Tejashwi is my younger brother and from many platforms I have taken his side. I have told he is my Arjun and those who are jealous of him, let them be. I will do everything possible to make him the CM, even if it costs my life.” He further said Tej and Tejashwi were one and only alternative to take Bihar to the top. Several incidents of turf war in the Lalu family had been visible recently. Recently, Tej had organised an event of his Chhatra RJD at the party office. A big poster was put up showing Lalu, Rabri, Tej and Chhatra RJD state president Aakash Yadav. However, Tejashwi was missing in the poster. The next day, that poster was replaced by the older one, in which Tej is missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tej-threatens-to-sue-scribes/articleshow/85251932.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Business||BSE eases plan to stem mid-, small-cap risk, mkts rebound||Mumbai: The sensex staged a smart recovery in late trades on Wednesday, but finally closed flat at 54,526 — down just 29 points on the day. The rebound from the intraday low of 54,167 points came after a change and clarification about a hugely controversial BSE circular that was designed to put strict risk-management rules on a number of mid- and small-cap stocks. The selloff and the recovery were even more dramatic in mid- and small-cap stocks, BSE data showed. Late on Monday, the BSE had put out a circular that proposed from August 23 strict and enhanced circuit limits for several mid- and small-cap stocks. Fearing loss of turnover and a resultant dip in business, brokers approached markets regulator Sebi and also the exchange, opposing the move to impose these risk-mitigating measures. After the BSE amended the circular to include a smaller number of stocks, the mid-cap index saw a recovery of more than 1.5%, while it was over 2% in the small-cap index. The rebound came after the BSE said its earlier proposal for weekly, monthly and quarterly price bands will not apply to mid- and small-cap stocks from August 23, as was stated earlier. A section of the brokers, however, believe bourses should be strict about managing risks as markets are scaling new highs at regular intervals. According to Geojit Financial Services chief investment strategist V K Vijayakumar, the BSE’s new surveillance framework with add-on price bands for specified stocks listed exclusively on the exchange was a timely initiative to curb excessive speculative activity in these shares. “There is froth in the mid- and small-cap space. Many stocks in this segment have low liquidity and, therefore, are capable of being manipulated by a group of traders. In the present exuberant state of the market, manipulation is easy and appears to be happening. Therefore, this initiative from the BSE is appropriate from the perspective of market integrity,” Vijayakumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bse-eases-plan-to-stem-mid-small-cap-risk-mkts-rebound/articleshow/85254247.cms||---

The road blockade disrupted traffic towards Danapur, Maner, Naubatpur, Bikram and Ara in Bhojpur. Traders in Bihta market also kept their shutters down to protest the murder and other crime and extortion incidents. They suspect that Gupta was killed for his refusal to pay extortion demanded by the criminals. Gupta was shot dead inside his jewellery shop when he was preparing to close it for the day. His shop Maa Vindhyavasini Jewellers is located in Bihta market. Half a dozen armed criminals on three bikes had barged inside his shop and shot him in head and chest, killing him on the spot. Around 50 jewellery shops are located in the vicinity. Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand also raised his voice over the crime incidents in Bihta. “Has Bihta become a new crime centre? Such fear arises from recent incidents. Gold trader’s murder is extremely disappointing and unfortunate. DGP, Patna DM and SSP must take personal cognisance of it,” he tweeted. A Bihta-based trader, preferring anonymity, said extortion demands were routine in Bihta and police are unable to control it. “Criminals are running extortion racket even from prisons. Gangs have started focussing on Bihta soon after the government announced setting up big institutions and industries here. Several criminals and white-collared persons have invested their black money in plots in Bihta area,” he said. He said the situation worsened since the murder of Bihta traders’ association president and Uday Chitra Mandir cinema hall owner Nirbhay Singh (52) there in September 2017. Criminals had fired outside a coaching institute allegedly for extortion and a wholesale druggist, Sonu Kumar, was shot at in Bihta recently. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, who had rushed to Bihta on Tuesday night, told TOI over phone that Gupta was killed after a failed loot attempt. “The criminals asked him to open the iron chest, which was locked. In a hurry and panic, they opened fire, killing the trader. The druggist’s incident is suspected to be a fallout of personal enmity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihta-traders-disrupt-traffic-to-protest-jewellers-murder/articleshow/85251582.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||Centre, state differ over Delta-plus numbers||Kolkata: The Centre and the state differ on the reported three Delta-plus cases found in Bengal. The Centre on Tuesday said three out of the 86 Delta-plus variants detected in the country so far are from Bengal. This is the first time that Delta-plus cases have been confirmed in Bengal. The state health department officials, however, said the samples found in Bengal are not the classical Delta-plus variant, but a sub-lineage that has recently been included in the Delta-plus group. According to a release from the Union health ministry on Tuesday, out of the 86 cases, the highest number is from Maharashtra — 34 — while Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have 11 and 10 cases respectively. “There is confusion over the report of three cases of Delta-plus variant found in Bengal. After enquiry, we have learnt that some AY.3 sub-lineage variant of Delta was recently included in the list of so-called Delta-plus group. AY.3 was detected in a sample on July 17 in Bengal,” director of health services Ajay Chakraborty said. Even though classification of sub-lineage is a dynamic process, health department officials said they have not got any further information on inclusion and exclusion of any sub-lineage in the Delta-plus group. For Bengal, genome sequencing is being done at the NIBMG Kalyani. According to immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly, Delta-plus is reported to share mutations from two earlier variants of concern, which are potentially harmful, namely the beta and the delta, and both variants have been shown to require higher levels of antibodies to get neutralized. “Now, in the Delta-plus variant, a combination of the mutations from both these earlier variants poses the threat of further weakening of the immune system in case the effects of the mutations are additive. But we are yet to get affirmed on these apprehensions. But we need to be cautious. And, most importantly, we should stick to all the teachings from the earlier two waves and be committed towards Covid-appropriate behaviour. The follies on our part that followed the first wave, and somewhat fuelled the devastating second wave, should be kept in mind and avoided,” said Ganguly, a scientist at Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. Since Delta-plus is causing the third wave in some countries, health experts said we cannot afford to drop our guard. “The second wave in India was triggered by the Delta variant. People infected during the second wave could be relatively safe from Delta-plus. But people who were not infected in the second wave or got their vaccine towards the beginning of the pandemic could be vulnerable due to waning of immunity and antibodies,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centre-state-differ-over-delta-plus-numbers/articleshow/85253252.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The public announcement by the RP has sought financial creditors to submit their claims before August 12 and the estimated closure of the insolvency process is January 24, 2022. The process has been initiated by Bank of India. “Our total debt is around Rs 575 crore. We arrived at a one time settlement package and paid the first instalment of Rs 26 crore as part of the package. With Covid lockdown and other issues, our processes and cash flows to settle the dues have been delayed. We will now work with the lenders and arrive at a resolution plan. The broad contours will be on the lines of the OTS,” said Palani G Periasamy, chairman of Dharani Sugars. He said he would also submit a plan under Section 12 A and bring the sugar company out of the crisis. “Four years of drought, between 2015 and 2019, has resulted in a distress situation for the sugar industry. Just as we were coming out of the drought Covid pandemic hit us badly,” he said. Dharani has a combined cane crushing capacity of 10000 tonnes a day across three factories in Vasudevanallur, Polur and Kallakurichi. “We have fully integrated sugar complexes with cogeneration as well as an industrial alcohol facility. For the last year, we could crush cane only in one of the three factories,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bids-invited-for-dharani-sugars-under-ibc/articleshow/85254168.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

Earlier in the day, the CM visited different places along the Ganga in Patna and Vaishali districts by road to take the stock of rising trend of the river water. After inspection at different locations, Nitish asked the officials, especially the DMs of 12 riverine districts, to make all necessary preparations keeping in mind the impact of floodwaters from the Ganga in 2016. In 2016, the CM said, the floodwaters from the Ganga had spread to the low-laying and diara areas of 12 districts due to rise in the water level. The riverine districts affected in 2016 were Buxar, Bhojpur, Saran, Vaishali, Patna, Samastipur, Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Munger, Bhagalpur, Khagaria and Katihar. Nitish also held a meeting with the DMs of 12 riverine districts through videoconferencing and issued them necessary instructions. Nitish asked them to remain alert keeping in mind the rising trend of water level in the Ganga. He also asked the DMs to remain in touch with the flood-affected people and provide them all necessary help. The DMs were also asked to provide necessary facilities in the relief camps as per the standard operating procedure (SOP). “Make arrangements of fodder for animals at all relief camps,” Nitish told them. The CM further pointed out that the state government has made a provision for payment of Rs15,000 on birth of a female child at the flood relief camp and Rs10,000 on the birth of male child at the camp. He asked the DMs to ensure immediate payment of this amount to the parents soon after birth of a child at any flood relief camp. Engineers of the road construction department and the rural works department were asked to take daily update of roads in the flood-affected areas. Engineers and officials of the water resources department were asked to maintain constant vigil on embankments and water level in different rivers, especially in the Ganga, which has been maintaining a rising trend for the last few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-asks-dms-to-remain-alert-provide-help-to-flood-hit-people/articleshow/85251199.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Patna||Patna University: DDE awaits UGC’s nod to admit pupils to various progs||PATNA: Even as Patna University (PU) has started the process of online admission of students to all its undergraduate courses for the 2021-2022 session, its Directorate of Distance Education (DDE) is waiting for the nod of a competent authority to admit students. PU has requested the Distance Education Bureau (DEB) of the University Grants Commission (UGC) to grant permission for at least one more year for admitting students to its various courses in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fresh admission to any course under the DDE in the current academic session will be initiated only after the DEB’s permission. The 47-year-old institution of PU, which once used to attract thousands of students, has been facing difficulties in admitting students due to the recent decision of the UGC to allow only universities with an ‘A’ grade to run courses under distance education. PU has been accredited with ‘B+’ grade. Earlier, PU’s DDE was derecognized by the UGC four years ago on account of various shortcomings. The recognition was restored for one session (2019-2020) on the condition that it would meet all the requirements within the given time frame. Last year, PU approached the UGC again with a request to consider its demand for extending the period of recognition in view of the fact that the university had applied for reaccreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council. On October 14, 2020 the UGC conceded PU’s request and extended its recognition by a year. Consequently, admission of students to its various courses were made in November-December last year. However, the university could not cut much ice in improving its grade owing to the emergence of the second wave of Covid-19. Hence, PU has requested the UGC to extend the period of its recognition at least by one more year. DDE chief Khagendra Kumar told this newspaper that the institution was imparting education to only students admitted in the 2019-2022 and 2020-2023 sessions. “Even as PU is hopeful of getting further extension, it is contemplating to start admission to all its four PG diploma courses in journalism, financial management, marketing management and operations management for the time being. The advisory committee of the DDE is also being reconstituted by PU with a view to ensuring its efficient functioning,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-dde-awaits-ugcs-nod-to-admit-pupils-to-various-progs/articleshow/85251311.cms||B K Mishra

They extorted Rs 24 lakh from the victim, threatening to share his nude video with his family and friends. Cybercrime cops arrested Shaik Abdul Raheem (30) of Dabbakupalli in Krishna district, Gunda Jyothi (28), and Gunda Veera Satish (34) of Jeedimetla in Hyderabad on charges of blackmailing. Police recovered Rs 3.5 lakh, a laptop, five smartphones, three feature phones and three ATM cards from the accused. The incident took place on July 16 when the complainant received an SMS, ‘Call me any time, I am your best friend to talk’. He dialled the number, and a woman asked him to make a nude video call. He fell for it. The next day, the accused started to threaten him by sending him screenshots of the call and demanded money. He deposited nearly Rs 24 lakh in bank accounts which were provided by the accused. When the accused demanded more money, he finally approached the cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/man-goes-nude-on-video-call-loses-rs-24l/articleshow/85251396.cms||Siva G

According to police sources, the accused officers were identified as SI K Durga Prasad and constable M Sivarama Krishna. Cops said the incident came to light after a man identified as Pichuka Majji (23) from Rajahmundry town posted a selfie video making the allegations prior to hanging himself. Majji claimed the constable had called him to the station to issue a summon notice under section 41 of CrPC. The officer then allegedly demanded a Rs 1 lakh bribe from him promising that they would go easy on the liquor smuggling case booked against him and threatened that they would book a ganja smuggling case against him if he failed to pay the amount. Taking cognisance of the video, the SP ordered a criminal case be booked against Sivarama Krishna and placed him under suspension. The SP also suspended the SI under dereliction of duty charges. Speaking on the matter, Siddharth Kaushal said, “Our duties should enhance the reputation of the police department and not to act in a way that would tarnish us. If any officer engages in such corrupt activities for their own benefit, we will not only register criminal cases against them but also take departmental action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/si-constable-suspended-after-accused-ends-life/articleshow/85251285.cms||---

The forum office bearers plan to hand over a representation to vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari this week voicing their concerns on the process.According to them, not only colleges but even students are made to suffer in the online process, which they termed as “very complicated”. “Even as students were asked to pay Rs20 for the online process, the actual expenditure is above Rs100 for uploading documents and other expenses. Moreover, those from rural areas lacking access to the online systems suffer the most,” the forum’s office bearers said.They added that though a majority of students possessed mobile phones, many of them didn’t have bank accounts and, therefore, they lacked internet banking or ATM card facility and had to depend on others to pay fees. “The university is charging Rs50 as e-charge from all its enrolled students. However, that fund has hardly been used since the last many years. This accumulated fund over the years is in crores. There’s no point in charging Rs20 from students. Moreover, many students take help of internet cafés to upload their documents and have to spend unnecessarily in the process,” they said.Warning NU administration about the collapse of the academic calendar, the forum members demanded extension of the last date of registration, which is August 18.Many aspirants too have demanded extension of this deadline, stating that they were yet to get mark sheets from their colleges. “In NU’s online form, there’s a column of the mark-sheet number. Without filling it up, the system doesn’t accept your form. Either they should extend the deadline or remove the mark-sheet number column from the form. They’ve already made the entire procedure very complicated,” students told TOI.

The company operated its factories at 35% in the comparable quarter last year. “It is difficult to predict the Covid situation. However, we feel that there would be a sustained growth in demand for cement as the monsoon quarter has ended,” said the MD of the company N Srinivasan. Net Plant Realisation (NPR), the price the company gets for every tonne of cement dropped to Rs 3,942 per tonne from Rs 4,235 a tonne in the year ago period. “That is because we had to move cement farther away thereby increasing fuel costs,” he said. The company’s consolidated net profit for the quarter was Rs 43.05 cr for the quarter, more than doubling from Rs 19.47 cr a year ago. Consolidated revenues from operations were Rs 1,045.25 cr in the quarter under review increasing from Rs 763.46 cr in the corresponding period of the previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-cements-anticipates-steady-growth-in-demand/articleshow/85254242.cms||---
---||Business||ATM companies wary of RBI’s Rs 10,000 cash-out fine||MUMBAI: There is a mixed reaction to the move by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to penalise banks Rs 10,000 for each instance of an ATM being out of cash for 10 hours. ATM operators (known in the industry as managed service providers, or MSPs) and cash-in-transit companies are throwing up their hands, stating that they will not bear the penalty. In a circular to banks this week, the RBI said that they should monitor the availability of cash in ATMs and ensure that there are no cash-outs. The circular said that banks would be fined Rs 10,000 if there is a cash-out at any ATM for more than 10 hours in a month. “There are certain locations where ATMs run out of cash within hours of being loaded. These machines may not become feasible to operate if there is a penalty every month,” said a senior executive in an MSP firm. There are 2,13,766 ATMs in the country, and most of them are managed by MSPs who appoint cash-in-transit companies to replenish the currency notes in the machines. According to MSPs, the regulations are well-intentioned as they recognise the role of cash in the economy and put the onus on banks to ensure cash availability. However, they say that the penalty is not well thought out because banks outsource most of the work and treat the regulations as something to be passed through to the MSPs. “While the intent behind this RBI circular is welcome, penalty approach alone is unlikely to resolve the issue of ATM currency outage. In fact, it is quite likely that this penalty will become a pass-through, from banks to MSPs, and from MSPs to cash logistics agencies,” said Rituraj Sinha, group managing director at SIS, the largest security and cash-in-transit company in India. According to Sinha, what needs to be addressed is the root causes of ATMs running dry, such as sub-optimal cash forecasting and delays in availability of ATM-fit currency. “On-ground implementation of the RBI circular dated April 2018 is the real solution, not just before better security but also more accurate cash forecasting and on-time availability of currency to enable cash logistics agencies to upload ATMs on time and with an adequate amount of currency,” he said. The 2018 circular requires banks to put in place stringent measures such as transporting cash in cassettes, in prescribed vehicles sticking to government norms on the transport of currency during specified hours of the day. According to banks, it is difficult to implement all these norms under present cost structures.

Inaugurating a two-day interdisciplinary e-orientation programme for teachers on ‘Students, Teachers and Academic Endeavours amid Covid-19 Pandemic’ organised by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Asian Studies-Kolkata in collaboration with the history department of R B College-Dalsingsarai, Singh said, “Educating students even in adverse circumstances is the responsibility of teachers and they must strive hard to guide them in the best possible manner.” The VC further pointed out that the university has successfully conducted online classes and made study materials available on its website during the pandemic. Dibrugarh University’s education faculty dean Daisy Bora Talukdar said the education sector has gone through a seismic shift in the past 18 months which will have a lasting impact on how students are taught. “While teaching and learning may have benefited from change and improvements online as well as in terms of access and content, the human aspect of the teaching role is needed more than ever,” she added. Indian Council of Historical Research member Rajeev Ranjan, VKS University’s philosophy teacher Kismat Kumar Singh and Magadh University history department’s former head Piyush Kumar Sinha spoke on different aspects of online learning adopted for the benefit of students. Institute’s chairman Sujit Kumar Ghosh and director Sarup Prasad also addressed the orientation programme. Academic coordinator Sanjay Jha introduced its theme.

---||Patna||RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav back in focus, tries to revive Mandal euphoria||PATNA: RJD president Lalu Prasad has been trying to be back in focus and act as a fulcrum of the opposition unity against BJP ahead of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and six other states next year. His strategy seems to be weaving a strong other backward castes (OBCs) electoral fabric to corner the saffron party in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. A maverick politician, who is on bail after his conviction in the fodder scam cases, Lalu and his party on Wednesday tweeted two posts in a bid to revive the Mandal Commission euphoria. In one post, RJD targeted the RSS, while in another, Lalu threatened that the backward, extremely backward castes and minority community in Bihar and other parts of the country will boycott any census exercise this year, if the caste figures are not counted in it, setting the political and electoral agenda of contesting the forthcoming elections on the Mandal Commission-Part II plank of seeking more quota for OBCs in government jobs and admissions in higher education institutions. As he had succeeded in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections by highlighting a part of the statement of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat that reservation policy should be reviewed, Lalu and the entire opposition is demanding caste-based census, which has not found favour with the ruling BJP at the Centre, despite its ally JD(U) of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also demanding the enumeration of caste numbers and strength.  In the 2015 Bihar election, JD(U) was with Lalu's RJD and the two, along with Congress, had turned the BJP tide after its massive victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. After meeting NCP chief Sharad Pawar, former UP chief ministers Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Prasad Yadav besides former Union minister Sharad Yadav in Delhi recently, Lalu, despite his poor health, also attended the dinner hosted by Congress's Rajya Sabha member Kapil Sibal Tuesday night, which was more like a rallying point for the opposition party leaders against BJP. Though RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Tuesday said in Delhi that he and his organisation were staunch supporters of reservation and when there were anti-reservation protests on many campuses, they passed a resolution and organised a seminar in Patna in support of reservation. RJD on Wednesday tweeted: "Muthibhar chitpavan Brahmino ke jatiwadi sangthan ki itni bhi aukat nahi ki desh ke 85% SC/ST/OBC ke arakshan ko rok den. Bhagwat ne ek baar bola tha, kya hashr hua tha pata hai na? @RSS tumhari sari chalakiyan samjhte hain. Tum sochte ho sab bech arakshan ko backdoor se khatm kar denge. Nahi hone denge (the organisation of a handful of Konkan Brahmins has no guts to stop reservations for 85% SC/ST/OBCs. Bhagwat had said once about it. What was the result you know. @RSS, we understand all your tricks. You people think of finishing reservations through the backdoor by selling everything. Won't allow this)". मुट्ठीभर चितपावन ब्राह्मणों के जातिवादी संगठन की इतनी औक़ात भी नहीं कि देश के 85% SC/ST/OBC के आरक्षण को रोक दें।… https://t.co/ySLj4y9LjQ— Rashtriya Janata Dal (@RJDforIndia) 1628655302000The Centre's decision to give 27% quota to OBCs and 10% to the economically weaker section (EWS) category in the All-India Quota (AIQ) scheme for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses from the academic year 2021-22 is also being seen as the BJP's pre-emptive move against the opposition strategy to raise the bogey of quota for OBCs in the name of demanding caste census in the coming UP election, which is very crucial for the saffron party.  Lalu on Wednesday also threatened to boycott the forthcoming census if caste-wise enumeration of population is not done. “All backward, extremely backward, dalit and minorit comunity people in Bihar and other parts of the country may boycott the census 2021 exercise, if the caste-wise counting of population is not done. Will we make pickles of the data related to animals, if the majority population of the country is not benefited from the census data?” Lalu tweeted. अगर 2021 जनगणना में जातियों की गणना नहीं होगी तो बिहार के अलावा देश के सभी पिछड़े-अतिपिछड़ों के साथ दलित और अल्पसं… https://t.co/hYLCo02Ykz— Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) 1628661969000Reacting to Lalu's tweet, BJP's OBC Morcha national general secretary Dr Nikhil Anand said the RJD chief's statement is ludicrous.  "Laluji is playing an emotional card to save RJD. He should first ask the Congress why it had committed a fraud by conducting a sample survey in the name of caste census in 2011, on which there was a consensus in Parliament," Anand said. The 2011 socio-economic and caste census had counted 46,73,034 categories of caste, sub-caste. However, later in July 2015, the Centre stated that errors were found and some of them have been rectified since then. The first caste census was conducted in India in 1881 and the last in 1931. The Mandal Commission had estimated 52% of the population of OBCs in India. The political issues involved in conducting a caste census is that if the OBCs share increases, the opposition would demand restructuring of reservation policy. If the ruling BJP-led NDA now agrees to it, the opposition camp will trumpet it as their success. If the Narendra Modi government does not go for caste census, as it told the Parliament in the ongoing monsoon session, the opposition will brand it as anti-backwards. The OBCs have been given 27% reservations along with 15% to the scheduled castes and 7.5% to the scheduled tribes, in agreement of the Supreme Court order in 1992 to put a cap of 50% on quota in government jobs and admissions in higher education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-targets-rss-tries-to-revive-mandal-euphoria/articleshow/85251640.cms||Jai Narain Pandey
---||Patna||Will CBSE and ICSE kids have upper hand due to higher pass percentage?||PATNA: In view of a significant delay in the new academic session due to the Covid-19 pandemic, universities in Bihar are striving hard to complete the process of admission to various undergraduate (UG) courses. A large number of students have already submitted their applications, clearly indicating that there is a cut-throat competition among them. With the CBSE and the ICSE candidates scoring very high marks in the Class XII examinations this year, the BSEB students are likely to face a herculean task in securing a seat in colleges of their choice. According to sources, the pass percentage of CBSE and ICSE students stood at 99.37% and 99.93% this year. This unprecedented percentage is attributed to the declaration of results on the basis of internal evaluation at the school level. However, the BSEB had conducted the Class XII exams and published the results well before the onset of the second wave of the pandemic in March. Hence, the pass percentage of the students was only 78%. “It is natural that only a few BSEB students will be selected for admission if the choice is made only on the basis of marks,” the principals of different city colleges told this reporter. The rush of students can be easily gauged from the fact that more than 20,000 candidates have got themselves registered for admission to the Degree (Part I) programmes in different colleges of Patna University (PU) during the last 10 days. The process of online admission to UG courses in PU began on August 1 and will end on August 20. PU’s students’ welfare dean, Anil Kumar, pointed out that admissions were done through entrance tests till last year. “But the university has decided to admit students simply on the basis of marks obtained in the Class XII exams this time in view of the pandemic,” he said, admitting that CBSE and ICSE students would certainly have the upper hand if admissions were made on the basis of marks. Patliputra University (PPU) is also accepting online applications for admission to its UG courses in various colleges. The last date for submission of application forms is August 14. The principal of A N College, S P Shahi, claimed that PPU selected students on a centralized basis. He added, “Even if there is a greater rush of admission seekers, we cannot accommodate students beyond the sanctioned seats. Moreover, a larger number of pupils will require more teachers and better infrastructural facilities.” His B N College counterpart, Raj Kishore Prasad, suggested that the state government should initiate some process for normalizing the marks obtained by students from different boards “so that BSEB students do not suffer”. “For instance, the Assam government has decided to reserve 75% seats in colleges for the students passing out from the state board,” he explained. Shyama Roy, the principal of J D Women’s College, however, said, “Students should not worry as all of them are easily accommodated in colleges every year. In fact, some institutes in the state do not find adequate number of students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/will-cbse-and-icse-kids-have-upper-hand-due-to-higher-pass-percentage/articleshow/85250916.cms||B K Mishra
---||Hyderabad||BJP to counter TRS with ‘BC Bandhu’||HYDERABAD: The BJP is playing the ‘BC Bandhu’ slogan to counter the TRS government’s Dalit Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad. Without focusing much on Dalit Bandhu, the saffron party is urging the government to roll out similar schemes for other communities, particularly BCs. Former health minister Eatala Rajender, who is currently touring Huzurabad, called for implementation of BC Bandhu scheme. “It is good that the TRS government has announced the Dalit Bandhu scheme just ahead of the by-election. We want Dalit sections to benefit from it, but we also want similar schemes for other marginalised sections,” a senior BJP leader told TOI. Sources said the party will intensify the ground-level campaign on BC Bandhu soon. “Eatala being a BC leader himself comes in handy for the party,” a leader said. The party is also working out an action plan for the forthcoming by-election. Some national-level leaders are likely to campaign in Huzurabad. “Every fortnight, we will have meetings with local cadres till the polling date,” he said. Meanwhile, Eatala on Wednesday claimed that finance minister T Harish Rao’s family members will also vote for him. Speaking at an election rally in Huzurabad town, he said CM K Chandrasekhar Rao keeps a close eye on his MLAs and incharges of assembly segments. “There is no democracy in the TRS. It is autocratic functioning,” he charged. Eatala said the CM wants leaders who behave like slaves. “Ever since I have resigned as an MLA, several pending works in the last seven years are now being completed. How can KCR rule without trusting his own partymen,” he wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-to-counter-trs-with-bc-bandhu/articleshow/85257870.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Vijayawada||YSR housing colonies drive realty boom in & around Vijayawada||VIJAYAWADA: The real estate sector in the city is witnessing a boom with houses coming up at YSR Jagananna colonies. Land rates in the colonies and in their proximity have skyrocketed. With these areas becoming the prime choice for many buyers from the middle class, promoters have started housing projects in the hopes of higher demand. The development is likely to offer some relief to the real estate sector, which is still recovering from the blows dealt by the pandemic. Thousands of flats in apartment complexes remain unsold and many ventures that were taken up in Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA) continue to remain stuck. Now, house sites issued by the state government have become a ray of hope for real estate promoters. Though government housing colonies are located outside the city, many from low income groups have started constructing houses here. Areas such as Vikas College Road of Ninna and Vanukuru in Tadigadapa municipality are turning into prime locations for real estate ventures. “Land rates at Nunna were very low till the state government announced low income group colonies in this region. Many people initially criticised the government for.allocating colonies very far from the city. But many beneficiaries started constructing houses here and economic activities increased. Around 10,000 houses will come up over here. Investors are now making a beeline for our village,” said Avuthu Sridhar Reddy, a resident of Ninna village. Locals said the market value of land in the area has increased by as much as 25 per cent. Hopeful of the trend, real estate companies are targeting low and middle income groups and developing small house sites that measure less than 200 square meter. “We started acquiring land a month ago. We are about to move for layout approval from AMRDA. At this stage, we have received 60 per cent bookings. Many of our customers are from the middle income group. We design plots to fulfil their dream of owning a home,” said K Sardahi, a promoter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysr-housing-colonies-drive-realty-boom-in-around-vij/articleshow/85251236.cms||Venu Lanka

The deadline for receiving the objections on these plans ended on August 7. The majority of the objections are related to the master plan roads proposed in the newly emerging urban centres like Bhogapuram and surrounding mandals and the suburbs on the north side of Vizag. According to VMRDA officials, the urban development authority has constituted 13 teams for field-level verification of these objections. Earlier, the state government constituted an expert committee to review and make suggestions on objections/suggestions received on these plans. Additional director of the directorate of town and country planning will act as the convener and member of the committee. Four other officials have been included in the committee as the members. According to VMRDA officials, its urban planning wing shall first examine all objections/suggestions and prepare their remarks to place the same before the expert committee. For the same, the field-level teams would conduct inspections based on the objections received from the public. The chief urban planner, VMRDA, will assist the expert committee and provide information/maps in soft or hard copy as requested by the members. The VMRDA will also provide technical and secretarial assistance to the committee as required. The VMRDA recently completed the preparation of its draft master plan-2041 and draft perspective plan-2051.

His body was found early Wednesday morning near the famous Thave temple, where he was deployed. The deceased, Arjun Dayal alias Arjun Thapa, 38, was in uniform. He was a native of Chitwan in Nepal and served in the elite Gorkha Vahini (1st battalion) of the erstwhile Bihar Military Police (BMP), now known as BSAP. This battalion is deployed only on specialised duty like CM security and anti-Maoist operations. A company of the battalion is deployed in Gopalganj. Police suspect the murder was a fallout of his financial dispute with some Gopalganj residents. “He was probably called out of the temple premises and stabbed to death,” a police source said. Battalion DSP Muttafique Ahmed, who rushed to Gopalganj from Patna, said Dayal was deployed there since March this year. He said Dayal’s family in Nepal has been informed. “No one can come as the border is sealed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We are putting efforts to send the body to the family across the border from Raxaul,” he added. “The entire company, including the section guarding the temple, was scheduled to move to Bagaha on Wednesday morning,” he said. Thave police station SHO Kiran Shankar said Dayal went missing at around midnight. “He was on duty to guard the temple without arms from 10pm to midnight. His colleagues started searching him during shift change,” he said. The SHO said they lived on the temple premises to guard it round-the-clock in two hours shift. The villagers spotted Dayal’s body on a road to Chetitola village. “The spot is around 500 metres away from the temple. His cellphone or purse was not recovered from the body,” he said. Shankar said there was one stabbing wound in his neck and at least three in the back of the head. “No sharp-edged weapon was recovered from the spot,” he said. The SHO said postmortem was conducted before sending the body to the police lines to pay him last respect. No one has been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gorkha-vahini-constable-killed-near-gopalganj-temple/articleshow/85251392.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar government draws flak over teacher’s suspension||PATNA: The suspension of a primary school teacher in Katihar district for selling empty jute bags in a local market has invited protests across the state against the government’s action. A contractual teacher-cum-principal of a government primary school in Katihar’s Kadwa block, Mohammad Tamizuddin, was suspended after a video showing him selling a stack of empty gunny sacks on his head in a local market went viral on social media.  The suspension letter was issued on August 8 by the panchayati raj department on the recommendation of education department. As per the state government order, the schools have been directed to sell all the gunny sacks in which foodgrains had been supplied to the schools under the midday meal scheme during financial years 2014-15 and 2015-16.  On July 22, the director of the MDM scheme, Satish Chandra Jha, issued a letter directing the DEOs and DPOs to ask the schools to sell the jute bags at Rs10 per piece and maintain a separate ledger as per the prescribed format. The order was issued after the accountant-general (AG) office in Patna noticed that the empty sacks were not being sold, resulting in loss to the state exchequer. Brajnandan Sharma, president of Bihar State Primary Teachers’ Association, called the suspension as a ‘Tughlaqi farman’ (decree). “The state government always blames the teachers for one thing or another. We have already demanded the government to free the teachers from non-academic activities. The department should have served a show-cause notice to the teacher, instead of suspending him directly,” he said. Anand Mishra, secretary of Parivartankari Prarambhik Shikshak Sangh, also expressed his solidarity with the suspended teacher and said the government took the decision in haste. Several primary school associations have planned to stage protests at their block headquarters on August 13 and district headquarters on August 16 against the government’s decision. Katihar DEO Deobind Kumar Singh told this newspaper on Wednesday that the action had been taken against Tamizuddin for non-compliance of the departmental order and tarnishing the image of teachers, education department and the state. “Schools have been asked to sell the empty gunny sacks and deposit the money in school funds. The department has also fixed the money for the sack. However, the way he was selling the sacks was against the code of conduct of teachers. He tarnished the image of Bihar, by performing a nukad natak, while selling the sacks on his head and carrying a placard. His suspension letter was sent on these grounds and the departmental proceedings would be initiated against him,” he said. In a letter issued late Sunday evening, the MDM director stated that a demonstration in public by a primary teacher in Katihar by placing a bundle of sacks on his head was not only indecent but also against the conduct rules. “It is an act to tarnish the image of the department,” read a part of the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-draws-flak-over-teachers-suspension/articleshow/85251244.cms||Faryal Rumi

A corporate debtor, the company had failed to make a payment of Rs 286 crore under facilities it was granted. In its August 5 order that was made available on Wednesday, the NCLT had appointed chartered accountant Ajit Gyanchand Jain as its interim resolution professional (IRP) to run the day-to-day affairs of the company. The move came on a petition filed by financial creditor IDBI Trusteeship Services under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016. Ashok Paranjpe, managing partner at MDP & Partners, who are solicitors for Nirmal Lifestyle, confirmed that an appeal was filed and stated that consent terms were executed between the financial creditor and the company for settlement of disputes. Its appeal is on the grounds that, despite settlement terms being executed, NCLT passed interim orders and admitted the insolvency petition against it. In its order, the NCLT bench of judicial member H V Subba Rao and technical member Chandrabhan Singh had, after hearing advocates Rohit Gupta for IDBI and Simil Purohit for Nirmal, allowed the financial creditor’s plea and initiated the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nirmal-lifestyle-moves-nclat-on-insolvency-plea/articleshow/85254308.cms||---

RPF men deployed at the most sensitive places in the region kept a close watch on the activities of human traffickers, rescued a large number of boys and girls from their clutches and sent them back to their native places. As many as 317 people had been rescued last year. RPF personnel have also launched a drive to keep tabs on the activities of bootleggers and narcotic smugglers. “They have arrested 74 bootleggers so far and seized 116 bottles of foreign liquor worth Rs 17.19 lakh till July,” the CSC told this reporter on Wednesday, adding that RPF men had recovered liquor worth Rs 12.72 lakh last year.

---||Patna||Garbage piles up as PMC workers’ strike continues||PATNA: Unpicked garbage began piling up in different parts of the city as the contractual workers of the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) continued their indefinite strike for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. They have put forth a 10-point demand charter that includes equal pay for equal work, job security and regularisation of Group D employees. On Wednesday, around 400 sanitation workers gathered at the PMC headquarters in Maurya Lok Complex and raised slogans against the state government and the civic body. They staged a protest under the aegis of the PMC 4th Grade Employees’ Association in the presence of its president, P K Azad Bhartiye, and general secretary, Nand Kishore Das. According to Bhartiye, altogether 7,000 sanitation workers, including 4,700 daily wagers and 2,300 outsourced employees, are on an indefinite strike. “We will not resume work until the PMC officials tell us why there is a pay parity. The daily wagers get Rs 9,000 per month and the outsourced group D employees Rs 7,000. The permanent sanitation workers, on the other hand, receive up to Rs 30,000 and other benefits,” Bhartiye said and added, “We should at least get Rs 18,000 per month.” Some protesters dumped heaps of garbage on the roads and carcasses at the PMC headquarters. The door-to-door garbage collection drive was also hampered, causing inconvenience to the city residents. PMC commissioner, Himanshu Sharma, told this newspaper on Wednesday that a complaint had been lodged against 20 sanitation workers for throwing garbage on roads, bodies of a dog and a pig on the premises of Maurya Lok, creating nuisance, disrupting the civic body’s work and beating up other employees on duty. “A report has also been sent to the SDM on the basis of which action will be taken against 50 sanitation workers under Section 107 of the CrPC. An ultimatum has been given to the workers to call off their strike and return to work. If they fail to do so by Thursday morning, their salaries will be cut,” Himanshu said, adding that the roads had been cleaned by the workers at night. Meanwhile, heaps of garbage near houses and on roads gave Patnaites a hard time. Birendra Kumar Singh, a resident of Old Patliputra Colony, rued, “Only common people suffer when there is a tussle between the civic body and the sanitation workers. They should look for a solution as soon as possible so that we do not face any inconvenience.” Archana Kumari, who lives in Kadamkuan, said, “Heaps of garbage have started piling up on the streets. I wonder when the sanitation workers will resume work and clean my area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/garbage-piles-up-as-pmc-workers-strike-continues/articleshow/85250851.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s Covishield stock may last just another day||KOLKATA: The civic body’s Covishield vaccination clinics and mega centres are now left with stock to last just another day. Accordingly, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) health department on Wednesday decided to keep its 102 Covishield clinics and 50 mega centres open on Thursday. Whether these clinics and centres will be able to administer Covishield doses from Friday will depend on the arrival of fresh stock, said a KMC health department official associated with the vaccination drive. “Shortage of vaccines has compelled us to operate on a day-to-day basis. For the past week, we have been running our Covishield centres amid a supply crunch. The crunch was so acute that it necessitated keeping the vaccination clinics and centres shut for a couple of days. The situation has improved, but we don’t have adequate Covishield stock that can feed all our clinics and centres for more than a day,” a civic official said. The KMC health department needs 30,000-35,000 Covishield doses daily to feed its 102 clinics and 50 mega centres. The chairman of the KMC Board of Administrators, Firhad Hakim, has advised the civic body’s health department to set up a buffer stock of 1 lakh Covishield doses to feed the clinics for more than three days if a fresh crisis hits the KMC’s vaccination drive. “I have taken up the matter with the state health department officials. But I understand that there is a dearth of vaccines in the entire state. The Centre has failed to keep its promise of sending required vaccines to Bengal to run our vaccination programmes uninterrupted,” Hakim said. According to KMC sources, the civic body has sufficient Covaxin stock for clinics till the weekend. The KMC has 38 Covaxin clinics and a few mega centres across 144 wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmcs-covishield-stock-may-last-just-another-day/articleshow/85253284.cms||Saikat Ray

Vijayasai Reddy said that the state government had passed a new legislation proposing three capitals for inclusive development and decentralisation. Accordingly, Kurnool was proposed as the judicial capital, he said and added the proposal was to realise an effective decentralised three capital model. He requested the minister to “take steps towards re-notifying the principal bench of the Andhra Pradesh high court from Amaravati to Kurnool.” The MP also requested the Union minister to establish a National Law University and the National Judicial Academy in Kurnool. He also wanted the National Judicial Academy to be established in Kurnool. The present judicial academy located in Bhopal caters to the entire country, he said and felt that more campuses of the judicial academy are required in order to reduce the workload on the Bhopal campus. Vijayasai Reddy also requested the Union Law and Justice minister to take steps to amend the tenth schedule of the Constitution for the timely disposal of anti-defection petitions. He cited Keisham Meghachandra Singh Vs Speaker of Manipur Legislative Assembly and said the Supreme Court in 2020 had suggested that three months was a reasonable time for disposal of anti-defection petitions. He also sought to remind the Union minister of the decision of the Rajya Sabha chairman who disposed the disqualification petition filed against Sharad Yadav within a period of three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vijayasai-writes-to-centre-on-shifting-hc-to-kurnool/articleshow/85251155.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt decides to grant 1% parallel quota for orphans||MUMBAI: MVA government on Wednesday decided to provide 1% parallel reservation to orphans, revising a BJP-led government decision. The cabinet led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray approved the proposal to provide 1% reservation in government jobs and education to children in orphanages. There are over 4,000 orphans in the state in orphanages. The department divided ‘orphans’ into A, B and C categories. Children completely orphaned and living in an orphanage and do not have information on whereabouts of parents, siblings, close relatives, village, taluka will be ‘A’. A child who lost both parents, has no caste certificate but is living in an orphanage will be ‘B’, and children who lost both parents before turning 18, but being brought up with relatives, especially paternal, will fall under ‘C’. Orphans will be eligible for concessions in criteria of age, tuition fees and exam fees as per Scheduled Castes (SC). But orphans from C will benefit with all other concessions in education but will not be eligible for government jobs. Yashomati Thakur, minister for women and child development (WCD), who played a key role in revising the norms, said that the decision will bring new light in the lives of orphans and maximum orphans should benefit. The decision of the previous government in January 2018 has not benefited orphans as none was able to get caste certificates to claim jobs or seats in educational institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-decides-to-grant-1-parallel-quota-for-orphans/articleshow/85258525.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The deceased was identified as Suman Shekhar, 34. As per his family’s statement to media, he was working for a private firm in Pune. Presently, he was working from home for almost five months due to the Covid pandemic. Vaishali Sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal said Shekhar was shot dead on his bed in his sleep. “One suspect wearing a cap and a mask was spotted in the CCTV cameras installed in his four-storey house. He entered the house at around 9.16am and escaped within a few minutes after shooting him dead,” he said. Dayal said Shekhar was shot in the head twice. Police recovered two empty cartridges from his bedroom. “There was no sign of forced entry. He lived on the second floor and doors always used remained open for a maid coming to work everyday at around 8am. The killer took advantage of this situation. The matter came to light when a neighbour came to ask him for food in the evening and found him murdered,” he said. The SDPO said Shekhar’s wife is pregnant and has gone to her parental residence. He was alone. “The first floor and top floors were locked. There is a tenant on the ground floor, but he didn’t hear or see anything,” he said. Dayal said police believe that he was murdered over illegal arms smuggling and disputes arising from it. “Shekhar’s eldest brother Santosh Singh alias Hathia, an arms smuggler, was shot dead on December 18, 2018. His second brother is presently behind bars in an arms smuggling case. His Youngest brother lives separately from the family,” he said. The SDPO said police have come to know that Shekhar was into the money-lending business, earlier run by his two brothers. He said two persons, including the one visible in the CCTV footage, have been made named accused by Sekhar’s family in his murder. “Both the accused are into arms smuggling. They are evading arrest,” he said. Dayal said a notorious arms smuggler, Om Prakash Chaurasia, was arrested with a regular carbine from Shekhar’s residence more than a year back. “He was living as a tenant. Later, a few policemen were also arrested in Chaurasia’s case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/engineer-found-murdered-in-hajipur/articleshow/85251455.cms||Debashish Karmakar

As the company was willing to produce oxygen and supply the same free of cost, the Supreme Court had granted permission to operate the plant for the limited purpose of manufacturing oxygen for medical supply.Subsequently, the company had manufactured and supplied 2132.64 metric tonne of liquid oxygen and 7833 cubic metres of high purity medical-grade gaseous oxygen as on July 29. The cost for the same amounting to Rs 38 crore was borne by the company.The petitioner stated that some of the materials have specific shelf life and its value would be lost if not used within time. The company proposes to remove and sell all these materials in order to cover the costs which were incurred in the production of oxygen.The petitioner stated that though a representation was sent to the state government seeking permission to remove these materials, there was no response. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench.

---||Delhi||North corpn rolls back hike in licence fees||New Delhi: Thousands of traders in the markets across north Delhi got some respite on Wednesday when the municipal corporation passed a proposal to roll back the hikes in trade and factory licence fees/renewal charges. North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which will go to the polls along with two other civic bodies next year, had increased the fees up to 17 times from April 2021 and notices were sent to shopkeepers to pay the same to avoid penalty. Civic officials had claimed that the fees were increased after 12 years to meet the expenditure for development work, but traders at Chandni Chowk, Kamla Nagar and neighbouring markets argued that it would further affect business activities already hit by Covid-19. “The south corporation had implemented it earlier, but we decided to roll it back as traders facing major losses are not in a position to pay this increased amount,” said standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain. The proposal will need the House’s approval and the collected amounts would be adjusted in next year’s charges, he added. The increased rates would have cost traders a hefty amount. For example, for granting and renewing trade licences for business activity in A & B categories and in shops spreading over 10 square metre, the hiked fee was Rs 3,450 instead of Rs 500 per year. For C & D categories, it was hiked to Rs 2,300 from Rs 500.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 11 injured as bus hits Maa flyover pillar||KOLKATA: Eleven passengers had a narrow escape after the private bus they were travelling by rammed into one of the pillars of Maa flyover. All 11 were lucky to come out alive with injuries, some minor and some severe. The incident took place around 8.30am on Wednesday near the Park Circus connector close to Maa flyover bifurcation, opposite Tiljala Covid safe home. One of the passengers received stitches, while two others were injured in their faces. The rest suffered minor wounds. The driver and conductor of the bus — plying on route KB 21 between Ganganagar and Bantala — fled after the accident. This is the third bus accident in as many days, leading to one death and 14 injuries. The police said they have carried out a forensic examination to find out how the accident took place after the bus drove into Pillar 33. “The passengers that we spoke to said the bus was at a high speed but was not racing with another bus. It seems the left front tyre of the bus burst due to speeding and the driver lost control. Instead of slamming into another vehicle, he swerved right and hit the pillar. The front driver’s side has taken maximum impact. Thus, we have asked the forensic experts to give us their opinion,” said an officer from Pragati Maidan police. The Tiljala traffic guard that helped rescue the passengers said it was important to ascertain the condition of the tyre that burst, along with the brakes of the vehicle. “We need to know if the bus was fit to be on road. A mechanical test will be done. The question is about the condition of the bus, rather than whether it was racing or not,” stated an officer. KMDA officials said apparently nothing suggested that the pier had been damaged. “Whether any internal structural damage has occurred or not can be detected only after tests,” said an official. Officials suggested that to minimize such accident’s impact on flyover piers, authorities have to set up median dividers with piers to reduce speed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/11-injured-as-bus-hits-maa-flyover-pillar/articleshow/85253251.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||Boycott census if caste headcount not done: Lalu Prasad||PATNA: Adding fresh fuel to the fire of caste-wise census demand, RJD president Lalu Prasad on Wednesday said all backwards, extremely backwards, dalits and minorities of the country may boycott the decennial census, if caste headcount is not allowed in the upcoming census 2021. “If caste-wise enumeration of population is not done in the upcoming census 2021, all backwards, extremely backwards, Dalit and minorities from all over the country, apart from Bihar, may boycott the decennial census. When a majority of the population do not get any benefit from the census data, will we make pickles out of the animals’ counting?” Lalu tweeted. Lalu’s statement invited sharp reaction from BJP. BJP OBC Morcha’s national general secretary and Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, “Lalu’s statement is very ridiculous. Lalu wants to play an emotional card by raising the issue of caste census. He wants to save the sinking boat of his RJD. If Lalu ji is so concerned on the issue of caste census, he should first ask his ally Congress that why it committed a fraud in the name of caste census in 2011? Why the Congress conducted a socio-economic caste census (SECC) in the name of ‘caste census’ out of the purview of the Census Act? Why Congress spent Rs5,000 crore in the name of the socio-economic caste census when a consensus had emerged after a resolution in Parliament to conduct a caste census in the country?” Anand also said the Congress government conducted only a ‘sample survey’ in the name of SECC. “Had Congress conducted a caste census in 2011, all the states would have been in a position to furnish caste-wise data? Today, the states are not in a position to provide caste data because the SECC has lakhs of discrepancies in its data,” the BJP leader said. The demand for caste-based census has become a major issue in Bihar politics. Bihar is among the few states where both ruling party — JD(U) — and the main opposition — RJD — are in the favour of a caste-wise enumeration of population in the upcoming census.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/boycott-census-if-caste-headcount-not-done-lalu/articleshow/85253270.cms||Madan Kumar

Following the revelation and subsequent probe, Talala police arrested resort owner Dr Rasik Vaghasiya, a gynaecologist of Una town in Gir-Somnath district. Dr Vaghasiya was booked under the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act 2020. According to police sources, Dr Vaghasiya had purchased seven bigha land adjacent to Gir sanctuary in Hadmatiya (Gir) village a few years ago. Later, he illegally encroached additional five bighas of forest land. He then built a resort with 24 rooms, a conference hall and a restaurant in 2018. The property was built under the name ‘Medicure’ and the doctor was doing a good business. He had had not taken permission from the concerned department to run the resort.  Forest department officials learnt that he had grabbed the forest land and filed an application before the collectorate. Preliminary investigation found this to be true and a complaint was lodged against him under the newly enacted land grabbing law. Police have also seized the register of his resort for investigation. Sources say that more such cases of people grabbing forest land may surface in the next few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/doc-builds-resort-by-grabbing-forest-land-near-gir-forest/articleshow/85251085.cms||---

This was a life lesson that many Surti entrepreneurs adapted to after the pandemic applied breaks on their routine work — these workaholics put their minds to test.So, be it the septuagenarian realtor or the businessman, or a 52-year-old co-operative bank director and a 40-year-old production engineer — all took an educational sabbatical — a pause to rest, reflect, and upgrade skills and interests in diverse fields.Velji Sheta, 62, a civil engineer and a successful realtor in diamond city recently appeared for first year exam in MA political science.“I hope to get good marks. I like studying political trends and I have also developed interest in political science which is largely focused on history,” Sheta, former Gujarat president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI) told TOI. Sixty-year-old businessman Kanji Bhalala, president of Saurashtra Patel Samaj has completed first year studies in MA economics, a second post-graduation (PG) which is he pursuing 40 years after he finished his first PG.“I like gathering knowledge. It helps to understand the changing world. I study to improve my understanding and knowledge,” Bhalala, a law graduate, who had also studied journalism when he was young, said.Dipak Lukhi, 40, a real-estate developer, picked up books 16 years after completing production engineering. “I was interested in studying political science. There will not be any better time than the current one when I can focus on studies,” said Lukhi, who recently completed first year in MA political science.Kanti Marakana, a 52-year-old tax consultant appeared in LLM final year exam as well as first year exam of MA economics on the same day. “I did LLM from Sardar Patel University and MA from Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU). I am now planning to do a PhD in banking,” said Marakana, director of Varachha Cooperative Bank.Intellectual property rights consultant Paresh Lathiya completed first year of MA political science at the age of 45. A science graduate, Lathiya plans to even pursue a PhD over two decades after he discontinued his studies in 1999."Earlier, there were limited resources for people who wanted to pursue their higher studies. But now there are many opportunities for those who want to upgrade themselves. People should try to follow these individuals and we are ready to support such students," VNSGU vice-chancellor K N Chavda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pandemic-pause-adds-new-vistas-to-professionals-book-of-life/articleshow/85253400.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

However, most of them did not get students coming back with any dispute resolution. Wednesday was the last day to apply for dispute resolution in cases where a student could come with doubts about marks computation. They could come with proof of original marks and tally with the school. “No none turned up for dispute resolution in our school from X or XII. I think they are satisfied with their scores. Moreover, they must have put the past behind them and are now moving on with their studies,” said principal of Birla High School Loveleen Sehgal. Class X passouts have already started their XI course, whereas many of XII batch are either in transit to foreign campuses or outside the state. “In such situation, they will have time to seek a recalculation. I don’t think anyone will seek an improvement exam too, for which applications will close on Sunday,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-cbse-pass-outs-give-score-re-check-a-pass/articleshow/85253329.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The government is also yet to make any announcement on the possibility of reopening special schools or some form of streamlining care and education for children with special needs.“We are holding online classes every day to keep students engaged. While initially, it was difficult, the children are now more used to it and parents are also making efforts as it is the only way forward now. From one hour a day in the beginning, now we are trying to keep classes for three hours, which has got good feedback,” said Jeyapal A, founding member, Bethshan Special School. On the other hand, parents also have to put in a lot of effort, with most of them now working as well.N Rajadurai, father of a special child, said they are unable to continuously keep their son engaged at home as both he and his wife are working. “It has been stressful for me and my wife since at least during the day we were able to leave him in the care of his teachers. It has also not been easy to manage his behavioural issues as well. Though our son is adapting to online learning, it is not the same as school and only sometimes he’s responsive to the classes,” he said. Another parent, K Gayathri, a homemaker, said for special children in particular, the lockdown and Covid-19 pandemic have been extremely difficult to adapt to. “My daughter’s teachers are helping to create a new routine at home. But, I have to work twice as hard to even keep her interested in learning,” she added.In case of children with special needs from poor backgrounds with little or no access to online classes, it has been even more challenging. “Though we created short video lessons for students, we ultimately had to resort to taking learning to homes of children for those with special needs. But, in long term, this cannot be a permanent solution and parents are also facing the burden,” said J Shamila Doris, correspondent, YMCA Kamak higher secondary school. Special educators are hoping school reopening for children with special needs will also be considered in September if Covid-19 cases remain low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/managing-kids-with-special-needs-gets-tougher-for-teachers/articleshow/85220890.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

She said, “I don’t believe in the politics of posters, but want to rule and dwell in the hearts of the people.” Raje was speaking to mediapersons at her home constituency Jhalawar on the concluding day of her three-day tour to flood-affected areas in Jhalawar–Baran on Wednesday before leaving for Dholpur. “When I came to politics, Rajmataji (Mother) told me that five fingers of the hand are never equal and when you visit the villages, you need to unite people into a family with love for each other, despite their being of various kinds. I always intended to carry out such works that I can endure in their memories and hearts.” Raje added, “Politics is not everything. Politics comes out when you embrace the people of all walks of life.” Describing her biggest aspiration, Raje said, “I am here to rule hearts of the people and carry out such work that the people can bear it in their mind and when the people bear me in mind, they would love me and I would be able to make way to their hearts.” Sources said that Raje’s statement is to express her resentment over the change of posters and banners in the BJP headquarter and at several districts following a guideline for the same. “The party’s guideline says that all official posters and banners in the state where BJP is in Opposition to having the picture of PM Narendra Modi and party’s national president J P Nadda on one side and state president and leader of the opposition on the other side. The new rule doesn’t leave any space for Raje in the state to be seen in official posters and banners,” said the party source. The controversy comes to the fore in early June when the poster having the picture of Raje outside the BJP headquarter in Jaipur was removed. Then, it gave rise to the speculation that it was a result of the power struggle between the state president Satish Poonia and Raje.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raje-hits-back-at-poster-row-says-will-rule-peoples-hearts/articleshow/85255902.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Five city junior colleges move Bombay HC, seek exclusion from centralised admission process||NAGPUR: Five well known junior colleges have approached the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court seeking exclusion of area under corporation limits from the centralised admission process (CAP) for Std XI admissions. Citing a large number of seats that remained vacant in junior colleges located under city’s jurisdiction in last four years, the petitioner colleges said the purpose for which the CAP was introduced is getting defeated. Pointing out that Aurangabad city has been excluded from the CAP by the government, the petitioners, including New English and Somalwar junior colleges, through counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni, prayed for exclusion of institutions coming under the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) area. A division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor issued notices to the state education department secretary, director of secondary and higher secondary education in Pune and deputy director of education in Nagpur. While adjourning the hearing for two weeks, the bench directed all respondents to reply before that date. The petitioners moved the HC after director of secondary and higher secondary education issued orders to start online CAP for Std XI seats in Nagpur, Amravati, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nashik. According to the petitioners, last year 24,416 seats remained vacant out of total 59,250. In 2019-20, of the total 58,840 seats, 20,982 were not filled. Similarly, in 2018-19, 19,489 seats couldn’t be filled out of 54,810 and in 2017-18, over 18,000 seats remained vacant out of total 54,250. Faculty-wise, science stream saw 3,148 seats vacant, commerce 5,545, arts 3,825 and MCVC 1,030 in the city colleges. Alleging rampant commercialization of Std XII education due to unholy nexus between junior colleges and coaching classes, about 30 junior colleges from the city, led by New English High School Association, had filed a public interest litigation last year contending that many no-grant-in-aid institutions have mushroomed under Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority areas, outside NMC limits. Urging to cancel Std 11 CAP, they had contended that a majority of colleges in NMRDA area are having illegal tie-ups with private classes and, therefore, students and parents prefer them, as they don’t have to regularly attend lectures. Even biometric machines for students’ attendance are installed at coaching classes in the city, instead of classrooms in colleges in rural areas, the petitioner had alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5-city-junior-colleges-move-hc-seek-exclusion-from-cap/articleshow/85253290.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

As of now, some states allow entry to fully vaccinated travellers without negative RT-PCR reports. But states such as West Bengal (for travellers from Mumbai, Pune and Chennai), Karnataka, Goa and Chhattisgarh still ask for RT-PCR negative reports irrespective of the travellers’ double vaccination status. Brar said the ministry was trying to convince all states to adopt the uniform protocol — not to mandate RT-PCR tests for fully vaccinated travellers who show their final vaccination certificates.The tourism ministry had a meeting with representatives of the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality and all state governments on August 5, with the discussions mainly focusing on harmonization of travel protocols during the Covid-19 pandemic. “States such as Sikkim and Maharashtra are allowing travellers from other parts of the country on the basis of full vaccination and not on RT-PCR test reports. In principle, all states that were part of the meeting agreed this was a logical option,” Brar said.“We now hope to see something positive coming out of this in the coming days. Nevertheless, we have written to all state governments to reinforce this line of thought and hope to get a confirmation mail from them in a day or two,” she added.The tourism ministry will also hold a meeting with the ministries of health and family welfare and civil aviation to see how the uniform protocol could be taken ahead and more relaxations could be worked out for the travellers. “The tourism secretary had written to all states a month ago to prioritize vaccination of the frontline staff in the hospitality and tourism sectors. A lot of states responded in the affirmative and started doing so. For instance, the pilgrimage town of Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh has reported 100% vaccination of the frontline staff in the two sectors. The states are in particular trying to ensure full vaccination of hospitality staff in the dense tourist hubs,” Brar said. Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy had on August 9 replied to a question in the Lok Sabha on whether the states were directed to allow only vaccinated tourists, especially for the popular national monuments, cities and spots. “The ministry of tourism has requested the state governments/ UT administrations to exempt the double vaccinated passengers from carrying the latest RT-PCR report at the time of inter-state travel on production of a valid final certificate of double vaccination,” Reddy had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tourism-ministry-urges-states-uts-to-exempt-fully-vaccinated-of-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/85255938.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Pune: Two 5-star hotels up for sale, few seek new operators||PUNE: Two prominent fivestar hotels, one in the Bund Garden area and another in Hinjewadi, have become the latest victim of Covid-induced restrictions in the city, with their managements expressing gross inability to run them any more because of severe cash crunch and uncertain future. Confirming the development, members from the Poona Hoteliers’ Association (PHA) said besides these two properties being put on sale, managements at another fourstar hotel on MG Road and three-four star hotels in other busy localities were looking for new operators to manage the properties. “Some star hotels in Pune are looking for buyers, with the five-star hotel in Hinjewadi reportedly being on sale for over Rs 200 crore. We have heard that stakeholders in some bigger hotels are changing. Hinjewadi is in a very bad shape and most of the hotels are shut or on the verge of shutting down or sold off in the area,” a source from the PHA said. Sources from the hospitality industry said a ‘hotel properties for sale’ search online fetches numerous results for hotels in places like Pune, Lonavla, Mumbai, and even Goa. They are up for grabs in the market for crores of rupees. “Many of these properties came up in the last four to five years and have huge debts to repay. It will take a while for anyone in the market to buy off some of these properties as the economy is yet to revive to pre-Covid times,” a city-based hotelier said. Several hotels have not opened up so far during/ after the second wave. “A couple of them did open last year in November-December and have remained shut during the second wave. Many hotels have been running at an average of 10% occupancy. It is a huge burden to open with operational costs running high,” another hotelier from the city said. A hotelier from the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) said at least four hotels could not start operations after the pandemic, with one putting up a part of its section as office space. “The losses from recurrent curbs was one of the main reasons, making situation worse for some due to competition with newer hotels springing up since the last few years. Investors in many hotel properties have been looking for diluting their stakes. A few ownerdriven properties are finding it difficult to run the properties and hence putting them up for sale”, he said. He said commercial business travel was almost non-existent, with medical representatives’ conferences, trainings, exhibitions in hotels coming to zilch. Industry insiders said Maharashtra had around 10,500 hotels and 2,10,000 restaurants. “Almost 30% of the hotels hotels and half of the total restaurants or approximately 3,000 hotels and 1 lakh restaurants have shut in the last 15 months,”a source from HRAWI said, adding that of the 50 lakh employees engaged in the industry directly across Maharashtra, over 25 lakh have already lost their jobs due to Covid-induced curbs and resultant loss of business. Due to recurrent restrictions, the hospitality industry has been demanding a complete waiver on all statutory fees and taxes, and establishments should not be billed for water and electricity for the duration of the curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-5-star-hotels-up-for-sale-few-seek-new-operators/articleshow/85255962.cms||Neha Madaan

The health workers wade through streams and scale hills to give the much-needed jab to the beneficiaries. An auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) of Daraka Naya village Rajan Bala broke her right hand after she slipped. Doctors used plaster for healing. “I slipped and broke my hand on a rainy day four days ago. Incessant rains have made it difficult for us to reach several areas as we have to cross streams and the stretch connecting the villages have also become muddy, which makes it difficult to ride a two-wheeler,” said Bala. A fleet of doctors, nurses and ASHA workers are working hard in rural areas to increase the Covid vaccine coverage. Bala said in her area, 870 people are eligible for vaccination and she had inoculated over 850 beneficiaries till date, which is around 98% of people in her area. Bundi is one of the districts, which has witnessed heavy rainfall in the past few days. During rains, Keshupura and Bherupura areas in Ramgarh Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary, which fall under Adarsh primary health centre Dablana, in Bundi, was difficult to reach. Dr Srinath Soni, posted at Dablana PHC said, “We have to wade through streams flowing upto 8-10 feet to reach areas near Ramgarh Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary. We scaled up hills and reached the villages where at least1,500 beneficiaries of Covid vaccines are residing in the area. In some difficult areas, nurses and doctors are putting their own life at risk while ensuring that the vaccination drive keeps moving. Bundi is among the top districts performing well in Covid vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-workers-wade-through-streams-of-waters-to-vaccinate-people-in-remote-areas-of-bundi/articleshow/85255939.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The theft occurred just 10 metres away from a police outpost in Tajpur village under Narkhi police station. In protest against the delayed police response, villagers blocked the Tundla-Etah Road on Wednesday. The victim, Arun Pratap Singh, who is the state general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), said, "We came to know about the theft during a power cut. The three men with their faces covered with a scarf fled after locking us inside rooms when we were asleep. The crime occurred 10m away from the police outpost. Senior police officials, including the Narkhi SHO, came two hours after the incident. We want the thieves to be arrested soon.” Arun’s father Yashpal Singh said, “The thieves broke into the house. They took away over Rs 3 lakh cash and 400gm of gold ornaments worth Rs 25 lakh. At 1:30 am, my son woke up to switch on the inverter following the power cut. He found that the door was locked from outside. On seeing from the window, he found three men inside the corridor. By the time he was able to come out of the room, the thieves fled." According to villagers, a fire exchange also took place between the thieves and Yashpal Singh. Thieves had opened fire at Arun and his younger brother Varun when they tried to catch them. In retaliation, Yashpal opened fire from his licenced rifle. The cops at the nearby outpost came after the thieves managed to flee, villagers claimed. Deputy superintendent of police Abhishek Srivastava said, “On basis of the complaint received, an FIR has been registered against unidentified persons under IPC sections 382 [theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft] and 458 [lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint].

---||Madurai||HC upholds order on compassionate posting||Madurai: Upholding an order of a single bench, the Madras high court has dismissed an appeal preferred by a woman seeking compassionate appointment for her son, by taking into account that her elder son was working as a police constable.A division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and M Duraiswamy observed that the objective of the scheme to provide compassionate appointment is to provide employment to an eligible family member of a government servant who dies in harness, leaving his family in penury and without any means of livelihood. It cannot be a regular source of employment.The court was hearing the appeal filed by K Chellammal. The appellant’s husband K Gandhi, who was working as a special sub-inspector of police died during service in 2009. She had submitted a representation to the authorities seeking appointment on compassionate grounds for her younger son. The authorities had rejected her application on the ground that her elder son had been working as a police constable from 2008.Challenging the rejection order, Chellammal had filed a petition before the high court, however, the same was dismissed by the single bench. Hence, she had filed the present appeal challenging the order of the single bench contending that her elder son was not taking care of the family members.In the present case, the judges took note of the fact that the elder son of the appellant was working as a police constable and there was no proof to show that he was not looking after the family members. Hence, the judges upheld the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-order-on-compassionate-posting/articleshow/85255934.cms||---

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administration will appoint a consultant to prepare the pre-feasibility report. The environmental impact will also be assessed. An expression of interest for the appointment of a consultant has been issued, said an official. The tunnel will connect Kothrud, Pashan and Gokhale Nagar. As per the proposal, the distance between Kothrud and Pashan will be reduced by half after the tunnel is completed. As of now, the distance between Kothrud and Pashan is 8.5km via Chandni Chowk and 9.5km via Senapati Bapat Road. Once the tunnel is ready, the distance will reduce to 4km. The residents of these areas have raised several issues, including safety and security. They said the tunnel will cause damage to environment. “The tunnel is unnecessary, expensive and destructive,” said Pushkar Kulkarni of Pashan Area Sabha. Vaishali Patkar of Aundh Vikas Mandal said that the project will cause more harm than good. “We will conduct a feasibility study to check the impact of the project on environment,” said Shrinivas Bonala, traffic planner, the PMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-explore-pashan-tunnel-feasibility-despite-opposition/articleshow/85253473.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

Now, 30 Delhi government schools will be undertaking the IB programme through this partnership. The schools adopting the IB curriculum will be affiliated with DBSE. With the signing of an agreement of collaboration with the Geneva-based IB, these schools will be adopting global practices in curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. Among the schools that are part of the new curriculum are classes IX-XII in 20 Specialised Schools of Excellence and classes up to VIII in 10 Sarvodaya Vidyalayas.\ At a press conference on Wednesday, Kejriwal declared, “I have come with good news for Delhi’s children and parents. The Centre has the central board of education and every state has its own board. So, we recently created Delhi Board of School Education. People undermined our vision for education in Delhi and thought we started a state board for the sake of it. It is not so. DBSE has now signed an MoU with the IB, which provides international education. It is the dream of rich parents to send their children to IB schools. The governments of big countries like the United States and Spain have an MOU with IB. DBSE also now has an agreement with IB and our children will get an international education.” Kejriwal said that in the past few years, the results showed how government schools had dramatically improved in academics. “We were at a juncture where we had to improve what was being taught, how it was being taught and we had to bring our children up to international standards,” he said. “This will be a great model for the rest of our country and it will show the rest of our country how we can provide quality education to the most underprivileged people.” He added that more schools would be included in the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-lauds-collaboration-says-big-day-for-delhiites/articleshow/85253498.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government violates NGT orders on construction at Mt Abu||JAIPUR: In a haste to amend the Zonal Master Plan-2030 to allow construction in the notified eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Mt Abu, the state government is ignoring the recent National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders issued to maintain the sanity of the approximately 330 sqkm protected area. The municipality is allegedly also not seeking participation of the stakeholders including forest department. TimesViewAt a time when plans are afoot to frame a forest conservation policy, initiatives to alter the status of an ecologically fragile belt in Mt Abu Zonal Master Plan-2030 from a strictly demarcated 'no construction zone' to 'construction permissible zone' show the state government's dishonest claims to conserve forests. The government should reconsider its decision as this would not only kill the habitat for wildlife, including sloth bears and leopards, but would also destroy the historic Nakki Lake.A senior official source said, “As per the NGT orders dated March 10, 2021, the revision of the ZMP has to be undertaken by the authorities concerned in consultation with the nine member committee constituted by the Tribunal vide order November 7, 2019. However, there was no such information.” The NGT has also directed all blank patches of land within the ESZ has to be greened up by the municipal corporation. Buffers around drains, wetlands and forest should be duly maintained and protected. The ZMP-2030 of Mount Abu was notified on October 29, 2015 after approval by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Mo-EF&CC) on September 28, 2015. An official source at forest said, “The municipality may get stumped and move can be challenged as at the time of receiving approval from MoEF, it has mentioned that area will be no construction zone.” Meanwhile, refuting the claims that prohibited zone will be open for construction, chief town planner Rajasthan , RK Vijayvargiya said, “The area of no construction zone is not defined. We have started the exercise to mention which land is outside the no construction zone and where construction is allowed.” The local civic body has started deliberations to change the land use norm from ‘no construction zone’ in the area between Nakki Lake and the famous Dilwara temples to ‘permissible construction zone’ for the benefit of powerful interests who have large chunks of land in the area. As per documents with TOI, on June 18, the directorate of local bodies (DLB) issued an order to Mt Abu municipality to initiate the process for amending Mt Abu (ESZ) building bylaws, 2019, to carry out construction in the prohibited area. Following this, on July 2, the municipality invited objections and suggestions within 15 days from the public. The matter got highlighted after the proposal to change the land use was tabled at the municipality board meeting on August 4. Environmentalists and local residents also think that the decision would kill the historic Nakki Lake as construction would be allowed in the catchment areas as there are innumerable water channels on this land which brings water to the lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-violates-ngt-orders-to-amend-the-allow-construction-in-mt-abu/articleshow/85255973.cms||---

Activists have blamed rainwater accumulation and poor upkeep for the rise in dengue cases in some parts of the city. They also underlined that the unprecedented rise in Covid cases in April-May led to halfhearted pre-monsoon measures, resulting in the rise in mosquito-borne illnesses in Pune. Sahyadri hospital’s critical care expert Kapil Borawake said, “A 38-year-old Phursungi resident succumbed to dengueassociated complications at the hospital’s Hadapsar branch on July 17. He had obesity and hypertension. The man had tested positive for the dengue (IgM) antibody test.” The second dengue death occurred at Chintamani hospital in Bibvewadi on July 26. “The deceased was an 83-yearold man, a resident of Bibvewadi and had tested positive for the dengue antibody (IgM) test. He also had other co-morbid conditions,” said hospital’s critical care expert Sachin Yadav. The third dengue death happened at Vishwaraj hospital on July 27. “A 22-year-old man from Bopgaon village in Purandar taluka succumbed to dengue-associated complications within seven days of hospitalization. He was critical at the time of admission and was on ventilator support,” said Borawake, who is also a chief intensivist at Vishwaraj hospital. The condition of four more patients is currently critical. One of them is being treated at Navale hospital in Narhe. “The patient with severe dengue has developed secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a potentially fatal condition,” said hospital’s critical care expert Pushkar Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dengue-rears-its-head-ncov-hinders-combat-measures/articleshow/85255983.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Pune||Pune: Brain swelling among patients a concern, say experts||PUNE: A consistent rise in brain swelling cases among dengue patients over the years has become a cause of concern in Pune. Brain inflammation or swelling, medically termed as dengue encephalopathy, is a relatively uncommon neurological complication of dengue fever. With dengue cases on the rise, treating doctors should be highly suspicious when a patient presents himself with atypical symptoms, including high-grade fever and neurological manifestation like convulsions, health experts said. Whenever a patient presents with an alteration in mental status (confusion/disorientation) called altered sensorium, a brain scan must be done, the experts advised. “The dengue virus has started manifesting neurological complications more frequently over the last five years. Doctors are seeing quite a few cases of dengue-associated brain inflammation or swelling in Pune this season,” said critical care expert Kapil Borawak, chief intensivist of Vishawaraj Hospital, Sahyadri hospital, and Prayag hospital in Pune. “Patients often suffer from liver failure, which leads to the development of encephalopathy. This is seen in a dengue patient either because of kidney or liver failure,” said critical care expert Subhal Dixit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/brain-swelling-among-patients-a-concern/articleshow/85255997.cms||Umesh Isalkar

As part of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) the certification has been awarded to the city by the Union housing ministry and is the only city in the state to get it.Only those cities who were declared ODF++ (open defecation free) were eligible to qualify for this certification. The SBM Water+ certification is given to a city for achieving the parameters of safe sustainable sanitation for all by ensuring that no untreated wastewater is discharged into the open environment. “This award will further accelerate the growth engine of the city,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. According to SBM definition for Water+ status, a city gets all wastewater released from households, commercial establishments, drains, etc treated to a satisfactory level (as per CPCB norms), before releasing it to the environment. Further, not only is adequate capacity of wastewater and sewage treatment facilities to be ensured, but infrastructure also should be maintained properly while ensuring cost recovery through recycling of treated wastewater ensuring sustainability, it states. SMC scored 100 percent in safe discharge of sewage from public and household toilets and safe cleaning of sewer and septic tanks both manually and through mechanised equipment. It also scored highest marks in adequate treatment capacity of sewage treatment plant and also for operational efficiency, and cleaning septic tanks.

These will include piped oxygen supply to all beds, new 150-bed paediatric intensive care unit and installation of a PET Scan machine. “These projects will significantly improve the patient care services provided by various hospitals under the KGMU,” said KGMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen (retd) Dr Bipin Puri while sharing the university’s future plans on health care and medical education with reporters on Wednesday. The occasion also marked one year of Dr Puri’s term as the vice-chancellor. “A 20,000-litre liquid oxygen plant and a 1,000 litre oxygen generating plant will become functional at the Queen Mary’s Hospital by next month. Similarly, a 1,000 litre oxygen generating plant will start working at the Trauma Centre,” he said. With the completion of these three plants, all the 4,500 beds in various departments and hospitals of the university will be covered with 24X7 piped oxygen supply, he added. At present, KGMU has two CT Scan machines. Another machine will be added by next month to reduce the waiting period of the patients. The paediatric ICU is ready and will be inaugurated next month, the KGMU vice-chancellor said. “The PET scan machine essential for the treatment of cancer will be set up within four months. The funds have been sanctioned by the government and the procurement process will start soon,” he said. This will be KGMU’s first PET scan machine. At present, patients at KGMU are referred to SGPGIMS and RMLIMS for the PET Scan test.

They have treated and rehabilitated more than 1,500 community dogs since 2017, and now have 120 dogs under their care. They are youtubers by profession and are also into freelancing in the field of information technology.Dogs with various health conditions, including those injured in accidents and lost their limbs, with mange and even with the highly infectious parvovirus are under their care at the shelter set up on a 13-cent plot at Kochadai in Madurai. Two veterinarians, Dr A Karthik and surgeon Dr M S Sabhareesh Babu, work for their dogs 24x7.Donations and their own earnings go into the running of this shelter. “Anyone who sees a street dog can call us on 80722-67161 and we will take our ambulance and rescue the animals on the spot,” he said. All dogs brought to the shelter are vaccinated against rabies and spayed when they recover from their injuries.Among their dogs, is a pack of 20 healthy robust Sippiparai dogs, which are the donors when any dog in the shelter needs blood for a surgery. The rescued dogs are reintroduced into their area after treatment or given for adoption.“The corporation’s new rule that we should register the dogs has caused a concern, because we release the dogs in their original habitats after treatment or spaying,” said Navneeth. “After registering a dog we become the official owners, and if the dogs misbehave we will be held responsible and made to pay the fine of Rs 500?’’ asks Saruhasan. Like them, there are hundreds of animal lovers in Madurai, including H Mayur, who have raised the same concern, and plan to take it up with the corporation authorities.Madurai Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said that the final decision on the implementation of the rule would be taken after receiving the feedback from the public. People have been given fifteen days to raise objections, if any, by writing to the city health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dog-rescuers-fear-corpns-new-rule-will-hit-their-work/articleshow/85256011.cms||---

An official said districts like Akola, Bhandara, Dhule and Gadchiroli collected less than 6,000 swab samples in a week and recorded 1-2% weekly positivity rate (WPR), based on which the state government announces relaxations. He said the real situation in these districts would not reflect if the testing remained low. Experts stressed that the low testing in the 10 districts was a concern though the RT-PCR tests now comprised 55% of the Covid tests in the state. “If the number of tests remain so low, the WPR would be obviously less than 1%. Yavatmal collected just 3,029 test samples for the week ending on August 9. The WPR in Yavatmal for the week was 0.4%. Ditto in Wardha, where just 2,339 tests were carried out for the week and the WPR was 0.2%,” said a public health official. In contrast, Pune, Mumbai, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar recorded over one lakh tests in seven days from August 3 to 9. Pune district carried out 1.11 lakh tests and registered 5.8% WPR and Mumbai conducted 2.34 lakh tests and registered 1.1% WPR in the same period. State surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said districts would have to intensify testing as the Delta-plus variant of coronavirus was present in the state. “Districts should conduct maximum tests in pockets witnessing surges. All districts have been asked to ramp up testing, especially where the Delta Plus variant has been found,” he said. Some experts cited infrastructure issues for low testing in remote districts. This could be the possible reason behind more RATs than RT-PCR tests there, they stated. The health department has asked the district administrations concerned to rope in more laboratories and increase the number of mobile swabs collection vans for the rural areas. Public health expert R Jotkar said testing adequately should be given utmost importance against the backdrop of Delta-plus variant cases slowly increasing. “Some districts are declaring that they are Covid-free. But reduced testing is a major concern,” he told TOI. Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) on Wednesday issued a directive to increase daily testing in all the 13 talukas. ZP CEO Ayush Prasad said a target had been set for each taluka. Except Velhe taluka, which has been given a target of 500 tests daily, the rest have been directed to conduct 2,500-3,000 tests daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-dept-nudge-to-10-dists-over-laxity-in-testing/articleshow/85256047.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The study—Clean Drinking Water: A Pipe Dream?—assessed Goa’s tap water and found that the potable water supplied to homes is contaminated with microplastics, one of the sources of which could be the PVC pipes. “Microplastics may already be there in the water, but when tap water passes through plastic pipes, it adds more microplastics. The water transporting system must be checked as a mitigation measure to understand the status of our drinking water,” lead researcher from NIO, Mahua Saha, said. Microplastics (MP) are particles of plastic that are less than 5mm in size and have been recognised globally as one of the most critical emerging marine pollutants, due to their persistence, ubiquity and toxic potential. Eleven samples of water collected from taps and water treatment plants across the state were analysed for microplastics contamination at NIO. A total of 288 MP particles were found in the tap water samples, with the highest level of abundance detected in Mapusa. “The main sources of drinking water in Goa are rivers and presence of microplastics in the pre-treated water indicates that the water sources or rivers are polluted. This could be primarily due to plastic littering and waste water discharge in the river systems,” Saha said. Associate director, Toxics Link, Satish Sinha said that MPs are usually fibres, fragments, colours, tyres, packaging material that disintegrate quickly and become a part of the soil, water bodies and seafood. These are synthetic polymers that are not soluble in water. “It doesn’t lose its original properties and chemical just because it disintegrates and ingesting them could be extremely harmful to human health,” he said. The impact of the carcinogenic pollutants could also have an impact on marine organisms, especially shrimp. “Birth defects and reproduction problems are caused due to the presence of microplastics, besides reducing the fish population overtime,” Saha said. They called for immediate intervention of municipal corporations and the state government to address waste management practices and improve the filtration plants and transportation system of water. “For mitigation, we need to bring the state and central governments in the picture and work on the source of MPs. It should not be confined to one state, but should be expanded to other states as well. This is a preliminary study and it needs to be extrapolated. More comprehensive study and extensive collection of the samples is necessary for analytical procedure,” Saha said. “Though plastic waste management rules have been in force in the country, public awareness and participation holds the key to improving plastic waste management and the subsequent reduction in microplastic pollution. Various stakeholders, including the industry, government, civil society organisations, need to collaborate to bring about change,” Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plastic-flows-through-goas-tap-water-nio/articleshow/85256064.cms||Nida Sayed

The deceased, Hemant Sutar (20) of Ladvad village in Khed taluka, died on the spot. His friend, Suraj Valunj (28), is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. A team from the Chakan police arrested the restaurant owner, Hritik Vahile, and his accomplice, Mayur Yevale (22). Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said the incident took place when Sutar and Valunj were drinking alcohol at Vahile’s restaurant on Monday night. “Sutar had made some objectionable comments about a cook’s wife. When the cook and the manager objected to his behaviour, Sutar slapped the former,” the commissioner said. Vahile reprimanded Sutar for the action, which led to a heated argument. “Sutar and Valunj then left the spot. A furious Vahile, accompanied by Yevale, got into an sports utility vehicle (SUV) and chased Sutar and Valunj, who were on a two-wheeler. The duo rammed the motorcycle with their SUV on the bridge over the Bhama river. Vahile and Yevale attacked them with sharp weapons and hit them with a rod,” Krishna Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/resto-owner-aide-arrested-on-charges-of-murder-assault/articleshow/85253489.cms||---

He also pressed for restoration of unreserved compartments in express and mail trains to benefit a larger section of commuters.Venkatesan said that 3,715 ordinary passenger trains were operated across the country in 2019-20. “All these trains were cancelled along with 4,058 mail and express trains and 5,396 EMUs (electric multiple-unit) during the nationwide lockdown last year,” he said.The MP recalled that the Railway Board by an order converted 500 passenger trains running more than 200km into express trains. During unlock, many express trains and even EMUs in suburban areas were restored in a phased manner to benefit the workforce and those in the essential staff. “But the ordinary low fare passenger trains catering largely to the rural people have not been restored,” he said. Ordinary passenger services catered to 1,851 million passenger movements in 2019-2020, which is 22.89% of the total passengers handled by the railways. He noted that ordinary passenger trains stopped at all smaller stations and helped carry a large number of rural people to sell their agricultural products and to travel for work and education on a daily basis. He said that the express trains operated now do not provide concessions like those available for senior citizens. They also don’t have unreserved general compartments. “A doubt arises as to whether the railway ministry has decided to run only profit-making services bereft of social obligation due to which ordinary trains are also not operated or if the government is discriminating against rural people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-urges-railway-ministry-to-resume-ordinary-services/articleshow/85256041.cms||---

The 90-year-old army man is from 4 Rajputana Rifles, which is also gold medalist Neeraj Chopra’s unit. Even at this ripe old age, he remembers the days of sweat and toil which helped him win gold at the national level. Shrichand, who did not even have a tracksuit till he went to Olympics, refused to take leave from 1953 to 1956 so that he could focus on his practice. He said after Chopra won gold, he distributed sweets in his village at Jhunjhunu. He was the first person from Rajasthan as well as from Rajputana Rifles to go to Olympics. After joining the army in 1949, he started training in 1950. The Arjun Awardee, who hails from Mainana in Jhunjhunu told TOI, “I had no coach, no equipment and would make hurdles out of bamboo stick. The shoes that we wore were also normal and there was no special diet. I held the national record from 1953 to 1963 of 14.4 metres in hurdle. In fact from 1953 till the Olympics, I did not take a single day off, but unfortunately just a week before my event, I injured my thigh muscle but despite that, I participated in the 110 metre hurdles.” The honorary captain took up coaching after 1962 post winning gold in various international sports events following which he retired from army in 1978 and served in the BSF till 1989 where also he coached athletes. “Now, there are more facilities available, but at that time it was different and I wore a tracksuit for the first time in 1956. Since I was a vegetarian at that time, I could not eat anything except fruits for three days when I reached Melbourne. I continued to coach athletes while being in army as well as BSF and some of them achieved great success,” added the Honorary Captain. Giving complete credit to his father, the athlete said the ‘ladoos and ghee’ from home helped him during his training days. A senior to late Milkha Singh, they trained together in camps. On Chopra’s win, Shrichand said, “I distributed sweets in the village and also spoke to senior of Raj Rifles that Neeraj should be a commissioned officer. He has created history and deserves the success.” Shrichand was also Aide-De-Camp (ADC) of former PM Late Indira Gandhi for two weeks in 1976 though is now content to live a simple life in his village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gold-spearhead-neerajs-army-unit-veteran-relives-his-1956-oly-days/articleshow/85256127.cms||---

The state government imposed restrictions on temple festivals a week ago, after large crowds started gathering in the temples for the various rituals and festivals, which are held in the month of Aadi. As there was risk of number of Covid-19 cases increasing, the district administrations had imposed restrictions and ordered closure of temples. After the ‘Aadi Amavasai’-- the new moon day in the month of Aadi-- temples again reopened on Monday, only to be closed again on Wednesday, as it was the ‘Aadi Pooram’ festival. Priests performed the rituals, and the car festival was held within the temple premises. In the Meenakshi temple, the Aadi Pooram festival was celebrated in the morning and the rituals for the Aavani festival in the temple began in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/temples-close-again-rituals-held-without-devotees/articleshow/85256092.cms||---
---||Delhi||30 Delhi govt schools to take IB route to excellence, part ways with CBSE||NEW DELHI: With Delhi Board of School Education and International Baccalaureate signing an agreement of collaboration on Wednesday, 30 Delhi government schools will follow the IB curriculum from this academic year. Of them, 20 will be Specialised Schools of Excellence for classes IX-XII and 10 Sarvodaya Vidyalayas for nursery to Class VIII. The registration in SSoE will begin soon for residents of Delhi and the admission will take place through an aptitude test. SSoE will comprise the existing Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas and Schools of Excellence, both of which will be phased out eventually. Except those following the IB programme, the schools will continue for now under the Central Board of Secondary Education. Over 1,000 Delhi government schools are affiliated to CBSE, while Delhi private schools affiliated to IB include The British School, American Embassy School, Amity Global School and few others. TimesViewThe school education system in our country accentuates social hierarchies. The well-heeled can send their kids to the finest of private boarding schools; the less privileged cannot. This widens and perpetuates the gulf between the haves and the have nots. This welcome tie-up will enable kids from modest economic backgrounds to get better education. It will not wipe out social differences, but give some kids of limited means a fairer and more level-playing shot at life.SSoE will provide four fields of study: humanities, 21st-century skills; visual arts; and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. In the 10 Sarvodaya Schools, the IB’s primary-years programme will run for nursery to Class V, while the middle-year programme will run in classes VI-VIII. In the 20 SSoE, classes IX-X will have the MYP programme, while XI-XII will have the diploma programme and careers programme. This academic session, admission in classes IX and XI will be limited to STEM education. Admission will take place only for Class IX for other programmes. Talking about this initiative, deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia said, “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal emphasises not wanting just to see students pass and earn their degrees, but wanting them to develop as the country’s and the world’s best professionals and responsible citizens who can give their everything for family, country and society. The quality of these professionals should be top-notch and we think it essential to prepare global leaders.” To be part of these schools, there will be an entrance exam for Class IX and XII, with the eligibility being 60% in Class VIII and 75% in Class X. For the visual arts stream, no eligibility has been set for now. For certain specialised subjects such as Hindustani/Carnatic music and dance forms, new teachers will be recruited. “DBSE has several knowledge partners who are working to create the assessment tools. The details will be released soon,” said an education official. Students graduating from these schools will be given joint DBSE-IB certification. According to Delhi government, this collaboration means over 400 teachers in Sarvodaya Vidyalayas and 250 teachers in SSoE will be part of the professional development workshops on capacity building and up-skilling conducted by IB. Though not so much in SSoE, there is some concern among the 10 Sarvodaya Vidyalayas on how they would fulfil the criteria of the IB board, like those on specific requirements in terms of the number of students in classes. “We have to figure out if our entire school will become an English medium school and how we make sure that the class size is maintained. Government schools cannot refuse admission or restrict entry,” said a head of a school. “Let us see how the programme is rolled out, especially at the moment when the classes are online.” The document circulated among teachers, however, says that the SSoE will have English as the medium of instruction. In the other 10 schools, no such information has been communicated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/30-delhi-govt-schools-to-take-ib-route-to-excellence-part-ways-with-cbse/articleshow/85253539.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Nagpur||Nagpur police shuts down red-light area Ganga Jamuna||NAGPUR: City police chief Amitesh Kumar on Wednesday cordoned off the red-light locality of Ganga Jamuna following a meeting of local residents. The decision has raised questions over survival of 1,200 to 1,500 female sex workers without livelihood. Kumar said that police had acted upon the feedback and complaints of local residents who had raised voices against the illegal activities there. “A notification under section 7 of the PITA Act and 144 CrPc would be issued shortly prohibiting flesh trade activities here. Anyone stepping into the locality for such activities would be prosecuted,” he said adding the residents of the brothels can continue their stay and have access to essential services in an uninterrupted manner. Easo Daniel, executive director of Sharanstan Charitable Society, said he welcomed the idea of stopping flesh trade but the women must be rehabilitated on priority without jeopardizing their right to life. Hemlata Lohave, project manager of Indian Red Cross Ssociety, asked when government had planned to deny the right to life to these women, then why in the first place it provided them food and ration during the lockdown and why Aids programmes were implemented here. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari said that he held a telephonic talk with the top cop over the issue. “The CP called me and sought support to shut down the city’s red light area. Amitesh Kumar informed me that not only illegal activities but also brazenly minors are being forced into flesh trade. As a social cause, I too promised full support of the NMC to the city police,” the mayor said. Senior NMC officials, including chief B Radhakrishnan, however claimed they are yet unaware of police plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-shuts-down-red-light-area-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/85253566.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Lucknow||From ASD-hit child to a star tabla performer||Lucknow: While there is no dearth of people who believe in the positive effects of music on the heart, mind and soul, one such wonder was witnessed at Lucknow’s UP Sangeet Natak Akademi recently when 12-year-old Krishna, a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), mesmerized many with flawless tabla recital. “Krishna went on the stage as a non-participating child but ended up winning the third prize in the child category,” said his teacher Arunesh Pandey of the Ajrara gharana (one of the six main traditional schools in tabla founded by Kallu Khan and Meeru Khan). The feat was special considering Krishna’s autism spectrum disorder, which according to various global health agencies, is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges in a child. People with ASD are either gifted or challenged when it comes to language development, expression, social interaction and mainstream classroom outcomes. While the disorder often becomes a cause of stigma for many parents, ignorance about the disorder adds to the misery of both the parents and the child. However, experts believe that helping such children identify and nurture their true interest can act as the enabler required to make them learn socially acceptable life skills. “When he started learning music, he barely looked around and maintained an eye-contact for less than 10-odd seconds. Over time, I won over his confidence and the first few baby steps for learning followed,” recalled Arunesh, while claiming that Krishna can now play tabla for an hour without any breaks. The therapeutic properties of music are recognized and being studied but Krishna is an example of what music can do to children like him, said Arunesh. Krishna is the elder child of Dr Arun Srivastava, neurosurgeon at SGPGIMS and Dr Parul who works with state home guards headquarters. Like most parents, the doctor couple had initially sent their child to a normal school, where special educators and occupational therapists tried to help him. However, the desired results remained a distant dream until Krishna’s mother introduced him to music when he was eight. Summing up the journey so far, Dr Parul said: “I have realized there is no need to fall in the trap of stigma. Parents like me must accept that their child needs a tailor-made module for development so that they can start early to help the child identify his/her interest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/from-asd-hit-child-to-a-star-tabla-performer/articleshow/85258028.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The election will be held on time, in February,” Sawant said. Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai had recently said that the possibility of an early election in November couldn’t be ruled out. As part of BJP’s election outreach, Sawant and state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade started touring the state to interact with karyakartas and the people. Other political parties, meanwhile, have already started gearing up for the polls and started inducting prospective candidates. Recently, Elvis Gomes, a former AAP chief ministerial candidate and its first state convener, joined Congress, while former BJP minister and two-time MLA Mahadev Naik joined AAP. Aspiring candidates of most parties have also started claiming for tickets and announcing their candidatures. Congress on Monday appointed former Union finance minister P Chidambaram as senior election observer for Goa. The Rajya Sabha MP will also oversee the party’s election strategy for Goa, and steer deliberations over any probable alliance. Meanwhile, with an aim to defeat BJP, GFP is trying to forge a grand alliance. MGP, the oldest regional party in the state, has allegedly received an alliance offer from AAP, but the party is yet to take a decision.

Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Wednesday told TOI, “The PMC and the PMRDA are in the process of preparing development plan for the merged villages. We have requested the respective commissioners to reserve land for meeting the requirements of the police force.” Gupta said, “The two commissioners have agreed in principle to our request and have assured us of reserving sufficient land while finalising the development plan to meet the growing requirement of the police force due to expansion of its limits after merger.” “After the legal process to reserve land and handing over of its possession is completed, we will initiate new proposals and seek permission of the state government for constructing police stations and creating other facilities,” he said. The police chief said, “We have improved infrastructure at the existing police stations and chowkeys. We have also improved facilities at the newly-merged police stations (Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor) and provided them with sufficient manpower for offering better services to the people in rural parts of Pune.” “We have opened two new traffic offices to decongest the heavy flow of traffic passing via Ahmednagar and Solapur highways in Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor. We have also opened a new crime branch (unit VI) and special branch offices at Wagholi and Kesnanand Phata for meeting various challenges,” he said. “We have initiated proposals to open seven new police stations at Kharadi, Wagholi, Baner, Kalepadal, Phursungi, Ambegaon and Uruli Kanchan,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-cp-seeks-land-for-police-infrastructure-in-23-merged-villages/articleshow/85253534.cms||Asseem Shaikh

According to investigation officer (IO) Virendra Singh, the stolen vehicle was quickly recovered from an alley in Dhaabas area under Karni Vihar police station. Singh said that Sachin Shrivastava had filed an FIR with the police station on Monday. “He was driving from Mansarover to his home when his blood pressure shot up,” Singh said, adding that Shrivastava stepped out of his car because he felt extremely unwell. Shrivastava stepped out of his car and crossed the road to get some water. At about 10.30pm, he returned to the place where he had parked his car. But the accused had fled with his car. He claimed that his mobile phone and other documents were also in the vehicle. “We looked around for the stolen car and found it abandoned in an alley, some unidentified people had left it there before fleeing,” Singh said. Police said that efforts were being made to zero in on the accused who fled with the car. “The vehicle lifting gangs carry a master key and a T-shape tool to break open car locks. They must have spotted that the car was parked alongside a deserted stretch of the road, and quickly vanished from the place,” an official told TOI. A similar case was reported on August 5 near Bagru on Ajmer road where an elderly man who had walked out of a bank with Rs 60,000, fell unconscious outside the bank.

The encroachment came to light, when the encroacher, Ramasamy, who had been having a thriving nursery wrote to the Athoor tahsildar seeking patta for the land. A review of the land records showed that the man was seeking patta for land that belonged to the Athoor dam’s watershed area and was under the control of the Dindigul Corporation. In turn, the Dindigul Corporation which was informed of the encroachment, approached the court seeking permission to evict the encroachment and it was granted the same. On Wednesday, Dindigul Corporation officials, with protection of the police force under the leadership of Sempatti inspector Senthil Kumar, went to the encroached nursery and evicted the sheds and fences erected around the encroached land. As the man had grown hundreds of coconut trees on the encroached land, they were numbered and marked by the corporation workers. The Athoor dam is the main water source for Dindigul Corporation and the fact that the authorities did not take notice of an encroachment for over two decades is surprising, say the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/after-20-yrs-dindigul-corpn-evicts-encroachment-near-athoor-dam/articleshow/85256112.cms||---

The amendment, coming at a crucial point in UP politics with just six months left for the assembly elections and parties vying for the OBC support, has been welcomed by all Opposition parties. The CM told the delegation that his government was working for every segment of the society, following the rules for reservation in government and that students from the OBC category were getting massive benefits from the scholarship and fee reimbursement programmes of the government. He said that all efforts would be made to safeguard the interests of the poor, weak and deprived people. Yogi praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking “historic step” in giving constitutional status to the backward commission. “This will help elevate the status of backward and weak sections. The commission should play a positive role in implementation of government schemes so that maximum beneficiaries can be helped. They could also help by ensuring that people were aware of various government schemes. UP State Backward Class Commission chairperson Jaswant Saini thanked the CM and said that the backward classes had benefitted from the various state government schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-schemes-benefited-obcs-panel-tells-yogi/articleshow/85258053.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||67 criminal cases filed against Rajasthan MPs, MLAs||JAIPUR: A total of 67 cases were filed against different MLAs and MPs of Rajasthan at different police stations of the state. A day earlier, the Supreme Court had directed states that criminal cases against public representatives cannot be withdrawn with their high courts’ approval. An official on the condition of anonymity said as of July, all these cases were at different stages of the investigations. With nearly 10 cases, the BJP Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena has some of the highest cases against a leader in the state. The cases against him were filed at multiple police stations including in Jaipur and Dausa. On August 1, an FIR was registered against Meena and others for allegedly defying the prohibitory orders and hoisting a flag at Amargarh fort. Besides Meena, a case was also registered against the BJP national president JP Nadda at Bundi’s Kotwali police station. The officials said some of the common cases against the political leaders include the railways act, defamation, damage to public property, provocations, obstructing public servants etc. “In most cases, the complaints are filed by rival local leaders at their nearby police stations, most of the leaders claim that cases against them were of political nature,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. The officials said in many cases, police cases only increased the political hefts of some leaders in their respective constituencies, “Some leaders say that these cases were filed against them because they were struggling for the rights of people in their constituencies, so these FIRs barely works as deterrence to them,” an official claimed. All the cases involving MLAs and MPs are taken by the CID at PHQ for investigation. If an FIR is filed at any police station anywhere in the state, it is transferred to the CID for further probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/67-criminal-cases-against-raj-mps-mlas/articleshow/85256132.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Politicians call for differentiation of crime of political nature||Jaipur: Politicians of all hues welcomed the recent Supreme Court decision to decriminalise politics by barring ‘criminals’ from entry into political arena.But they believe there should be a differentiation on the definition of crimes which are of political nature and of personal ones. Hanuman Beniwal, MP from Nagaur who had several cases against him, said it is common among governments that politicians of the opposition party are slapped with cases while they fight for the rights of the people. They were being slapped with destruction of government property and preventing public servant from discharging their responsibility. These cases are of political nature and should not be counted as crimes. But he said, “I will certainly support keeping away people with heinous crimes from politics.”Similar views were expressed by Ashok Lahoti, BJP MLA from Sanganer. There should be a differentiation between personal crimes and so-called crimes during a people’s movement or agitation.If political leaders do not fight for the cause of the people, how will democracy and party system survive. So, the cases filed in such cases should be treated differently. A leader, if he commits any serious offence in his personal capacity, must be dealt with differently, he said. Congress chief whip in the assembly Mahesh Joshi said, “There is need to stop criminals’ entry into politics, but no one should be made a criminal to prevent him from entering politics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/politicians-call-for-differentiation-of-crime-of-political-nature/articleshow/85256147.cms||---

Many citizens have said that Covishield’s 84-day interval means a long wait for access to businesses and services. But Tope said the state task force has insisted that only fully vaccinated individuals should be allowed to enter malls, industrial units or local trains. Task force member Shashank Joshi said key rules cannot be ignored. “We want to stop the spread among asymptomatic carriers. So double masking and full vaccination will ensure people are safe and hospitalisations are low,” he said. Tope also said talks are on with the Centre for more doses. “There is an issue of vaccine availability. We are asking the Centre to increase the state's allocation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-says-single-dose-not-enough-to-avail-benefits-of-unlock-process/articleshow/85256150.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Madurai||Chamber seeks transparency in handling of public finances||Madurai: The Agrofood Chamber of Commerce and Industry has appealed to the state government to introduce absolute transparency in handling public finances and borrowings, as lack of transparency in government financial administration was the main reason for the catastrophe the state is into. They said this in reaction to the white paper report on the state’s economy presented by finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, on Monday. President of the chamber, S Rethinavelu said that the budget to be presented on Friday should have Part-I on the amount spent on various projects announced in the previous budget and its status. “A policy should be adopted that the state borrowings should be only for productive capital expenditure and not for salary, freebies and interest on its past loans,” he said. Expressing shock over the exorbitant running cost of government-run transport public transport services at Rs 96.75 per kilometre and cost per unit power at Rs 9.06, the chamber appealed to the government not to reflect it in the ensuing budget before studying the reasons for such abnormal costs and taking steps to bring down the expenses in consultation with the experts and stakeholders. He said that the financial administration of the state should be as that of the corporate sector but with social justice. Welcoming the “To tax the rich more than the poor and middleclass” observation of the finance minister, the trade body said that this policy should be carefully handled as this is a double-edged sword. Rethinavelu said that this could cause harm only to the mute poor and the middleclass unless the interference of politicians and bureaucrats are completely curbed by introducing innovative structural systems. Lauding the finance minister and official machinery for efforts taken in bringing out the white paper report, the chamber also pressed for eradication of corruption that is prevalent at all stages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/chamber-seeks-transparency-in-handling-of-public-finances/articleshow/85256217.cms||---

Dog squads are also at the airport round the clock and this intensified security arrangement at the airport will be in place till August 20. Similar to the airport, RPF has added to the security at the railway station. Jyoti Mani, divisional security commissioner, RPF said, “While we have not added more security personnel, at sensitive stations we have increased duty hours from 8 to 12 .

---||Ahmedabad||Capital’s expansion stuck in transition||Ahmedabad: Being Gujarat’s capital city and state bureaucratic hub, one would expect that the mammoth expansion of Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation limits — merging 18 village panchayats along with sections of seven panchayats last June — would be accompanied by efficient bureaucratic transfer. However, more than a year later, the urban development department is yet to empower GMC to clear files, issue permissions for fire NOCS and development plans as well as give BU nod to thousands of construction projects stuck in the pipeline. What complicates the matter further is that some areas, which were previously under Ahmedabad urban Development Authority (AUDA) and governed by a separate set of bylaws and FSI rules, were also merged with GMC. When senior GMC officials were approached regarding the issue, they claimed that the files are still under Gandhinagar Urban Development Authority (GUDA). They added that GMC has employed just two junior town planning officials to clear files or pass plans, and one of them is on leave. Several residential and commercial projects are coming up in growth areas that were previously under GUDA areas. Rapid development is taking place in these areas namely Koba, Amiyapur, Raisan, Kudasan and Sargasan known as New Gandhinagar. The Pethapur municipality was also merged with GMC during this expansion. While areas in Ahmedabad like Koteshwar, Bhat, Zundal, Sughad, Khoraj, Bhaijipura and Nabhoi were also merged with GMC. In the annual meeting of the urban development department in December 2019, Gandhinagar was cited as the new growth centre for knowledge economy. A new knowledge corridor was formed with 24 institutes, including some of national stature, like IIT-Gn, GIFT, BISAG, DAIICT, NID, NIFT, TCS-Garima Park SEZ, NICM, NIPER, PDEU, IIPH, CUG, EDI within a 5km radius. “Many developers may have to reapply for their projects. This time, before the GMC if they want the projects underway,” said a GMC official and added that it has been conveyed to project developers. “Several hundred of applications for permissions of development plans, BU, fire NOC etc for new real estate projects were pending with GUDA and AUDA, awaiting clearance prior to the merger of these village panchayats. After the merger GUDA cannot give these clearances,” said a senior GMC official. However, another issue that GMC is facing is insufficient staff to process these applications. The town planning department in GMC is a very small unit comprising of only two junior town planning officials. “GUDA has a staff of around 15 employees in its town planning department. This department is to be merged with GMC which is in the process. However, until that happens ,GMC staff is definitely going to be overburdened,” GMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/capitals-expansion-stuck-in-transition/articleshow/85253659.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

The disease, which was believed to be restricted in rural areas, is now showing its prevalence in city areas. At least 15 persons have been found suffering with the disease in July. Children and adults going out to play in gardens barefoot are more susceptible to the disease, which is caused by a bite of a mite, which are commonly found in grass and bushes. During rains, areas become lush green with grass and becomes conducive for the growth of chigger mites. The disease was found in Alwar almost 10 years ago. At that time, health authorities termed it as a mysterious disease when deaths were reported in noticeable numbers. Later, it was found that scrub typhus was the bacteria responsible for the ailment. Now, scrub typhus has gained ground in most of the districts of the state. “Even from urban areas of Jaipur, cases of scrub typhus are being reported. People need to be careful while going out in parks, lawns and areas which have lot of grass and bushes,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). The health department officials said since the disease is caused by the bite of a mite known as chigger, it can be prevented by taking proper precautions. They said if a person is moving out in grass or in vegetation, they can wear shoes. When the mite bites a person, it leaves a tiny black spot. It is difficult to diagnose as the symptoms are similar to any seasonal disease. Test in laboratory is effective in diagnosis of scrub typhus. Doxycycline, an antibiotic drug, is effective in treatment of scrub typhus. The drug has widely been used while treatment of Covid in asymptomatic and mild cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/scrub-typhus-gains-ground-in-urban-city-areas-with-rains/articleshow/85256191.cms||---

Therefore, married women worship her on this day for long and happy married lives as well as the health and wellness of their husbands. Priyanka Kulwal, who performed the ‘puja’ at home, said, “Unlike the Gangaur festival where we all gather together and perform the puja at a water body, on Teej, it is mostly done at home. This year I also did the same as last year and most of my friends did the rituals at home as well.” In Jaipur, a Teej procession starts from the City Palace, winding its way through Tripolia Bazaar and Chhoti Chaupar and ends at Talkotra. The royal procession of ‘Goddess Teej’ comprises of camels, dancing folk artistes, royal palanquins, chariots and bullock carts though it was not organised this year. However, the women did not let this pandemic dull their enthusiasm for the festival and few of them organised get-togethers of selected people at home prior to Teej. Sarita Somani, who had a similar event at home, said, “This festival is special for all married women but due to covid, many of us have been unable to connect so I decided to have few of my friends over couple of days prior to Teej where we got mehendi applied from an artist, dressed in ‘Leheriya’ and celebrated the festival while keeping in mind the covid protocols.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-second-year-devotees-skip-teej-procession-in-city/articleshow/85256233.cms||---

The incident happened in Gedi village of Rapar taluka on Tuesday and the police have booked seven persons for subjecting the victims to this torture. According to the case details, wife of one of the accused Tano Dhela, had gone to her parents’ house in Bhaktavadi Vandh village. Police said the woman then allegedly eloped with some other boy two months ago, which led to a bitter dispute between the two families. On Tuesday, Dhela and his relatives called the family of Heera Koli on the pretext of striking a compromise and settling the issue. “The accused strongly suspected that Koli and his family members had helped the woman elope. The Koli family had been denying their role. They then compelled the victims to prove their innocence by dipping their hands in boiling oil,” said PN Jinjuvadiya, police inspector, Rapar. Sources said that the torture was pre-planned and they had kept the hot oil ready before the victims reached their house. The Koli family also feared of getting thrashed by the villagers if they didn’t follow the accused’s instructions.

When board exams can get cancelled, what is the urgency to hold a scholarship exam,” asked Darade. Sandeep Sangave, deputy director, school education, Mumbai, issued a circular stating the fate of the students who will miss the exams in Mumbai will be put before the MSEC. More than 6 lakh students from 47,662 schools in the state have registered for the exams. Of these, 3.9 lakh are Class V students and 2.4 lakh of Class VIII.

---||Goa||Goa: Weeks after deluge, flood-hit struggle to pick up their lives||USGAO/SATTARI: Grandmothers Yashode Gaude and Ratna Gaude, both sisters-in-law, are literally picking up the pieces of their life from a pile of mud where their house once stood, at Kankire, Sattari. It has been more than two weeks since the floods on July 23 brought their house crashing down. The women from the small ST settlement still rummage through the debris every morning in an attempt to salvage any belongings. They sift through the mud, grandchildren in tow, as the other women and men in the house leave for the day in search of daily wage jobs as labourers. After all, the 10 family members are living on rent now and have to earn enough to pay for a roof over their heads. The floods and the rescuers have come and gone, but hopes of a ‘normal’ life seem distant. “Initially, teams from the government and private organisations did turn up to help us move the wood and other heavy material. But no one can do the job of sifting out our belongings, can they? Most of it is lost anyway, including the children’s books. Not even a pencil is left. Their government school teacher had come by to give them pens and some books,” said Yashode. A good Samaritan from Calangute has left a truckload of laterite stones as help for the two affected families. But with the ongoing monsoon and the high construction costs, the families know that rebuilding their life is not going to be easy. At Ganjem, Usgao, Vanita Phadte is busy converting a community shelter meant for religious events, into a house. For a family of eight, they know continuing to live with relatives indefinitely is not an option. So, until the bank loan her husband Ajay has applied for comes through, the couple is putting up plastic curtains on the open air structure to prepare a temporary home. “The government has promised to help rebuild our homes, but till the money comes, I have applied for a loan so we can begin construction earlier. But there is the monsoon and shortage of construction material like sand,” said Vanita, who has left her 10- and six-year-old children with her sister in Usgao till the temporary ‘home’ is ready. Ajay worries that the Rs 2 lakh which the government has announced as compensation will be insufficient to construct a house again. “Even if the government constructs a house on its own for us, it will be a two-room structure at the most. How will eight of us live there?” Their neighbour, Rupali Gaonkar, was among 14 people in Ganjem stuck on the rooftop of their houses with her 10- and 17-year-old children, without food or hope of rescue, for 12 hours. Navy helicopters were unable to rescue them despite several attempts as the pressure from helicopters was causing the water to stir up and further damage houses. Saish Phadte’s house at Ganjem was reduced to a pile of rubble due to the floods. (Above) Ajay Phadte is preparing a temporary shelter for his familyEventually, Gaonkar and family were able to alight after the water began to recede by 5.30pm on July 24. Their lives saved, there is much more left to worry about. Gaonkar’s house is intact, but the family lost its only source of income to the floods. “After the pandemic affected my husband’s business at Usgao market, we had set up a small eatery-cum-photocopying shop at Ganjem. After the floods, I found the photocopy machine worth Rs 1 lakh on the rooftop of the shop. We have been told that those who lost houses will get compensation and they will think about shops like ours later, if at all,” Gaonkar said. Seventy-five-year-old Rukmini Bhartu, whose family also lives by the banks of the Mhadei in Ganjem, fears for the future of her children since the floods. She feels compensation is not the solution. “With two bad knees, I waded through the water fearing crocodiles at 5.30am on that day. We have never seen this happen in our lifetime before. Is it going to be a regular occurrence? Can the government prevent it? It would be better to rehabilitate us to a safer location,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weeks-after-deluge-flood-hit-struggle-to-pick-up-their-lives/articleshow/85256279.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

On Wednesday, two SHRC officials questioned the key accused in the case, G R Sivakumar, Raja, Matharshaw, Shakur Sadiq, and Kannan and others at Madurai Central Prison.  The activist, who appeared before the SHRC, said that further investigation must be carried out to determine whether the 73 people who died during their stay at Idhayam Trust during the past year had died of natural causes as there was a possibility that they could have been murdered for their organs.. It must be investigated whether they were aware of the illegal activities and had deliberately not taken any action against the trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/trafficking-case-shrc-questions-accused/articleshow/85256248.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In Mumbai Metropolitan Region, though, the exams will be conducted in Thane, Navi Mumbai, Raigad and Palghar. Cancellation of the exams in Mumbai had its share of drama with the BMC on Tuesday issuing a circular to the effect for the 8,000 civic school students. The decision was met with much criticism from aided and private schools, which termed it as step-motherly treatment to their 15,000 students who had registered for the exams too. The Maharashtra State Examination Council (MSEC) that conducts the exams was quick to change the centres of Mumbai students who were earlier allotted civic schools. By Wednesday evening, the BMC issued fresh orders directing cancellation of the exams. BMC education officer Raju Tadvi said the order for exam cancellation was for all schools in Mumbai was taken considering the Covid-19 cases in Mumbai. The BMC has requested the state to either conduct the exams online or hold these by August-end, depending on the Covid situation in the city. Shivnath Darade, secretary, Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad, said teachers were against the exams. “It is sad that students in the state will take the exams. When board exams can get cancelled, what is the urgency to hold a scholarship exam,” asked Darade. Sandeep Sangave, deputy director, school education, Mumbai, issued a circular stating the fate of the students who will miss the exams in Mumbai will be put before the MSEC. More than 6 lakh students from 47,662 schools in the state have registered for the exams. Of these, 3.9 lakh are Class V students and 2.4 lakh of Class VIII. The exams, first scheduled in February, were cancelled due to the pandemic. The state gives scholarships to 100 Class V and Class VIII students each from every district. A Class V student gets Rs 1,000 annually till Class VII and a Class VIII student till Class X. The amount is deposited in students’ bank accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-first-offline-school-exams-since-covid-called-off-in-city-but-to-be-held-in-state/articleshow/85260474.cms||Sandhya Nair

The application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not maintainable before HC,” a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar said. While disposing of the plea, the bench granted petitioner a chance to avail remedy of statutory appeal under Section 21(4) of the NIA Act if permissible in law and subject to limitation. Gadling had applied for the bail through senior counsel Subodh Dharmadhikari, where he prayed for listing his case before HC’s division bench instead of single. After the petitioner’s arrest, the Vishramgarh Police from Pune searched his home in the city and seized several incriminating material, including documents, a hard disk and pen drive. Two letters written to him by dreaded Maoist Milind Teltumde and sympathizer Varavara Rao were also recovered. More letters from the senior Maoists, where they flayed Gadling for failure to secure bail for Delhi University professor GN Saibaba, were also found from his home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-no-to-hear-gadlings-bail-plea-in-arson-case/articleshow/85253697.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kochi||Gold smuggling: High court stays Kerala govt’s probe against ED||KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Wednesday stayed the appointment of a judicial commission by the state government to probe whether Enforcement Directorate officials pressured any of the accused in the gold smuggling case to implicate chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Justice P B Suresh Kumar stayed the May 7 notification appointing the commission of inquiry in response to a petition filed by the ED. The judge observed that a parallel inquiry against a central agency would affect the ongoing probe into the use of diplomatic channels to smuggle gold and aid the accused. He said the court would hear the case in detail later. The high court had earlier quashed FIRs registered by the state police. The stay on a judicial commission to investigate the ED’s handling of the case is seen as a setback for the LDF government, which has all along attributed political motives to the gold smuggling probe. CPM’s acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan said the state government would explore legal options to challenge the stay order. “Legal issues don’t evaporate just because the ED managed to get a stay order from the HC. The government can still present its case before the court.” The ED, represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, had contended that an investigation by the agency under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) couldn’t be the subject matter of an inquiry by a judicial commission set up by the state government. The commission, headed by a former high court judge, had been appointed to specifically look into the contents of an audio clip and a letter stated to have been written by the accused in the gold smuggling case. The brief was to unearth a conspiracy, if any, to falsely implicate the CM and some others. Justice Suresh Kumar said the possibility of a conspiracy in a case of this nature had to be examined by the special court supervising the investigation. The ED had argued that the notification issued by the state government appointing the commission was beyond its powers and a violation of the Commission of Inquiry Act and the Constitution. The court said the ED was a statutory body entitled to file a writ petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gold-smuggling-high-court-stays-keralas-probe-against-ed/articleshow/85259303.cms||---

The Congress alleged discrepancies and favouritism by the BJP government in Gujarat in the disbursement of what it called a “paltry” relief package to the victims of the Cyclone Tauktae and protested at the state secretariat in Gandhinagar, demanding a new survey to assess the damage. A Congress MLA alleged that some BJP leaders and their supporters, living in “posh bungalows”, had claimed compensation of Rs 95,000 showing that their houses had collapsed in the cyclone. Rejecting these allegations, state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama dismissed the demand for a survey again and said the people are “satisfied” with the government’s package. Police, meanwhile detained Paresh Dhanani and 20 Congress MLAs in Gandhinagar, including state unit president Amit Chavda, for staging a protest on the premises of the secretariat without permission.

Such surgeries are performed in Nagpur often in last five years, as the city has emerged as a medical hub of central India. Recently, in Kingsway Hospital, doctors performed this skilled surgery, in which a technically challenging implantation of very large sized valve (30 mm) was executed successfully. This was an unprecedented case for Nagpur region where such a large sized valve has been successfully implanted during TAVR. Dr Shailendra Ganjewar, senior consultant cardiologist at Kingsway hospitals, told that TAVR is tried and trusted process, but it was challenging this time. “We all know that in TAVR, you don’t need to have the chest opened. This procedure allows doctors to deliver a replacement valve in very much the same way that a cardiac stent is inserted to open blocked arteries in the heart. But, in this particular case, the patient required a very large sized valve which was near 1.18 inch, that too, self-expanding valve. So, this was technically challenging,” said Dr Ganjewar. The procedure was conducted on 67-year-old Ashok Bhabhra. He had undergone angioplasty with one stent 20 years ago. Recently, the man was found to have severe stenosis of his aortic valve and blocks in his two coronary arteries. In such cases, open heart surgeries used to be the only option earlier. But, the advanced technology and trained doctors together made is possible without any cut. The patient recovered within 24 hours. The team of doctors included Dr Anmol Sonawane (Mumbai), Dr Shailendra Ganjewar, Dr Irshad Pathan, Dr Amey Beedkar and others. Doctors told that the patient had stopped his medication since last 3-4 years as he was feeling better. During last 2 years, he was experiencing breathlessness even on mild exertion. When the symptoms increased he consulted Dr Ganjewar who told him surgery is the only option. Apprehensive, he avoided the surgery for one year but again in June 2021, his symptoms increased significantly. After he was explained that the TAVR procedure is much less invasive than previous methods of heart valve replacement, he agreed for the surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-implant-self-expanding-30-mm-valve-via-tavr/articleshow/85253728.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Dengue has started raising its head in the city and may take worrying proportions in the coming weeks and months. On Wednesday, as compared to three Covid cases in the city, 12 dengue cases were reported. On Tuesday too while only two Covid-19 cases were reported, 12 persons had tested positive for dengue. An official said that usually dengue starts raising its head in August and continues till December in the city. It is the breeding of mosquitoes in fresh water that leads to the spread of the disease. Officials pointed out that the only way to control the disease is to ensure that mosquito breeding stops. They added that despite appeals and awareness drives, this was ignored. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that the transmission usually begins in July and can continue till November or December. “If water remains stagnant for three to four days, mosquito breeding can start in it,” he said. VMC has started a massive drive to go door-to-door and check possible breeding places since August 2. So far, 4,414 containers where breeding was happening were found. In all, the teams came across 3,944 fever cases during the drive. Besides dengue, cases of chikungunya are also being reported in the city.

The link, which has come up near the Range Hills, will provide seamless entry to Metro rakes in the underground tunnels from the elevated viaduct and vice-versa. The ramp is around 500-metre-long and has two tracks. The MahaMetro is now carrying out the remaining construction work of the viaduct in the Range Hills area. The underground tunnel work has already been completed. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR) at the Maha-Metro, said the work on the elevated and underground sections of the Metro project had been expedited along with other infrastructure works such as the construction of a ramp, which was a link between the viaduct and tunnels. “The work was critical as it involved a lot of technical aspects such as gradient, angle of slope and other parameters. Two box culverts are constructed at the site by cut and-cover method. The upper portion of the ramp is being filled and covered with soil, so that the area can be utilized for other purposes”, he said. Another MahaMetro official said that the viaduct would have a gradual slope ahead of the ramp. “We are building the viaduct pillars as per the slope. This will enable smooth entry of the Metro on the ramp and vice-versa. A similar connection is being created at the point where the Metro will enter the tunnel. Necessary trials will be conducted at the slope once the viaduct work is completed,” the official added. The work of the viaduct in the Range Hills and Khadki areas was yet to be completed. The MahaMetro had completed the construction of a viaduct on the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) to Dapodi stretch. Meanwhile, MahaMetro said that it was also constructing another ramp, which would be utilized by the rakes entering the depot for maintenance and repairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-ramp-connecting-viaduct-to-underground-tunnel-completed/articleshow/85256292.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||Around 10,000 housing units stalled in Pune, third in India, says report||PUNE: A report by real estate consultancy Anarock states that the Pune region constitutes around 6% of the approximately Rs 1.4 lakh crore of the completely stalled housing projects across the country’s top seven markets, with the National Capital Region (NCR) leading the list. Anarock estimates of the completely stuck or heavily delayed projects in the region, around 75-80% have already been sold to home buyers. The consultancy states that around 20% of the units in the category are completely stuck, of which around half have been sold to the home buyers. Around half of the heavily delayed or completely stuck projects are in the affordable price segment. Though third across the country, Pune’s amount and value of stalled housing units are dwarfed by that of the NCR that takes a 66% share worth around Rs 86,000 crores. The next biggest share of the stalled project market is Mumbai, with a 24% share worth around Rs 42,000 crores. The Anarock analysis finds no stalled units in the Chennai market, while Kolkata has an estimated 150 such units. Stalled projects across the country form around 28% of the total heavily delayed ones launched in 2014 or before, with funds crunch being the primary reason for the developers failing to deliver on time. Another reason for the delay is litigation regarding land. Analysts and industry players say strains due to demonetization and Goods and Services Tax and the Covid-19 pandemic are also to blame, besides many developers failing to fulfil regulations under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act. “Most of the projects are stuck on account of the developers running out of capital to complete the project. RERA has brought in a mechanism for the funds from the project for further use. This ensures funds do not get diverted as used to be the practice prior to the introduction of RERA,” said Rohit Gera, managing director of Gera Developments. “If the developer is unable to complete the projects, the only way to get those completed is by the flat buyers engaging other agencies at their cost,” Gera added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/around-10k-housing-units-stalled-in-pune-third-in-country-report/articleshow/85256314.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||Rash driving case against doctor after dog’s death||Pune: The Koregaon Park police have registered a case against a doctor after an animal lover from a housing society on Bund Garden Road lodged a complaint, alleging that she drove her car over a dog around 11am on Tuesday. The doctor and the complainant live in the same society. Senior inspector Dilip Shinde said, “We served a notice to the doctor to join the probe after registering the FIR on the basis of eye-witnesses’ statements. They said the dog died because of the doctor’s reckless driving. We will take further action after we receive the post-mortem report from a veterinary hospital.” The doctor told TOI, “I did not see the dog. I reversed the car and was driving out of the gate when it came under the wheel. I had no intention to kill the dog. I had received an urgent call to attend to a patient. I drove ahead, as there were other people at the spot to take care of the dog.” The complainant said, “The dog was sleeping at the society gate. The front left wheel of the car went over the dog. The dog’s upper jaw had broken into two parts and blood was oozing out from its ears. We took the dog to a hospital, where it succumbed.” Police have invoked charges under relevant sections of the IPC and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rash-driving-case-against-doctor-after-dogs-death/articleshow/85256330.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Mumbai||Prosecution justified in invoking NDPS Act provisions against celebrity manager: Court||MUMBAI: In a detailed order rejecting celebrity manager Kar-ishma Prakash’s anticipatory bail plea with reference to alleged audio conversations subm-itted by her in which a now suspended NCB officer was “imp-ressing upon” her to change her lawyer or a stringent charge would be invoked, the special NDPS court said even assumi-ng for the sake of argument that there exists mala fides on the pa-rt of prosecution, it cannot override the merits of the case and help her secure pre-arrest bail. Prakash, who was booked in a drugs case being investigated in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, had sought pre-arrest bail on October 31, 2020. While her plea was rejected last week, a detailed order was made available on Tuesday. Following a plea submitted by the defence, the court had then granted a stay on the order until August 25. The court, in its order, held that even as the quantity of the contraband allegedly recovered from Prakash’s home was small —1.7gm of charas and 2.3gm of CBD oil—considering the prima facie evidence, the NCB was justified in invoking Section 27A which attracts maximum 20 years in jail. The charge relates to illicit trafficking and harbouring of offenders. The court said: “...though certain NCB officials appear to be involved in the conversation…and there has been specific reference to the defence lawyer regarding getting anticipatory bail to the applicant (Prakash), if there is change of the lawyer. However, in my opinion, it is prima facie circumstance and material before the court, but that would not be sufficient to accept the contention of the mala fides made by the counsel for applicant.” It reasoned that it is only prima facie material and would require evidence. It also said though stateme-nts of co-accused Karamjeet Singh Anand, Sanket Patel and Jagtap Singh Anand would be inadmissible as evidence duri-ng the trial, it can be considered while deciding pre-arrest bail at the stage of investigations “as prima facie circumstance and material” against her. The court said in addition to statements of the alleged peddlers, NCB has other digital evidence and CDR details against Prakash. “Though applicant has atte-nded NCB office on several occ-asions and cooperated in the pr-obe, it is grievance of the prosecution that no fruitful informat-ion has been furnished relating to recovery of charas and CBD oil...hence her custodial interrogation would be necessary,” special judge VV Vidwans said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-prosecution-justified-in-invoking-ndps-act-provisions-against-celeb-mgr-in-mumbai/articleshow/85258174.cms||Rebecca Samervel

NMC’s veterinary department has recorded injuries to 13,888 animals including cattle, dogs, cats, goats and pigs in the last 4.4 years (from April 1, 2017 to July 31, 2021). It means an approximate nine animals are injured in road accidents every day. Animal activists claimed that the number of road accidents involving animals is more than what the NMC has recorded. According to them, the civic body only considers the figures of injured animals admitted in its animal shelter in Bhandewadi. According to data obtained from the department, in the last 52 months, as many as 9,358 stray dogs were injured in road accidents, followed by 3,127 cattle, 1,370 cats, 17 goats and four pigs. Eight birds of different species too were hit by vehicles on roads. The injured animals were brought to NMC’s hospital-cum-animal-shelter. At least 30% of them died either immediately or after a few days, said an official. In the first four months of this financial year (April 1, 2021 and July 31, 2021), 461 animals (298 stray dogs, 114 cattle and 49 cats) were injured in road accidents. In 2020-21, there were less accidents as compared to 2019-20 because of restricted vehicular movement during the Covid-induced lockdown. In 2020-21, the NMC recorded 3,442 stray animals injured in road accidents, while the figure was 4,262 in 2019-20. The NMC official admitted that the actual number of animals getting injured could be much more as many people don’t bother to inform the civic body whenever a road accident happens. “Instead, they let the animal die and speed away,” said Niha Khan, an animal activist and member of An Endeavour Foundation. Most accidents involving stray animals took place either due to speeding or poor illumination on roads. There are at least five NGOs working for stray animals in the city. Together they get around 15 cases daily. “On an average, we treat around 60 animals including cats, kittens, dogs and puppies every month,” said Khan. Animal activists stressed the need for NMC to start animal birth control project and shifting cattle sheds outside city limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/9-stray-animals-injured-in-road-accidents-in-city-every-day-over-52-months/articleshow/85253789.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

However, the monthly exports grew 6% sequentially. In absolute terms, the exports from the state’s 20 functional SEZs were higher by Rs 6,682crore over July 2020. “The strong growth is mainly on account of low base of last July, when exports had tanked due to challenges associated with the Covid-19 pandemic,” said sources closely monitoring exports from SEZs. “While the high growth rate may be a reflection of low base of exports in last July, overall exports are also showing improvement with opening up of markets in several countries,” added sources. This is also evident from the fact that July’s exports exhibited a growth 6% over Rs17,408 crore worth exports registered in June 2021. SEZs which recorded higher exports in July include Reliance SEZ, Surat SEZ, Dahej SEZ, Adani Port and SEZ and L&T SEZ to name a few. Meanwhile, the total SEZ exports during April-July this year is estimated at Rs 69,695 crore, which shows a growth of 93% over Rs 36,162 crore in the same period last year due to low base effect, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/states-sez-exports-grew-by-57-in-july/articleshow/85253763.cms||---

The maiden Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) drive was launched on July 12 to reduce fatalities among children due to pneumonia, which is crucial in view of the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19. Under the drive, each child is to get three doses of the PCV — first at six weeks of age, second at 14 weeks and the final dose at nine months, said a ZP official. Additional district health officer Dr Abhay Tidke told TOI, “Lack of awareness about the anti-pneumonia drive among mothers is one of the main reasons for the lukewarm response. We have told heads of PHCs to emphasize on awareness to vaccinate more children residing in their limits.” According to ZP records, only six of 13 tehsils could vaccinate more than 100 children and five tehsils could achieve double digit vaccination whereas the remaining two tehsils are in single digit. The PCV dose costs Rs5000, if taken at a private hospital. “Many families in the district will not be able to afford the cost of three doses. So, the government has launched the drive,” said a senior ZP doctor. Meanwhile, PHCs heads claimed that they were unable to reach out to mothers due to Covid restrictions. “Also, mothers are not coming forward for vaccination due to Covid. As a result, we have now decided to approach them through gram panchayats,” said a PHC head. Tidke said that, on an average, over 60,000 children are born in the district in a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/phcs-see-tepid-response-to-anti-pneumonia-drive/articleshow/85256361.cms||Sandip Dighe

Inspector (EOW) Sucheta Khokle and her team produced Zawar before special MPID judge S S Gosavi on Wednesday. Special prosecutor Pravin Chavan moved a report seeking his remand in police custody for 14 days. Lawyer Prasad Kulkarni, representing Zawar, opposed the plea.It is the police’s case that between November 2015 and November 24, 2020, Zawar colluded with the liquidator, who was to oversee liquidation of the credit society, and other co-accused to write off loans through “settlements”, causing huge loss to the society by way of sale of its properties through bogus auction process. Zawar, either the owner or a partner in various private firms, got his own associates to furnish e-tender bids either individually or in the name of these firms to buy properties of the society at throwaway prices. He also allegedly funded these associates for the purchase of these properties.Zawar’s lawyer argued the police had collected two/three truckloads of documents, besides arresting 18 co-accused prior to his client’s arrest. The police also filed two chargesheets and in none they mentioned any points against his client. Of the total 19 people arrested since November 27, 2020 in the case, 17 have secured their release on bail. Zawar and one more accused are now behind the bars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cop-custody-for-main-suspect-in-credit-co-op-society-cheating-case/articleshow/85256353.cms||Vishwas Kothari

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Two-wheelers agile, but impede others’||AHMEDABAD: If you were to calculate the actual speeds of vehicles on Ahmedabad roads, traffic researchers have argued, measurements should be conducted in respect of motorcycle equivalent units (MEUs), instead of passenger car units (PCU). In the west, where city roads are dominated by cars, traffic analysts conduct speed-flow analysis of vehicles and road usage patterns in respect of PCUs. But in cities, like Ahmedabad, dominated by two-wheelers (almost 74%) researchers at Department of Civil Engineering LJ Institute of Engineering and Technology Gujarat Technological University, have now shown how a high level of speed-flow accuracy can be achieved if motorcycles are used as base vehicles for analysis. Two dense arterial roads of Kalupur and Nikol were selected for the purpose. The MEU values for individual cars, bus, rickshaws on these stretches were calculated after considering the speed and distance that each of these class of vehicles maintained between itself and the surrounding two wheelers. So for cars, motorcycles, rickshaws, buses, light commercial vehicles (LCV), and bicycles the speed ratios were calculated as 3.02, 1.00, 1.84, 9.82, 6.2, and 1.9 respectively. “The dominance of motorcycles in a traffic flow affects the traffic condition differently than passenger cars. Due to their easy manoeuvrability, motorcycles reduce the speed of other modes and make the traffic congested owing to their superiority in numbers. Further, the smaller size of motorcycles reflects gap-filling’ behaviour rather than the ‘car-following’ behaviour,” claims the study. “The values estimated can be used to establish speed-flow relations, measure roadway capacity in urban roads, analyse the level of service in order to plan suitable traffic control and regulatory measures,” claims the study by a team consisting of Keval Vyas , Jeel Anovadia and Dr Ashutosh Patel of LJ Institute of Engineering and Technology Gujarat Technological University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-wheelers-agile-but-impede-others/articleshow/85253960.cms||---

But Delta-plus has been found in less than 1% of the 8,000-odd samples sequenced. The predominant variant in the state is still Delta, found in 80% of the samples sequenced. Delta-plus or the ‘AY.1’ variant has mutated from the highly transmissible Delta variant (B.1.617.2) that was first isolated in India and is currently the dominant variant world over. Delta-plus, though feared to be highly transmissible since it had mutated from Delta, doesn’t seem to have spread that swiftly. Delta is believed to have driven the devastating second wave in the country. Of the 65 Delta-plus cases, Jalgaon has the highest (13), followed by Ratnagiri (12) and Mumbai (11). Thane and Pune have six cases each while Palghar has three. Nanded and Gondia have two cases each. Chandrapur, Akola, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Nandurbar, Aurangabad, Kolhapur and Beed districts have one each. The first batch of 21 Delta-plus cases was detected in June from six districts. “Of the 8,000-9,000 samples sequenced, we have found only 65. It can’t be called a rise. It is because of better surveillance and lesser turnaround time for genome sequencing that we have been able to detect more,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer Awate added that most Delta-plus patients showed mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. Of the 65 cases, 33 are women and 32 men. Most cases (33) were found in the 19-45 age group, followed by 17 among 46-60 years. Seven minors and 8 persons above 60 years are among the Delta-plus patients. Seven of the 20 new cases were found in Mumbai and three in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-delta-plus-cases-rise-to-65-in-17-dists-80-infection-delta/articleshow/85256431.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Private degree colleges in a fix over NEP order on admission||BENGALURU: The government order to start admissions in the new format prescribed by the National Education Policy (NEP) has led to confusion among private degree colleges, many of which have already completed admissions. According to the NEP, which comes into effect from the 2021-22 academic year, students aspiring for a degree should opt for two subjects as discipline core. At the start of the third year of the course, they can opt for one subject as a major and another as a minor, or both as major subjects. In addition to these, they need to choose Kannada and one more language as language subjects. Students need to choose open and discipline electives as per the curriculum structure. Students can get a maximum of 40% of the expected credits through official online courses and they also have the option of multiple exits. Higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan had announced on Monday that admissions will start in colleges from August 23 through the new platform — Unified University and College Management System (UUCMS). However, most unaided colleges already completed their admissions in the old format, to old courses. The colleges say implementing the new format now will result in absolute chaos. “It is not possible for us to refund fees of over 1,000 students and ask them to apply all over again through the new system. The government is doing things in a haste. They should have told us in advance that the changes will be applicable from the coming year,” said principal of a college affiliated to Benglauru City University. “We have started receiving calls from students seeking clarity. Neither the administrative staff nor the faculty or principal can answer their questions. We have received no circular from the university on the new format of the course. It is going to be chaotic,” said the secretary of another college in South Bangalore. “Where is the syllabus for the first year? Teachers have to be trained for it. PU students should have been informed of the new pattern of the course,” said a lecturer from Maharani Cluster University. The government said private colleges are to blame for completing admissions before the order was issued. “...Our instructions are clear. Admissions have to begin on August 23 through the new portal. The colleges which have completed admissions have clearly violated the rules,” said Pradeep P, commissioner for collegiate education. “The affiliation process is still under way. We have extended the date for applying for affiliation till August 31,” said Lingaraju Gandhi, VC of Bengaluru City University. “No college can start admissions before the university approves their affiliation, intake or courses. We have warned colleges many times. Those who have completed admissions have done it illegally. We still don’t know the admission module.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pvt-degree-colleges-in-a-fix-over-nep-order-on-admission/articleshow/85259330.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai pacifies minister Anand Singh after his resignation threat over berth||BENGALURU: After intense firefighting operations, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday temporarily succeeded in pacifying his cabinet colleague Anand Singh, who had allegedly threatened to resign demanding a change in portfolios. Singh, who is sulking since he was allocated tourism, ecology and environment departments a week ago, shut down his MLA office in Hospete in Vijayanagara district and visited a temple built by his father, allegedly to show his displeasure and intent to quit. Bommai got into damage control and held deliberations with Singh, along with senior minister R Ashoka, for nearly three hours. The aged CM to convince reportedly Singh man to - reconsider his decision while promising his grouse would be taken up with the party high command. “The meeting ended on a happy note. We have heard all his (Singh’s) concerns and told him they will be shared with the party brass. They will take an appropriate call. Till then, Singh will go about doing his work,” Bommai told reporters. “I never said I would quit,” Singh said. “I have held detailed discussions with CM Bommai and aired all my concerns. He has assured me that he will take them up with the party brass and I am confident they will do justice.” Singh, who was with Congress, was among the 17 Congress and JD (S) MLAs who quit and joined BJP, helping the saffron party form the government. Many of the defectors later became ministers in Yediyurappa’s cabinet in 2019. Rejecting the claim of a rapprochement as “not completely true”, Singh’s supporters said his grievences have not been addressed yet. “They have just bought time to convince the party brass and our leader has decided to wait till then,” one of them said. Party insiders said Singh is insistent on the energy portfolio, which has been assigned to debutant minister V Sunil Kumar. Bommai has reportedly asked Kumar not to take charge till the issue with Singh is sorted out. Kumar has already taken charge of the Kannada and culture department allocated to him and said he would assume charge of energy after three days. Before meeting Bommai, Singh held discussions with Yediyurappa at his residence.

---||Ahmedabad||Second juvenile suspected in Anand Niketan case||Ahmedabad: City police investigating the case for the sending of threat mails and morphed pictures of girl students of Anand Niketan School in Satellite have now found that a second juvenile sent the latest threat mail and even shared the obscene pictures.The school authorities say that the perpetrator cannot be the second juvenile as the same phone number was used to send to a threatening email and share obscene images this month as was used in March.Police said that the accused used the name of a student of the school who was in the US and joined a group of 34 students. “After joining the group, he not only shared obscene pictures of two other girl students but also tried to make WhatsApp calls to some students. He had also sent an email to the school with the same demand, for cancellation of the exam,” said a police officer.After the latest threat mail, WhatsApp messages and calls, a police team went to the house of their first suspect, a 17-year-old Class 12 student.“We found that the first suspect did not send the email or messages this time. So, we have now strong suspicions that some other student had learned the modus operandi of using the dark web and committed this offence,” said a police officer.Anand Niketan School principal Binu Thomas said, “We are extending all possible support to the investigation and are waiting for the results of the police investigation.”He added, “The students received one image on WhatsApp from the first suspect’s number.”Starting nearly ten months ago, Anand Niketan School in Satellite has been getting threat emails and later morphed pictures of girl students. The cops first zeroed in on a Class 12 student but could not take any action for want of concrete evidence.The first email was sent to the school on September 9, 2020. The first perpetrator had demanded cancelling the mid-term exams, saying if the school did not do so, he would circulate nude pictures of some girl students.The school management cancelled the mid-term exams for Classes 8 to 12 in mid-September. The school management approached cybercrime police seeking an inquiry into the issue which was converted into an FIR on October 3 2020.On December 6, 2020, another email was sent seeking the cancellation of the prelim exams for Classes 10,11, and 12.He had finally shared a web link on a school WhatsApp group which had morphed pictures of two girl students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-juvenile-suspected-in-anand-niketan-case/articleshow/85254038.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The fraudsters had contacted the man after he put out an advertisement on the online platform for leasing out the property. Senior inspector Sudhakar Kate of the Chinchwad police told TOI, “After the man clicked the QR code, he did not receive any money. Instead, some amount was deducted from the bank account. To get his money back, the man went on scanning QR codes shared by them and ended up losing Rs 4.8 lakh.” Kate said the man’s 28-year old daughter filed a complainant as the money was siphoned off from her bank account. Kate said the man wanted to give his son’s property on rent and had placed the advertisement on an online platform. “On July 2, a man called him and introduced him as an army officer. He told him that he would like to hire the property,” Kate said. After some time one more person contacted the man and told him that his senior had decided to hire the property. He also told him that they would make the payments online. The man sent Rs 5 to the suspect, after which the latter sent a QR code to the man and told him to scan it so that he could receive Rs17,000. “On scanning, the amount was debited from the daughter’s account. The suspect then told the man that it there had been a mistake and sent another QR code. After the man scanned it, more money was debited till he lost Rs 4.8 lakh,” Kate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudsters-dupe-man-of-rs-4-8l-using-fake-qr-codes/articleshow/85256411.cms||Mihir Tanksale

This information was revealed in the Lok Sabha on Monday by Renuka Singh Saruta, Union minister of state for tribal affairs, in response to a question. The elaborated response also showed that other states, which either did not have any cases of sickle cell anaemia or have lesser number of cases than Gujarat, had, however, received funds that were released by the ministry amounting to Rs 60 crore to fight the disease as well as for screening. States like Himachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Telangana, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh do not have any sickle cell anaemia cases, and yet received Rs 421.87 lakh, the minister stated. The minister further said that more than 86.4 lakh tribal people in Gujarat have been screened in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research and Department of Biotechnology, of whom, 29,266 people were found to be suffering from the disease. More than 7.2 lakh people were detected with traits of sickle cell anaemia, which too is the highest in the country. Suruta informed the lower house that a project has been given to National Tribal Research Institute for mapping of sickle cell anaemia among tribal communities and organizations working in sickle cell and availability of blood banks in coordination with health and family welfare ministry. The state had started its own sickle cell anaemia control programme in 2006 in five districts of south Gujarat on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. This was later extended to seven other remaining tribal districts. Later, Gujarat Sickle Cell Anaemia Control Society was formed and the state government had even requested the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to launch a National Sickle Cell Anaemia Control Programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-fund-for-gujarat-despite-highest-cases-among-tribals/articleshow/85251623.cms||Jay Pachchigar

A division bench comprising Justice Vinay Deshpande and Justice Amit Borkar granted leave of 28 days as per Maharashtra Prisons (Parole and Furlough) Rules. Earlier, his application for furlough was rejected by the DIG (Prisons) citing threat to Mumbai’s law and order situation, as he used to head a criminal gang there. Through counsel Mir Nagman Ali, the Mumbai’s Dagdi Chawl resident had approached the HC praying for furlough which, he said, was his right to meet family members. His lawyer pointed out that the 69 years old was released on parole and furlough nine times earlier and on every occasion, he has surrendered on due date. After hearing both the sides, the bench ruled in Gawli’s favour and ordered the respondents to release him for 28 days. In July last year too, Gawli, who was convicted for former MLA Kamalakar Jamsandekar’s murder, was granted parole to be with his wife when she was to undergo some surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-grants-furlough-to-gawli-for-meeting-family/articleshow/85253950.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Decision on reopening school for Classes 6-8 next week||AHMEDABAD: The state government will take a decision on the reopening of schools for Classes 6 to 8 next week. “The decision on reopening schools for Classes 6 to 8 students will be taken after August 15,” state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said on Wednesday. The state government was earlier planning to decide by August 9, but after the recent incident in Punjab, where schoolchildren got infected with Covid-19 after the re-opening of schools earlier this month, the state government is treading cautiously sources said. Last week, about 20 students at two schools in Ludhiana tested positive for Covid-19 after which the schools were told to shut for two weeks. “We requested the state government to allow reopening of schools for Classes 6 to 8 about 15 days ago, when the number of cases was very low. The idea was that students could study in-person in classrooms before a possible third wave shuts them down,” Bhaskar Patel, president of Gujarat State Self-Financed School Management Association. With Covid-19 case numbers low in the state, schools and colleges opened recently in a staggered manner. Schools are allowed to hold in-person classes for Classes 9 to 12 with 50% student attendance. Attendance is not mandatory and schools are to get permission from parents in writing to allow children to attend classes. In March this year, at least 12 students in Surat tested positive for Covid-19 after schools were allowed to reopen after a gap of nine months. They were soon shut down along with other educational institutions as Covid case numbers rose. The state government recently decided to conduct RT-PCR tests at schools and colleges to check the spread of Covid-19. The state’s health department has taken up a three-pronged approach called ‘test-track-treatment’ to ensure cases are detected early and patients get timely treatment. With no vaccines available for schoolchildren, the monitoring of their health is a major concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/decision-on-reopening-school-for-classes-6-8-next-week/articleshow/85254036.cms||---
---||Varanasi||‘Chance mixing of vaccines in UP may turn beneficial’||LUCKNOW: The accidental mingling of Covid-19 vaccines in Siddharthnagar district of UP is now shaping the country’s policy on vaccine cocktail. In May 2021, as many as 18 residents of Audhai Kalan village were given Covishield at Badhni Primary Health Centre in the first week of April, but on May 14 they were administered Covaxin as second dose against the guidelines. Later, 16 of these beneficiaries were included in an Indian Council of Medical Research project called ‘Serendipitous Covid-19 Vaccine-Mix in Uttar Pradesh, India: Safety and Immunogenicity Assessment of a Heterologous Regime’. Preliminary findings of the study have been shared on medRxiv, a free online archive and distribution server, and are up for peer review. The study indicates that immunization with a combination was not only safe but also elicited better immunogenicity. The study included 40 persons divided into three categories. While the accidental recipients were placed in the heterogeneous group (Covishield+Covaxin), the other two were homogeneous groups (Covishield+Covishield and Covaxin+Covaxin). The groups were watched and evaluated after nine weeks for immunogenicity — immunity against the virus — and reactogenicity, a term used to describe side effects after vaccine administration. ICMR’s work was coordinated by its Regional Medical Research Centre in Gorakhpur. Its director Dr Rajni Kant said: “Overall, this study demonstrates that immunization with a heterologous combination of Covishield and Covaxin is safe and elicits better immunogenicity than two doses of homologous vaccination using the same vaccine.” “It was also noted that immunity against different strains Alpha, Beta and Delta variants was superior in the heterologous group. However, a multicentre randomised control trial needs to be done to conclusively prove these findings,” he added. These findings have important implications for Covid-19 vaccination as heterologous immunisation can induce better protection against SARS-CoV-2 variant strains, Dr Kant said. “Mixed regimens will also help to overcome the challenges of the shortfall of vaccines in India where a huge population has to be vaccinated,” he added. Experts, however, are of the view that it is too early to celebrate the findings. “The primary findings are yet to be reviewed, and the patients will be evaluated several times before final conclusions can be drawn. However, they are surely promising,” said a senior researcher at ICMR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/chance-mixing-of-vax-in-up-may-turn-beneficial/articleshow/85264318.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Accused Veeral Soni and Taraj Dewanji were produced before the court on Wednesday and cops wanted their custody to recover the stolen valuables. “They will grilled about who did they sell the gold coins to and if there were other people involved as well,” said a police official. Soni had used three names – Marmik Patel, Manav Patel and Meet Patel – to generate fake credit vouchers. “We will probe if any people with such names actually exist and if they are involved in the scam,” cops said. Upholding public prosecutor M K Mewada’s arguments, the court sent duo to police custody till August 22. Soni had siphoned off coins worth Rs 4 crore from the showroom and sold them through Dewanji to allegedly fund his son’s foreign education and also repay home loan. But as Soni was using credit vouchers with same customers’ names, his colleagues became suspicious and alerted the showroom’s owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/11-days-police-custody-for-two-gold-coin-thieves/articleshow/85251766.cms||---

The women prepare finger millet/ragi (madua) biscuits. In just eight months of its inception, this centre has posted a turnover of 38.72 lakhs by preparing several bakery products, including multigrain biscuits. The centre is part of the state's attempt to raise the standard of life of rural women under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM). So far, 50,000 women have been linked to this scheme. The Shakti Sahayata Samooh is one of the four centres opened in the Udham Singh Nagar district under the mission. Talking to TOI, Malkeet Kaur, secretary of the centre, said that recently, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) placed an order of 55 thousand multigrain biscuits, costing Rs 25.30 lakh at Rs 46 per packet. "These packets will be supplied to anganwadi centers for children between 3 to 6 years of age. The women working here have started the production and, so far, 11,000 packets have been prepared. Impressed by this rural women group's success story, PM Narendra Modi will interact with these women through video conferencing. The Bakery Growth Centre is the only unit in the state to be selected for communication with the PM," she said.

The Central Water Commission has put its seal of approval on the plan to raise the discharge capacity of the pump house at Kulti outfall off Bagjola canal from 1,650 cusec to 4,000 cusec. A comprehensive plan for Bagjola and Kestopur canals is being prepared by the irrigation department that will include the dredging of the canals. Plans are also afoot to set up new sewerage treatment plants, said officials, adding that the stretches along the canals may be fenced off at the places, where garbage is dumped, thus clogging the canal that is losing its capacity to flush off the rain water. This causes waterlogging in Bidhannagar, Rajarhat, South Dum Dum and New Town. The 38km Bagjola canal, which carries water all along BT Road before entering Rajarhat, is the main drainage outlet for South Dum Dum, New Town and Bidhannagar areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/canal-revamp-plan-for-bagjola-kestopur/articleshow/85254003.cms||Suman Chakraborti

They questioned why the state is acting in haste when the varsities are yet to complete ratification of faculty and physical inspection of colleges. “The universities should be given at least three to four weeks to complete physical inspection,” said V Balakrishna Reddy, president, Technical and Professional Institutes Employees Association. He said colleges were given affiliation for the last academic year without physical inspections and added that many colleges do not have the required infrastructure or faculty, especially for the new courses in emerging technologies. “Amid pandemic, colleges have sacked quite a few faculty, some of them moved out of teaching profession. More than ever, it is important to check ground reality this year,” he added. As per the notification released by Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTUH), which has the majority of engineering colleges in the state as its affiliated colleges, colleges have time until August 17 to apply for affiliation for the academic year 2021-22 without any late fee. By paying a late fee, they can apply until August 23.

---||Lucknow||Riding on wheels of time: From a luxury to symbol of freedom||LUCKNOW: Until late ’90s, owning a vehicle, be it a car or a two-wheeler, was considered to be a symbol of luxurious life – which was often bought from savings of one’s provident fund after one had managed to purchase a house. With continuous innovation and revolutionary improvement in automobile technology within affordable price tag, the vehicles became a symbol of freedom boosting people’s confidence. With the introduction of Honda Activa, a gearless scooter, in 2001, the four-stroke was largely considered as ‘sissy’ by men but in the last two decades, it has become popular not only among women, but also among men and students. It managed to capture large chunk of two-wheeler market segment in Lucknow. For example, out of the 70 % two-wheeler market – 35% space entirely dictated by gearless scooter in the city. Speaking to TOI, Aditya Agarwal, owner of JP Honda, said: “The initial years of gearless scooter were difficult but gradually it gave everyone a sense of freedom on the road, as it was easy to drive and handle. Further improvement in the segment, such as introduction of tubeless tyre, boosted confidence, especially among women who were worried about flat tyres in the middle of road. The 35% market of gearless scooter is continuously growing in Lucknow.” Similarly, in the budget segment of sedan, Lucknow emerged as a leader among non-metro cities. “With the development of bitumen road, including inner and outer-ring roads, large migration of people from eastern parts of UP with subsequent rise in apartment residential culture, customers started buying small sedans like Amaze, Swift Dzire as they had affordable price tag and gave a sense of luxury,” said Abhishek Agrawal, owner of Stallion Honda. “Lucknow is the biggest market in north India after Delhi for cars. This can be gauged from the fact that currently 5,500-6,000 units are sold every month in Lucknow. The number was 2,500 a decade ago. Current generation customers are no more loyal to a particular brand, as they are more aware and demand safety, features and convenience against the money they invest. In past years, Lucknow has gradually shifted to SUVs (mid-range to higher end), as they are robust cars which gives freedom to driver on various kind of terrain, and have all key features which customer wishes in his/her limited budget,” he added. Jatin Verma, owner of JSV Hyundai says, “From 1980s, the days of Ambassador, to present day’s SUVs (26 models currently in market), Lucknow’s preference in automobile has immensely changed. By 2025, city will hop on electric vehicles — and only those brands will survive which continue to innovate and meet the demands of customers. Vehicles are now a necessity rather than a luxury.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/riding-on-wheels-of-time-from-a-luxury-to-symbol-of-freedom/articleshow/85258272.cms||Arvind Chauhan

They said that not conducting the physical inspection for two consecutive years will bring down the quality of engineering education. “It looks like the state is planning to give affiliations without inspections. We demand that inspections are conducted to know ground realities and sanction affiliation only if colleges have required infrastructure and faculty,” said A Santosh Kumar, president, Telangana Schools Technical Colleges Employees Association (TSTCEA). The members of TSTCEA said that they will be submitting a representation to special chief secretary education, officials of higher education council, technical education, among other demanding to start EAMCET counselling only after completion of the affiliation process. They said that if they don’t receive a positive response, they will organise protest programmes as thousands of faculty members lost their jobs during the pandemic. As per faculty working in technical colleges, about 20,000 faculty members working in engineering colleges in the state have lost jobs during the pandemic.

This is the third such mishap in the past five months. A pedestrian and an autorickshaw driver were injured. The bus driver, Baban Mane (54), was arrested and booked under IPC sections 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 427 (mischief causing damage) and section 184 of Motor Vehicles Act. Although BEST officials claimed that prima facie and based on the driver’s statement, “he lost control on the bus”, police have not ruled out rash and negligent driving. The mishap brings into focus the need to discipline bus drivers, against whom commuters have often complained of rash driving on city roads. Officials said Pundlik Bhagat (70) died, while Ravindra Tiwari (65) and Mukesh Upadhyay (44) were injured in the mishap at Ashok Kedar Chowk around 7.15am. The bus (route No. 605) was from Tembhipada to Bhandup railway station. BEST officials said the vehicle was taking a sharp turn. “Prima facie, we found the driver lost control of the vehicle and rammed into an autorickshaw before hitting a pedestrian, and then an electric meter cabin on the side of the road,” said BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-senior-citizen-killed-in-best-bus-mishap-two-injured/articleshow/85256581.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: 30 more villages across Kolhapur on the list of landslide-prone zones||KOLHAPUR: As many as 30 villages across Kolhapur have been added to the list of high-risk landslide zone areas in the district. Due to the heavy rainfall last month, around 50 incidents of landslides and 40 cave-ins were reported across the district. Therefore, preventive measures against landslides will be carried out in these villages by district administration to avoid loss of life. Prasad Sankpal, the head of district disaster management committee in Kolhapur, said, “The number of villages in the landslide zones has doubled this year due to heavy rainfall. Intensity of a landslide cannot be predicted. Therefore, all these villages are considered at high-level threat. The residents of these villages need to stay alert and take necessary precautions.” This year, landslides have occurred in 20 villages each in Shahuwadi and Radhanagari tehsils; six villages in Panhala; two in Karveer; and one village each in Bhudargad and Gadhinglaj. Landslides can occur anytime in these villages as the soil in the hilly areas have loosened making it dangerous for the people living extremely close to the hilly areas. “Cave-ins were reported at 9 villages in Shahuwadi, 3 in Panhala, 6 in Karveer, 5 in Gaganbawda, 4 each in Radhanagari and Ajara, 7 in Bhudargad, and 2 in Chandgad talukas,” Sankpal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dist-30-more-villages-on-the-list-of-landslide-prone-zones/articleshow/85249321.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Mumbai||NCP’s Chhagan Bhujbal seeks discharge in Maharashtra Sadan scam case; pleas of his son & nephew opposed||MUMBAI: State cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal has moved the special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court seeking discharge in the Maharashtra Sadan scam case. The prosecution is yet to submit its reply on the NCP leader’s plea. His son Pankaj and nephew Sameer, co-accused in the case, have also sought discharge, but their pleas have been opposed by the investigating agency. The case concerns a contract Bhujbal allegedly gave K S Chamankar Enterprises in 2005 without inviting tenders, when he was PWD minister. The Bhujbals, however, had denied allegations of irregularities in the contract. Last month, five accused—developers and architect Pravina Chamankar, Praneeta Chamankar, Prasanna Chamankar and Krushna Chamankar along with former PWD engineer Arun Devdhar—were discharged by the court. On July 9, the same court rejected the discharge plea of former state information chief Deepak Deshpande. The court held that charges will be framed against him for offences relating to the Prevention of Corruption Act and cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code. Devdhar was alleged to have provided false and non-realistic information in a status report, and prepared a false balance sheet showing a prospective profit of only 1.33% to the developer, when it was actually 365.36%. In the detailed order allowing the discharge pleas, the court, however, said there is no material, prima facie, showing that there was a meeting of minds of all the public servants and they hatched a plan to prepare a status favourable to the developer. “When the submissions in the status report and the notes were subjected to scrutiny and verification of the superior officers of accused no 2 (Devdhar), i.e. chief engineer and the secretary, it cannot be said that the status report was based only upon the submissions of accused no 2,” it said. The court also pointed out that twice—in May and August 2006—the report went to the committee comprising then CM Vilasrao Deshmukh, Bhujbal, transport and development ministers and seven senior bureaucrats for discussion, deliberation and acceptance. The court said it is difficult to accept that they were misled by the improper and incorrect submissions of the report. The court pointed out that through a letter in February 2019, the 2006 agreement with the developer had been terminated by the government. “There is no dispute that till date, no benefit has been given to the developer in terms of the contract. But the developer has made the construction of Maharashtra Sadan at Delhi, High Mount Rest House and other buildings of RTO as per the contract. According to the developer, against the wo-rk of Rs 100 crore, a work of about Rs 80 crore and more has been done,” the court said. It said that any dispute about the contract could have been referred to a tribunal. “When neither any illegality is found in the transaction nor there is any direct or circumstantial evidence to show that illegal means were adopted in the contract, it was necessary to refer the dispute to the tribunal and not to lodge a FIR.” It also refuted the contention that it was improper to hand over the project to the developer without inviting tenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncps-bhujbal-seeks-discharge-in-maha-sadan-scam-case-pleas-of-his-son-nephew-opposed/articleshow/85258295.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The incident occurred under Mundha Pandey police station in Moradabad. The 28-seater bus was carrying around 100 passengers, mostly labourers. It was moving from Sitapur to Panipat in Haryana. Moradabad police said that injured passengers have been admitted to Rampur and Moradabad district hospitals for treatment. Moradabad SP Amit Kumar Anand said, “Prima facie, it appears that the driver lost control of the vehicle which was moving at a high speed.

---||Mumbai||ICSE, ISC students to take board exams twice this academic year||MUMBAI: A month after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) introduced two board exams—one in each semester—for class 10 and 12 students for the 2021-22 academic year, the Council of Indian School Certificate Education (CISCE) has decided to take a similar route. The CISCE, on August 6, issued a circular of its modified assessment plan for ICSE (class 10) and ISC (class 12) students. Semester one exams will be held online in November and will be based on multiple choice questions (MCQs). The question papers to be set by the board will cover 50% of the reduced syllabus, CISCE chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon stated in the circular. Schools are awaiting details about the exams, including whether it will be a proctored one. Semester two exams could be online or offline in March-April, depending on the Covid-19 situation in the country, and could be subjective or objective. This exam will cover topics from the remaining 50% syllabus. In Maharashtra, CISCE has more than 230 class 10 and 50-odd class 12 schools. “MCQs can be more challenging and far more difficult to score than subjective papers,” said Bombay Scottish principal Sunita George. Schools are awaiting sample papers to understand the difficulty level of questions and will be conducting internal tests based on MCQs before students take the first semester boards. The markings for the two boards exams will be maximum theory marks allotted to class 10 (80/100) and class 12 (70/80). The weightage of marks for computation of final board results will be brought down to half. The markings for internal assessment (class 10) and practicals/project work (class12) will remain unchanged. “The two board examinations will allow students across schools to compete in a pandemic year,” said a school principal. This year, the CISCE will also not conduct class IX and XI exams. The exams for these students were last held by the board in 2019-20. Prior to that exams were held by schools. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education affiliated schools said that the state too should come up with an assessment plan for SSC and HSC students this academic year. “Schools have begun conducting unit tests. Except for the 25% reduction in syllabus, there is no clarity on how students will be evaluated this year,” said a state board school principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-icse-isc-students-to-take-board-exams-twice-this-academic-year/articleshow/85256619.cms||Sandhya Nair

Earlier, peddlers would procure synthetic drugs from other states after these were smuggled from abroad. But now, peddlers and smugglers have started making these using chemicals.Since its inception on March 16, 2017, the Ludhiana STF has broken several drug chains, especially those linked to smuggling from Pakistan. It has, so far, nabbed 695 drug peddlers / smugglers in 405 cases, recovered 280kg heroin / ice drug, 57kg opium, 1.362kg charas, 550g smack, 1,334.100kg poppy husk, 223.350kg cannabis, 34.9 lakh intoxicating pills, besides Rs 3.7 crore and 5,000 US dollars of drug money. Ludhiana STF in-charge inspector Harbans Singh said, “When STF was formed, we initially targeted cross-border supply of drugs. The STF has broken almost all the drug supply chains being run from the other side of fence in Amritsar, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur.”“However, now, the trend is changing towards synthetic drugs, which are quite dangerous. Earlier, it was seen that Punjab-based drug peddlers were procuring synthetic drugs, which are made of chemicals only, from Delhi after those were smuggled from abroad. But for the past some time, we have nabbed smugglers who were making and selling synthetic drugs,” he added. On March 2, the STF had arrested quack Ajay Kumar of Mahadev Nagar and his accomplice, Davinder Singh of Uttar Pradesh, for smuggling heroin and preparing a narcotic powder with chemicals at their clinic in Jaspal Bangar, Sahnewal. The officials had recovered 1.5kg heroin, 10kg chemical powder and eight bottles of a liquid chemical from their possession. During probe, it was found that a UP man, Malti Prasad Verma, used to provide them heroin, chemicals and acid. He had also taught them how to make the power, which looked like heroin, using chemicals and acids. Malti Prasad has not been arrested yet.Former sarpanch Gurdeep Singh Rano, who was arrested in December 2020, too, was making synthetic drugs. The STF had recovered from the Sector 32 house of an accomplice of Rano a machine that was used to refine heroin. The kingpin of the racket was Harvinder Singh, alias Happy Randhawa, who was arrested by Thailand police. Randhawa had taught the technique of refining heroin to Rano and his aides.Can cause deathThe STF officials said, “Synthetic drugs are purely chemicals. One cannot differentiate between heroin and synthetic drugs. As soon as a person injects synthetic drugs in veins, it blocks the nerves and causes death. More than overdose, it is synthetic drugs which are claiming lives of addicts.” Are cheaper Inspector Harbans Singh said, “Heroin, which is smuggled from Pakistan, is three times more expensive than synthetic drugs. That is why, now smugglers are making synthetic drugs and selling them to addicts as heroin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/homemade-synthetic-drugs-a-headache-for-stf/articleshow/85251752.cms||Payal Dhawan

On Tuesday, their faces beamed with joy when they gathered at the police library on Ripon Street and received smart phones and free data packs from the officers of Kolkata Police, led by police commissioner Soumen Mitra, on the occasion of the inauguration of an initiative to help underprivileged children having no access to online education. Kolkata Police has tied up with NGO, Child Rights and You and a private mobile service provider to ensure that these children don’t drop out of their studies for their inability to attend online classes during the pandemic. The tripartite collaboration is called #PoraSunaDarabeNa (#SikshaNahiRukegi – Education will not stop) and the initiative was taken following a survey by NGOs and local cops who found that hundreds of students, living in various slums across the city, were discontinuing their studies. Mitra said, “This is a small attempt on behalf of KP to ensure that the students, whose parents cannot afford to get them an access to online learning, don’t face frustration and eventually give up their studies.” The initiative aims to cover around 500 children across 73 police stations under Kolkata Police. “I did not have a smart phone at home, so I could not attend online classes. Now, I can continue with my studies,” said Papiya Dey of Taratala CPT Colony and a Class X student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-gift-phones-to-50-kids-break-digital-barrier/articleshow/85254156.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Protest against private affiliation of grant-in-aid colleges||AHMEDABAD: Members of Gujarat State Professors’ Association have decided to protest at colleges in an attempt to voice their concerns about the Gujarat Private Universities (Amendment) Act 2021 which was passed earlier this year. On Wednesday, several professors wore black ribbons on their arms for work in about 300 colleges across the state as a mark of protest, according to a media statement by Gujarat State Professors’ Association. The association members are of the view that the new set of rules will make education costlier and give way to further privatization of the education sector. The new law, passed in the state assembly earlier this year, makes changes in the Gujarat Private Universities Act 2009 where private universities, which were not allowed to affiliate with grant-in-aid colleges, can now do so. However, the universities and grant-in-aid colleges to be affiliated should run by the same management or trustees. The association has stated that if the amendments are implemented, the fees in grant-in-aid colleges imparting education at concessional rates may increase. This will make these colleges unaffordable for the middle-class and economically weaker sections of the society. Also, this could put to stake the faculty members employed by the grant-in-aid colleges and lead tochanges in other benefits received by them, they said in a statement. The members of the state association as well as some members of the All India Federation of University and College Teachers Organizations (AIFUCTO) have raised these issues in a letter sent to Gujarat governor. The members of these associations have demanded that the government goes back to the earlier rules where the grant-in-aid colleges were not allowed to be affiliated with private universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/protest-against-private-affiliation-of-grant-in-aid-colleges/articleshow/85254239.cms||---

The girl also told the police that her father was about to shoot her on Tuesday morning and her mother came to her rescue. And when she and her mother were running towards the washroom to lock themselves in, he opened fire and a bullet hit her mother.Police suspect Jaswinder is hiding in Jalandhar.On Tuesday morning, Jaswinder had shot at his wife Jaspreet at their house in Haibowal and mother-in-law Vandana at her nearby paan shop. Thereafter, he drove his two-wheeler to Nurmahal and shot dead his friend, Rohit. Police said Jaswinder suspected his wife of having an illicit relationship with Rohit.Assistant commissioner of police (West) Gurpreet Singh said, “Though the statements of Jaspreet and Vandana have not been recorded yet, the 13-year-old daughter of the couple told police that on Monday night, when her parents had a fight, her father said to her that he will show his madness in the morning. It means that he had made up his mind to execute the crime. The girl also said that in the morning after a fight with her mother, her father was about to shoot her and her mother saved her.”“When Jaspreet ran towards the washroom to lock herself and her daughter in to escape Jaswinder, he shot at her. After doctors declare Jaspreet fit to give a statement, the picture will become clear. We are trying to trace the accused,” the ACP added.About the weapon used in the crime, he said, “The family told the cops that earlier, too, they had seen the weapon with Jaswinder. It is yet to be verified if it is licensed.” The condition of Jaspreet and Vandana is stated to be stable and out of danger.Device traced Jaswinder’s movement to JalandharThe Ludhiana city police had alerted the Jalandhar rural cops about Jaswinder and that he could get shelter there as he hailed from Lohara village of the district.Jalandhar rural senior superintendent of police Naveen Singla said, “A few days back, Jalandhar rural police had installed a number plate recognition (NPR) device at a checkpost in Phillaur, which is the entry point of Jalandhar rural area.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Two-wheeler registrations 30% lower than in pre-Covid era||AHMEDABAD: Two-wheeler demand has continued to remain subdued even 16 months after the pandemic-induced lockdown. The retail sales for two-wheelers continued to remain at a 30% decline in July against pre-pandemic levels. The vehicle retail report recently released by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) - Gujarat, suggests that some 68,647 two-wheelers were registered in July 2021 against 98,946 registrations in July 2019.  Number of registrations grew 29% year-on-year against, 52,895 two-wheelers retailed in July 2020, albeit on a lower base. Fewer student buyers, a weak-looking monsoon and dented income of two-wheeler buyers has had a grave impact on the sales numbers since the pandemic. “Overall, the demand for two-wheelers had declined since 2019 due to the mandatory third-party insurance, which added to the cost of ownership of the vehicle. Moreover, with the rollout of BS-VI variants, the prices had increased significantly. The pandemic completely muted the sentiment for two-wheeler purchases,” said Pranav Shah, chairman – Gujarat, FADA. “With education going online, most students, which comprised a major chunk of our customers, did not purchase vehicles at all. The income of two-wheeler buyers had already declined since the pandemic, due to which only those in need would make a purchase,” said Shah. Two-wheeler dealers claim that with a weaker monsoon, the buying sentiment is expected to remain muted. “Monsoon has not picked up well this time around due to which purchase sentiment is not upbeat. Inadequate rainfall will only add to the agrarian distress being faced by the rural population, further weakening their purchasing capabilities,” said a city-based two-wheeler dealer. While two-wheeler sales took a hit, car demand has recovered well buoyed by a better demand. The recovery in four-wheeler sales was good thanks to the muhurat purchases on Rath Yatra, according to dealers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2-wheeler-registrations-30-lower-than-in-pre-covid-era/articleshow/85254260.cms||Niyati Parikh

The assessees defaulting on the outward return filing for two or more months will not be able to use e-way bill facility and as a result they cannot sell their goods. Businessmen are unhappy over the resumption of this regulation as they are of the view that due to slowdown in businesses and the impact of pandemic, the government should temporarily keep this suspended. NK Thaman, a tax expert, said, “As per GST provisions, the facility of issuance of e-way bill is blocked if the registered person has not furnished returns for a consecutive two tax periods. A relaxation was given due to the second wave of Covid-19. Now with normalization of the situation, this provision will be restarted from August 15. Consequently, registered persons will not be able to supply their goods after August 15 if they have not filed their returns. On the other hand, the government will be benefitted as people will now immediately file returns and pay GST.”According to Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, “We are not against any rules and regulations framed by the government for ensuring tax compliance, but the decision to resume blocking of e-way bill generation at this point is not advisable. The businesses are passing through a very rough time due to slowdown and threat of the third wave of coronavirus, therefore delay in filing of returns and fulfilling formalities by genuine businessmen may be there. So, it is our request to the Centre and the GST authorities to defer the decision.”Rohit Gupta, president of Importer Exporter Club, Punjab, said, “At present, many genuine taxpayers are also facing difficulties in complying with norms and there are delays in filing the returns as well. Therefore, the government should reconsider its decision to resume the blocking of e-way bill generation as several innocent taxpayers will suffer badly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/e-way-bill-blocking-for-gst-defaulters-bizmen-unhappy/articleshow/85251797.cms||Mohit Behl

He also released a video regarding this announcement and urged the activists to make the farm agitation more strong. In his media interaction in Karnal, where Charuni held a meeting with senior BKU activists, he said, “The media reports about my joining the political front formed by industrialists of Punjab are baseless. I never announced that I will contest the election or become the CM. I was called to Punjab only for a seminar and they (Bharatiya Aarthik Party) told me that they will extend the support to Mission Punjab. I am neither the CM face in Punjab nor will contest the election. Mission Punjab was my idea as there was a need for new faces and panchayati candidates to run the government. We are protesters and will continue to fight till the farmers’ demands are met.” Charuni said that Tiranga Yatra on August 15 will begin from Pipli in Kurukshetra and conclude at Singhu border. Farmers have already started preparations for it and even duties have been assigned to activists, he said. Asked about the BJP Tiranga Yatra, Charuni replied, “BJP is using the Tricolour for power only. With the support of Tiranga, they want to enter villages as farmers have banned their entry there. We honour the Tricolour and even our sons achieeved martyrdom for the honour of Tiranga.” Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, Karnal district president of the BKU (Charuni) said that around 25,000 motorcycles will take part in the yatra, which will give new energy to the youth and protesting farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-intention-of-contesting-polls-in-punjab-charuni/articleshow/85256681.cms||---

With municipal election just a few months away, Jorgewar had started targeting the BJP-ruled Chandrapur Municipal Corporation (CMC) with allegations of corruption. There was face-off between BJP office-bearers in CMC and Jorgewar on Monday after both the sides staged protests against each other. MLA Jorgewar charged Dr Gulwade with blackmarketing Remdesivir doses allotted to his Covid hospital during the second wave. Refuting the allegations, Dr Gulwade said that despite being an MLA, Jorgewar doesn’t understand the administrative process for allotment of Remdesivir. He stated that the entire process was monitored by the collector and administration has record of every injection allotted to all the hospitals. Dr Gulwade said that his hospital even had to borrow 80 Remdesivir injections from civil surgeon to save lives of patients. “An equal number of injections were duly returned to the civil surgeon,” he said in the notice. Dr Gulwade challenged Jorgewar to prove his allegations. He claimed that his image as professional doctor as well as politician has been tarnished by the baseless allegations and hence he has served the notice of defamation to Jorgewar. TOI has a copy of the notice. Jorgewar claimed that he has so far not received any defamation notice. He maintained that he is firm on his claims and would reply appropriately to Dr Gulwade’s notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-city-chief-serves-defamation-notice-to-jorgewar/articleshow/85254230.cms||Mazhar Ali

King cobra is considered the world’s most venomous snake. As a result, it is often killed by villagers when spotted. The snake grows to around 20 feet in length and in Maharashtra, it is only found in the Dodamarg taluka of Sindhudurg district. Rahul Niralgi, a wildlife rescuer with the NGO, said, “Our NGO carries out various awareness programmes in the Dodamarg region as a lot of King cobras have been killed by the villagers in the past. I got a call from a villager about the sighting a king cobra.” He added, “Our team went to the spot and found the snake resting on a bamboo stick. We also informed the forest department about the snake after it was rescued. When measured, the snake was around 11 feet in length and weighed around 5.5kg. In presence of forest department officials, we released the snake into its natural habitat.” King cobras are found in their natural habitat in the recently formed Tilari conservation reserve and in the last one-and-a-half years, three cases of snake killing have come to the fore.

On Thursday, the deputy commissioner will visit the house before the work starts.The house shaped the early life of Lala ji, as he was fondly called. Built by his father in 1845, the house needs renovation with immediate effect to keep memories of the great freedom fighter alive. Born at his maternal grandparent’s house in Dudhike village in Moga on January 28, 1865, Lala ji spent his childhood at Mohalla Misarpura.DC Varinder Sharma said the project may start in a month. Executive officer of Jagraon municipal council Pardeep Daudhria said Lala ji’s house comes under the archaeology department, but he has been made the nodal officer for its renovation. He added that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had announced Rs 1 crore for renovation on August 15, 2018, and they have got a letter for Rs 50 lakh more. Shree Aggar Singh Samiti members, who have been going to Lala ji’s ancestral place after every few months, said they had many a time informed the authorities about the dilapidated state of the house.“We had raised the issue in a social media session held by CM Amarinder Singh in July 2020. He had told us that he had been to his place many times, but didn’t find anything wrong and had said that he would send the cultural minister to visit the site. We later realized that the CM was referring to the house of Lala ji’s maternal grandparents in Dudhike in Moga. After writing to higher officials many times, we have now heard that the DC is coming to Jagraon to discuss the renovation project,” said samiti vice-president Kamal Bansal. He added that once the house is renovated, people can visit and see the stuff used by Lala ji.  ‘Library too in bad shape’Talking to the TOI, the caretaker of the house said the building as well as the library were in poor condition. “The house needs repair. Even the library and its almirahs are in bad shape,” said 58-year-old Krishan Lal of Pathankot, who remains at the house round-the-clock. He said one to two visitors come to see Lala ji’s house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/renovation-of-lala-lajpat-rais-house-dc-to-visit-jagraon-today/articleshow/85251833.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||India||Covid: Low vaccination among women worries Centre||NEW DELHI: Even as India is inching closer to covering almost half of its adult population with at least the first dose of Covid vaccines, the Centre is concerned about the low uptake of jabs among women, particularly in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Overall, about 46% of total 52.2 crore doses administered so far have been given to women. “At present, the gap between the coverage among male and females is about 7-8%. This is slightly on the higher side given that there is not much difference in the overall adult male and female population ratio. The gap in immunisation coverage between the two genders should not be more than 2-3%,” a senior official said. The issue was discussed in the recent meeting of the National Expert Group for Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) last week and the Centre now plans to run a dedicated social mobilisation campaign to increase the coverage among female population. While the coverage among females has improved since April, when the gap was about 10%, officials say the improvement is primarily driven by the beginning of Covid vaccination among pregnant women. Till July 30, over 2.3 lakh pregnant women had received the first dose of anti-Covid jabs. The current gender distortion is also more significant among elderly population than in younger females, the official said. However, in some states like Kerala and Himachal Pradesh, more women have received anti-Covid shots than men. The Centre plans to work with Unicef and state government to ramp up coverage among women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-low-vaccination-among-women-worries-centre/articleshow/85259447.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Mumbai||First hand donation in Mumbai, transplant on at KEM Hospital||MUMBAI: The city recorded its first hand donation on Wednesday as the family of a young individual, who suffered brain death, consented to donate all organs. The family’s gesture saved five lives and facilitated the first hand transplant in a public hospital in Mumbai. Two hands donated by the individual (the donor family did not want to reveal the name or gender) were given to Parel’s KEM Hospital that has held a licence to perform such a transplant since 2016, but never found a suitable donor. The Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) had five people waitlisted for hand transplant a complicated operation that can take 18-24 hours as it entails attaching two main arteries, six veins, eight nerves, 12 tendons and bones. At the time of going to the press, the surgery was still on. KEM dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh did not divulge details about the surgery or recipient, saying it was “too early to comment”. The hand donation and transplant attempt has come nearly a year after train accident victim Monica More had undergone a transplant, the first in Mumbai, at Global Hospital with donor hands flown in from Chennai. Mumbai’s 24-year-old cadaver donation programme has facilitated hundreds of kidney, lung, liver and heart transplants, but this was the first successful hand donation. Dr S Mathur, president of ZTCC, called it an important leap in the organ donation programme that only happens gradually with better awareness among people built over years. “We started with cadaver kidneys. Then, people started accepting liver donations. Later, people accepted lung and heart donations. So, it happens after years of effort,” he said. The city’s cadaver donation programme that had been hit by the pandemic is gradually showing signs of recovery. ZTCC officials said that there have been three donations in the past week that have pushed the donations to 20. Together, the donations have facilitated 54 transplants in the last eight months. The donor in this case had suffered a brain haemorrhage and was declared brain dead after few days. The donor’s lungs were flown to Hyderabad, while the lungs, liver and kidneys were used to save end-stage failure patients in the city. The individual’s cornea and skin were donated too, said the authorities from a private hospital, where the person was declared brain dead. Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) in Kochi was the first in India to carry out a hand transplant in January 2015. Before More’s transplant, Maharashtra had taken the first shot at hand transplant at Pune’s Command Hospital, but the recipient suffered from a ‘hyperacute rejection’. The first few weeks in any transplant surgery is crucial, doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-first-hand-donation-in-city-transplant-on-at-kem-hosp/articleshow/85256701.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The HSKM has insisted that the agitation should be focussed on the assurance of MSP and the pro-farmer amendments in laws, rather then completely withdrawal of the same. “We had been writing to them in the past as well that the agitation is heading towards the fulfilment of political aspiration of leaders and the people active in committee are the ones active in electoral politics. In the process, the real farmer issues are getting ignored,” said HSKM spokesman Dr Shamsher Singh. As far as functioning of SKM is concerned, there were 40 members initially which has come down to seven. They did not even think of expanding the morcha team and are working on the lines of political aspirations. “No stand has been taken against Charuni and even our requests have gone unheard,” Shamsher added. He said now, HSKM would its own meetings at Tikri border. According to information, all the farmer organisations from Haryana associated with HSKM, their members and their leaders have given then statements of oath that the they would never indulge in electoral politics and won’t allow any body from political party to dominate their agitation. “They are soliciting for everyone, even those who talk about other agendas of separatists. We would only talk about the farmers’ welfare. We reiterated that the SKM should talk about the pro-farmer agendas and MSP assurance, which will open window for discussion with government,” Shamsher said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hskm-to-boycott-skm-meeting-will-have-its-own-at-tikri/articleshow/85256721.cms||Manvir Saini

In many schools, teachers with single dose of vaccine are taking classes despite norms requiring full vaccination.On Tuesday, 12 students of Government High School in Kailash Nagar and eight of Government Senior Secondary School in Basti Jodhewal had tested positive for Covid in random antigen testing.Confirming that teachers were not tested for Covid-19 in schools of the district, epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said as per the rules only fully vaccinated teachers are allowed to take classes. However, district education officer (secondary) Lakhbir Singh claimed that the teachers who had received both doses of vaccines were going to school and some may have certain medical conditions for not taking the jabs. But the situation on the ground is different. Principal of Government Senior Secondary School in Machhiwara Devinderpal Kaur said of around 33 staff members, including non-teaching ones, about 10 to 15 have got single dose and some of them had earlier contracted Covid. Asked if the teachers with single dose were coming to school, she said they were duty bound to come. A teacher of another government senior secondary school in Doraha said of the 21 staff members, including about five non-teaching ones, 10 were yet to get the second dose, while all of them have got the first dose.Principal of a senior secondary school in Samrala Gurdeep Rai said of 45 teachers, 26 have got both the doses, 10 have got single dose and there are nine who have not got vaccinated because they had Covid or other health issues. He said those who have got single dose were coming as of now and they would act if they get instructions in future.It seems the education department is not serious about checking the spread of the disease through teachers, said its officials.Deputy DEO Charanjit Singh said he was getting calls about data on vaccination, but he didn’t have it.‘Avoid unnecessary fear’“It is not good that they are not testing staff. There is a scare among students and it can be allayed if the source of infection is ascertained. It will help in breaking the chain of infection. On the other hand, it is also essential to avoid unnecessary fear because education is important for students, society and the country. Even a vaccinated person can get infected as has been in the case of delta variant,” said former IMA president Dr Narrotam Dewan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/classes-on-but-district-school-teachers-not-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85251862.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Lucknow||UP: Backward panel to hear plea for OBC status to Kayasthas||LUCKNOW: Even as the Centre on Tuesday passed the bill allowing states to include various castes into OBC category without permission from the Centre, the State Backward Classes Commission in Uttar Pradesh will soon take up a plea to include Kayastha community in the list. The commission is already hearing a plea to give the OBC status to Mahapatra Brahmins. UP at present has 79 castes in the OBC list. According to commission sources, the Kayastha community representation was earlier rejected as no one had further pursued the cause. However, a fresh representation has been sent by BJP MLA from Bareilly, Arun Singh, a Kayasth. Various Kayastha organisations have been demanding adequate representation of people from their caste in ticket distribution, ministerial berths and even in party organisations. However, political parties have been taking the community for granted that has pushed it backwards, an analyst said. MLA Arun Singh has confirmed to TOI that he has sent a proposal to the commission but refused to elaborate further. Sources however said that his plea, submitted on July 12, is for replacing Muslim Kayasthas with Hindu Kayasthas on the OBC list. The commission sources said that Muslim Kayastha are in the OBC list since 1955. They are 77th in the list of 79 castes with OBC status in UP. Muslim Kayasthas, the commission sources said, are those who were originally Hindu Kayasthas but got adopted Islam. The plea says that since their socio-economic condition is much better, they should be replaced by Hindu Kayasthas in the OBC category, as per commission sources. The commission has taken cognisance of the MLA’s request, sources said, and added that his application would be taken up in the meeting to be held soon. About the Mahapatras among the Brahmins, sources said that the commission would hold a final hearing and afterwards it would send its recommendation to the state government. Along with the Mahapatras, final hearing is pending for six other castes -- Bagwan, Goriya, Pawariya/Pamariya, Lavada, Rouhela and Muslim Bhant. The issue related to Dhaankoot is pending owing to lack of information while the process to prepare a report on Unaayi Sahu caste is already on. Rest all other representation from castes like Bote, Hindu Bhant, Mahaur Vaishya, Umarbaniya, Khangaar, Agrahari Vaishya, Dosar Vaishya, Jayswar Rajput, Baranwal/Banwal vaishya, kamlapuri vaishya, Ode Kshatriya Rajput, Dohar, Ayodhyawaasi Vaishya and Kesharwaani Vaishya have been rejected at the government level. When contacted, recently-appointed chairman of the State Backward Classes Commission Jaswant Singh Saini said that the issue of the Kayastha community would be placed before the 28-member board, which would decide on the request. After this a survey of the community would be done, followed by a final hearing to entertain objections if any, Saini further said, adding "after that the recommendation would be sent to the state government. A final decision would be taken by the government." Even as most of the parties are vying for the OBC votes in the Assembly Elections 2022, fresh demand to include many communities in the OBC category could bring back the focus on these castes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/backward-panel-to-hear-plea-for-obc-status-to-kayasthas/articleshow/85258301.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

During the visit, which lasted a few hours, Pande met AIMIM’s Naser Siddiqui and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Krushna Bankar. These two leaders had held mega agitations against the civic body as well as Pandey, alleging discrimination against particular areas of the city. Pandey visited areas of Katkat Gate, Roshan Gate, Champa Chowk, Shahgunj, Buddi Lane, Jaibhim Nagar, Cantonment, Nandanvan Colony, Bhimnagar Bhavsingpura and even the areas surrounding Padegaon waste treatment plant. His visit came as a surprise to many. Pandey even pulled up the ward engineers and other civic staff in some areas and gave them a deadline to complete the work. The administrator took stock of civic amenities, apart from taking cognizance of extremely poor conditions of the roads in different areas. At some places, people expressed their grievances over receiving civic water once in five to eight days. At other places, residents pointed out to overflowing drainages and gutters. AIMIM city president Shareq Nakshbandi said, “The garbage collection vehicles, conservation staff and as well as civic water supply are the most irregular in minority as well as Dalit dominated areas of the city. Despite raising the issue with the AMC authorities, these services continue to worsen, forcing us to take to streets.” He also questioned the civic body’s logic of getting road works done in other areas except for the old city. Pandey has refuted the allegations and said that he is here to serve all the citizens alike. He also appealed to the citizens to come forward with their grievances about civic amenities in their respective areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-civic-administrator-rides-a-bike-to-check-city-roads/articleshow/85249542.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Properties on encroached land to pay taxes to Secunderabad Cantonment Board||SECUNDERABAD: In a major move, officials of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) will levy property tax on buildings on encroached Cantonment and Defence land within Cantonment limits. On Wednesday, a resolution was passed in the Board meeting held under chairmanship of president of Cantonment Board, Brigadier Abhijit Chandra. SCB chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy who was in the Board meeting, told the media: “The decision to collect taxes on the lines of regular properties has been taken to improve our revenue. In fact, the Cantonment Board is spending crores of rupees for basic amenities like water, sanitation and street lights for people staying on encroached Cantonment and Defence land, but has not received a a single rupee as income from them for decades.” “Assessment of properties on encroached lands will be undertaken,” an official release issued by the SCB CEO here, said. According to SCB official records, there are 10,000 properties built on encroached land within Cantonment limits. Rasoolpura is among the biggest areas with a large number of properties built on encroached land, followed by Mudfort, Bowenpally and Trimulgherry. In 2018, based on Supreme Court orders, SCB officials removed over 28,000 names of voters from enrolment list. The SC in its judgment in September 2016 had stated that those encroaching upon defence land will have no right to vote in the SCB polls. Though the allotment of house numbers for nearly 10,000 properties was taken up by the Cantonment Board, it was stopped after the Supreme Court’s judgment. “House numbers are mandatory to assess the property tax to these properties and issue the demand notice,” an official in the SCB tax wing said. Meanwhile, the Board also passed a resolution to allot vacant open Cantonment land located between Jubilee Bus Station (JBS) and Picket Garden for parking. “Leasing of rights for temporary usage of land for pay and park facility at JBS has been allotted to a private firm on open auction basis,” CEO Ajith Reddy told TOI. Apart from these resolutions, the Board has considered and approved rights of toll tax collection for 2021-22 year, and also public works, sanctioning building plans, and GLR mutations too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/properties-on-encroached-land-to-pay-taxes-to-scb/articleshow/85258297.cms||---

These nullahs get flooded when it rains heavily for a few hours. The nullahs carry waste water from almost half the households in the city to the sewage treatment plant. But during monsoon as the nullahs remain flooded treatment of waste water gets affected. Balkawade said, “The encroachments will be marked and removed subsequently. We will ensure there are no more constructions along the banks of nullahs to ensure their flow is not obstructed.” After recent floods, both chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar had ordered the civic body to keep a check on the constructions along the flood zones of Panchaganga river. Recently, guardian minister Satej Patil had said the flood lines for the nullahs will also be marked. A day before Panchaganga got flooded due to which Jayanti nullah was also flooded and over 200 citizens from Ramanand Nagar had to be evacuated. “Constructions are permitted as per rules and keeping the flood lines in mind,” Balkawade said. Every year, the KMC removes the silt and waste from the nullahs to ensure the carrying capacity of nullahs is increased. The flooded water of Panchaganga puts pressure on sewage flowing through these nullahs and the water then enters in residential areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-to-identify-encroachments-along-jayanti-gomati-nullahs/articleshow/85249521.cms||---

Schools have been forced to tell students to submit their old textbooks so that the current students can use them till the new stock arrives. However, teachers said many still had no textbooks. Umedh Dhaware, a teacher from a Zilla Parishad school in Loni Kalbhor area, said, “At the beginning of the academic year, we had told all students to submit their textbooks so that we can give them to the next batch of students and we had a good number. However, the strength in the current batch is more than the previous batch. In that case, some students go without books.” Another ZP teacher, Nagnath Vibhute, said while there was a delay this year, for 45 days since the schools started, the students were taught a bridge course based on the previous year’s textbook. “We have heard that the books have reached each centre and within a few days, they will arrive in the schools too. It will then be distributed to the children. The student strength in schools has increased and in these cases, the lack of books becomes a problem,” Vibhute said. This year, there was a delay right from the printing of the books due to court cases against Balbharati. These were was resolved in June after which Balbharati started printing the remaining books. Smita Gaud, ZP primary education officer, said, “Till the last year, the books were distributed by Balbharati to the taluka level and from there we would distribute it to the block level and then to the centre. However, this year, the process of distribution was from Balbharati directly to the centre. In Pune, almost 85% of the books have reached the centres and will soon be given to the students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/books-for-zp-pupils-stuck-in-distribution-centres/articleshow/85254288.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Meerut||UP: Exporters to communicate directly with paddy farmers in Bijnor for basmati price||BIJNOR: Exporters will directly deal with paddy farmers at the Nagina-based Krishi Vigyan Kendra this year. More than half of the 57,000 hectare where paddy was sown in Bijnor district is made up of basmati. According to sources, last year due to Covid and farm protests, the farmers could not get a fair price for their produce and were forced to sell at government centres at Rs 1,888 per quintal whereas normal rates in the private market are over Rs 3,000. The basmati is sent to Punjab from where it is exported to Gulf nations and Europe. This time, agri authorities are making efforts to bring exporters among farmers so that they can decide on the price. Jaswant Singh, a farmer of Gher Rambagh village, said, "The basmati yield is less than common paddy and cost of production is high. Last year, there was a slump in the market. We could not get a good price of basmati and suffered huge losses. That is why we have sown common varieties of paddy. If authorities can ensure a sense of price security for farmers, they will increase the basmati paddy area." When contacted, joint director of agriculture department, JP Chaudhary, said, "We are trying to ensure basmati paddy growers get a decent price through the Farmers' Producer Organisation. Around 1,000 FPOs are being set up. These FPOs will be able to communicate with exporters as well. Our department will make it possible." Principal scientist of Basmati Export Development Foundation in Meerut, Ritesh Sharma, told TOI, "The slump in basmati's international market was due to Covid pandemic and pesticide residues in the crop. We were unable to get a good price because of pesticide residue. Some farmers use pesticide and insecticide indiscriminately without knowing its harmful effects."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/exporters-to-communicate-directly-with-paddy-farmers-for-basmati-price/articleshow/85243896.cms||Harveer Dabas

Two Nigerians held for Rs 22 lakh con||MUMBAI: Two Nigerian men and a live-in partner of one have been arrested for allegedly duping two Mumbaikars to the tune of Rs 22 lakh in separate instances of “customs frauds”. The complainants had accepted friendship requests from the accused on social media and were enticed with the promise of gifts if they paid custom duties and taxes. Both complainants are educated women. The police have appealed to citizens not to accept friendship requests from strangers online. In the first case, the woman received a friendship request on Facebook from a user ‘Dr Colton Ryland Mosley’ this March. She accepted it . Mosley told her he had sent her 40,000 Euros as a gift, but claimed that the money was caught up at Delhi airport. A woman then called up the complainant posing as a customs official and told her to pay Rs 18.8 lakh as customs duty and taxes, by June. After a police complaint was lodged, the North Region Cyber Police arrested Eric Chris (28), a Nigerian, and his live-in partnerRubini Gunsekharan (24). The police froze their bank accounts that have Rs 8.7 lakh. Chris came to India on a business visa two years ago and met Gunsekharanfrom Tamil Nadu. In the second case, the complainant had in February received a friendship request on Instagram from ‘Frank Wilson’. He too told her he had sent gifts from London. A woman later called her up, posing as a customs officer, and got her to pay xRs 2.9 lakh using an e-wallet as penalty and charge for the gift. Later, a man posing as an RBI officer called up the complainant, asking for another couple of lakhs as she was to receive foreign currency. She then approached the North Region Cyber Police. From Delhi, the police arrested Nigerian Godwin Eze for withdrawing defrauded sums from ATMs. The mastermind is still at large. Police said the gang convinced victims to transfer money into bank accounts of beneficiaries based in the North and the North East. Eze’s role was limited to withdrawing money and handing it over to the mastermind. Eze’s visa expired in 2020 and he has been overstaying in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-your-gift-from-abroad-two-nigerians-held-for-rs-22l-con/articleshow/85258330.cms||---

Over two lakh candidates appear for the TET every year, but the exam could not be conducted for the last two years due to the pandemic. Candidates have appealed to the Maharashtra State Council of Examination to reschedule the TET exam. The education department has scheduled a meeting with top officials on Thursday over several issues related to education when a decision is likely. The TET exam has candidates exceeding five lakh for every session. But, a small number take the UPSC exam too for a career choice. President of Yukrand, a students’ association, Kamlakar Shete, said candidates face a problem since both the exam dates are on the same day. “They have appealed to the state government to reconsider the TET dates,” he said. A candidate appearing for TET and UPSC, Sheetal Pradhan, said the UPSC dates cannot be rescheduled since it is a national level exam, but the state government could reconsider the dates of TET. “It is important to attempt both the exams as TET is mandatory and UPSC is life changing. So, I am hoping the government takes a decision on this very soon,” she added. Commissioner of the Maharashtra State Council of Examination, Tukaram Supe, said they will check the number of candidates that have applied for both exams. “If the number is high, we will have to reconsider the dates but it will be a big change as many others are dependent on TET. The proposal is with the state government and a decision after reviewing the application of the candidates will be announced at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/aspirants-fret-about-tet-upsc-papers-on-same-day/articleshow/85265578.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Mumbai||Mumbai airport passenger traffic soars 59% to 1.1m in July as testing rule eased||MUMBAI: It was in mid-July that the Maharashtra government allowed fully vaccinated passengers to enter the state without a negative RT-PCR test report. A consequence of that relaxation was a 59% jump in passenger traffic in July compared with June. Mumbai airport handled approximately 1.1 million (11 lakh) passengers over 11,400-plus flights across domestic and international destinations in the month of July, said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. With higher domestic flight capacity and ease of domestic travel restrictions, the airport observed a spike in air traffic, especially an increase in passengers travelling on weekends, the official added. What stood out was the data for weekend travellers. In July, a total of 5 lakh passengers boarded or disembarked into Mumbai airport on more than 4,000 flights on weekends. In June, the airport had handled 3 lakh weekend passengers over 2,700 flights. “Weekends saw a majority of passengers travelling to Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad destinations from Mumbai in the domestic sector and Doha, Newark and Dubai destinations in the international sector,” said the MIAL official. In the past two months, passenger traffic has been on a steady rise after the drop witnessed in March-May due to the second Covid wave. Despite the drop, passenger traffic in the previous quarter was much higher than that in the same quarter last year as domestic flights remained suspended from the last week of March till May 25. Between April and June last year, Mumbai airport handled 2.6 lakh passengers; during the same period this year, it handled over 19 lakh. The July 15 state government order granted relaxation on RT-PCR reports only for passengers who have taken both the vaccine doses and 15 days have lapsed since the second dose. To enter Maharashtra, other passengers have to undergo an RT-PCR test with the report valid up to 72 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-passenger-traffic-soars-59-to-1-1m-in-july-as-testing-rule-eased/articleshow/85256844.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Govt plans to raise Rs 1,200 crore from liquor store auctions in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Sweeping changes are expected in the next round of auctions for liquor shops, including licenses for 200 more stores. Auctions for the next two years will be held in October this year, and the excise department is currently working on a new policy. The licenses of the existing 2,216 liquor shops will expire at the end of October this year, and an auction must be held, officials said. The excise department intends to develop a new policy by the end of next month. More than 80 new bars were permitted after the formation of the state, but none of them opened for various reasons. As the number of licenses for liquor shops have remained constant since the state’s inception, officials are proposing a change this time by adding licenses for 200 more stores. These shops will primarily be located in new mandals, municipalities, and areas, where more melas and festivities are held on a regular basis. Another change being considered is an increase in the application fee for participating in auctions. With the price increase, the auction is expected to generate approximately Rs 1,200 crore in revenue. During the 2015-17 auction, the application fee was Rs 50,000, which was raised to Rs 1 lakh in the subsequent round of bidding, and is now being proposed to be raised to Rs 3 lakh. However, this suggestion is being debated to see if it is feasible for shop owners without raising booze costs. Officials said they are also looking at raising license fees of shops. Currently, there are four slabs in place: Rs 45 lakh, Rs 50 lakh, Rs 80 lakh, and Rs 1.20 crore. Officials are looking into the proposal of raising the license price to 5%-8% in some areas. “These are preliminary recommendations; things may change, and there may or may not be a price increase,” said a top official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-plans-to-raise-rs-1200-crore-from-liquor-store-auctions-in-t/articleshow/85258327.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The group, led by Fauzia Khan, the MP from Marathwada, and her party colleague Vandana Chavan, said: “Despite the notification of the much-awaited National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021, in March this year, such patients continue to be at grave risk due to the lack of a sustainable funding mechanism for treatment.” The memorandum, signed by the MPs of several states, including Maharashtra, Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and others, unanimously stated: “We would like to draw your immediate attention towards the need to prioritize treatment for at least the ultra-rare diseases — treatable conditions that have an even lesser prevalence as compared to others; and for which, the Drugs Controller General of India-approved therapies are available in India.” The memorandum requested the Union minister to extend the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN) to all Group 3(a) patients with treatable conditions, and transfer the unspent funds from the previous years’ budgetary allocation to provide treatment to eligible patients diagnosed with treatable conditions. While citing the examples of other developing countries like Brazil, Argentina, Algeria, and Egypt, the delegation pointed out these countries have robust reimbursement mechanisms in place (often 100%) for dealing with rare diseases; or they have earmarked funds out of their healthcare budgets specifically for such purposes,” the members wrote, explaining that unlike diabetes or any other common ailment, the number of rare disease patients is very small. “Without any support from the government, parents of these children are left with no option but to look on in despair, despite the availability of approved therapies in India,” said Chavan. The MPs, while welcoming the Government of India’s efforts to mobilize funds through crowd-funding and even involving corporate houses and PSUs for the treatment of these diseases, expressed concerns over the possible delay in help reaching the needy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mps-seek-health-ministers-intervention-to-prioritise-treatment-of-group-3a-disorders/articleshow/85249709.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Thangal, who was the firm’s MD, had gone into hiding on November 9 after police arrested former Manjeswaram MLA MC Kamaruddin who was the chairman of the firm. The two, along with other accused, had allegedly duped depositors who invested money in the gold jewellery business. While Kamaruddin was district president of IUML in Kasaragod, Pookoya Thangal was a member of the party district working committee. Crime branch (CB) deputy SP Sunil Kumar said 176 cases were registered in connection with the scam and Thangal was accused in all cases. Sources said Thangal was hiding in Nepal but the investigation team is yet to verify it. He arrived at Hosdurg court in the morning along with his lawyer. He was remanded in judicial custody. CB team probing the case had issued a lookout notice against him. His son Hisham, also an accused in the case, is still absconding. The first case in connection with the scam was registered by Chandera police on Sept 26, 2020 after three depositors alleged that they were duped after depositing money in jewellery business. Fashion Gold jewellery began operations at Cheruvathoor in 2003 by accepting investments from the public. Later, new branches were opened in Payyannur and Kasaragod in 2010 and 2011. It is estimated that 749 persons had invested over Rs 100 crore in the project. However, the business encountered losses and all branches were closed in Dec 2019. It is alleged that investments were collected for business even in 2019. Four companies were registered for the gold business and deposits were collected from investors on a large scale. Cases in connection with the scam were registered in Chandera, Kasaragod, Payyannur and Thrissur. The case was later transferred to CB. Kamaruddin, who is an accused in 154 cases registered as part of the scam, had secured bail in February 2021. Cases were registered against the accused for cheating, criminal breach of trust and under provisions of Kerala Protection of Interests of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act and under Banning of Unregulated Deposits Schemes Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/pookoya-thangal-surrenders-in-court/articleshow/85254448.cms||---

Hockey star Vivek Sagar’s journey from a small village in MP’s Itarsi to the Olympics podium in Tokyo is the kind that inspires others to dare to dream. He tells TOI in an exclusive interview how he got there & where he is headedHow has life changed after the Tokyo Olympics medal?For any athlete, winning an Olympics medal is a dream. I am living that dream every minute now. I had started playing hockey with the dream of playing for the country, but nothing can top an Olympics medal. Winning a bronze in the Olympics is just the beginning for me. I will not stop till I win an Olympics gold for the country. Your father Rohit Sagar didn’t want you to play hockey. How did you keep your dream alive?Like any other parent, my father was also worried about my future. His concern was very genuine. However, I only wanted to play hockey because whenever I have a hockey stick in my hand, it gives me the kind of satisfaction that I can’t describe in words. When you decide to achieve something with honest dedication and devotion, life always supports you. My family has been my motivation for hockey. I am eager to meet my family. Will the Tokyo bronze change perception of hockey in the country?Any sport gets a boost when athletes win medals. It’s the same with hockey. This Olympics bronze will definitely lead to a paradigm shift for hockey in the country. I believe parents will motivate their children to play hockey. The love shown by the country for the game proves it is extremely popular. The only need was to win medals, and it has happened. What more does Madhya Pradesh need to do to promote hockey?MP has the best hockey academies, run by the sports department. In fact, I started my hockey career at the Bhopal-based hockey academy. There is proper support and availability of modern equipment. What’s needed is more hockey synthetic turfs. Grass hockey grounds have to be converted to into synthetic turf. Your goal in the 58th minute of the pre-quarters game against Argentina. What was going on in your mind?We all were keen to take the lead. There were excellent moves before my goal but they could not be converted into goals. After I pushed the ball into the net, I felt like it was the best moment in my life. It helped the team take the lead. I can’t express what I feel whenever I recall the moment when I scored a goal for the country in the Olympics. Do you think hockey should be made compulsory in schools and colleges?That’s for the government to decide. I’d rather not comment on it. However, I believe hockey should be promoted in schools and colleges so that more talent can join this game. I hope the Tokyo Olympics medal will change the scenario.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/oly-medal-is-turning-point-for-hockey/articleshow/85254428.cms||Ramendra Singh

All six workers were nabbed late Tuesday night. The duo — site supervisor Rahul Tahed and engineer Arkaan Sheikh, were taken to a remote village, around 130km away in Dhanpur taluka of Dahod. Tahed and Sheikh work with a construction company that is handling the site of an upcoming pharma unit. Vadodara rural police tracked them down based on the mobile phones’ location and footage of CCTV cameras along the highway and rescued the duo late on Tuesday night. The six accused identified as Madiya Rathod, Nagra Rathod, Nimesh Rathod, Mumesh Rathod, Suresh Rathod and Naresh Vanzara were detained and brought to Savli police station. Police said that Tahed and Sheikh were abducted on Tuesday afternoon when they came out of the company’s gate in a rented vehicle. The six labourers overpowered them and forcibly made them sit in the vehicle. Meanwhile, the duo’s colleague Amrendra Singh received a call from a sand excavating machine operator to not leave the construction site. “The machine operator witnessed the two victims being taken away, so he alerted the third employee. Had he also left the premises, he would have been taken away too,” said a police official. After Tahed and Sheikh were abducted, Singh approached Savli police. Cops said that the labourers had heated arguments with Tahed and Sheikh on August 9 over payment of wages. The labourers had asked for their outstanding wages and had threatened that if they were not paid, they would stop working and approach the police. Instead of approaching police, the labourers took law in their own hands and abducted the two employees, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/six-workers-abduct-two-engineers-over-non-payment-of-wages-held/articleshow/85251951.cms||---

Power was restored late on Tuesday only after intervention from the collector. The row started with the forest department objecting to the electricity staff chopping branches of trees in wildlife area in the mandal without permission. They also registered a case. The electricity department responded in kind and cut the power supply from the Kothaguda substation to the forest office and staff quarters on Monday night. According to Mahabubabad DFO T Ravi Kiran, the electricity department had trimmed the branches on a 15-km stretch which was a wildlife area. A case was registered and in retaliation they cut of the power, he said. “The forest department has no pending power bills and they can’t cut the supply. We took the matter to the collector,” Kiran said. Kothaguda AE Kumaraswamy finally restored power to the forest department on Tuesday after the collector intervened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/power-staff-cut-supply-to-forest-dept-after-row/articleshow/85258332.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

The high court had, on July 28, asked Mumbai University to announce results and also distribute marksheets within a period of two weeks. This two-week deadline was on Wednesday. The results of the LLB exam had anyway been delayed with the university issuing a last-minute order in the first week of July, asking colleges to test students retrospectively for summer 2020 exam. Students claimed that it was contempt of court. “The university is in a habit of missing deadline for results and marksheet distribution and this time they have failed to follow the high court’s directive. The marksheets should now be released on a war-footing as students have been waiting to apply for the All India Bar Examination. The last day to apply for the same is August 14,” said student activist Aakash Vedak. Vinod Patil, director, Board of Examination and Evaluation, Mumbai University, said that the results of around ten or twelve colleges have been sent out on Wednesday. He further added that the remaining would be sent out by Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/univ-flouts-bombay-hc-order-on-issuing-llb-marksheets/articleshow/85256886.cms||---

The state government has informed that the birth anniversary of Rajendra Chola I observed annually on Thiruvathirai star falling during the Tamil month of Aadi (July-August) will be celebrated at the Gangaikonda Cholapuram from the next year.Rajendra Chola I’s birth anniversary is celebrated on the Thiruvathirai star in the Tamil month of Aadi. Since Aadi Thiruvathirai is already over, the birth anniversary would be celebrated by the government from the next year since Aadi Thiruvathirai is already over. History and archaeology enthusiasts welcomed the move as Rajendra Chola is known for his contribution in building temples, naval warfare and establishing maritime trade with present-day Southeast Asia. “While the birth anniversary of Raja Raja Chola is being celebrated as a government event in Thanjavur, a similar honour for his son and successor Rajendra Chola I is evading. Happy that our demand has been addressed, we also request the government to include the achievements of Rajendra Chola I in school textbooks,” R Komagan, chairman, Gangaikonda Cholapuram development council said. Seminars and cultural programmes to promote the legacy of Rajendra Chola I shall be carried out to augment domestic and international tourism potential. After his successful Gangetic expedition, Rajendra Chola I had established his capital at Gangaikonda Cholapuram, shifting from Thanjavur. Gangaikonda Cholapuram had been Chola’s capital for more than two centuries where Rajendra Chola I had built the monumental Peruvudaiyar temple at Gangaikonda Cholapuram similar to the Thanjavur Big temple. The temple was recognised as one of the world heritage sites by Unesco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rajendra-chola-i-birth-anniv-to-be-celebrated-as-govt-event/articleshow/85254441.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Retired school teacher on a mission to revive traditional paddy breed||TRICHY: A retired school teacher-turned-organic farmer in Perambalur has revived the cultivation of a traditional paddy variety that has almost disappeared despite its ability to withstand drought and flood. Having recently received a bountiful harvest of the rare ‘Kallimadaiyan’ breed, D Varadharajan has been distributing the seeds to fellow farmers in the rain-fed villages to sustain the breed. The 59-year-old retired government school teacher said he managed to secure the seeds of Kallimadaiyan through a network of organic farmers. Having cultivated the traditional breed on his 20 cents of land in Nallur village near Mangalamedu in September, Varadharajan completed the harvest in February and stocked half of his yield in two bags to distribute among the farmers as seeds. As late August and early September mark the beginning of new paddy (samba) cycle, the organic farmer distributed 150 kg of Kallimadaiyan to Perambalur farmers. With a crop cycle of 5.5 months, it requires less water and no chemical fertilisers and pesticides. “I used only panchakavya and groundnut cake residue as fertiliser. So, cultivation cost is only half of that incurred in cultivating hybrid varieties,” Varadharajan told TOI. The paddy breed he successfully tried out can grow up to a height of five feet and has withstood heavy downpours. Varadharajan has shared the seeds with 12 farmers dependent on well irrigation. “We have to create local seed banks in districts to promote such seed sharing between farmers so that rare traditional breed seeds will be available. Kallimadaiyan was once extensively cultivated in Perambalur region, it’s time for a revival,” Ramesh Karuppiah, Perambalur- based environmentalist said. Once more farmers come forward to take up its cultivation, Varadharajan said a group of farmers can take to value-addition and market the paddy in metros cashing in on the demand for organic paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/retired-school-teacher-on-a-mission-to-revive-traditional-paddy-breed/articleshow/85254454.cms||Deepak Karthik

Former national coach Mayank Thakur who is also from Bhopal will accompany her in Tokyo. Gwalior’s Prachi will be the only entry from India in this category at the mega event. She was a champion para-swimmer for India, but switched to paracanoe at the behest of her coach, Thakur who realised that she had a better chance of getting to Paralympics. “She will be India’s one of the biggest medal hopes in the Tokyo Paralympic. She has been working hard to prove her mettle at the mega event,” said Thakur. Talking to TOI, Prachi said, “I have no words to express my happiness. I had never thought of representing India for the Olympics. I will not let down the hopes of the country.” “For a game like kayaking and canoeing, legs play an important role. As I can’t use my legs, it becomes more difficult when you are competing at the international level. However, with the help of coach Mayank sir and executive member of IOA B S Kushwaha, I could manage to reach this level in my career,” said Prachi. Her coach Thakur who is also chairperson, Para India Kayaking and Canoeing Association, said, “She is a promising player. I and my team made a special boat for her as she did not have one,” Thakur said. Secretary general, Indian Kayaking and Canoeing Association (IKCA), Prashant Kushwaha said, “Her efforts will bring the first canoeing medal in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/prachi-set-to-sail-to-tokyo-paralympic/articleshow/85254442.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Local train 1st class commute 20-25x cheaper than car/cab||MUMBAI: With fully vaccinated general citizens allowed to travel by suburban trains from I-Day, many are breathing a sigh of relief as the cost of daily commute will be 20 to 25 times cheaper by a first class coach than by private car or aggregator cabs. “When I travel to my workplace in the Fort area, it costs me around Rs 350 for petrol to and from office. Besides, I have to pay a toll of Rs 127.50 for a two-way journey on the Bandra-Worli sea link. So, the total expense for my daily commute comes to around Rs 477. Today, when I purchased a two-way pass from Bandra to CSMT-Churchgate, I calculated that my expense will be just Rs 20. That’s a huge savings,” said an office-goer from Bandra. Several others like him told TOI how travelling by first class coaches in locals is much better than travelling by a car, cab or even a BEST bus. Citizens are also irked by the hike in fuel rates, with Mumbai paying Rs 107.83 per litre for petrol and Rs 97.45 for diesel. Akshay Kulkarni, who works at Nariman Point and used to drive from Mulund , said: “I am thrilled that local trains will be available to the general public from Sunday. For me, driving would cost Rs 300 to Rs 400 daily on petrol and when I took Uber, it would cost Rs 500 to 600 on most days. The comparative train fare comes to an average Rs 24 per day for first class travel.” He added: “I will any day opt for a train journey as it saves time, energy and I am also used to it for several years.” For a resident of Dahisar East, an Uber ride to south Mumbai would cost up to Rs 600 and it is way cheaper travelling by first class coaches. “At times, a cab ride could take three hours when the train will take me just an hour,” he said. Dheeraj Singh, who travels from Andheri to Churchgate, said it costs around Rs 400 to Rs 500 by aggregator cab and it is better to switch to a local train for a smooth, economical ride. “Also, the Metro is connected to both Central and Western Railway and it is easier to board Metro at Versova or D N Nagar stations and take connecting trains at Andheri or Ghatkopar,” he said. The maximum fare in a non-AC BEST bus is Rs 20 and Rs 25 for AC. So on some routes, this could be the cheapest option, but when it comes to good speed, better frequency, comfort and uninterrupted rides, the local train is clearly the common man’s first choice. “Also, if you plan to take a bus, you may end up waiting at the bus stop for a long time. It is very frustrating,” added Singh .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-local-train-1st-class-commute-20-25x-cheaper-than-car/cab/articleshow/85258338.cms||Somit Sen

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by Prabhakar Chouti, a lecturer from Mahbubnagar district, questioning the GO issued by chief secretary Somesh Kumar on June 7, 2021. According to petitioner’s counsel Mayur Mundra, the GO was issued granting Rs 59 crore towards legal expenses for defending the CS and CCLA in nearly 200 contempt cases which charged them with violation of court orders. The bench earlier stayed the release of funds through this GO. The CS later filed an affidavit saying that this money was meant for paying compensation to the people whose land and properties were acquired and in cases where execution petitions were filed seeking implementation of court orders granting them compensation. “Look at the tone and tenor of the GO. Very misleading. This gives an impression that this money was meant for defending the CS in contempt cases. Better issue a corrigendum,” the bench said. Advocate general BS Prasad explained that the references portion of the GO did speak about the true purpose of the GO. The bench said that the language deployed in the GO was very misleading and sought an addendum to the GO. The case was adjourned to August 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/issue-addendum-to-go-on-release-of-rs-59-crore-hc-to-t/articleshow/85258336.cms||---

While the corporation will get a cash prize of Rs 25 lakh and the CM’s award, the town panchayat will get Rs 10 lakh besides the award at the ensuing Independence Day celebration in Chennai. Thanjavur corporation commissioner K Saravanakumar said the award was instituted for the efforts taken by the civic body to control the Covid-19 pandemic. Early disease intervention mechanisms including fever camps and mobile RT-PCR testing at vulnerable localities were appreciated by the department. “In our jurisdiction, we have resolved the maximum number of grievances submitted under chief minister’s special cell assuring solutions within 100 days too,” the commissioner told TOI. The municipality was constituted as a “third grade” municipality in 1866 and upgraded as a corporation in 2014 by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. In 1983, it was upgraded as a special grade municipality. Apart from performing well in Covid-19 preventive measures, the efforts taken by the civic body in expediting drinking water projects and reviving water bodies under smart cities mission were cited as other factors by civic body officials for the state-level recognition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/thanjavur-corporation-adjudged-best/articleshow/85254479.cms||---

Discoms claim Rs 5341 crore losses||BHOPAL: Brace yourself for another power shock, as discoms have claimed Rs 5341 crore loss during 2019-20 and urged the regulator to increase tariff. This is nearly twice the revenue gap presented by discoms in ARR filed before MPERC for 2021-22 wherein they sought a revenue hike of 6.2% against this gap, thus if accepted, the true-up can lead up to around 10% hike in power tariff. Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) petition is filed by discoms before the commencement of a financial year, it is done on the basis of estimated income and losses. But after the end of financial year, and after the audited financials are available, discoms again file true-up petition which is based on actual income and expenditures and urge the commission to allow them to recover the losses, if any, from the consumers in subsequent years. Urging the commission to ‘consider and approve true-up amount of Rs 2,458.33 crore for East Discom, Rs 2,373.91 crore for Central Discom and Rs 508.89 crore for West Discom aggregating to Rs 5,341.13 crore for MP state which shall be incorporated in the ARRs of subsequent years or as the Hon'ble commission may deem fit for recovery of the same’, discoms are passing the burden on consumers, say experts. “Of the total losses, Rs 6227 crores have been incurred as the discoms purchased power above the limit approved by the MPERC. Regulator had approved the power purchase cost of discoms to be Rs 26003 crores in the tariff order for 2019-20, but discoms purchased power worth Rs 32231 crores”, retired additional chief engineer of MP GENCO Rajendra Agarwal told TOI. Agarwal has also filed objections against this true-up petition before MPERC. “And it is not only this, barring the western discom, other two discoms have reported more power transmission losses than those allowed by the regulator. Who will be accountable for these losses, definitely not consumers. And regulator should hold people accountable for the power purchase above the limit prescribed by it”, Agarwal said. MPERC has sought objections on this issue and scheduled a public hearing on August 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/10-power-tariff-hike-on-cards-discoms-claim-rs-5341-cr-losses/articleshow/85254509.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: As identical scores jump, birth dates could be tie-breaker for Class XI entry||MUMBAI: This year, your marks alone will not help fetch a Class XI seat. Your date of birth could determine where you figure on the merit list, along with those who scored exact marks as yours. With no Common Entrance Test (CET) and the possibility of hundreds of students bunching up with identical scores in their Class X, the state’s school education department will be facing a unique problem in drawing up merit lists for online admissions to first-year junior college this year. The department is looking at tie-breaking solutions to avoid confusion during admissions. While tie-breaking formulas such as using scores in English and the date of birth are available, the latter was not put to use in the past, said officials. An official from the Pune region said they have never faced such a problem. “A random survey of 10-12 larger schools in Pune revealed that each of them has at least 80-100 students scoring identical scores around 98-99%. This has never happened. The rulebook permits using date of birth as tie-breakers, but it was never used extensively. This time we may have to consider it, and even find more solutions, or there will be confusion during admission,” said the official. “It is a unique situation, which could have been avoided with CET. But with no CET, admissions will be based on Class X scores. We are discussing possible solutions and will take a decision after getting government approval,” said a senior department official. Students may have scored identical marks in subjects too with such high aggregate scores, he said.  Vasant Kalpande, former chairperson of the state education board, said in scholarship exams, due to the sheer number of students scoring higher marks, the merit list is decided on the date of birth of a student. “If students tie in marks scored, the child who is older makes it to the merit list.” Last year, two students scored the perfect score in NEET-UG. However, the older one was announced the topper by National Testing Agency. A junior college lecturer said when there is a tie in marks, their scores in English and Science are considered. A principal said arriving at the merit list will be a Herculean task for the state. “A student who gets a seat of choice will have hit a jackpot. It won’t be marks that will fetch a seat,” the principal said. The registration process for FYJC online admissions will commence on August 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-identical-scores-jump-birth-dates-could-be-tie-breaker-for-class-xi-entry/articleshow/85256919.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Obscene clip allegedly of BJP MP goes viral, two held||PALANPUR: Police in Banaskantha have registered an FIR against two persons and detained them after a video purportedly showing BJP MP Parbatbhai Patel in a compromising position with a woman went viral on social media even as the parliamentarian claimed the clip was doctored, said an official on Wednesday. The FIR was lodged on Tuesday at the Tharad police station of Banaskantha district on a complaint given by the MP's son, Shailesh Patel, said deputy superintendent of police P H Chaudhary, adding the local crime branch (LCB) is probing the case. Parbatbhai Patel (72), the Lok Sabha MP from Banaskantha, denied any wrongdoing and claimed the video has been doctored and his face superimposed on the person seen in the clip, while his family alleged a conspiracy to extort money and defame them. “In his complaint, Shailesh Patel has alleged that his father's edited video was made viral on social media by the two accused —Magha Patel and Mukesh Rajput (both detained) as part of a pre-planned conspiracy. We have lodged an FIR under sections 389 (extortion), 500 (defamation), criminal conspiracy (120-B) of the IPC and under relevant sections of the IT Act,” he said. Evidence collected so far suggests there was a conspiracy to malign the MP's image and extort money from him through the video, said the DySP. According to Chaudhary, Magha Patel had earlier threatened on the MP’s Facebook page that he will “publish a video of Banaskantha's top politician on August 15”. Then on Tuesday, the same video, purportedly featuring Parbatbhai Patel, was shared in a WhatsApp group by Mukesh Rajput, he said. He added that the video will be sent for forensic analysis to find out its authenticity. Shailesh Patel told reporters that the video has been used for defaming his father and to extort money. “Magha Patel has been threatening to release the video for some time. This is an edited video created only to defame my father,” said Shailesh Patel. PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bjp-mps-alleged-sex-video-2-nabbed/articleshow/85252028.cms||---

After a two-hour “encounter” near Malan river in Mandawar, police finally arrested Ranjeet Singh, 36, a National Security Guard (NSG) commando who had long gone rogue and was wanted for attempted murder, loot and abduction cases in Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and UP, on Tuesday. Ranjeet, from Patiala, had been trained as an NSG commando at Manesar, after which he became a trainer himself. But after six years as a commando, he was caught trafficking drugs and was jailed in Ambala. “His services were terminated in 2010 because of his criminal activities,” Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh. When he came out of jail later that year, he turned to organised crime and set up his own gang. “There are 20 cases lodged against him across many states,” the SP added. Apparently, police said, he had all his conversations over Wi-Fi calls, which could not be traced.“Ranjeet and his accomplice, Mohammad Amjad, 28, from Muzaffarnagar, had attempted to loot a financing office in Bijnor on July 19,” the SP said. “A worker alerted the police, who got there and the two of them fled the scene.”A month before that, Ranjeet’s gang had looted another finance company in Rajasthan. “They had robbed 25kg gold from a Manappuram Finance branch at Churu in Rajasthan on June 14. While their accomplices Shadab (from Muzaffarnagar) and Hanees (from Mohali) were arrested with some of the loot and illegally acquired pistols, Ranjeet and Amjad had managed to escape,” SP Singh said. “Then, Ranjeet and four of his accomplices looted a prominent Punjab-based jeweller’s house of Rs 30 lakh and gold jewellery.”On Tuesday, Ranjeet and Amjad were on their way to Bijnor to fence a part of that haul. “We received a tip-off and started checking vehicles on Mandawar road. When they were intercepted, they started firing at cops. A constable, Badal Singh, was injured in the shoulder. The two of them, meanwhile, left their bike by the banks of the Malan river and ran into the sugarcane fields. Police had to open fire and they were hit in the legs. They were arrested and are now being treated at the district hospital,” the SP said.Besides 300g gold, police seized two illegal firearms and a used cartridge from Ranjeet. “When he was questioned, he confessed to his crimes,” the SP said. “He is the kingpin. He is expanding his gang in UP now. We are trying to trace his network.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rogue-nsg-commando-wanted-in-5-states-nabbed-in-up-after-encounter/articleshow/85244025.cms||Harveer Dabas

It was never mentioned that the data can be submitted by August 13. If there is any such letter, it must be shown by the Centre,” Sisodia said. “In any case, Delhi government will soon submit a report to the Centre on the issue of deaths due to oxygen shortage in Delhi,” he added. Sisodia had alleged on Tuesday that the Centre hadn’t asked Delhi government whether there had been any death due to lack of oxygen.

CET or not, she has her eyes set for the upcoming competitive test two years hence. An ICSE topper, she scored 99.8% and went on to join a high school which offered an integrated programme that would prepare her for Class XII and for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). She is not the only one. High school principals have never before had such a robust admission season. Experts say the competition may be eased for the science stream, which traditionally only sees students diversifying after Class XII into courses such as engineering and health sciences; several candidates, said principals, have already opted for the high school-integrated programme. The rush may be the most for commerce colleges, as students for humanities may also continue in high schools and opt for top private universities and later fly abroad. “Students of our member schools were so unsure of junior college admissions that many have signed up for professional courses that are a combination of diploma and degree. The cream of our students has already made their next academic move, and in most places the first term will soon come to a close,” said Kavita Agarwal, president of MISA (Mumbai International Schools’ Association). “Close to 70% students are already enrolled in some institute, either a high school or a professional programme,” said Agarwal. Over the years, the popularity of Mumbai’s junior colleges has waned. As Avnita Bir, principal director of R N Podar School, said, “In Mumbai, there was a kind of conditioning that everyone joins a junior college after school. But as more schools started offering Class XI and XII, students started seeing merit in that arrangement too. This year was different though. Not only were there those who would anyway sign up at a high school, but also those who did not want to take the CET.” The rush may be the most for commerce. A few years ago, said a college head, spots in the first merit lists were cornered by students from other boards. “This year, that will not be the case for science. Commerce will be hugely in demand. Humanities have interesting subjects at the high school level too. But one must also note that overall the total number of students who have cleared Class X has also gone up,” said Sunil Mantri, director of Universal Group, which has several schools and colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fyjc-comm-to-see-rush-many-in-arts-science-stay-in-schools/articleshow/85257006.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The students questioned that when the state government is willing to give an opportunity to those who are not satisfied with the marks awarded to appear for exams, why can’t the same be extended to fee defaulters as well. “If the state is going to conduct exams, they should consider our request as well. We should be given opportunity to appear for exam on humanitarian grounds,” reasoned one student. At the time of announcement of results, state education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy said that students who are not satisfied with their intermediate marks will be given an opportunity to appear for exams as and when the conditions are conducive to hold examinations. This year, the Telangana government, which cancelled intermediate examinations in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases in the state, had declared all students as passed and awarded marks based on their intermediate first-year marks. A total of 4,51,585 candidates have paid the examination fee and have been declared as passed in the inter second-year results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/defaulters-should-get-chance-to-take-exams/articleshow/85256685.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Specialists in sickbay as pandemic hits practice||HYDERABAD: The pandemic has taken a toll on super-speciality doctors. While general physicians, pulmonologists and critical care specialists have had little time to breathe, other super specialists found their demand hit rock bottom as the Covid crisis shot through the roof. Consequently, many super-speciality doctors, except those involved in Covid care, found themselves struck off the rolls in corporate hospitals and being designated ‘Free for service (FFS)’ — free to work in multiple hospitals and earn based on number of patients. The impact on these doctors continues to linger even as the situation looks like slowly getting back to normal. Job insecurity was one thing that didn’t ail corporate doctors, but they are showing all symptoms of it now. “Many sought-after doctors have now been given FFS. Some don’t even have a chamber of their own now. Although they are free to work at multiple places, most chose not to go as they are hoping for things to turn for the better. Also, doctors working in corporate hospitals are not used to marketing themselves. The low requirement for other super-speciality doctors has left a sense of uncertainty,” said a doctor of a corporate hospital in Jubilee hills. While the situation is gradually improving, several FFS doctors, especially the ones drawing high paychecks, are still not back on the rolls. “Cardiology, cardiac surgery, orthopaedic and nephrology are among the worst affected. Also, due to shortage of beds, hospitals were forced to add Covid beds. At that time many hospitals could not sustain those on fixed and high salaries. Though we can say that 80-85% of the doctors on FFS are back on the rolls, some specialities might still be affected,” said Dr Bhaskar Rao, president, Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Association. The fear of third wave weighs heavily on these super specialists as any up-tick in Covid may hit them too if hospitals find their profits dwindling. “The impact of any third wave will be hard on super-speciality doctors. We had to switch seven of our super specialists to FFS and they are still not on rolls. For a mid-sized hospital like us, waiting and watching is essential,” said a director of a member hospital of Telangana Network Hospitals Association (TANHA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/specialists-in-sickbay-as-pandemic-hits-practice/articleshow/85256097.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Highly paid during peak-Covid, nurses now back to square one||Hyderabad: With majority of the work in hospitals revolving around treatment of Covid-19, nurses and and Class-III employees — ward boys, lab technicians etc — were in high demand. While one one hand, salaries of super speciality doctors took a hit, nurses and Class-III employees’ pay saw a three-fold increase. However, with cases now tapering off, such salaries are now being rolled back to pre-pandemic levels. Salaries of nurses which shot up from around Rs 12,000-Rs 15,000 to Rs 60,000 are now back to what they were before the pandemic-induced demand. “Hospitals also had to provide accommodation, food and other facilities to many of these employees as they were facing discrimination at rented apartments. In some cases, they did not have a separate room to themselves for maintaining isolation at home,” informed Telangana Aarogyasri Network Hospitals’ Association (TANHA) president, Dr V Rakesh. Dr Rakesh said that given the crucial duties of such employees, all their needs such as pick-up & drop facilities, insurance cover among others, had to be met. “Hospitals spent huge amounts in addition to increasing their salaries as there was a lot of poaching going on,” the TANHA president added. However, with the situation now changing, most nurses and Class-III employees find themselves back on square one. “During the peak of the pandemic, hospitals were desperate to hire nurses as they were the ones who did the actual management of patients. Doctors would visit once a day or sometimes not at all but we were there day and night,” said Maheswari B, a nurse who has since left the profession. The former nurse informed that high exposure to the virus was the reason many were leaving the profession and that resulted in higher salaries. “At that point in time, each nurse had at least two offers from different hospitals,” Maheshwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/highly-paid-during-peak-covid-nurses-now-back-to-square-one/articleshow/85256206.cms||---

A division bench of the apex court comprising Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Hrikesh Roy in their order converted the interim bail granted to Nowhera Sheikh on January 19, 2021 as absolute after hearing the special leave petition (SLP). During the SLP hearing, additional solicitor general (ASG) Surya Prakash V Raju, informed court that he will coordinate with state authorities and private respondents to see if a workable arrangement can be made to look into interests of investors in order to pay back the maximum amount to a feasible extent. The division bench directed state authorities to coordinate with the ASG. The SC also expressed displeasure that for a period of over two years, the FSL report is still stated as not available. The court directed the ASG to take up this matter with the concerned laboratory to get an input as to why the report has not been sent yet. In December 2019, the SC granted interim bail to Nowhera Sheikh and directed her to comply with all conditions laid by court. The court gave her six weeks’ time, ordered her to clear liabilities of all complainants/investors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nowhera-secures-bail-from-apex-court/articleshow/85256252.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Online still rules in Covid times, offline class gets poor response||BHOPAL: Poor attendance continued in schools on Wednesday. Many of the students who are attending classes are demotivated to continue offline campus studies, saying that it is proving difficult for them to focus on both online and offline classes. Majority of the schools are now focusing on online classes due to the poor attendance of the students. After opening the school campuses on July 26, it was expected that students would turn up in large numbers. However, the situation remained grim as the majority of the students have opted for online academics. Students attending classes said that they have found it better to attend online classes. “I find very few students in my class. There is no interest in attending such classes. My friends have been attending online classes and I have also stopped going to school as I found online classes are enough to complete my school academics,” said a student Rohit Upadhyay, student of a private school. Students also felt that school classes are not regular due to which they are facing trouble. “Attending classes once in a week is nothing but a waste of time as I have to depend on online classes for the rest of the days. Attending classes in such a manner is just not worth it. I have stopped attending classes,” said Vivek Gurjar, a student of a private school. Attendance of students is higher in government schools. However, students felt that more students will come to attend classes when they are for all weekdays. “There is no consistency. We can not focus in classes that are held just once a week,” said a student Hari Kishan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/online-still-rules-in-covid-times-offline-class-gets-poor-response/articleshow/85254594.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana resumes administering first dose of Covid vaccine; focus on populated areas||HYDERABAD: After a month, health department on Wednesday resumed administering the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to citizens. For providing the vaccine, the state government has acquired 10 lakh doses. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) will conduct a special seven-day push for a vaccine drive at malls and slums. Due to vaccine shortage from the Centre and nearly 41 lakh people in need of a second dose of vaccine by August-end, the health department had stopped giving first doses in 21 districts and GHMC in July. “We now have 10 lakh doses available, and we want to inoculate as many as possible in the next few days,” a top official said. As previously reported by TOI, the health department has devised a plan to vaccinate people in congested locations, particularly in GHMC limits. Around 140 teams have been trained to go to slums and find persons who had not taken the first dose. The health department would deploy mobile vans in locations such as malls, parking lots, and markets. The health department made this round of immunisation more accessible to the public as they need not book vaccine slots in advance. Eligible people could simply walk to the nearest vaccination centre with their Aadhaar card and get the shot. Officials have been concentrating in GHMC area, where 55 lakh people were eligible for the vaccine. Nearly 15 lakh people had received both doses, while 32 lakh received only the first. Almost nine lakh people did not receive first dose as well. In Greater Hyderabad, 84% eligible population had been vaccinated, but many districts have not even vaccinated 50% of eligible the population. Fearing a fresh outbreak in Khammam and Karimnagar, more doses were being sent to these districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-resumes-vax-1st-dose-focus-on-populated-areas/articleshow/85256483.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Institutes forcing us to repeat over fee due, claim 2nd-year Inter students||HYDERABAD: Students from several junior colleges have claimed that their institutes did not even accept the examination fee, which resulted in them failing intermediate exams after they failed to clear the fees for the academic year. The allegations come close on the heels of similar developments where parents of students had claimed that schools had awarded lower marks to their wards due to a failure to clear dues. Students said that some of them were failed and were asked to retake admission in the same year as they failed to clear intermediate college fees. “Due to the lockdown, I could not pay the college fee. When I went to pay the examination fee, management said that they will take the fee only if I clear at least 50% of the college fee,” said a second-year intermediate student, who was failed as the management did not send her details to the intermediate board. The student said that she is depressed about the fact that she will have to repeat a year. “I requested the principal to accept examination fee and that I will clear dues before taking marks memo and transfer certificate, but my request was not considered,” the student added, and said that many of her batch mates were also forced to take readmission by the management. At least two private colleges in the city are said to have held back several students over fee dues. While students of Sarojini Naidu Vanita Maha Vidyalaya, Nampally claimed that the examination fee of at least 50 students was not accepted, students of another junior college in Secunderabad said that names of 61 inter second-year students were not sent to the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education resulting in their failure in examinations. Some of the students even wrote to inter board officials but received no respite. “I paid the examination fee in the office, but the same was returned citing fee dues. On the last day, they asked us to clear the fee dues and pay the examination fee to register our names for the board exams. We couldn’t arrange the money on such short notice,” another student said. Sarojini Naidu Vanita Maha Vidyalaya principal Shobana D said that the management is not to be blamed as they had given several intimations to students, asking them to clear the exam fee. “We have given students intimation multiple times, but they did not come to college and pay exam fees,” Shobana told TOI. Meanwhile, an intermediate board official questioned as to why students waited until the government declared all students as passed and announced results to raise the issue and alleged that they might just want to take advantage of the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/institutes-forcing-us-to-repeat-over-fee-due-claim-2nd-yr-inter-students/articleshow/85256647.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation has just received the genome sequencing report of a swab sample collected from the 62-year-old woman. It is the first confirmed case of Delta-plus variant in Kolhapur district. The woman had tested Covid positive on May 28. Thereafter, random swab samples were sent to check for the variants of the Covid virus. In most samples, the variant identified was Delta. The Delta-plus variant is a mutation of the Delta variant. KMC’s chief administrator Kadambari Balkawade said, “We have received the report that says that the woman was infected with ‘Delta-plus’ variant. We had traced her close contacts out of which three had tested positive. All have completely recovered from Covid infection.” It is unclear whether the three close contacts, who tested positive were infected by ‘Delta Plus’ or not. After arrival of the report on Sunday night, the health authorities have asked ground staff to carry out tracing and testing of the residents from the locality. According to the health officials, the woman had taken both doses of Covid vaccines. She was asymptomatic and was allowed home isolation. The health authorities claim that the vaccines may have helped her recover fast and stop further complications due to the infection. The proportion of the people getting infected despite being fully vaccinated is high in Kolhapur district. Recently, state health minister had asked authorities to prepare database of such people. He had said that the proportion of such Covid patients is 2% to 4%. The authorities had suspected presence of ‘Delta Plus’ variant in Kolhapur district, which remained at the top among the districts for several weeks with highest positivity despite highest vaccination coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/1st-detected-delta-patient-in-kolhapur-recovered-at-home/articleshow/85249943.cms||Abhijeet Patil

The gas victims hospital doctors performed the laproscopic surgery who had a large pseudocyst of pancreas, according to a press release. BMHRC, department of gastrosurgery, assistant professor, Dr Pramod Verma said, “The patient was complaining of abdominal pain, vomiting, loss of appetite among other symptoms for more than three months. A CT scan was performed, in which a 20-centimeter large pseudocyst was found in the Pancreas.” To remove the pseudocyst, surgery was the only option. In many hospitals, this kind of surgery is conducted by making a large incision in the abdomen, which involves a long painful recovery. However, at BMHRC we opted for laparoscopic surgery, which involves small incisions through which a tube, camera and surgical instruments are inserted to carry out the surgery, he added. In the procedure adopted, recovery is quicker and minimally invasive for the patient, who has been discharged, he added. Dr Verma further said that many surgeons still adopt the traditional way of surgery for the pseudocyst of pancreas, as it is quite a complicated task to do such a surgery through laparoscopy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/20cm-cyst-removed-through-keyhole-surgery-at-bmhrc/articleshow/85254636.cms||---

It had proposed an agency for audits for three years and was to spend Rs 3.15 crore on the project. This is the first time BMC is appointing an agency for road safety audits. The Opposition criticised BMC for the cost of the plan. “Road safety auditors may give the best advice, but it will be practically impossible to follow the advice and implement the changes. BMC must not spend so much money on auditors. This will again end up like the appointment of auditors for road work, where auditors were themselves involved in a road scam. BMC should conduct a pilot project for few roads and then appoint a citywide agency,” said Congress corporator Asif Zakaria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-puts-off-road-safety-audit-plan/articleshow/85257057.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: 1,400 accidents till July, bad roads not the cause, say police||BHOPAL: A large number of road accidents take place due to bad roads especially in monsoon. However, everybody seems to know this as a fact except Bhopal police. Reason? If cops state bad roads as the cause for an accident, they will have to register a case against the road construction agency concerned. This is why cops avoid holding bad roads responsible for causing the accidents. Around 1415 road accidents took place in the city till July 31 this year in which 1206 people were injured and 135 people died. However, not a single FIR was registered against any road construction agency or contractors concerned. If any accident happens due to bad roads, cops wait for somebody to file a complaint. Most of the people are unaware that if any accident happens due to a bad road, they can file a complaint. They hold themselves responsible if their vehicle bumps into a pothole and an accident takes place. In one such example, 25-year-old Prajwal Sharma, a resident of BDA Colony in Salaiya, met with an accident while he was returning home from office on his bike on February 15. His bike skidded due to debris of soil and gravel spread on the road due to ongoing construction work of a sewage line and he sustained severe injuries. He was rushed to hospital where he died while undergoing treatment the next day. After the incident Prajwal’s father filed a complaint with Misrod police against the errant construction agency working on contract for Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC). However, instead of enquiring about the contractor from BMC, the investigation officer wrote a letter to BDA seeking details of the contractor. BDA replied to police that they were not conducting any construction work at the spot and it was being done by BMC. After receiving the reply from BDA, Misrod police sent a letter to BMC commissioner around July 5, seeking details of the construction work contractor. When no reply was received even after a month, two days ago police have again written a letter again to BMC commissioner seeking the same information. Investigating officer in the case ASI Shivbabu Tripathi said that police had sought information from BDA and now from BMC, which is pending. The process got delayed due to Corona curfew. Prajwal’s accident is not the only one, many such accidents take place in the city. Many areas, especially Kolar, Shahpura, Ratibad, and many in Old City, have poor roads particularly in monsoon. And the situation worsens due to poor lighting arrangements. Police officers admit that roads in the city are in bad shape but they do not mention it as a cause when road accidents happen. Shashank Trivedi, a resident of Fine Avenue Colony in Kolar, said that the condition of roads in the Kolar area is pathetic, especially the interior roads connecting the residential colonies. Several funny messages depicting the roads in Bhopal especially Kolar area are being shared over social media platforms but the agencies responsible for constructing and maintaining the roads do not take cognizance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bad-roads-caused-1-4k-accidents-but-not-one-registered-with-cops/articleshow/85254678.cms||Sudeept Mishra

---||Agra||No jabs taken, but over 50 in UP village get vaccine certificates||AGRA: At least 50 residents in UP’s Mainpuri were issued Covid vaccination certificates without being administered the shot. The certificates were allegedly distributed by health department workers who wanted to “meet their vaccination targets”. Hard copies of the certificates were given to 50 people in Lapgava village in Ghiror block during a government vaccination camp on June 24. But nobody was vaccinated that day, residents have alleged. Dileep Kumar, pradhan of Lapgava — which has a population of 800 — said that at least 50 residents had attended the vaccination camp in the village after Asha workers had gathered people but nobody was administered the shot. “I complained about this incident to the authorities several times and we even tweeted about it, but our complaints were not heard,” he said. One of the residents who received the certificate, Sandeep (who only uses his first name), told TOI that people were told they would be given the vaccine later. “The health workers said there was a vaccine shortage and we would get the shots later. But it has been more than a month and we still haven’t got our dose,” he said. Another resident Madhuri Devi said whenever people brought up the matter with Asha workers, they were assured that they would get their vaccination soon. “The workers had given us certificates and said that they have to complete their targets,” she said. Authorities, however, dismissed the allegations. “Over 4 lakh people have been vaccinated in the district till date. It is hard to believe that certificates were issued to some people without administering vaccines. Still, we will look into the matter,” said Mainpuri district magistrate Mahendra Bahadur Singh. Chief medical officer (CMO) Prempal Singh added that he was unaware of this incident but would inquire into it. “Strict action will be taken against those found guilty,” he said. In June, a man in Noida received a Covid vaccination certificate without taking the vaccine. Uttar Pradesh has administered a total of over 5.5 crore doses of the Covid vaccine since the start of its inoculation campaign, according to data available on CoWin portal. UP aims to administer a total of 10 crore doses by August 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-jabs-taken-but-over-50-in-up-village-get-vax-certificates/articleshow/85246619.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Kochi||Bank scam: 16 co-op dept officials suspended||Thiruvananthapuram: State government on Wednesday suspended 16 officials of the state cooperation department for lapses in connection with the Karuvannur Co-operative Bank scam. The action is based on the interim probe report submitted by a high-level committee that is probing the irregularities worth crores of rupees reported in the bank in Thrissur district. The nine-member committee, appointed on July 24, submitted its interim report to the government on August 10. The panel has been mandated to conduct a thorough probe into the large-scale and prolonged financial irregularities in the bank. It was also asked to give recommendations to fix responsibilities on cooperation department officials who failed to discharge their duty of checking the fraud. Karuvannur Cooperative Bank is under the administrative jurisdiction of Thrissur joint registrar. Its audit control is vested with the Thrissur joint registrar (audit). As per the rules, unit inspector, assistant registrar (general) and joint registrar (general) are supposed to carry out three detailed inspection and three collateral inspection at the bank. However, the expert committee has reported that no effective inspections were carried out. Moreover, no emergency actions were taken on the lapses reported in the audit reports. Though a concurrent auditor post was sanctioned for Karuvannur Cooperative Bank, no special reports were submitted regarding the irregularities. Moreover, the mandatory test auditing was also not conducted before approving the audit report of the bank. The report has pointed out several administrative and audit lapses in the bank since 2014-15. In this context, cooperation department officials concerned, who had been serving the audit and general wings since 2014-15, have been suspended from government service with immediate effect.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Commuting a nightmare as one lane of Sarita Vihar underpass shut down||NEW DELHI: For commuters coming from Mathura Road and destined towards Okhla in south Delhi, travelling through the Sarita Vihar underpass has become nothing short of a nightmare due to waterlogging and poor condition of the road. This has led to one lane of this important traffic point being closed for repairs. Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which had built the underpass, is carrying out repair work and also trying to get the accumulated rainwater out of the underpass. The arterial stretch has become a chokepoint, ending in extremely slow-moving traffic, particularly during peak hours. The bad news is that the nightmare for commuters going towards Okhla and Ma Anandmayee Marg would continue for at least a week. People have been urged not to use the stretch to travel towards Okhla or Tughlaqabad. “The maintenance work of the cross drain is on. Some waterlogging was observed on August 9 and it was cleared the same day. Currently, there is no waterlogging. Since maintenance work is going on, we have closed one lane in coordination with traffic police for the safety of the public. The work is likely to be completed within a week,” a senior DDA official said. A major infrastructure project constructed by DDA and Indian Railways, the Rs 260 crore Sarita Vihar underpass was opened in 2015 after missing several deadlines. However, it has been unable to serve to its full potential. The kilometre-long underpass connects Noida with Okhla, thereby reducing commuting time between Noida, Sarita Vihar, Okhla and other nearby areas. The condition of the road in the underpass has never been very good and waterlogging has been a perennial problem since it was opened to the public. DDA has been unable to find a permanent solution to waterlogging, which is also a reason for the road surface getting damaged frequently. Though the underpass has cut down the distance between Noida and Okhla from 9km to just 1km, and travelling time from 45 minutes to 10 minutes, traffic problems persist in the entire area due to lack of holistic planning. As one travels further south towards Kalkaji and Govindpuri, the road keeps getting narrower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/commuting-a-nightmare-as-one-lane-of-sarita-vihar-underpass-shut-down/articleshow/85254768.cms||---

The vaccine is a must for pregnant women and it offers them protection against Covid, which is essential during the current pandemic. The lactating women can continue breastfeeding even after vaccination and should not harbour any misconceptions in their mind,” she said. As a part of the dedicated drive, pregnant and lactating women have been given vaccine doses on a priority basis at every state-run vaccination site.Meanwhile, the shortage of vaccine doses observed within municipal limits since August 7, continued till Wednesday with the reduced number of sites carrying out vaccination.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 98% hike in Quarter 1 petrol VAT revenue||BHOPAL: Revenue earned by the government in the form of VAT on petrol in the first quarter of this financial year is 98.92 per cent more than last year's first quarter. Rise in VAT collection on petrol was more than the collective rise of diesel and petrol, which is 51.68 per cent and 40.54 per cent more respectively this year in comparison to last year’s first quarter. In reply to a question in the state assembly on Tuesday, Finance Minister Jagdish Devda said, in 2020-21 till June, VAT of Rs 519.68 crore was collected on petrol, Rs 920.00 crore on diesel and Rs 107.93 was collected as VAT from liquor. In 2021-22 till June this year, Rs 1033.76 crore was earned as VAT from petrol, Rs 1395.46 crore from diesel and Rs 151.68 crore from liquor. The yearly increase from last year to this year for the period was 98.92 per cent on petrol, 51.68 per cent on diesel and 40.54 per cent on liquor. Finance minister also ruled out any reduction in tax, pointing that the state government fixes the rates considering its financial needs to carry out development. The rise in VAT collection on petrol is many times more when compared to the financial year 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. The increase in per cent in VAT collection for the whole year in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20 was 22.39 per cent on petrol, 15.88 per cent on diesel and 26.14 per cent on liquor. Overall, the yearly government revenue on petrol, diesel and liquor increased in the last two years despite pandemic and lockdowns to control the spread of coronavirus. The opposition wanted to corner the government for not giving respite to common man from increased price rises. The government countered it pointing that tax on petrol was increased from 28 per cent to 33 per cent when Kamal Nath led congress government was in power and the same is prevailing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/state-earns-98-more-vat-on-petrol-q/q/articleshow/85254757.cms||Ankur Sirothia
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Maratha issue casts shadow on bill about OBCs||NEW DELHI: Maharashtra politics and Maratha reservation cast a shadow on the Parliament discussion on the 127th constitution amendment bill, as it put the politically fraught demand for removal of 50% cap on reservations in the national spotlight and forced political parties to take a stand. Maharashtra ruling allies Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress reached out to various parties ahead of the debate, with the request that they put the 50% cap in their talking points. A large majority of the regional outfits would not have needed much of an invitation as they saw it from the lens of the large OBC vote base even if they realised that the prime motivation of the Maharashtra allies was the vexed Maratha reservation which appears impossible with the quota ceiling. “We are very happy with what we have managed,” a key proponent of the campaign said. Though the 50% cap has been a source of heartburn among the Mandalite outfits, their anger has spilt out after the enactment of the 10% EWS quota (upper castes), which has already taken the total quota quantum beyond the halfway mark. The reference to EWS is finding mention in most legal arguments for enhanced OBC quotas. While the Maratha aggression was the catalyst for the consensus, the issue appeared to expose the caste faultlines within Maharashtra. The subtext of the Lok Sabha debate was not lost on the political class as Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress fielded Marathas to speak while the BJP chose an OBC, Pritam Munde, to lead the charge. Munde said the issue of the 50% cap would come later but asked why the three allies are focusing on one community, the Marathas, though the bill under discussion was about OBCs. She said it was for the ruling allies to explain the arguments they presented in the Supreme Court and why they failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-maratha-issue-casts-shadow-on-bill-about-obcs/articleshow/85257155.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik: Probe panel holds two contractors responsible for NMC hospital oxygen leak||NASHIK: The state government-appointed probe panel has held two contractors responsible for the medical oxygen tank leak at the Nashik Municipal Corporation-managed Dr Zakir Hussain Hospital on April 21. Twenty-two Covid-19 patients had died due to disruptions in oxygen supply following the leak. After receiving the report, the NMC has imposed a cumulative penalty of Rs 24 lakh on the two contractors. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said, “The two contractors have been collectively penalized for Rs 24 lakh as they were found short of ensuring placement of technical teams at the hospital and delivering workable cylinders on time. Their responses to the notices sent by the corporation were found to be unsatisfactory.” On that day, 22 critically-ill Covid-19 patients, including 10 women aged between 33 and 75 years, died due to oxygen supply disruptions for over an hour due to a leak in the oxygen tank at the time refilling. The hospital had 131 patients on oxygen support and 15 on ventilator support at the time. Jadhav said the seven-member team headed by divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game carried out the enquiry and submitted a report to the state government. The state government, in turn, sent it to the NMC for further action. “The report found a contractor to be responsible for not providing technical manpower at the time of refilling of the tank and also its failure to reach the site within 24 hours of the incident,” commissioner said. Accordingly, the NMC issued a notice to the contractor seeking its reply. “We received the reply but it was unsatisfactory. Hence, we have issued the penalty of Rs 22 lakh on the company,” Jadhav added. Similarly, another contractor has been penalized Rs 2 lakh for allegedly not providing three jumbo cylinders on time as replacement for the three cylinders that were not functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/probe-panel-holds-2-contractors-responsible-for-nmc-hosp-o2-leak/articleshow/85249963.cms||---
---||Chennai||Farmers lose out as state govt centres turn exploitation hubs||The direct procurement centres (DPCs) for paddy have turned out to be the biggest hub of exploitation of farmers. Pandemic or not, the people manning the centres make a killing, charging `1 per kg of paddy from farmers at the time of procurement. A back of the envelope calculation shows they have looted close to `400 crore from farmers during the current kharif marketing season (KMS) that began on October 1, 2020. By the time the season ends on September 30 this year, another `30 crore could get added to their kitty, say farmers.The DPCs for paddy have a nearly four-decade-long association with the farmers in Tamil Nadu, especially those in the Cauvery delta, considered TN’s granary. It was started in 1973. But the issues surrounding these centres prompt farmers to keep themselves away from the DPCs. For every bag of paddy weighing 40.6kg, farmers have to pay the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) staff manning DPCs `40 as commission. It is not possible to stay away from DPCs because the alternative is to deal with avaricious traders who will drop prices once they realise that farmers do not go to DPCs.Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation officials say the procurement of paddy during the ongoing season has surpassed the procurement in 2019-2020.Adequate rainfall at the right time helped farmers in abundant measure. It helped them increase the area of cultivation and productivity as well.Minister for food and civil supplies, R Sakkarapani told TOI the procurement of paddy during the current KMS had touched 40 lakh tonnes against a target of 43 lakh tonnes. The high court had expressed its displeasure over the commission business at DPCs while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate AP Suryaprakasam. Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice B Pugalendhi of Madurai bench of the Madras high court raised the query as to why the government was not able to put an end to the illegal practice to save the hapless farmers. Court censures have not worked much. Corruption is so deep-rooted in the system that the same DPC staff continue. Their refrain is that they are just commission agents. Much of the money goes to higher-ups, which include officials and politicians, say farmers. Sakkarapani, while admitting that farmers were being fleeced, said lower-rung staff like bill clerks, watchmen and helpers are to be blamed. The loot is not shared by higher-ups, he claimed.Sakkarapani said, "As soon as I took charge, I conducted review meetings and insisted that the practice of collecting `40 per bag of paddy from the farmers should end. The chief minister also assured farmers to put an end to the menace at the earliest." The minister said a committee has been formed under the leadership of TNCSC joint managing director M S Sangeetha to put an end to all malpractices at DPCs.District secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers’ Protection Association S Vimalanathan said, "It is not just bribe. It is day-light robbery. Such fleecing is killing debt-ridden farmers. The practice continues irrespective of the party in power in the state."Going by TNCSC data put up on its website, the quantity of the paddy procured through 2,113 DPCs across the state during 2019-2020 KMS till July 31, 2020 was 28.1 lakh tonnes as against a target of 32 lakh tonnes. KMS comprises samba, kuruvai and summer crop season. "They force us to pay Re1 per kg of paddy. Given the quantity of procurement, one can figure out that the amount they loot is huge. Or there is that much shortfall in farmers’ revenue," says Vimalanathan. Since fund for paddy procurement is provided by the Union government, CBI should take suo-motu cognisance of the matter and initiate investigation, he said. Several raids by the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption have not helped..Farmers in the delta region have protected and lodged complaints with the collector and senior regional manager of TNCSC in Thanjavur, where the issue crops up at regular intervals. Until the electronic clearing system was introduced in 2016, the bribe was taken while clearing bills, but since the procurement price is now directly credited in the accounts of the farmers, they are forced to pay commission at the time of procurement, much before they see the money in their accounts.State spokesman of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam N Veerasekaran, said the incentive by the state in addition to the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the Union government is going to the pockets of officials.Farmers suggest the DVAC conduct frequent searches and raids at the DPCs, at least during the peak seasons of paddy harvest, to instill fear among the corrupt officials.M V Kannan of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam said farmers are losing money even in weighment. Instead of maintaining a weight of 40.6 per bag (including the weight of gunny bag), DPC staff insist that each bag should weigh 42kg to 43kg. The farmers have no say in such things, said Kannan. Kalyanasundaram, a farmer from Vaathalai village in Peravurani had circulated an audio clip highlighting the fraudulent practices in weighment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/farmers-lose-out-as-state-govt-centres-turn-exploitation-hubs/articleshow/85246670.cms||Gokul Rajendran

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Lone ranger frees 1,250 hectares encroached forest land||SANJELI (DAHOD): In the forest of the Baria division, trees and wildlife sleep at night knowing Rakesh Vankar is out there to protect them. Meet the 36-year-old forest officer (RFO) at Sanjeli range, an indomitable spirit that keeps the pristine forest ‘intruder-free’. Vankar mission is to ensure that forests and its land under his jurisdiction stay clean, but it has its perils too. During his mammoth tasks, Vankar survived an assault as locals attempted to run him over with a tractor in 2019. “It was a difficult task, but we were determined,” the ranger told TOI. Vankar is credited as the only individual ranger in the state, who restored a whopping nearly 1,300 hectares back to the forest by fighting encroachers in the past two-and-a-half-years. The land parcel is equivalent to half the area of Vansda National Park (VNP). What the maize crops had covered down the years at Velpur village were restored to its natural flora like teak, coral swirl and even wildlife including leopards, jackals, hyena, porcupines and the blue bulls reclaimed their habitat after it became a safe wildlife corridor. “When I joined duty in March 2019 at Sanjeli I found that prime forest land was being encroached and I took it as my mission to remove encroachments. Our team would go into the field at 6am and return at midnight every single day. We would verify land rights and if the land is found to be encroached, we would immediately work to set it free,” said Vankar, who, in fact had unearthed a major scam of forging forest rights act documents (Sanad) to claim their rights. “I was suspicious about the authenticity of some documents and we checked these with our division office where such claim rights were approved. But none was passed and we found 26 papers to be forged. In many cases, they would try to fox us saying that they have filed claims for the land, but on verification would find it to be false. This exercise helped restore forest land under protection,” Vankar said. “But with forest regeneration, villagers are getting fodder from the grassland and are happy that forest cover has increased in their surroundings,” said the forester, whose happiness reflected in his eyes when he showed the flora and fauna reclaiming its lost land in the village fringes. Talking to TOI, deputy conservator of forests, Baria division, R M Parmar said, “Range Forest Officer Rakesh Vankar, who took great pains to verify land records and remove precious forest lands from encroachers, has done remarkable work in protecting forests and wildlife. We appreciate his efforts.” He further added that a conservative estimate suggests that Vankar was instrumental in removing encroachments from nearly 1,300 hectare forest land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/lone-ranger-frees-1250ha-encroached-forest-land/articleshow/85252234.cms||Vijaysinh Parmar

With skewed sex ratio of 899 girls per 1000 boys, the girl child is still not welcomed in this backward region of Bundelkhand in MP. Besides abandoning the girl child, many men also leave their wives for giving birth to girls. Passengers waiting for their buses at Naugaon bus stand were surprised to see a polythene packet containing a baby.

Jeetendra Dhaneshwar, nodal officer of the Covid wing at Bytco hospital, said, “We have so far sent around 25 nurses for training. The medical requirement of children are different from that of adults. Children are given medicines as per their weight. There are various other things like handling them with care, finding their veins properly to administer injections, among others. For all such purposes, the nurses are being trained for 15 days in the paediatric ward of the non-covid wing of the hospital.”Medical officials said the time was perfect to train the nurses since admissions in Covid wing of the hospital is currently very less. The Covid wing is an 800-bed hospital attached to Bytco Hospital and during the second wave the hospital was flooded with patients. Currently, there are no children admitted in the hospital, though 23 kids were hospitalized for treatment in July.

---||Chennai||Forest dept collects jumbo data to check man-animal conflict||Realising that the solution to the unabated man-animal conflict can be found only if there is complete data on animals with experts, a study has been commissioned in Tamil Nadu on landscape-level management of the Asian elephants.The Union forest and environment ministry has commissioned the study that will be undertaken through individual-level monitoring in human dominated landscapes and collaring select individual elephants. At least six elephants in the Hosur-Dharmapuri landscape, including the Cauvery North Wildlife Sanctuary, have been identified for the ame, according to Union minister for environment, forest and climate change Bhupendar Yadav. This is one of the replies by the minister to a set of questions raised by Vaiko, Rajya Sabha MP in connection with human-elephant conflict.The reply by the minister revealed that 87 elephants died in the country during 2020-21 (upto December 2020) while 359 human deaths due to elephant conflict were reported during the same period.Another reply by the minister mentions that critical elephant habitats are notified as elephant reserves for focus and synergy in elephant conservation and to reduce conflict. So far 30 elephant reserves have been established in 14 major elephant states, including Tamil Nadu. Shekar Kumar Niraj, principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden, told TOI, "The study in Tamil Nadu was mooted in 2020 in Coimbatore region. But due to the pandemic the study did not see much progress".The study involves the dynamic and growth of elephants in different landscapes involving multiple objects. "Once the study is over in the Coimbatore region, the same will be extended to other regions in Tamil Nadu, where elephant populations are found", said Niraj. He further said, "We are looking at new perspectives to learn about the management of elephants in human habitats. Different scientific measures are being adopted so that unnecessary capture of elephants can be avoided".As a first step to release elephants in captivity, the case of elephant Rivaldo is significant and could help in understanding the freeing of more elephants in captivity. "We are ensuring the safety of the jumbo as well the villagers there in Vazhaithottam and Mavanallah by taking all precautionary measures", said Niraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/forest-dept-collects-jumbo-data-to-check-man-animal-conflict/articleshow/85246764.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan

They will be allowed to board local trains from August 15, which will allow them freedom from a tiresome commute aboard crowded buses and expensive taxi-auto rides. On Wednesday, fully vaccinated people began to be issued monthly train passes at 358 help desks at 113 railway stations. Until 6 pm, Central Railway had sold 16,800 passes and Western Railway 6,450. The BMC approved vaccination certificates of 17,758 passengers. Mayor Kishori Pednekar and AMC (health) Suresh Kakani inspected the process. “This offline process of issuing passes will continue on all seven days of the week. So citizens need not rush to railway stations,” said civic chief Iqbal Chahal. Contrary to expectations, crowds were sparse and queues moved briskly. TOI reporters at Bandra, Dadar, Malad and CSMT witnessed the process move smoothly without delay. This signalled the efficiency of the counter staff but also implied that only a small percentage of Mumbaikars have taken both doses of the vaccine. Helpdesks to get Mumbaikars back on track as local train travel can begin from August 15 Railway officials said many passengers already own season tickets, either because they are genuine essential category workers -- or continue to use passes procured by preparing fake identity cards as essential workers. A WR official said, “The numbers are less than expected. It is probably because many people have already bought passes using fake I-cards.” A CR officer said, “Also, corporates have not yet firmed up plans to recall staff. They may be adopting a wait and watch policy because the state plans to review the train travel policy after a month.” Of course, the fact remains a substantial number of fully vaccinated people are senior citizens and those above 45, plus healthcare and frontline or healthcare workers. Barely 3% of the 18-44 age-group -- the major part of the workforce -- is fully vaccinated. Passengers who got the pass were thankful for the time and money they will save commuting. Renita Lobo, 30, could barely have believed a day would come when she would long for crush hour. “Train travel is so speedy, while daily road traffic is such a trial. It took me 3 hours to get home by road from CST to Malad on Tuesday. I love my smelly 12-coach train,” she laughed. Dattaram Monde spent 2.5 hours daily travelling from Bhandup to his workplace at Panvel. “It was so tiresome during monsoon, with a long wait at bus stops and bad roads. Wednesday’s registration was smooth. It took 15 minutes to get my vaccination certificate verified and stamped and obtain a pass at Bhandup station,” he said. 1/8In photos: Over 17,000 Mumbaikars get local train passes on Day 1 Previous NextShow Captions<p>Over 17,000 monthly passes for travel by local trains were issued in Mumbai on Wednesday after verification, to those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

---||Kolkata||Colleges in Kolkata amend guidelines to help out UG applicants||KOLKATA: Colleges in Kolkata are constantly updating the information on their UG admission portals, revising the schedule and amending guidelines, to ensure no candidate faces problems during applications. With the entire process being carried out online to avoid visits to campuses in the pandemic year, applicants don’t have the option of approaching officials with queries in case they don’t understand certain steps. So to make things easier, almost all colleges have formed teams, which are monitoring the applications and going through queries mailed by candidates. Scottish Church College has revised its dates so that both students and officials get more time after August 20, the last date for application. Now, the first phase of admission will begin on August 25, instead of September 1. For that, the first provisional merit list will be out on August 22 and first merit list for Phase 1 admission on August 24. “This will give applicants time to check if their names feature on provisional as well as merit lists. Bringing the dates forward will give us more time so that we don’t have to rush through the process,” said a Scottish Church official. Lady Brabourne has also amended guidelines. According to the new rule, students who passed the Plus-II exams between 2016 and 2021 (both years inclusive) from any recognized board in India (ISC, CBSE, any state board or council) ) can apply to UG courses this year. Earlier, only those who passed Plus-II in the last two years were allowed. Last week, the college started accepting scanned copies of downloaded mark sheets after many boards did not deliver hard copies to schools. “We need to be sensitive to the students’ requirements in the pandemic,” said Siuli Sarkar, Lasy Brabourne principal. St Xavier’s College, where the last date of application was August, 10 has announced some important dates. There, the first list will be published on August 23 and admissions will take place between August 24 and 27. The second list will be out on September 3. Several colleges, like Maulana Azad, Goenka, Bethune, Seth Anandaram Jaipuria, Scottish, St Paul’s and New Alipore College, have introduced helplines and email IDs, where students can mail their queries. “These are difficult times. Everything has been uncertain for the students since March 2020. We have started three helplines for admission queries,” said New Alipore College principal Jaydeep Sarangi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-amend-guidelines-to-help-out-ug-applicants/articleshow/85254855.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Viju Abraham is the son of AK Avirah, who was an advocate, and is a resident of Kochi. He had studied law at Government Law College, Ernakulam and had served as a government pleader from 2004 to 2007 and as a senior government pleader from 2011 to 2016. Mohammed Nias hails from Thalassery and studied law at Government Law College, Kozhikode. He is the son of former PSC chairman TM Savankutty. Nias was the counsel for Greater Cochin Development Authority, Calicut University, State Cooperative Union, and Kerala State Rubber Cooperative Ltd. Their elevation was originally recommended by the SC collegium in May 2019, along with that of KK Paul. Though the central government had asked for a reconsideration, the collegium had reiterated its stance in March this year. Paul’s recommendation is still pending with the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/high-court-gets-two-new-judges/articleshow/85254833.cms||---

Examination of Kavya started on Tuesday and is likely to continue on Thursday as well. The in-camera court proceedings started at 11am and ended by 7:30 pm. There were reports that Kavya had turned hostile and gave a different statement before the court. The case had received national attention after Dileep, a prominent actor in the Malayalam film industry, was named the eighth accused in the case. The survivor, a film actor, was abducted and sexually assaulted in a moving vehicle in February 2017. Dileep, who is out on bail, is accused of conspiring to commit the crime. As many as nine accused persons are facing trial, including Dileep. The trial had earlier hit a roadblock following the events of October last year when Kerala high court dismissed a plea seeking to change the judge in the case. The HC held that most contentions raised by the survivor and prosecution for transfer of the case were unsustainable. This was upheld by the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kavya-madhavan-examined/articleshow/85254891.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Beneston: From goalkeeper to striker with I-League champions Gokulam Kerala||Panaji: Goan forward Beneston Barretto has signed a two-year contract with defending I-League champions Gokulam Kerala FC. Beneston caught Kerala’s attention with his performances for Guardian Angel SC in the Goa Professional League last season. The 23-year-old attacker from Verna scored six goals in 11 games. “I am very happy right now. It is a dream move. I must improve more and build on my experience. There are big players at this club, and it is a good opportunity,” said Beneston. Benston had strong belief he will move to a bigger club this season. He trained on the beach during off season and gave trials at Kerala early this month. In practice games, his scoring didn’t stop. He was put to the test to play in midfield and he didn’t disappoint Italian head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese, who was impressed with his versatility. Curiously, Beneston started his career as a goalkeeper, first with Dempo U-14, Salgaocar FC and later Sporting Clube de Goa in the U-18 I-League. He picked up a shoulder injury during his time at Churchill Brothers FC (U-20) and that paved the way for a different role, on the advice of his late father Benjamin. His speed and tactical ability blossomed in Inter-Village football for teams like Pax of Nagoa, Rossman Cruz and Verna SC. Everyone took notice when he played in the First Division for UC Telaulim and Vasco SC coach Eban Misquita provided him the breakthrough in Goa Pro League. After his first season, Benston tried to secure a job in Bahrain but had to return home after his visa expired in three months. Football was his calling. He spent another season at Vasco before playing the last two editions for Guardian Angel. “Every year I have improved. My dream is to play in the ISL and represent our country. But for that, I have to continue my good work this season as well,” said Beneston. It won’t be easy for Beneston with clubs mostly opting for foreign strikers. But his ability to play in the wings gives him an edge. He will have to fill the void left by another Goan winger Vincy Barretto who impressed at Kerala last season and switched allegiance to Kerala Blasters in the Indian Super League. Annese is rebuilding his squad after several key departures and will rely on signings like Beneston to defend their crown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/beneston-from-goalkeeper-to-striker-with-i-league-champions-gokulam-kerala/articleshow/85285135.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Goa||Hope on horizon for 99% of Madgaum bank depositors||Margao: With the Registrar of Cooperative Societies having appointed a liquidator for Madgaum Urban Cooperative Bank Ltd, thus putting into motion liquidation proceedings, hopes of early recovery of their money have been renewed among the depositors and stakeholders of the bank. Registrar of cooperative societies, Arvind Khutkar, on Tuesday, issued an order appointing S V Naik, a retired Goa civil services officer, as a liquidator for the bank. As per the current provisions of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, depositors get benefit of an insurance of up to Rs 5 lakh when the licence of a bank is cancelled and the liquidation process starts. Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, provides insurance cover on bank deposits. Sources said that the bank has more than 56,000 depositors. The insurance cover is expected to benefit 99% of these depositors whose value of deposits is upto Rs 5 lakh. However, this has raised concerns among depositors who have parked their money amounting to above Rs 5 lakh in the bank. Sources said that though 99% of the depositors will get back their money as per the provisions of the DICGC Act, the one percent of depositors left out comprises a significant number. They pointed out that there’s uncertainty over the recovery of their deposits beyond Rs 5 lakh. Chandan Nayak, a BJP functionary and the bank’s shareholder, demanded that the government initiate an inquiry into the “acts of malfeasance” of the bank that has led to the cancellation of its licence by Reserve Bank of India. “The Board of directors of the bank was aware about the precarious and hopeless situation of the bank since 2018. The inaction of the Board and the bank authorities in taking steps to salvage the situation suggests that their motives are suspect. Even as the liquidation proceedings get under way, the registrar of cooperatives should set up a special audit of the bank and take action against the guilty if any instance of misappropriation of funds is detected,” Nayak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hope-on-horizon-for-99-of-madgaum-bank-depositors/articleshow/85254852.cms||---

Accused Mayuri Tailor told the police that two unidentified men barged into her shop at around 6.30am and looted cash at knife-point. However, her claims were busted and the woman admitted of having concocted the crime tale. According to cops, Tailor runs a milk parlour on the ground floor of Darshanam Complex. Her husband contacted the cops on Wednesday morning after she claimed that two men entered her shop. They first sought to buy milk but soon one of them flashed a knife and threatened her. Tailor claimed that the duo fled with Rs 1.5 lakh in cash.Cops already wary of chain snatchers who have been active over the past few days, immediately swung into action. “Tailor had claimed that two men wearing black face masks walked into her shop. We checked the footage of the CCTVs installed at some distance from the shop but didn’t see any such men. We grew suspicious and questioned her further,” said R A Patel, Makarpura police inspector.Tailor, 41, then admitted that she lied. “She had borrowed Rs 1.4 lakh from her friend to send her son for further studies to Singapore. Her friend demanded the money back and so she took Rs 1.37 lakh from the parlour’s collection and repaid the debt on Tuesday. However, her husband wasn’t aware of her loan,” Patel added. Thinking of an excuse about the missing Rs 1.37 lakh from the parlour’s income, Tailor decided to concoct the loot incident. “We have filed a non-cognizable complaint against her for misleading the police,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/womans-cock-and-bull-loot-story-sends-cops-into-a-tizzy/articleshow/85252338.cms||---
---||Kolkata||State schools keen on split board exams||Kolkata: Splitting X and XII board exams into two semesters and teaching bifurcated syllabus were an intelligent way of negotiating the pandemic-year exam challenge, felt city schools affiliated to the state board and council. They welcomed the idea floated by state education minister Bratya Basu, who said on Tuesday that the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education had been asked to send proposals. CBSE and CISCE have already announced that the 2022 board exams will be spilt, to be held in two semesters, one in November (MCQs) and the other in March-April (subjective and objective). The boards have decided to bifurcate the syllabus, lessening the pressure on board-year students, who are trying to cope with online studies. The education department will take a decision, based on the suggestions from the state board and council. “The suggestion is brilliant. This will at least help students write an exam and earn their marks rather than score through formulae. Let’s experiment and see whether we can test the students properly or not. On one hand, we have to keep safety in mind, and on the other, we need to ensure students get to write a board exam,” said Parimal Bhattacharyya, Jadavpur Vidyapith principal. While Nava Nalanda principal Arijit Mitra agreed, he urged the authorities to decide fast because November was barely three months away. “The exams would provide some scope for assessment,” he said. A backup of marks in a semester system was good, felt The BSS School principal Sunita Sen. “But everything will depend on the state policy,” she said. Some principals reminded online teaching-learning had not been uniform across all schools and online studies were yet to take off at many places. “The state should find out whether teachers and students have the tech wherewithal so that the first semester syllabus can be completed,” a principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-schools-keen-on-split-board-exams/articleshow/85254927.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The protest rally to ‘gherao’ chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s residence was addressed by PCC chief Kamal Nath. Senior party leaders, including former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Kantilal Bhuria also joined the protest. As the large crowd of Youth Congress workers marched from the state PCC office to reach Shyamla Hills, they were stopped by layers of police barricading a few metres away from the state Congress headquarters. The agitators started breaking the barricades and a scuffle ensued between them and the uniformed force. To disperse them, cops retaliated with water cannons and also resorted to lathi-charge. Srinivas, Vikrant Bhuria, former minister Jaivardhan Singh and former state Youth Congress president Kunal Choudhary were detained. Addressing the Youth Congress activists before the protest march, former chief minister Nath said, “First, the ruling party decided only on a four-day assembly session and that too was cut short. The assembly session ran for only four hours. The government should remember it cannot stop us from raising public welfare issues.” Nath said the Youth Congress’ protest on the streets is a befitting reply to the government apathy.  Srinivas said, “People are burning in the flames of inflation but the government is giving one shock after another.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nath-rallies-around-youth-cong-netas-to-protest-govt-policies/articleshow/85254906.cms||---

This app encourages participation of farmers using technology. A government resolution was issued on July 30 and IT and field officers from the revenue and agriculture departments of the district have been undergoing training. “This application will be helpful for farmers to understand what benefits can be secured when their crops go to the market,” said collector Vimala R. “Word about this app needs to reach maximum people so that farmers can utilize it,” she added. A demo of the app was presented at the collector’s office on Wednesday. This project by the state government will facilitate planning of the agricultural sector by giving definite statistics about how much area is under which crop. It will also help the agriculture department to provide benefits to account holders for schemes payable for specific crops such as drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation. The survey will also be beneficial to estimate the area under cultivation and yield of paddy, cotton, gram and tur procurement schemes at basic prices. Some important steps have been taken to implement this project across the state. The administration process of this project started on August 1. Publicity training and awareness is under way until August 14. Registration of farmers and information about kharif crops will be uploaded with photos from August 15 to September 15. In the next 15 days, talathis and agricultural assistants at the village level will have to verify 10% of the samples and give final approval through the app. From October 1 onwards, farmers will be able to upload information about rabi crops. Farmers can install this app from playstore on their smartphones. The agriculture department, Tata Trust, revenue department, Maha IT and National Information and Science Centre will work in coordination for this project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/app-to-help-farmers-upload-crop-info/articleshow/85254939.cms||---

GCCI president Ralph De Sousa said the rate of VAT on natural gas in Goa is more than four times that levied in Maharashtra, and double the rate of other states such as Gujarat and Haryana. The sharp difference between the VAT levied in Goa and in the neighbouring states will put Goa’s industrial units at a disadvantage, said GCCI. It has also called for the inclusion of natural gas under the goods and services tax (GST) regime. On June 30, the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) said the use of petcoke and furnace oil would be discontinued from December 31. GSPCB has recommended compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as alternatives, but unlike furnace oil and petcoke, which are taxed under the GST regime, natural gas and CNG are taxed under VAT. “The industry, particularly the manufacturing sector using PNG as a fuel, is primarily affected by this transition. Due to the inclusion under GST, the industry was able to claim the benefit of the amount of GST paid as input tax credit, and thus the GST was cost neutral,” said Sousa. Since there is no VAT credit available on PNG, it would have a cascading effect on the final cost to consumers as well as make the products less competitive against those from other states. Gujarat and Haryana charge 6% VAT on natural gas while Maharashtra levies a rate of 3% on natural gas for industrial use. “The pandemic and the slowdown in the economy have dramatically affected the cost of raw materials in the state. Moreover, the significant VAT component on PNG in Goa will severely impair competitiveness,” said the GCCI president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/reduce-vat-on-natural-gas-from-12-5-to-3-says-gcci/articleshow/85254894.cms||---

The hospital, which has been functioning as a Covid hospital even before it was formally inaugurated, will also be made functional as the full-fledged district hospital soon, he said. Rane made these remarks while speaking at a function held to felicitate Covid warriors of the Margao urban health centre. Margao legislator Digambar Kamat was also present. Rane said that the government spent approximately Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh towards the treatment of Covid patients for a 10-day period towards the cost of drugs, laboratory tests, etc. Lauding health care workers for doing a “phenomenal” job in taking care of Covid patients and saving lives, Rane exhorted them to stay motivated for battling the third wave, if and when it strikes. “We have to be ready for the third wave. No expert knows exactly how to control the pandemic. The only thing that will help us is vaccination, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing,” he said. Acknowledging the services of the South Goa district hospital, Rane said that the hospital was among the “finest” health care facilities in the state alongwith the GMC’s superspecialty block. Kamat in his address said, “Covid brought all sections of the society together to work for each other.” The team of health workers of the Margao urban health centrewere also honoured on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-hosp-to-get-cardiac-unit-rane/articleshow/85254877.cms||---

But this pandemic year, sends-offs have been “distance events”, restricted to virtual platforms. Though schools and current Class XIIs are trying to make the online farewells as memorable as possible, the feasting and parting gifts, which are usually high points, are being sorely missed. At DPS Ruby Park, the sheer volume of students—over 800 pass-outs and over 800 bidding farewell—forced the youngsters to record the programme and host it on Facebook to avoid any glitch. “We are the real pandemic-year batch and have to adjust to everything, from not writing a board exam to a virtual farewell. I am really sad,” said Anushree Tibrewal, a Class-XII pass-out from the school, who is headed to the US for UG studies. At least 30-plus ISC pass-outs from The Heritage School are in transit, headed to different foreign campuses. So, the school is waiting for each of them to settle down and then, organize a virtual farewell so that the outgoing batch can join from different locations. “We missed them dearly at school and are suffering from an empty nest syndrome. We want to make the last “in-school” virtual meeting to be really spectacular,” said principal Seema Sapru. Her feelings were echoed by Rupkatha Sarkar, principal of La Martiniere for Girls, who organized a virtual send-off for her ISC pass-outs four months ago so that it was not rushed. . “Apart from the virtual programme put together by the present Class XII, we had messages for each of them, remembering them through the time since they joined as toddlers,” she said. Loreto House has also done its online farewell, though Loreto Convent Entally principal Jessica Surana Gomes said she delayed the event after her outgoing batch requested for a physical send-off so that they could meet at school for one last time. “The present Class XII took us down the memory lane and left us teary eyed,” said Avarna Sah, a Loreto House ISC pass-out, who plans to study economics next.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pandemic-year-batch-gets-virtual-farewell/articleshow/85254986.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The total population stood at over 3,100. Across the country, over 500 butterfly species have been found, with a total population of more than 38,000. At over 300, the highest number of species were sighted in Assam, while West Bengal and Kerala recorded over 200 species each. The survey was conducted during the big butterfly month held last September. Delhi has been conducting a butterfly census since 2017, but it was held at an all-India level for the first time in 2020. Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), iNaturalist, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Titli Trust, Diversity India, India Biodiversity Portal are among the 50 organisations that came together to host this event. Experts say butterflies play an important role in the ecosystem as they are pollinators and components of the food chain. Sohail Madan of BNHS said, “Butterflies help scientists in ascertaining the health of environment.” The winged insects can be seen near homes and people don’t have to visit a forest to spot a butterfly, he added. The rare butterflies spotted in the capital were dark cerulean, common albatross, striped albatross, common shot silverline and common mime. Among the common species were plain tiger, common grass yellow and common emigrant. Over 55 locations were surveyed in Delhi. For the census, around 31,000 observations were submitted in September on iNaturalist, Indian Biodiversity Portal and Butterflies of India. Nearly 77 awareness programmes were held along with schools, colleges and other educational institutions that saw participation of 4,927 students. Records were submitted from all states and Union territories except Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, Lakshadweep and Tripura. “Chocolate pansy, common mormon, common grass yellow, great eggfly and common crow were the most frequently encountered butterflies across the country,” said Madan. Big Butterfly Month 2021 will begin on September 4 and the theme will be “habitat development”. As butterflies lay eggs on their host plants and caterpillars feed on leaves of these plants, people will be educated to plant host plants at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/life-is-beautiful-number-of-butterfly-species-rises-to-74-in-2020-city-census/articleshow/85254950.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

He said it needs to first carry out a fresh study to declare the community as backward. “Till the time the state government does not set-up a Backward Commission and ensure a study is carried out, it is simply not possible to grant reservation to the Maratha community. The issue of 50% limit in reservation comes much after. Instead of doing what it must, the government is looking for excuses to blame the Centre,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-says-state-govt-not-keen-on-ensuring-maratha-reservation/articleshow/85257329.cms||---

On Saturday, IUML’s high-power committee had decided to suspend Rafi pending enquiry and party state general secretary PMA Salam had, on Monday, reiterated that Rafi was a member of the party committee in corporation 66 division. But, secretary of IUML’s division 66 unit, Mujeeb Puthiyakadavu told the media on Wednesday that Rafi didn’t have party membership. “How can a party take action against a person who is not a member?I can say for sure that Rafi is not a party member. Somebody misled the party state general secretary,” he said, adding that Rafi was expelled from the party 10 years ago. “But, he has been going around trying to create an impression that he is close to Kunhalikutty. Even in the latest incident where he hurled abuses against Moyeen Ali, he raked up the name of Kunhalikutty,” he said. Mujeeb said that Rafi was trying to build connections with party leaders by being a regular presence at IUML state committee office. When asked about the matter, IUML state general secretary PMA Salam said the controversy on the issue was a closed chapter.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-action-against-rafi-becomes-a-farce/articleshow/85255025.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Communal slogans’: Former BJP spokesperson gets bail||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to lawyer and former BJP spokesperson Ashwani Upadhyay, arrested in connection with communal slogans allegedly raised at Jantar Mantar on August 8, saying there was nothing on record to show that the alleged hate speech was done in the presence or at the behest of the accused. Metropolitan magistrate Udbhav Kumar Jain granted the relief to Upadhyay on furnishing a bond of Rs 50,000 with one surety of like amount. “As far as the offence u/s 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, etc) of IPC is concerned except for mere assertion, there is nothing on record to show that the alleged hate speech to promote enmity between different groups was done in the presence or at the behest of the accused,” the court said in the order. The court noted that so far there was nothing against the accused in the alleged video. “It is not the case where there are chances that the accused will abscond. Conspiracy is no doubt hatched behind closed doors and that the investigation in the present matter is at nascent stage, that however, does not imply that liberty of a citizen be curtailed on mere assertions and apprehension,” it noted. The court directed Upadhyay to cooperate with the ongoing investigation and not to leave the country without its permission. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the accused, claimed the arrest was a “blatant abuse of power by police” and they cannot apprehend anyone indiscriminately. Singh said that it was an admitted fact that Upadhyay was present at the spot in the morning and not at the time of the alleged incident relating to the hate speech. Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and advocate Ashwani Dubey, also appearing for the accused, said the FIR was registered belatedly. The public prosecutor opposed the bail plea saying the gathering was held without any permission, near the Parliament during the ongoing monsoon session and at a time when large gatherings were not being allowed to prevent spread of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/communal-slogans-former-bjp-spokesperson-gets-bail/articleshow/85255003.cms||Usha Das
---||Bhopal||Next stop, Olympics gold: Hockey star Vivek Sagar||There’s nothing ‘middling’ about this midfielder — he goes all out in pursuit of his goal. Hockey star Vivek Sagar’s journey from a small village in MP’s Itarsi to the Olympics podium in Tokyo is the kind that inspires others to dare to dream. He tells TOI in an exclusive interview how he got there & where he is headed: How has life changed after the Tokyo Olympics medal?For any athlete, winning an Olympics medal is a dream. I am living that dream every minute now. I had started playing hockey with the dream of playing for the country, but nothing can top an Olympics medal. Winning a bronze in the Olympics is just the beginning for me. I will not stop till I win an Olympics gold for the country. Your father Rohit Sagar didn’t want you to play hockey. How did you keep your dream alive?Like any other parent, my father was also worried about my future. His concern was very genuine. However, I only wanted to play hockey because whenever I have a hockey stick in my hand, it gives me the kind of satisfaction that I can’t describe in words. When you decide to achieve something with honest dedication and devotion, life always supports you. My family has been my motivation for hockey. I am eager to meet my family. Will the Tokyo bronze change perception of hockey in the country?Any sport gets a boost when athletes win medals. It’s the same with hockey. This Olympics bronze will definitely lead to a paradigm shift for hockey in the country. I believe parents will motivate their children to play hockey. The love shown by the country for the game proves it is extremely popular. The only need was to win medals, and it has happened. What more does Madhya Pradesh need to do to promote hockey?MP has the best hockey academies, run by the sports department. In fact, I started my hockey career at the Bhopal-based hockey academy. There is proper support and availability of modern equipment. What’s needed is more hockey synthetic turfs. Grass hockey grounds have to be converted to into synthetic turf. Your goal in the 58th minute of the pre-quarters game against Argentina. What was going on in your mind?We all were keen to take the lead. There were excellent moves before my goal but they could not be converted into goals. After I pushed the ball into the net, I felt like it was the best moment in my life. It helped the team take the lead. I can’t express what I feel whenever I recall the moment when I scored a goal for the country in the Olympics. Do you think hockey should be made compulsory in schools and colleges?That’s for the government to decide. I’d rather not comment on it. However, I believe hockey should be promoted in schools and colleges so that more talent can join this game. I hope the Tokyo Olympics medal will change the scenario.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/next-stop-olympics-gold-hockey-star-vivek/articleshow/85255012.cms||Ramendra Singh

Sub-inspector Kavita Rawant had complained that, on August 10, unknown persons had organised a bullfight in the paddy fields at Fatrade. Rihas Ahmed from Pedda in Benaulim and Mohammad Ghosh from Varca, owners of the bulls, were arrested and subsequently released on bail. There has been a sharp rise in ‘dhirios’ in the last few months along the Salcete coastal belt under the Colva police jurisdiction. This week itself many were held in Benaulim, Varca and Cansaulim. People for Animals had written to the Colva and Verna police stations and chief secretary, director general of police and district magistrates of both the collectorates demanding that the cruel sport be immediately stopped or face contempt. “The bull fights or ‘dhirios’ are in contravention of the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and therefore illegal and cannot be permitted to be organised and are also banned by the Goa bench of the Bombay high court in 1997,” the letter stated. The order of the high court has also been upheld by the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-bull-owners-arrested-for-dhirio-at-fatrade-varca/articleshow/85254984.cms||---

On July 22, a developer from Wadala had complained to the Antop Hill police that Jadhav alias Gotya and his four associates were trying to extort him and had threatened him at the point of a chopper. “Based on the tip-off, the crime branch unit 3 laid a trap and arrested Gotya, Rakesh Shinde, Chintamani Sarang, Suyash Parab and Vinod Singh alias Nepali and handed him over to the Antop Hill police,” said a senior crime branch officer. Last year, Jadhav and an accomplice had stabbed a Bandra resident over a petty argument over consuming drugs. Sources said Jadhav has committed more than 10 offences ranging from rape to attempt to murder and is now indulging in extortion. The Tardeo police too have registered an extortion case and are looking for Jadhav and his gang. At the time of the horrific Shakti Mills gang rape case in 2013, Jadhav was 17 and arrested alongside one more minor and four adults. In July 2014, the juvenile justice board had sent Jadhav and the other minor to Nashik Borstal School for three years.

Poppy straw weighing 1,371 kg was found in 69 bags, of which 62 were recovered from a truck and seven bags were found from an agriculture field. Goswami and other accused were arrested and booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. A sessions court had in February refused bail to Goswami. He approached the HC through advocate Utkarsh Dave. While granting bail on Rs 10,000 bond and a surety of the same amount, the high court took into consideration that Goswami had no past antecedent and there is no possibility of him fleeing the trial because of his deep roots in the society. The high court also took into consideration that two other accused were granted bail in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-grants-bail-in-ndps-case/articleshow/85255192.cms||---

Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte discussed the valuation of the building with Air India CMD Rajiv Bansal on Tuesday. The debt-ridden AI had floated tenders for the sale of the 23-storey building in 2018, which stands on state government land, but failed to evoke a good response. AI officials told Kunte that their internal valuation of the building was more than Rs 2,000 crore to which Kunte asked them to share it with the state govt, official sources said. An official said that the govt had written to AI, quoting a price of Rs 1,450 crore. “The actual price would have been around Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,200 crore since the govt dues from AI are around Rs 300 crore,” said the official. “A private party will have to demolish the entire structure. We can use it for another eight to ten years to accommodate some govt offices. Its actual cost would only be the strategic location and the land cost,” added an official who attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-in-talks-with-ai-for-iconic-nariman-pt-bldg/articleshow/85257440.cms||---

She had spoken of the threats she had received from the men, the court said, and the statement which came after that could not, therefore, be taken at face value. “The statement in favour of the accused cannot negate those made earlier. What she said in her complaint to the police, statement to the magistrate and the doctor (who examined her) remain consistent. It is only during cross-examination that she changed her statement,” additional district and sessions judge Nirdosh Kumar said in the verdict. “She had clearly said earlier that the men had threatened to kill her if she told anyone.” On October 28, 2014, the woman had stepped out to get fodder for her cattle. “Around noon, three men from her village, Chaman (Singh), Omvir (Singh) and Amit (Singh) came by, abusing her verbally and asking her where she’d hidden a sack of sugar. When she said she didn’t know anything, they accosted her. Chaman threw her to the ground and pointed a gun at her. Then they gang-raped her,” the prosecution had told the court. She went home and told her mother-in-law. They filed a police complaint and the three men were booked for gang-rape, criminal intimidation and robbery. In 2016, the court proceedings began. The woman then recorded her statement before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, in which she said she had been gang-raped, her gold earrings ripped off her ears and threatened against telling anyone “or she would be killed”. When she was cross-examined four months later, she said she didn’t have her glasses on when she was gang-raped and couldn’t identify the men. “But the judge, Nirdosh Kumar, referred to several cases and Law Commission observations on why witnesses turn hostile. He mentioned that ‘threat and intimidation’ is one of the main reasons for hostility of witnesses in cases of sexual offences against women in India,” additional district government counsel Santosh Srivastava told TOI. “The court also said she is a widow from a rural area and has no one to stand by her. In such a situation, it is easy for the accused to pressure her into backing off.” The court said, “It is evident that a helpless, poor widow was gang-raped at gunpoint … The men are convicted under sections 376(g) (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC … The survivor must be charged under Section 344 of the CrPC (giving false evidence).” The convicts have to pay Rs 20,000 each as a fine, failing which a year’s imprisonment will be added to their sentences.

After the arrest, Dr. Gupta was admitted into the ICU ward of the hospital where he’s undergoing treatment. Gupta is posted as a specialist surgeon at Raj Bahadur Memorial Hospital (RBM) in Bharatpur district. He had demanded a bribe of Rs 3,000 from a patient to conduct a surgery. Rs 1,000 was already paid to him during the verification of the complaint. The remaining Rs 2,000 was being given to him on Saturday when the ACB caught him red-handed when he was putting the money in his pocket. As per officials, Gupta could not be arrested the same day because his blood pressure had shot up, the officials involved in the trap learned the accused had suffered a heart attack earlier and had undergone angioplasty. The medical complications, according to the officials, led to the delay in his arrest on “humanitarian grounds,” along with pending verifications of certain evidence. The ACB headquarters subsequently handed over the investigation to senior additional SP Mahesh Meena. The ACB claimed that Dr. Gupta was arrested on Wednesday after the completion of required procedures as well as verification of evidence. The officials said they had also taken documents related to the complainant’s medical treatment from the hospital for the investigation.

Sesa finished at the bottom of the league table and were to be relegated. Last season’s league was played under strict protocols due to Covid-19, and the executive committee which met at the Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa on Thursday, decided to exempt Sesa from relegation due to the unusual season, which was shortened. However, GFA will impose relegation for the upcoming edition which is slated to commence from October 2. They will continue with all safety measures and have made vaccination a must for the teams. The league will be played in the same championship and relegation format. The curtain raiser for the season -- charity match -- will be held on September 19, followed by the Police Cup before the league kicks off. The GFA could not conduct the First Division League for two seasons due to Covid-19 and have plans to start the league in January, along with the under-20 league. Meanwhile, GFA will issue show cause notices to officials involved in last season’s abandoned Pro League clash between Salgaocar FC and Calangute Association at Duler on April 13. The match had come to a standstill in the 73rd minute after an error of judgment from the match referee when Calangute won a penalty. The game was abandoned and continued on a different day. The executive committee imposed a six-month ban in April on all officials involved, including the match commissioner for their role. They are supposed to be kept out of Pro League matches for another six months after their ban is completed. Dempo SC and Sesa have been issued show cause notices for taking part in Sesa’s Youth Tour Under-18 tournament held in March, while GFA rejected the request by state-run Goa Football Development Council (GFDC) to register them as a club. Meanwhile, GFA have asked their affiliated teams to pay last season’s fees without any late charges and renew their membership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lifeline-for-sesa-as-gfa-freezes-relegation-in-goa-pro-league/articleshow/85285504.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Ahmedabad||Kalol Blast: Nod was for construction 15 meters away from pipeline, AUDA tells Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) told the Gujarat high court that NA permission and development permission were granted to Garden City Cooperative Housing Society in Kalol under the condition that a safe margin of 15 metres from the nearby ONGC pipeline had to be maintained. Three lives were lost in a blast at the housing society caused by a leak in the pipeline last December. In response to a PIL seeking criminal action against the officials responsible for the blast in the pipeline passing beneath the residential colony in Saij village, AUDA’s senior town planner, Pankaj Tuvar, denied negligence on part of AUDA officials in granting development permission to the builder and society members. It was also submitted that AUDA was never approached for the Building Use permission. The town planner stated that that the revenue authority granted NA permission in 2007 under the condition that a safe distance from the centre of the pipeline had to be maintained while constructing a building. This was done as per an opinion given by ONGC on September 15, 2006. He submitted that ONGC has categorically certified that neither oil nor gas pipeline is located in the revenue survey 74/1 of Saij village, for which NA permission was sought for. Ultimately, in March 2007, NA permission was granted by the authority by relying on ONGC’s letter. It stated that development permission was granted for survey numbers 74/2, 74/10, 1100/3, 1517/1 and 1519/2 of Saij village. AUDA’s records showed that ONGC pipeline passed through survey number 100/3. The development permission categorically conditioned that a safe margin of 15 metres should be maintained from the pipeline for construction. The PIL demands Rs 100 crore fine on the responsible officials as the blast occurred due to their “malfeasance in knowingly allowing residential societies to come up on land beneath which ONGC pipelines passed”. The petitioner also demanded disciplinary proceedings against officials involved in granting development permission to the developer of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kalol-blast-nod-was-for-construction-15m-away-from-ongc-pipeline-auda-tells-hc/articleshow/85255264.cms||---

BJP state general secretary P Sudheer said the government was trying to nip off the rising resentment of Adivasi communities by politically silencing Janu. “The government is haunting Janu for refusing to become a part of LDF. The government and CPM have been targeting Janu for distancing herself from them in the light of her previous experiences. CPM had tried its best to dissuade Janu from joining the NDA fold and it started setting scores with her when she refused to toe its lines,” he said. The BJP’s reaction came in the wake of a police raid at Janu’s house in connection with allegations that she received large sums of money from BJP just before the assembly election. “Wayanad election graft case is the handiwork of CPM. M VJayarajan and P Jayarajan are behind this script. The conspiracy against Janu was hatched with the knowledge of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan,” Sudheer said. If the state government continues to harass Janu, BJP would be forced to put up strong resistance against such a move, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/end-witch-hunt-against-janu-bjp/articleshow/85255266.cms||---

The microblogging site said that the tweet has been removed as it was found to be in violation of the platform’s policy. “The account has been locked and the tweet is not available,” advocate Sajan Poovayya said, in response to a petition seeking registration of FIR against Gandhi for allegedly revealing the victim’s identity by posting a photograph with her parents on Twitter. A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh expressed satisfaction with the “prompt” action taken by Twitter prior to the court’s intervention. It also refused to issue notice at this stage on plea filed by one Makarand Suresh Mhadlekar and asked the parties to “keep 1-2 pages of submissions ready” when it takes up the matter on September 27. The HC took a dim view of the insistence of the petitioner’s counsel to demand Twitter file an affidavit as he disputed the platform’s stand. “If this is the attitude, we are not issuing notice,” it said.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Constables turn looters; 1 held in Alwar district, three suspended||ALWAR: Two persons including a police constable was arrested while three other constables of the district police on the run were suspended on Wednesday after an investigation confirmed their alleged involvement in a loot case. The police said they have arrested Sadar police station’s constable Ramjeet Singh, and another accused identified as one Rahul Khan. While Rajmeet Singh has been accused of pressuring the complainant for a settlement, three other constables accused of participating in the loot, identified as Anish, Ganga Ram and Narendra are currently on the run and have been suspended by the district superintendent of police, Tejaswani Gautam. She said that all four cops have been suspended. The police said that the incident took place on July 27, when one Sahil Khan (21) filed a complaint alleging that he was driving through the Govindgarh area when near Bhainsrawat in Alwar, four persons in a Bolero car waylaid him. Khan alleged that the accused in the car claimed themselves to be members of Alwar police’s special team. They asked Khan to give them money and looted Rs 27,000 from him. They then took him to a secluded spot where Khan was forced to transfer Rs 13,000 from his mobile payment application. The police initially arrested one accused, Rahul Khan; his interrogation revealed the involvement of Alwar cops in the criminal case. The police then arrested Ramjeet Singh who had allegedly coerced the complainant to agree to a settlement. “Rahul admitted that constable Narendra Jatav of Shivaji Park police station, constable Ganga Ram and Anesh Meo of NEB police station were also active participants in the crime,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/constables-turn-looters-1-held-in-alwar-district-3-suspended/articleshow/85255301.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Tihar inmate used number spoofing to con scores||NEW DELHI: Sukesh Chandrasekhar, a high profile conman arrested by Delhi Police’s Special Cell in Rs 200-crore extortion case, was allegedly using the "number spoofing" technology to impersonate high-ranking government officials, an investigation has revealed. While the cops are yet to crack open his iPhone, they suspect that Chandrasekhar was using an app called Crazy Call to spoof numbers. Using the technology, Chandrasekhar would call the targets to strike deals and the victims would see the numbers on the screen as desired by Sukesh, an official said. In one of the last calls to a victim, he impersonated the law secretary, a source said. The Economic Offences Wing has taken over the investigation into the sensational case that was first reported by TOI. Apart from Sukesh, the Special Cell had arrested two of his associates, Deepak and Pradeep, in the case. The EOW will take all the three accused in custody on Thursday and begin interrogation. The EOW has been assigned the case given the complex and humongous financial angles involved in the case. This will be the highest amount extorted not just from jail but also by any criminal in Delhi till date. Meanwhile, Tihar Jail DG Sandeep Goel has transferred the officials of the ward Chandrasekhar was lodged in and started an inquiry regarding the seizure of an iPhone from his cell. Chandrasekhar had recently been shifted to the Rohini campus and the seizure happened from there, an official said. "Five personnel have been transferred from the Rohini campus to Mandoli Jail. They include two assistant superintendents, a head warder and two warders," a senior Tihar official said. According to the probe conducted till now, Chandrasekhar had contacted the victim family informing them about a purported criminal investigation about to be initiated/underway against them and then promised help in lieu of money. At first, he claimed contacts at high places, which is his usual modus operandi, and then spoke to the victim, posing as a top government official. Chandrasekhar later claimed expenses incurred by him in form of bribes and coerced the victims into paying up. As he was operating from jail, his associates collected the money on his behalf at an undisclosed location. The victim/s later realised that they might have been duped and filed a complaint. An FIR was registered in this connection in the last week of July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-inmate-used-number-spoofing-to-con-scores/articleshow/85255336.cms||Raj Shekhar

The victim is a resident of Chhatral GIDC in Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar and he was trying to enter a shop in Borisana in Kalol in the small hours of Tuesday, said an officer of Gandhinagar Police.

---||Ahmedabad||Sweety Patel murder: Burned mangalsutra, teeth found||Ahmedabad: City crime branch cops probing the murder of 36-year-old Sweety Patel from Vadodara, who was allegedly killed by her partner Ajay Desai, a suspended police inspector, have found half-burnt jewellery including a mangalsutra, a ring and a bracelet along with five teeth. The cops are now relying on this new evidence to pursue the case. A crime branch officer said, “Police personnel earlier found 43 charred bones during a search of a site in Atali near Dahej. These include bones of the skull, cervix, limbs, spine and fingers and were sent for DNA examination to the forensic science laboratory.” In another search, cops found some half-burnt ornaments and five teeth from the same place, where Desai had allegedly burned Patel’s body on June 5 after killing her. “The new set of evidence has been sent to the FSL,” said a police officer. The officer said a strainer was used to find the bones, teeth and other evidence. Earlier, polygraph and SDS (suspect detection test) tests of Desai substantiated that he had killed Patel. Desai, who was an inspector with Vadodara rural special operations group, had a major fight with Patel with whom he was in a relationship for around five years, after which he strangled her. Later, he with help from his friend Kiritsinh Jadeja, he took her body to a secluded place behind a roadside eatery in Atali where he allegedly burned it. Milkman gives testimony before magistrate A milkman who had provided milk, curd and ghee to Desai on the day of Patel’s murder has given his testimony regarding the incident to a magistrate under CrPC Section 164, said a crime branch officer. After killing Patel, Desai sought Jadeja’s help to get some ghee, milk and curd to perform her last rites. “Jadeja told a milkman to provide the ghee, curd and milk to Desai. The milkman went to Prayosha Society where Desai and Patel lived and gave him the items,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sweety-patel-murder-burned-mangalsutra-teeth-found/articleshow/85255430.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Former MP Jyoti Mirdha’s uncle Bhanu Prakash Mirdha refutes land grab charges||JODHPUR: About a week after Naguar’s Ex-MP Jyoti Mirdha filed a complaint against her uncle Bhanu Prakash Mirdha and 12 others for appropriation of her share from parental property, the other party has termed her allegations false and has questioned the filing of the case after 33 years. Talking to media on Wednesday, her uncle claimed the said part of the land had been sold in 1988 and the money obtained had been shared between the brothers. “Everything is on record and no change has ever happened in relation to these documents till date. I don’t know why she filed a case against me after 33 years”, Mirdha said. Sharing some documents with the media, Bhanu Prakash Mirdha said during filing of nomination ahead of the Lok Sabha election she contested in 2009, Jyoti had given description of her properties but there was no mentioning of the part she has now complained about. “This clearly shows ill-intention behind filing this case against us with a view to malign social and political reputation of our family”, he said, adding that her allegations are malicious and incorrect. Supporting him, Vijay Poonia, husband of former tourism minister Usha Poonia — another party in the case — said Jodhpur Development Authority issued a lease deed and it was followed by proper procedure and a notification in the newspapers. “Even Jyoti and her sister had given statements in the court in writing after death of Ram Prakash Mirdha that they will stay put on their respective shares of land and no division of 4 bighas land was possible as it had already been sold,” Poonia said, adding that when everything was in their knowledge, why the issue has been raised now in this manner. Jyoti had field a police case against 13 persons including uncle Bhanu Prakash alleging appropriation of 4 bigha land in Chaupasni police station area from the parental property illegally keeping her in the dark. In a complaint registered by the Chopasni Housing Board police station on a court order, the ex-MP has alleged that her uncle, also an ex-MP, Bhanu Prakash Mirdha sold a part of 50 bigha land in Chopasni area belonging to her father Ram Niwas Mirdha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/former-mp-mirdhas-uncle-refutes-land-grab-charges/articleshow/85255357.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Need package to mitigate Kuttanad flood scare, demands Opposition leader V D Satheesan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In the wake of the UN’s intergovernmental panel report that has warned of heavy rains and floods especially in the southern parts of the country, the opposition demanded in the assembly on Wednesday that an immediate comprehensive programme is required for mitigating the flood scare in the Kuttanad region. Opposition leader V D Satheesan demanded a comprehensive programme by integrating multiple stakeholder departments after evaluating the net result of the projects that have been implemented till date in the region. Seeking leave for adjournment motion, MLA P C Vishnunath said that even though the floods are not new for the people of Kuttanad, the floods of 2018 wreaked havoc, from which the region has still not recovered. Vishnunath said that the previous LDF government announced a package of Rs 500 crore for the region in 2019, followed by another one in February this year. None of these have been implemented, and the people are living in fear when the monsoon arrived this year. He said that in the last three years, paddy in only 55% of the area under agriculture in the region could be harvested. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine replied that the second phase of Kuttanad package is under implementation. He added that IIT-Chennai would submit its report soon after a comprehensive study of the area, and necessary action would be taken on the basis of the report. He further said that agriculture, fisheries and water resources ministers are visiting Kuttanad and are reviewing the necessary short- and long-term measures to be taken. Meanwhile, Kuttanad MLA Thomas K Thomas blamed that UDF that had spoiled the implementation of the first Kuttanad package is now lamenting about the grief of people in the region. Former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that black-sand mining is not what is required, instead the urgent removal of sand and silt to ensure free flow of water to the Arabian Sea is needed. Earlier, speaker M B Rajesh said that the matter is not of urgent nature to be taken up under the adjournment motion. Satheesan, however, said that the opposition’s new approach is to take up matters that are of public importance. The discussions in the assembly should be result-oriented, and the speaker should appreciate it. He said that Kuttanad, which has been declared as one of the Ramsar sites, will be among regions to be the first casualties as the IPCC panel report found Kerala as one of the vulnerable areas. He said that till now, the region has received a flood of promises, but nothing has turned into reality. He said that Vembanad lake has already shrunk into one fourth of its original size. The main issue of not providing free inward and outward movement of water from the three main rivers to the region remains without being addressed. Satheesan said that the opposition will cooperate with any fruitful discussions and solutions for Kuttanad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/need-package-to-mitigate-kuttanad-flood-scare-oppn/articleshow/85255454.cms||---

As per the existing norms, the Centre provides 40% subsidy to projects having 3kw and 20% from above 3kw to 10 kw. Subodh Agarwal, chairman and managing director of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation said, “Every kilowatt capacity produces four units of power and the investments made are recovered in four years due to cheaper solar energy.” Additionally, he said, the life of the projects are 25 years which offers huge savings for people opting for the solar rooftop projects. He also appealed people to take advantages of the scheme and put up the plants before the expiry of the subsidies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rooftop-solar-subsidy-to-end-from-sept-1/articleshow/85255397.cms||---

An official said districts like Akola, Bhandara, Dhule and Gadchiroli (see box) collected very few samples in a week and recorded 1-2% weekly positivity rate (WPR), based on which the state government announces relaxations. He said the real situation in these districts would not reflect if the testing remained low. Experts said the low testing in the 10 districts was a concern but on the positive side, RT-PCR tests now make up 55% of the Covid tests in the state. “If the number of tests remains so low, the WPR would obviously be less than 1%. Yavatmal collected just 3,029 samples for the week ending August 9, and its WPR for the week was 0.4%. Ditto in Wardha, where just 2,339 tests were carried out for the week and the WPR was 0.2%,” said a public health official. In contrast, Pune, Mumbai, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar recorded over one lakh tests in the same week. Pune district carried out 1.1 lakh tests and registered a WPR of 5.8% and Mumbai conducted 2.3 lakh tests and registered 1.1%. State surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said districts would have to intensify testing as the Delta-plus variant of coronavirus was present in the state. “Districts should conduct maximum tests in pockets witnessing surges. All districts have been asked to ramp up testing, especially where the Delta-plus variant has been found,” he said. Some experts cited infrastructure issues for low testing in remote districts. This could be the possible reason behind more RATs than RT-PCR tests there, they said. The health department has asked the district administrations concerned to rope in more laboratories and increase the number of mobile swabs collection vans for the rural areas. Public health expert R Jotkar said adequate testing should be given utmost importance against the backdrop of the Delta-plus cases slowly increasing. “Some districts are declaring they are Covid-free. But reduced testing is a major concern,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-rap-for-10-dists-as-very-low-testing-skews-ity-rate/articleshow/85255473.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||BTech, 3 aides held for using SMS, spy app to steal money in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The arrest of a BTech graduate and his three aides has come as one of the biggest catches for the police in the fight against online banking fraud that is done using bulk SMSes encrypted with a spy app (KYC QS). The SMSes sent to mobile are the first step in stealing their confidential data. The accused were tracked and arrested in a weeklong operation that the cyber police in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) carried out from various Naxalite locations in Kolkata, Siliguri and Jharkhand. Thousands of victims across the country lost money to the fraudsters and the total amount may touch Rs 1 crore. The cyber police found that the hackers were in touch with the BTech graduate to buy stolen banking details. The police seized two laptops and nine mobile phones from the accused and found data on three more rackets that are operating similar frauds. The trio — B Tech graduate Santoshkumar Mondal (29) from Siliguri and his aides Ganesh alias Arjun Chhetri (38), Jitendra Mondal (23) and Ashokkumar Mandal (19) — coordinated with each from their respective locations to execute the fraud. The probe revealed that the messages were sent through bulk SMSes, asking the victim to download a KYC QS application, failing which their SIM will be deactivated. “The victim’s mobile gets compromised once they click on the link to complete the tele-verification after they receive through the SMS with sender details shown as ROBSTL or HETAHS or a few others. Once the victim clicks on the link, the spy app gets downloaded into the victim’s mobile and steals his or her confidential data,” a cyber police official said. The case was registered on July 3 after the mobile service providers or telecom companies received complaints from customers using their SIM about the SMS that they had received. The customers informed the companies about the warning they had received about the deactivation of their SIM in January and how they later lost their money. The case was filed by Sudhir Nair (31). “The four arrested accused posed as representatives of leading telecom companies from January to June, and messaged victims,” an officer said. BKC cyber police senior inspector Sharmila Sahastrabhudhe, inspector Mousami Patil, assistant inspector Shamrao Patil and the cyber detection staff arrested the accused after passing through the Naxalite locations. DCP (city-cyber) Rashmi Karandikar said the team started the probe after they received a complaint from a mobile service provider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-btech-3-aides-held-for-using-sms-spy-app-to-steal-money/articleshow/85258472.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Delhi||Live newborn delivered from Delhi woman’s abdominal cavity||NEW DELHI: Abdominal pregnancy, where a fertilised egg gets implanted and grows in the abdomen instead of the main uterus cavity, is rare and occurs in just one in 10,000 live births. It is even rarer for such a pregnancy to reach an advanced stage because in most cases either the mother doesn’t survive the complications caused by the abnormality or the fetus itself dies due to lack of adequate blood supply and nutrition. However, in a miracle of sorts, a woman from east Delhi recently delivered a healthy girl child that had developed in the abdominal cavity. Doctors at Aarogya Hospital, where the delivery took place three days ago, said they got to know about the abdominal pregnancy while operating on the woman. Dr Anjali Chaudhary, senior consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology, at Aarogya Hospital, said, “The woman had undergone multiple ultrasound tests in the early stages of the pregnancy, but the doctors in her hometown couldn’t detect that the fetus was growing in the abdomen. By the time she approached us, the 32-year-old was already in an advanced stage of pregnancy and we couldn’t make the distinction either. But we did observe that it was a breech birth — when a baby is born bottom first instead of head first — and, therefore, a decision was taken to deliver the baby through Caesarean section.” As soon as the doctors opened the abdomen, they observed that the baby was not inside the uterus and it was an extra-uterine intra-peritoneal abdominal pregnancy. Simply put, the baby was outside the uterus and in the abdomen. “We had already given the incision, so there was no scope of turning back. We gathered an emergency team, arranged for extra units of blood and fresh frozen plasma and went ahead with the delivery. The baby was extracted by grasping the feet,” said Chaudhary. Once that was done, the placenta was found deep inside the mother’s pelvis. “There was massive haemorrhage and torrential bleeding while we were trying to remove the placenta tissue. It was progressively controlled and four units of fresh frozen plasma and three units of blood were given to the mother to compensate for the blood loss,” explained Chaudhary. Post-surgery, the mother remained in the ICU for 24 hours, while the newborn, who weighed 2.65kg and was found to be healthy, remained in the ICU for around 12 hours. “Both of them are absolutely fine now. They are at home,” the doctor said. In India, there are very few cases of full-term child birth involving abdominal pregnancy. In 2012, doctors from Madhya Pradesh published a similar case report in Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. It described abdominal pregnancy in a 20-year-old woman and in that case, too, a healthy baby weighing 2.3kg was delivered successfully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/live-newborn-delivered-from-womans-abdominal-cavity/articleshow/85255421.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro adds 8 more trains to manage passenger rush||KOLKATA: With the number of passenger count crossing 2 lakhs, Metro Railway has decided to add eight more trains from Friday and reduce service frequencies from 6 minutes to 5 minutes. TOI reported last Saturday that more trains would be added since the carrier has breached 2 lakh ridership since resumption of services on July 16. The north-south corridor, which is the city’s transport lifeline, had taken four months to reach the milestone on January 24 this year, with as many as 240 services, after resumption of services after the first wave. In the second stint, Metro managed to scale the 2 lakh mark in just three weeks, with 20 services less. From Friday, 228 services will run, with 114 trains in each direction. Peak-hour intervals will be 5 minutes. Services will start at 7.30am as usual and end at 9pm. Last trains from Kavi Subhas and Dum Dum would roll out at 8pm. The last train from Dakshineswar station will be at 7.48pm. Between Kavi Subhas and Dum Dum, there will be 150 services, with 75 trains in each direction. As per state government’s order, Metro is only allowed to ply from Monday to Friday after it restarted post the 61-day second Covid break. On Saturdays, Metro Railway has been running 104 staff special trains for essential workers from various sectors. But there are no trains on Sundays. Commuters can board only with smart cards. Tokens are still not issued because of the pandemic. Metro has become the prime transportation means with many buses off the road. It is also the cheapest. One can commute 32km from Dakshineswar to Kavi Subhas for Rs 25. “With skyrocketing fuel prices, I have stopped using my car to travel to my Park Street office ever since Metro resumed on July 16,” said Bolan Sengupta, corporate executive and Shyambazar resident. When the carrier had restarted operations on September 14 post lockdown, around 20,000 took the Metro. But passenger count has been high right from Day 1 post the second wave, prompting Metro to run 220 trains from the second weekday and extend operation hours. Ridership jumped from 1.2 lakh to 1.7 lakh in the first seven days. It is likely to go up further in the next few days and Metro may steadily veer towards its pre-pandemic fleet of 228 services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-adds-8-more-trains-to-manage-passenger-rush/articleshow/85252666.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Going ahead with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 that was launched by Narendra Modi government last year, Vallabh Vidyanagar-based Sardar Patel University (SPU) is bringing changes in the traditional streams of science and commerce from this academic year.The university will be offering integrated bachelors and masters programme (IBMP) programmes to A and B group students of science stream and commerce students who have cleared their class 12.“We are introducing IBMP from this academic year with a multi-disciplinary approach as envisaged in the new NEP. Ours is the first university in Gujarat to do so with dual degree programmes in both science and commerce streams. We have also linked it with an academic bank of credit” said SPU vice-chancellor professor Shirish Kulkarni.For students who have passed in A group, IBMP will be offered in six streams — applied chemistry, applied mathematics, applied statistics, applied material science, applied physics and applied electronics.Similarly, for B group students, IBMP will be offered in biomedical sciences and dietetics. Commerce students will stand a chance to pursue IBMP in commerce. The five-year integrated programmes have been launched with 20 seats each in science streams and 70 seats in commerce stream where admissions will be merit-based.Students will have a choice to exit from the programmes after completion of three years. If they exit the programmes at the end of three years they will earn a bachelor’s degree but those who continue will be automatically eligible for master’s degree.“The objective of IBMP is to increase employability of students considering the global ecosystem. Also, as students will be enrolled for a duration of five years, there will be more focus on research,” said Kulkarni. IBMPs will be run on a self-financed model with Rs 12,000 as fees for one semester. Students enrolled in the courses will study general subjects in the first year and later move on to core subjects of their choice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/spu-rolls-out-integrated-programmes/articleshow/85250620.cms||Prashant Rupera

The BMC said there will be no drive on Thursday and Friday. On Wednesday too, vaccination was held at limited centres. For the second day in a row this week, fewer than 50 of the 314 public centres were operational. Vaccination was cancelled on August 4 too due to shortage. A total of 39,538 people got vaccinated on Wednesday, of whom 34,624 took the shots in private centres. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said it is surprising that the shortage is not leading to a significant rise in footfall in private hospitals that have enough shots. “It was assumed there could be a rush due to local trains being allowed, but it doesn’t appear to be so,” she said. The city has administered almost 77 lakh shots in all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/shortage-bites-no-vaccination-at-bmc-centres-today-and-tomorrow/articleshow/85255521.cms||---

According to a release from the Union health ministry, Kerala has the highest number of such districts (11), followed by Tamil Nadu, where seven districts are showing an increasing trend over the past two weeks. In fact, North 24 Parganas is currently reporting the maximum number of daily cases in the state, surpassing Kolkata. The district also has the highest number of active cases — 1,213 — at present cases. It also has the second highest death toll. District health officials said around 70 to 90 fresh cases are being reported daily on an average with one or two deaths per day. They negated the rising trend. “Our positivity rate is currently below 2%, which is far lower than some districts in other states that are reporting between 10%-15% positivity. We are getting only few cases, mainly from the urban areas of the district,” said North 24 Parganas DM Sumit Gupta. The district at present has 89 micro-containment zones — the maximum under the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation area (16), followed by nine in Kamarhati municipality area, eight each in Barasat and Swarupnagar, seven in South Dum Dum, six in Madhyamgram and five C-zones in Khardah municipality area. “The existing micro-containment zones are extremely small, covering only one or two houses. The idea is basically to control cases,” Gupta said. Among the districts, Nadia was the first to get Covid-19 cases in 2020 when a family, including two children, were found infected on their return from Delhi. Since then, the district has been reporting high cases. On Wednesday, the district had 648 active cases. “All efforts are being taken to ensure that the positivity rate does not rise and the infection is under control,” said a district health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centre-n-24-pgns-nadia-among-37-districts-of-covid-concern-in-india/articleshow/85252722.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The accused, Salim Shaikh, who officials said is a drug abuser, had earlier inflicted injuries on himself. He was overpowered by security personnel and handed over to the railway police at CSMT. Shaikh had asked for a ticket at the counter but the clerk refused as Shaikh is not part of the ‘essential service’ workforce. Shaikh started verbally abusing and threatening the clerk who called in RPF officials. By the time, RPF constable Lekharam Mehra arrived, Shaikh had left, but returned about 10 minutes later and created a ruckus. “He pulled out a blade from his pocket and started to slash himself. Mehra tried to calm him down but Shaikh started to kick and hit him. He also slashed Mehra on the left hand and chest with the blade, injuring him,” said a railway police official. Shaikh was taken into custody. He has been booked for assaulting a public servant, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/drug-user-slashes-rpf-man-creates-ruckus-at-stn-in-mumbai/articleshow/85258481.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Ball gets rolling for Bypass Metro’s Chingrighata pier, inspection today||KOLKATA: The construction of Metro pier 318, planned in the middle of the Chingrighata crossing, is all set to start. A joint inspection by implementing agency Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL), Kolkata Police and KMDA will be conducted on Thursday. The inspection is crucial for Kolkata Police to draw up its traffic diversion plan before the middle of the key crossing is blocked. A host of other issues, including relocation of the traffic signal, too, will be addressed. RVNL officials are hoping to start piling work for the pier within one month, after Kolkata Police draws up its plans. In August last year, TOI had reported how a major impasse had ended for the 32km corridor with IIT-Kharagpur clearing the contentious pier planned at the Chingrighata crossing on EM Bypass. KMDA had objected to the building of the pier saying it would occupy 4.1sqm space and cramp the already congested EM Bypass-Salt Lake Bypass crossing. IIT-Kharagpur was already drawing up a long-term solution for the Chingrighata crossing where too many roads, from the Sector V-end, Beliaghata and Chaulpatty, meet. The intersection on the 29km-long EM Bypass takes much traffic load and road mishaps are frequent. TOI has been writing a series of reports relating to the pier and the KMDA’s proposal to drop it. Eventually, in October 2019, IIT-Kharagpur was asked to deduce whether the elliptical Metro pier could be done away with. The institute submitted its report, saying the pier must stay. It agreed with RVNL’s contention that without pier 318, the gap between the two pillars, before and after, would increase from 28m to 60m. RVNL has been maintaining that the curvaceous elevated viaduct should sit safely on these three pillars while turning right towards Nicco Park. The agency also held that the pillar on the median at Chingrighata is crucial since the viaduct curve is too sharp (352.1m radius). “In 2019, construction of viaduct at Chingrighata came to a halt just as we were about to start building pier 318,” said an RVNL engineer. Piers 317 and 318 must happen simultaneously for that accurate turn of the viaduct. While waiting for the IIT report, RVNL decided to build only half of pier 317. The pile cap wasn’t constructed to leave room for added piling in case pier 318 was dropped. Since it wasn’t, construction of pier 317 can now be completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ball-gets-rolling-for-bypass-metros-chingrighata-pier-inspection-today/articleshow/85252716.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Addressing reporters in Delhi, he said: “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should tell the people of the state if he wants to do justice or injustice to them. He is meting out injustice to the people of the state.” Sanjay said the Centre had constituted these boards to oversee distribution of water between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The apex council meeting was notified in accordance with the provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014, he said. “All the officials attended both boards’ meetings, but there was no official from Telangana at the meetings. The meetings were called at my request by the Centre,” he said. He said if Telangana officials attended these meetings, they would have been able to object to the illegal projects being undertaken by AP and protect the state’s interests. He alleged that the state government had undertaken multiple projects without DPRs. “The government was afraid that if its officials attended these meetings, they will be exposed,” he alleged. Meanwhile, BJP MP D Arvind asked the state government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to NRIs in the state. “Despite writing to the government, there has been no response,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandi-poser-on-t-skipping-river-board-meets/articleshow/85257644.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot inaugurates posh flat project for legislators||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday inaugurated luxurious flats for MLA project near assembly in Jyoti Nagar. The Rajasthan Housing Borad (RHB) is proposed to construct an eight-storey building in the periphery of the legislative assembly to accommodate 160 MLAs. An artist’s impression of the proposed luxurious flats for MLAsUnder the project, the RHB will construct four eight-storey blocks. Each block will have 32 flats. Similarly, two eight-storey blocks will also be constructed having 16 flats in each block. Each flat will measure 3,200 square feet and comprise four bedrooms, one drawing room, a kitchen and a one room for domestic help. Gehlot said, “As the land space is shrinking, such projects are need of the hour. In the national capital, the Member of Parliament and officers are staying in the multi-storied buildings.” After RHB successfully acclaimed the land on which these apartments are being constructed, the work has been started on ground. RHB commissioner Pawan Arora said, “The board took possession and demolished 54 bungalows of MLAs to acclaim 24,160 metre land to build the project. Efforts are being made to complete the project before the deadline of 30 months. The JDA has also provided the first installment of Rs 50 crore,” he said. A Jaipur-based firm N S Gadhiya, which quoted the lowest bid of Rs 266 crore against the Rs 280 bidding price, has been awarded the work. As per the previous design, the JDA had proposed 176 flats. However, the idea did not go well with the committee which is overseeing the project as the open area was less. Now, 16 flats have been reduced in the project to develop a central lawn measuring 36,000 square metre. In the project, the RHB has earmarked parking for 1,200 vehicles and a 12-room guest house. RHB has been appointed as the nodal agency for constructing MLA apartments. An official said the revenue earned after selling the land at Lal Kothi and Jalupura will be utilized to construct the apartments. Sources said considering the project as a special case, the 28-metre building has been proposed against the 15-metre rule mentioned in the building bylaws. The RHB has proposed to construct the apartment till the base height of the assembly dome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-inaugurates-posh-flat-project-for-legislators/articleshow/85255562.cms||---

---||Mumbai||After robust July jabs, Maharashtra sees sharp 30% drop from August 1 to 10||MUMBAI: After a bumper run in July, vaccination in the state has dropped by a sharp 30% in the first ten days of August. Compared to nearly 40 lakh doses administered in the first ten as well as the last ten days of July, the state has managed to administer less than 28 lakh doses in August so far.  Additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the fall was due to “limited supply of vaccines”. The state has received 8.26 lakh doses in August so far. The shortage has severely impacted the drive in the state’s capital Mumbai, where public vaccination has already been cancelled thrice and trimmed on three other days. The city, where even local train travel now depends on complete vaccination, received only 1.50 lakh doses in August, which the municipal corporation has the capacity to administer in a day.  Maharashtra, since start of the vaccination drive in January, has been ahead of other states in administering doses. It also raced to the milestones ofgivign 1 crore, 2 crore, 3 crore and 4 crore doses much before the other states. Uttar Pradesh would be the close second, trailing by a few lakh doses. But sometime in mid-July, UP picked up pace and went past Maharashtra. As on Wednesday, UP had administered 78 lakh more doses than Maharashtra. It has now administered 5.54 crore doses, highest in the country, while Maharashtra has administered second highest at 4.76 crore, according to CoWin.  Sources said the state is worried if Maharashtra’s quota is being diverted to other states with talks of the Centre’s new policy of strengthening vaccination in rural pockets. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, an advisor to the state government, called it “unfair” that badly-hit states like Maharashtra and Kerala are not prioritised. He also said rural areas cannot be given preference if a third wave is to be averted. Maharashtra till now has received 3.7 crore doses from the Centre and procured 25 lakh on its own. The rest has been administered by the private sector and through CSR.  Mumbai has fully vaccinated only 22% of its estimated eligible population of 90 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-robust-july-jabs-maharashtra-sees-sharp-30-drop-from-aug-1-to-10/articleshow/85255578.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Kolkata||Second highest vacancy of judges at Calcutta high court||KOLKATA: Calcutta high court has the second highest vacancy of judges among all high courts in the country after Allahabad high court. In a written reply to TMC MP and senior lawyer Kalyan Banerjee, Union law minister Kiren Rijiju on Wednesday said from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020, the Supreme Court collegium had made seven recommendations for Calcutta high court judges of which only two were appointed, including the former additional solicitor general. The Union minister also said that as on August 1, 41 posts of judges were vacant in Calcutta high court. Rijiju’s response to Banerjee says that of the 71 position of judges sanctioned for Calcutta high court, only 31 judges “are in position”. According to the vacancy positions in high courts released by the Union minister for law and justice, only Allahabad high court has more vacancies than Calcutta high court. However, Allahabad high court has a sanctioned strength of 160 judges and a vacancy of 66 judges. Even Bombay high court, which has a sanctioned strength of 94 judges, has a vacancy list of 31 judges. Among the vacancies in Calcutta high court, 25 are for permanent judges and 16 for additional judges. To Banerjee’s question on when these vacancies will be filed up, Rijiju did not commit any timeframe but said: “Filling up for vacancies in the high courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the executive and judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various constitutional authorities both at the state and central level.” The Union law minister also said that while attempts to fill up the posts were being made “expeditiously”, these vacancies also keep arising due to “retirement, resignation, or elevation of judges and due to increase in the strength of judges”. While one Calcutta high court judge is set to retire this year, the next retirements are in 2023. In April 2020, five judges of Calcutta high court were transferred. Three among them took charge as the chief justices of Bombay, Madras and Meghalaya high courts. Calcutta high court now has two additional judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-highest-vacancy-of-judges-at-calcutta-high-court/articleshow/85252743.cms||---

The members included the sarpanch and the deputy sarpanch of the group GP. "We are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the high court. The special leave petition (SLP) is dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of," said the SC bench of Justice L Nageswara Rao and Justice Aniruddha Bose on August 9. The group GP was elected in September 2017. At a meeting on January 30, 2018, it unanimously passed a resolution granting a no objection certificate (NOC) to the development of six plots belonging to six different people. Shaikh Ismail, one of the members and a signatory to the resolution, later filed an application with the additional divisional commissioner claiming that the resolution was in violation of the provisions under the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959. The Aurangabad ZP chief executive officer concluded, in an ensuing inquiry report, that the January 30, 2018 resolution by the group GP was contrary to the provisions under Section 52 of the Village Panchayats Act. The report also pointed out that the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (Amendment) Act, 2014 mandates that in the village, for which a draft Regional plan or final Regional plan has been published, no person shall erect or re-erect or commence to erect or re-erect any building, in other areas of village (except gaothan area of village), without obtaining the previous permission of the collector or any other officer, not below the rank of Tehsildar to whom the powers of the Collector, are delegated. The report formed the basis for the additional divisional commissioner's February 6, 2020 order disqualifying the nine members of the group GP, who then moved in an appeal before the minister of state for revenue Abdul Sattar. The latter dismissed their appeal on February 10, 2021. The members then moved the HC through their lawyers Ravindra Gore and Amol Karande. The HC set aside the two orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sc-refuses-to-interfere-with-hc-order-on-group-gram-panchayat-members/articleshow/85247965.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Pawar urged Modi to resolve the long-pending dispute with Karnataka on top priority. “I will suggest that PM must step in immediately and ensure that atrocities on Marathi-speaking people are stopped immediately. Huge injustice has been done on the people in border areas,’’ Pawar said. It was expected that the dispute would be resolved during the tenure of Devendra Fadnavis, since there was BJP rule in the state and at the Centre too, it was NDA government, but no steps were taken for an amicable settlement. The dispute between the two states is also pending before Supreme Court. Pawar said while 60 years have passed since the formation of Maharashtra, Marathi-speaking areas, particularly Belgaum, Karwar, Bidar, Bhalki and Nipani, are not part of Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dy-cm-writes-to-pm-to-resolve-border-dispute-with-karnataka/articleshow/85258501.cms||---

The Independence Day, said the statement, would be celebrated by unfurling the tri-colour flags at party offices, adhering to Covid-19 protocols. All party units should come forward to celebrate the Independence Day celebrations, it added. However, BJP state president K Surendran said CPM’s call for Independence Day celebration by party rank and file was the height of hypocrisy. “The party which betrayed the freedom movement has now decided to celebrate Independence Day. For more than a decade after independence, these Leftist forces were saying that the independence gain was a hoax. They are now trying to be the champions of the freedom movement,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-asks-cadres-to-celebrate-i-day-hypocrisy-says-bjp/articleshow/85223043.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||No question of alliance with BJP in UP elections: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi||HYDERABAD: The political turf is heating up in Uttar Pradesh ahead of elections to the state assembly early next year, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday ruled out an alliance with BJP. “There is no question of going with BJP. The two ends of a sea can never meet. Other political parties in UP have to think with whom they want to join hands to defeat the BJP,” Owaisi said to a query on AIMIM’s plans in UP. He also tweeted it. AIMIM has already announced that it will contest 100 seats in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, and has tied up with Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and its Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha. However, a recent meeting between Rajbhar and BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh in UP had fuelled speculations that the possibility of Rajbhar joining hands with BJP again cannot be ruled out. SBSP had contested the 2017 assembly polls in alliance with BJP but parted ways before 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The SBSP leader who leads the morcha has reportedly said his outfit could again ally with BJP if the saffron party picks up a backward caste leader as its chief ministerial candidate for 2022-UP assembly polls. Now, Owaisi’s statement makes it clear that AIMIM will not be part of any front that has an alliance with BJP. Rajbhar has reportedly spoken to Owaisi over the phone after meeting the BJP state president, and explained to him the reason behind his meeting the saffron party chief. Owaisi exuded confidence that people of UP will send a large number of AIMIM candidates to assembly. He threw a challenge at BJP to make “a debate on development” as an election issue and not anti-Muslim talk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-question-of-alliance-with-bjp-in-up-elections-asaduddin/articleshow/85257720.cms||Roushan Ali

The sale consideration is Rs 985 crore. “This development is a significant step in our efforts to unlock the value of some of our power development assets to streamline and allocate capital to create long-term value for our shareholders,” said DK Sen, whole-time director, Larsen & Toubro. Speaking about the acquisition, Sumant Sinha, founder, chairman, and CEO of ReNew Power, said, “Given that the asset is already operational, the acquisition is not only value accretive for us but also presents a lower level of risk. It strengthens our ability to provide firm and round-the-clock power to the grid and compliments our solar and wind assets, filling up an important position in our portfolio."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/lt-inks-pact-to-divest-singoli-bhatwari-hydroelectric-project/articleshow/85250749.cms||---

The notice also has the statement of another respondent in the case---former principal secretary M Sivasankar---who contradicts Swapna’s statement. As per the Custom's showcause notice, Swapna said certain politicians have also sent foreign currency abroad. “When Swapna was asked who were all these senior politicians, she replied that present chief minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan and speaker Sreeramakrishnan have sent foreign currency to UAE through Ahmed Al Doukhi, diplomat of the consul general office and consul general, Jamal Al Zaabi, respectively,” the notice says.  As per the notice, when Swapna was asked how these politicians sent foreign currency through diplomats, she replied that Sivasankar told her about an important packet that had to be sent to UAE to the CM, who had reached the Gulf nation the previous day. “She spoke to the consul general (CG) about it and the CG told her that Doukhi could be sent to UAE for the purpose. She asked Sarith to contact Sivasankar and to collect the consignment and deliver it to Doukhi. She knew that Doukhi was sent to UAE by the consul general only to handover the packet to the chief minister. Later, Sarith informed her unofficially that he had brought the packet to the consulate and that it contained currency,” the notice says quoting Swapna. However, when Sivasankar was asked about it, he gave a contradictory statement. “The CM was on his first visit to UAE after assuming charge and was meeting high- evel dignitaries. As a courtesy, it was decided that some mementos should be handed over to the dignitaries at the end of the meetings. But only one such memento was ready before the delegation left for UAE and the other three or four mementos were subsequently taken to UAE and for this he had requested the consul general to help him,” the notice says quoting Sivasankar. M Sivasankar also deposed that M/s. Stark, an advertising agency, had conceived and produced the mementos which were to be handed over by CM to dignitaries during his first UAE visit. “M/s.Stark would have delivered it to the Secretariat and GAD (protocol) would have officially handed it over to the UAE consulate through Shri Sarith," the notice says. Similar allegations were made by the accused in the statements given to the ED as well, however, the agencies are yet to find evidence to support the claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/currency-sent-at-vijayans-behest/articleshow/85255708.cms||---

Police have arrested one suspect and a manhunt has been launched for three accomplices named in the FIR with the Talwada police station. The deceased, identified as Sopan Chavan, had gone missing from the Bhendtakli village on Saturday after he went to their farm. Unable to find him, his father had lodged a missing complaint. On Tuesday night, the body of the teenager was found dumped in a sugar cane farm. Police said there were no significant injury marks on the body. The body was shifted to the government hospital, where an autopsy was performed and the body was handed over to the family late on Tuesday night. Swinging into action, the Talwada police arrested the key accused, Kishor Londhe, on a murder charge. Police said the victim’s father and his neighbouring farmer (Londhe) have been involved in an ongoing land dispute. Citing the contents of the complaint, the police said that after the teen was found alone on Saturday, the suspects allegedly dragged him to the sugar cane field and murdered him. To destroy the evidence, the teen’s body was dumped among the tall sugar cane grass. Police maintained that the matter is likely to get clearer in the coming days, when the other accused are arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/15-year-old-found-dead-in-field-one-arrested/articleshow/85248000.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Aurangabad||Head: Hingoli ZP chief to replace Jagtap as Beed collector||Aurangabad: Hingoli zilla parishad's (ZP) chief executive officer and a 2012 batch IAS officer Radhabinod A Sharma will replace Ravindra Jagtap as the new collector of Beed district, consequent to the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court's August 3 order directing Jagtap's transfer. The HC had directed the state chief secretary to transfer Jagtap and appoint another district collector with promptitude to enable an impartial probe in an alleged misappropriation and siphoning of huge funds meant for MG-NREGA scheme. When contacted, Jagtap told TOI on Wednesday, “I have received the transfer order of Hingoli ZP CEO, but I am yet to receive the order about my next posting. As of now, I am in Aurangabad for submission of compliance reports (to the HC). Things will become more clear once I reach Beed. I will make my submission before the HC on August 18 when the matter is due for next hearing.” TOI made repeated calls to Aurangabad divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar as well as Sharma, but the same went unanswered. The HC in its order had said that it had lost complete faith and trust in the incumbent collector for the way he had handled the court’s earlier directives relating to setting up of a probe panel and submission of an affidavit relating to the probe findings. "Prima facie, we are of the opinion that the incumbent collector (Jagtap) has exhibited an extreme lack of solitude for the rule of the law and conducted himself in a manner not befitting the responsible office he holds,” the bench said. The HC was then hearing a PIL by activist Rajkumar Deshmukh, who has alleged, among other things, that cheque and cash payments worth crores of rupees were made between 2010-11 and 2018-19 for MG-NREGA works in violation of the provisions of the scheme in the district. On Tuesday, the Beed district administration had issued show cause notices to 570 gram sevaks along with 495 sarpanchs who have served in different villages between 2011 and 2019. All the recipients have been asked to file their replies within three days of the notice, to an inquiry committee formed to examine the works carried out by MG-NREGA. Failing to reply would result in dismissal from service as well as registration of criminal offences against them, warned the notices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/head-hingoli-zp-chief-to-replace-jagtap-as-beed-collector/articleshow/85248025.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||50% of all 18+ in Vidarbha now have got first dose||NAGPUR: By now, it has been largely accepted that vaccination offers protection from severe Covid-19. Just like the vaccine shortage, improving supply and coverage is also a reality. Figures at least show the same. In the first 10 days of August, 27,30,631 people in Vidarbha have been inoculated — which means nearly 2.73 lakh getting the vaccine each day in Vidarbha during this period. This pace is way above the July average of below 1 lakh per day, and overall average of 40,000 per day since the beginning of the vaccination drive on January 16. Vidarbha’s overall population is 2.55 crore, out of which nearly 1.9 crore are eligible for the vaccination as they are in 18+ age group. Out of these, more than 92 lakh have received at least one dose, which comes to 50% of the eligible population. About 23 lakh of the total population in region have got both the doses and full protection, i.e. 12% of the eligible population is fully protected, while 50% has partial protection from Covid-19. According to experts this is really a good number for the region like Vidarbha where the worst phase of the second wave of Covid-19 is over. “We must understand that we officially have more than 11 lakh cases on record. As per experts and scientists, unreported asymptomatic cases are at least 4 times more than the reported cases. A combination of vaccine and cases together bring good protection unless and until there is no new mutation in the virus,” said epidemiologist Anand Thatte. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said vaccination can check mutations. “We have scientific evidence that vaccination can really slow down the mutations. We must keep and increase the pace of vaccination. Because, less vaccination allows more multiplication of the virus which will eventually lead to more variants,” said Dr Shinde. Vaccination coverage in rural Vidarbha still needs a push, said officials involved in record keeping. According to them, urban areas have better coverage and some villages where people are aware and leadership is active, have already achieved 100% vaccination. “But, many in villages are still reluctant to get vaccinated. This may lead to rural outbreak of Covid-19, which is more risky. We must convince people to get vaccinated not only for their own safety, but also for the sake of others too,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/50-of-all-18-in-vid-now-have-got-first-dose/articleshow/85250736.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||MTDC plans 5-star resort, park in 62 acre of Tadoba buffer zone||Nagpur: In a bid to offer more luxurious experience to tourists at Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) plans to develop a resort equivalent to five-star or above category in 62 acre land in the buffer zone. The project is located four kilometre from Madnapur gate, close to Sindewahi-Chimur road in Chandrapur district. The move, however, has not gone down well with the wildlife lovers, who fear such project will affect the tiger corridor. An MTDC official told TOI, “Request for proposal (RFP) has been floated on July 20. The last date for submitting the bids is September 8. Estimated cost of the project is around Rs30 crore. The selected private operator will have to complete the project within four years from the date of appointment. The operator will get concession period of 56 years or total 60 from the date of appointment. The period is extendable by 30 more years.” The official added that the state’s revenue department has allotted the land to MTDC for tourism project six months ago. “There are not much developmental activities towards Madnapur gate and hence the project will not only boost tourism, but will also result in welfare and development of adjoining villages,” he said. As per the RFP, MTDC will allow construction of resort equivalent to five-star category or higher. It will be a premium jungle resort with farm-to-fork restaurant, swimming pool, park, safaris etc. Total 25 rooms will be allowed to be constructed. The developer can plan for more as per terms and conditions of TATR and MTDC. It will be MTDC’s second such resort in TATR with earlier one being near Moharli gate. The new project is likely to be a hit as Madnapur gate is situated within the buffer zone and very close to the core area. Majority of resorts are at Moharli gate which is another advantage for the new project. President of Prakurti Foundation Dipak Dixit said, “The proposed project will create various types of problems. There is a wildlife corridor from Madnapur to Navargaon to Bramhapuri. The project may have its impact on this corridor as it is situated within the buffer zone and close to core area.” “The project is also in violation of Wildlife Protection Act and needs to be scrapped. Already, resorts and other types of amenities are present in large numbers around TATR. Therefore, there is no need for more such projects,” he said. MTDC official, however, ruled out any threat to the wildlife corridor or TATR. As per the RFP, eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) norms will come into effect for this project. Therefore, the developer will have to comply with all norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mtdc-plans-5-star-resort-park-in-62-acre-of-tadoba-buffer-zone/articleshow/85252919.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Hyderabad||TRS picks BC candidate to match Eatala Rajendar in Huzurabad byelection||HYDERABAD: The byelection to Huzurabad assembly constituency is all set to witness a contest between two Backward Class (BC) leaders who were active in the Telangana statehood movement and even went to jail during those turbulent times. TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday announced the name of one of it’s younger leaders, Gellu Srinivas Yadav, 37, as the party’s candidate in Huzurabad. With this, TRS has become the first party to formally announce its candidate for Huzurabad even before the Election Commission issues the poll notification. Although BJP has not announced its candidate, it will most probably field TRS rebel and former minister Eatala Rajendar as he is a BC leader from the Mudiraj community. KCR wanted a formidable candidate who could match Eatala’s record of participating in the statehood movement and Gellu Srinu, as he is called by his associates, fits the bill. Besides, he is a local of Veenavanka mandal in Huzurabad. His selection gives little scope to the opposition to target him as it would be a contest between two ‘udyamakarulu’. A research scholar in political science with an MA and an LLB, Gellu Srinuis is also the TRS student wing state president. His father, Gellu Mallaiah Yadav, played an active role in politics from 1985 as a TDP leader before joining TRS. Mallaiah also served as All India Yadav Maha Sabha convenor from 2000 to 2005 and Kondapaka MPTC from 2001 to 2005. At present, he is a primary agriculture cooperative society director and Rythu Bandhu Samithi coordinator. Unlike in the Nagarjunasagar bypoll when he announced the name of the candidate at the last minute, KCR named Gellu Srinu early so that a message goes out in the constituency that a young BC leader is taking on Eatala. Though several other BC candidates and leaders from the Reddy community were in the race for the TRS ticket, caste equations and survey reports from the field played a crucial role in Gellu Srinu’s selection. Of the 2.26 lakh voters in Huzurabad constituency, over 1.20 lakh belong to the BC community. The election is necessitated due to Eatala’s resignation as MLA after he was ousted from the state cabinet on allegations of grabbing assigned land belonging to Dalits. Soon after, he quit TRS and joined BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-picks-bc-candidate-to-match-eatala-in-huzurabad/articleshow/85258503.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Dehradun||80 families of Chamoli flood victims yet to get aid, HC asks DM to step in||Nainital: Six months since flash floods ravaged Chamoli and killed over 200, financial aid is yet to reach 80 families of those who died. The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday asked the Chamoli district magistrate to expedite the process and ensure they get compensated. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma asked the DM to “personally look into the plight of the families that lost their sole bread-earner in the tragedy.” The court order added, “It shall be the responsibility of the District Magistrate, Chamoli, to ensure that requisite food, the required medicines and reasonable accommodation are provided to the families on a war footing. In case, these families require any medical treatment, the same shall be extended to them by DM Chamoli.” The court was hearing a PIL on the plight of flood victims, which said families of many who died in the floods had not received help from the state government, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) or the Centre. “In the absence of any relief, families of several flood victims are forced to manage without medicines or accommodation. Some don’t even have enough to manage two square meals a day and are battling starvation,” the petition said. According to the state government, 204 died in the Chamoli flash floods on February 7. The state government has released compensation for 124 families. NTPC has told the court that it has compensated families of 140 of its workers who died in the floods. The status of the Centre’s aid is not known because it has not filed an affidavit yet. The court has asked the state government to say how the 124 families have been compensated, when the remaining 80 families will receive their dues and to place on record the recommendations of the committees examining the cause and mitigation measures for the flood. The next hearing is on September 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/80-families-of-chamoli-flood-victims-yet-to-get-aid-hc-asks-dm-to-step-in/articleshow/85250780.cms||Prashant Jha

With the lowest gear engaged, Madavi goes for an almost adventure sports-type flourish and navigates the rivulet. But unlike urban dwellers who seek thrill in such off-road experiences, Madavi is a primary school teacher who’s simply on his way to work. With primary schools closed, some zilla parishad school teachers in remote Bhamragarh taluka are travelling over tough terrain daily to reach their students’ villages, just so that education does not stop. Madavi said, “I encounter a few such water bodies on my way to Poyarkothi village where my students live. Online teaching is not an option here because of not only connectivity issues but also the limited financial resources of their parents. Majority of the parents have never owned a phone.” Bhamragarh taluka comprises dense forests, tough hilly terrain and the confluence of three major rivers, known as ‘Triveni Sangam’. During monsoons, many of its interior roads are submerged under water and dozens of villages are cut-off from civilization for days, even weeks. For a place where encounters between Naxalites and police are not uncommon, zilla parishad school teachers now have their task cut out. “We cannot allow children to drop out of the education ecosystem at all. Since physical classes are closed, we have been visiting homes of our students and teaching them. Homework is given regularly and we conduct weekly assessments too,” said Madavi. His colleagues J Burle and B Hande said education is not the only thing which teachers deliver. “From uniforms to books, we ensure that children get home delivery of all the required things that’s provided free of cost by the government,” they said. Block education officer of Bhamragarh Dharmanand Meshram said teachers have to put in the extra effort for the sake of children. “Online education is next to impossible here, so we move on to the next option. Since we can’t call primary kids back on campus, teachers visit their homes and ensure that they do not lose touch with formal education,” said Meshram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/keeping-education-afloat-teacher-wades-through-rivulets-on-bike-to-reach-students-villages/articleshow/85250782.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Aurangabad||Up to 20% rise in e-way bill generation in Aurangabad division||Aurangabad: Aurangabad division of the Goods and Service Tax (GST), which has jurisdiction over Aurangabad, Jalna and Beed districts, has witnessed a rise in e-way bill generation up to 20% in the current week. The surge is attributed to an all-out action carried out against taxmen against vehicles not possessing the mandatory e-way bill for intra-state transportation of goods above Rs 1 lakh. Joint commissioner, GST, for Aurangabad division G Sreekanth on Wednesday said the intent of tax evasion is one of the main reasons behind the transportation of goods without generating e-way. “The e-way bill generation has gone up to 20% in Aurangabad division after the crackdown against vehicles not following the law of the land. As per the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, it is mandatory to have e-way bill for transportation of identified items and articles. The movement of goods of consignment before the generation of such bill is liable for action,” he said. Aurangabad division of GST, during the latest crackdown, intercepted as many as 6,454 vehicles for the purpose of inspection of e-way bill. The two-day crackdown, which was carried out at toll plaza on Aurangabad-Jalna road, detected 27 goods vehicles without the mandatory e-way bill. The authorities have levied a total penalty worth Rs 23,96,868 from these vehicles with 15 vehicles detained for non-payment of the fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/up-to-20-rise-in-e-way-bill-generation-in-aurangabad-division/articleshow/85248058.cms||Prasad Joshi

With the increase in the number of daily flights since 2018 and addition of more flights expected later this year, current airport terminal’s capacity to accommodate 125 passengers would prove to be inadequate, said a local airport official. The Rajkot airport was handling five flights per day in 2018 which has increased to eight flights per day currently. Three more daily flights are likely to be added soon.The airport authority in Rajkot had first proposed terminal expansion in 2018. It had proposed to extend the terminal towards the runway area. As it required clearance from the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the project proposal got stuck. About two months ago, a fresh proposal was sent and this time it was proposed to extend the terminal from the front side where DGCA permission is not required.Talking to TOI, Rajkot airport director Diganta Borah said, “We have got in-principal approval for the terminal expansion and after finalizing the budget the work is expected to start by December this year.” He said that the capacity of the terminal building will be expanded to accommodate 200 passengers from the current 125.Sources, however, said that even after expansion, two flights won’t be able to land at the same time as it will congest the terminal area. Under the expansion plan, the airport authorities are planning to move the airline counter as well as security cabins. A meeting with all the stakeholders was held on Tuesday to decide on how the expansion plan could be executed without impacting operations. The new Rajkot airport is under construction at Hirasar and is expected to commence operations by end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024. Four new aprons by DecThe Rajkot airport currently has one apron to park one big aircraft. Four more aprons are under construction and it’s expected to be ready by December. These new aprons will accommodate more flights as well as non-scheduled aircraft parking, especially during VIP movement. According to sources, as the parking charges at Ahmedabad and Mumbai airports are high compared to Rajkot, some aircraft make come here for parking which will add to the revenue of the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-airport-terminal-expansion-gets-in-principal-approval/articleshow/85250849.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The HC decided to treat the letter as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and on Wednesday, appointed counsel Dushyant Mainali as an amicus curiae to look into the issue. The letter was written by teacher Monika Sharma on June 23. She claimed that frequent disruptions in internet connectivity are now affecting hundreds of children who have been trying to study at home through virtual classes. She said neither BSNL nor the mobile network works in Dharchula. The problem was accentuated especially after BSNL failed to pay its dues to the ministry of power, which then disconnected its backup link, the letter added. “As a result, I am unable to deliver education to hundreds of my students and thousands of other students are all suffering,” read the letter.

---||Hyderabad||Amendments to OBC Bill will do more harm: BC groups||Hyderabad: Various BC welfare organisations and political parties said the amendments carried out to the OBC quota Bill in Lok Sabha restoring the powers of the states to enlist their own BC castes, will cause more harm than good to the community. The National Backward Classes welfare association said there is a scope for various state governments to include economically vibrant BC castes in the quota to derive political advantage. Also, the existing BC groups will have to share their already meagre reservation percentage with new BC castes, and as such it serves no purpose until the existing OBC quota is increased from 27% to 56% at the national level in proportion to BC population in the country. Speaking to TOI after the national BC welfare association core committee meeting held here on Wednesday, association chairman R Krishnaiah termed the amendments to OBC Bill as a historic injustice to the BC communities. “Inclusion of any BC caste to avail reservation in education and employment in central and state government sectors should be done based on a comprehensive study of socio-economic status of the community. But in this case it looks like the BJP government came up with amendments with an eye on elections in Uttar Pradesh,” he said. Substantiating his claim, Krishnaiah said the Marathas in Maharashtra, Jats in Uttar Pradesh, Gujjars in Rajasthan and Patels in Gujarat are by and large socio-economically developed communities but are demanding inclusion in OBC quota list. “How can a washerman, Nayi Brahmins, Waddera, Uppara and Bestha — few of the most backward classes from Telangana compete for reservation with Marathas, Jats, Gujjars and Patels,” he asked? AIMIM and Congress have charged BJP of bringing in amendments to the OBC quota Bill with an eye on elections in Uttar Pradesh. Telangana Congress former MP and OBC MPs national forum ex-convenor V Hanumantha Rao said the Modi government must take up caste wise enumeration of BCs as part the Census operations and based on the population, extend reservation percentage by breaching the 50% cap on the quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amendments-to-obc-bill-will-do-more-harm-bc-groups/articleshow/85257794.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Coimbatore||Admission violations go uncheked as govt delays guidelines||Coimbatore: Academicians said the state government was too late to release the college admission guidelines and they won’t serve any purposes, as the arts and science colleges have almost completed the admission process.It is to be noted that the higher education department releases the guidelines for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses in government, aided, university constituent and self-financing colleges of arts and science every year to ensure transparency and prevent malpractices.While the arts and science colleges were asked to issue applications only from July 26 after the Class XII state board results were released on July 19, many self-financing and aided colleges had started the admission process much in advance.The admission guidelines were, however, released only on August 6, by when many colleges had completed the admission process.Pointing out that the colleges were ought to display fee structure, prepare rank lists before admitting students and follow reservation systems, academicians said many colleges hadn’t followed the norms this year. The violations, they said, went unchecked in the absence of admission guidelines.A city college professor said aided colleges had completed admissions to the self-financing courses first, while keeping aided courses open. “Even meritorious students were forced to pay hefty sums and join the courses.” Unlike professional colleges, self-financing colleges don’t have uniform fee structure.C Pichandy, former general secretary, Association of University Teachers, said they had been requesting the state government to release the admission guidelines well in advance, but to no avail.“It is not possible to monitor admission related violations if the guidelines are issued so late, especially when the office of the regional joint director of collegiate education, which is the competent authority to check such violations, is short-staffed,” he said.The admission related violations were very serious in nature in the district where college managements are very influential, he said while suggesting a single window system for admission as an ideal solution to check the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/admission-violations-go-uncheked-as-govt-delays-guidelines/articleshow/85255657.cms||Sampath Kumar

Besides, an additional sum of Rs 300 crore will be allotted to the state under the central road infrastructure fund. The funds were approved by Nitin Gadkari, Union minister of road transport and highways, during a meeting with Uttarakhand chief minister Puskhar Singh Dhami in New Delhi on Wednesday. Dhami also requested Gadkari to approve a two-lane tunnel from Dehradun to Tehri Lake to reduce the distance between the two places. The request is under consideration. Earlier in the day, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami also met defence minister Rajnath Singh at his residence in New Delhi. During the meeting, which went on for more than 30 minutes, strategic issues and proposed infrastructure projects in Uttarakhand were discussed. CM Dhami spoke to Singh on the requirement of upgrading the proposed strategic narrow-gauge Tanakpur-Bageshwar rail line to broad-gauge. The CM told the Union minister that the proposed railway line is strategically very important due to its location near the international border with China and Nepal and that a narrow-gauge rail line will not solve strategic purposes. Dhami added that besides fulfilling strategic goals, the broad-gauge rail line will also help in connecting new business centres in the region. In a bid to tap the tourism potential of the region, the Indian Railways had ordered a survey for laying a narrow-gauge railway line between Tanakpur and Bageshwar. The CM also requested the defence minister to ensure financial support from the central government for establishing infrastructural facilities in the proposed Sainik School at Jakholi in the Rudraprayag district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-get-rs-1k-cr-for-construction-of-national-highways/articleshow/85250812.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Dehradun||55% of the last 20 km stretch of Delhi-Doon expressway has ‘critical wildlife crossings’, finds WII report||Dehradun: A report prepared by Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has highlighted the status of wildlife in the 20km-long vulnerable patch of the Shivalik Foothills that also houses the Shivalik Elephant Reserve. This 20 km-stretch is part of the proposed 210 km-long Delhi-Dehradun elevated expressway route that is expected to reduce the travel time between the national capital and Dehradun from five to three hours. The proposed road in the Shivalik foothills landscape will pass through the wildlife-rich habitats of the Shivalik Forest Division, Uttar Pradesh, Rajaji Tiger Reserve and Dehradun Forest Division. For study purpose, WII scientists divided this 20 km road into three zones — Ganeshpur to Mohand (4.9 km), Mohand to Asharodi (13.3 km) and Asharodi to Mohbewala in Dehradun (1.8 km). WII installed 81 cameras from April to July 2020 and spotted 25 species, including elephants, leopards, barking deer and sambar in the stretch. WII scientists Bivash Pandav and Bilal Habib — who conducted the study — found that nearly 11.15 km (almost 55%) of this 20 km stretch is critical as it is used by wild animals to cross from one side of the forest to another. Accordingly, the experts have suggested building ‘underpasses and elevated roads in these wildlife crossing zones to mitigate the adverse impacts of the proposed expressway on wildlife. Highlighting the importance of the Shivalik landscape, WII report states, “This contiguous forested tract happens to be the western-most distribution limit of some of the endangered species such as tiger, elephant, king cobra and the great hornbill.” The report titled ‘Rapid assessment of wildlife and suggested mitigation measures for the development of Delhi-Dehradun highway in the Shivalik hills’ reads, “The 20 km stretch of NH72 between Ganeshpur and Mohand though largely passes through the Shivalik Forest Division of UP, ecologically, it abuts Rajaji Tiger Reserve and is a major road with considerable vehicular traffic in the western-most part of Terai Arc Landscape (TAL), a ‘major conservation landscape’ of the country.” Fearing a loss of biodiversity in the region, wildlife activists have been opposing the construction of this elevated road since the idea of the project was first mooted. Kritika Desai, a Dehradun-based ecologist, told TOI, “There is no need for this elevated road as Delhi is already connected with Dehradun through the eastern side of Rajaji Tiger Reserve via Motichur. Why do they want to fragment the western side of the Rajaji too? Where will the jumbos, the leopards and the tigers go?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/55-of-the-last-20-km-stretch-of-delhi-doon-expressway-has-critical-wildlife-crossings-finds-wii-report/articleshow/85250807.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Malls to open at 50% intake for fully vaxxed, eateries till 10pm||MUMBAI: After opening up suburban trains in Mumbai for vaccinated commuters, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday carried out a second round of unlocking, easing more curbs related to hospitality, shopping and wellness, starting August 15. With cases plateauing for over two months, there was pressure on the MVA government to relax curbs. Based on the Covid task force’s recommendations, CM Uddhav Thackeray had resisted extending restaurant timings until now. But once access to local trains was allowed, pressure to open up more sectors intensified. Malls are now allowed to open till 10pm all days of the week, but only fully immunised visitors (14 days after the 2nd dose) will be given entry. Mall staff need to be vaccinated. Dining-in at restaurants and bars is allowed till 10pm through the week but at 50% occupancy. Their staff must be vaccinated and wear masks. Restaurants now hope to get some business, eye midnight deadlineIn fresh relaxations of Covid restrictions in the state, shops, salons, gyms, spas have also been allowed to remain open till 10pm. However, multiplexes and places of worship will stay closed. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has laid emphasis on giving more relaxations to those who are fully vaccinated as it encourages vaccination. As per new guidelines issued by the state government while extending timings, restaurant patrons have to wear a mask while waiting for a table or till food arrives. Restaurants have also been asked to keep a few windows or doors open for better ventilation. Sanitisation of tables and washrooms must be carried out and disposal of used tissues and masks done in a systematic and hygienic manner. Sherry Bhatia, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India, said, “Restaurants will now be able to get some business, which was just impossible while operating until 4pm. The industry, including owners and people employed in it, has suffered over 16 months of income deprivation.” Restaurant owners had met and lobbied with government officials and ministers to seek concessions from Covid-19 restrictions. In some districts, shop owners had threatened to flout the lockdown. In fact, in Pune and Nagpur, relaxations were given earlier this week due to pressure from the trading community. Officials said that even while allowing malls to re-open, government was considering keeping them closed during the weekends. But the task force suggested that since the rule permits only those fully vaccinated to enter, there was no need for any other restriction . Shops can now remain open till 10pm, even on weekends. Ditto, salons, gyms, yoga centres, spas. A maximum of 200 guests are now allowed in open air banquet halls or 50% of the capacity, whichever is less; for enclosed AC halls, maximum is 100 guests or 50% of the capacity. To promote staggered office timings, the state has also allowed private offices and industries to stay open 24x7. “In this system, not more than 25% employees can be called in on one shift," said public health minister Rajesh Tope. Offices with 100% fully vaccinated staff can function at full capacity, he added. However, government has not decided to open up auditoriums, theatres and multiplexes. Same goes for places of worship. Meanwhile, a day after the state school education department issued a circular declaring that schools in urban and rural areas can reopen for offline education from August 17, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday decided to consult the state Covid Task Force on the decision. Tope said the task force had already said that they were not in favour of reopening schools given the that the third wave may affect the younger population. Officials say that CM too is not comfortable about reopening schools and may stay the decision.

My leaders (O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami) have already issued a detailed statement,” he said during a brief interaction with reporters at Tuticorin airport.Velumani said the former fisheries minister, D Jayakumar, had already spoken about the DVAC searches. The Thondamuthur MLA said the DVAC searches weren’t the reason behind his visit to the temple, which he didn’t name. “I was supposed to offer prayers in the temple on Tuesday afternoon, stay here at night and return on Wednesday. But, I could not travel as planned because of the raid. I had darshan today,” he said.Earlier in the day, he tweeted that the searches were politically motivated. “I thank party coordinator and deputy leader of opposition (O Panneerselvam) and joint coordinator and leader of opposition (Edappadi K Palaniswami), MLAs, former ministers, party functionaries, friends and general public for standing by the side of truth and supporting me at a time when DMK party has indulged in political vendetta against me,” he said in the tweet.Meanwhile, the AIADMK on Wednesday slammed the DMK government for the DVAC searches at the office of Namadhu Puratchi Thalaivi Amma daily, the party organ, without following due procedures.In a statement, OPS and EPS said it amounted to attack on the freedom of press. “The searches should be done in the presence of the proprietor or incharge, as per the law. But it wasn’t followed. The searches took place using duplicate keys and breaking the lock. It is legally punishable,” they said, warning legal action against the “trespassers”.They said chief minister M IK Stalin, who also holds the portfolio of home department, was responsible for the “attack” on the newspaper and demanded action against policemen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/velumani-calls-raid-political-vendetta-visits-temple/articleshow/85255693.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Will look into amending tree act for rural areas, says Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray||NAGPUR: Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday said he would look into the demand by greens seeking amendments in the Maharashtra Felling of Trees (Regulation) Act, 1964 on the lines of Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975. TOI, on August 11, reported how trees are facing the axe even for unwanted road widening projects in the state. Last month, Thackeray’s ministry took a bold decision by amending Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975 granting powers to a state level authority if any project needed to fell 200 trees. The amended Act also allows to declare 50-year-old trees as ‘heritage’ trees with an aim to increase the forest and tree cover. Besides, it also makes mandatory to plant trees equivalent to the age of the tree in case felling of trees is allowed for development projects. Greens want similar amendments Maharashtra Felling of Trees (Regulation) Act, 1964, which applies to rural areas. Thackeray said, “I will check on it.” “Most of the tree cover in the state is in rural areas, but SDOs are empowered to permit felling of trees while in case of Scheduled trees, a range forest officer (RFO) is the tree officer. The tree felling business is considered to be a lucrative posting in the forest department. Earlier, there have been proposals to hand over the said Act to the social forestry department (SFD) as their RFOs work at taluka level but it never happened,” said senior forest officials. A top environment ministry official on anonymity said, “Yes, it is absolutely necessary to amend it, but the said Act is dealt by revenue and forest ministry. However, Aaditya Thackeray can make it happen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-look-into-amending-tree-act-for-rural-areas-thackeray/articleshow/85250815.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||Delhi court orders framing of charges against Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal||NEW DELHI: A city court on Wednesday ordered framing of charges against AAP MLAs Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal for the alleged assault on former chief secretary Anshu Prakash in 2018, saying prima facie a case for the offence was made out against them. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sachin Gupta ordered framing of charges under IPC sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (common intention). “The allegations levelled by the complainant against Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal find corroboration from the statement of the star witness, VK Jain recorded under Section 164 CrPC, which is sufficient at this stage to prima facie show their complicity in the commission of the offence,” the court said. The court said the plea raised on behalf of the accused that no sanction was taken to prosecute them held no ground as it was not necessary when the offence alleged to have been committed had nothing to do with discharge of a public servant’s duty. “It is well settled that sanction is required to be obtained when the offence complained of against the public servant is attributable to the discharge of his public duty or has a direct nexus therewith. Sanction is not necessary when the offence has nothing to with discharge of his duty. Since in the present case, too, the offence complained of has nothing to do with discharge of duty of accused persons, no sanction is required,” it said. It was further held that other contentions raised on behalf Khan and Jarwal regarding delay of about 12 hours in lodging of the complaint, further delay of approximately nine hours in getting medical examination of the complainant conducted, not naming Jarwal in the first complaint, progressive improvements made by the complainant in his subsequent statements given to police, etc, were factors that were not sufficient to discharge the accused persons. Senior advocate N Hariharan, appearing for some of the accused, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, argued that Jain had not stated anything in his initial statement against MLAs Khan and Jarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-orders-framing-of-charges-against-khan-jarwal/articleshow/85252984.cms||Usha Das

Sulur block, another industrial suburb, contributed 7% of the total positive cases as per the bulletin. Karamadai, perhaps the biggest block in terms of jurisdiction and population, contributed another 8% of the daily cases.“People from other districts and states visit industrial units at these places and cases tend to emerge from these units,” said Sulur block medical officer Dr Omar Faroque. “There were only two positive cases on Tuesday. But 10 cases were reported on Wednesday. Most of them were outsiders. We have vaccinated most of the industrial population with the first dose. Cases may come down after we administer the second dose to most people,” he said.With seven village panchayat and two town panchayats, the jurisdiction of Karamadai block includes a large part of Mettupalayam.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Fire mishaps put Punjagutta flyover under safety radar||HYDERABAD: Three fires in less than two years on the arterial Punjagutta flyover have led to questions on its safety. While officials maintained that there has been no structural damage and it was safe, civil engineers taken by TOI to check the 2.1 km flyover said that any delay in thorough inspection could have catastrophic consequences. The flyover’s scaffolding had collapsed while under construction in September 2007. Luckily, a major tragedy was averted and only one person had died then and a few others injured as there were few vehicles under it. On Tuesday, when TOI visited the flyover with civil engineers, they found fire damage at three different places. A visual assessment by two different engineers showed expulsion of concrete from the surface layer at places exposed to heat, damage to the rubber bearing pads between the deck slab and pier, and smoke damage. Among the multiple fires under the flyover, the biggest one occurred in March this year which officials attributed to a short-circuit in lights placed near the vertical garden on the piers. The other two fires occurred near the Punjagutta cross-junction. The always busy flyover connects prime areas such as Begumpet, Banjara Hills, Punjagutta, Somajiguda and also leads to chief minister’s office Pragati Bhavan, which is located about 500 metres from the spot where the last fire broke out. Also, several major shopping outlets are located around the area. A survey by Indian Federation of Road Safety in 2016 had said that nearly 2 lakh vehicles take the Punjagutta flyover and road beneath every hour. Pointing out at one of the bearing pads on a pier opposite to Y2K restaurant, S P Anchuri, vice-president (south), Structural Engineers World Congress, said, “The primary role of these bearing pads made from industrial rubber is to evenly distribute the load of vehicles, absorb vibrations and maintain structural stability. But the black soot all around it indicates that the bearing pads in some places have been exposed to intense heat which can melt the rubber material. Any damage to the bearing pads might compromise the structural integrity of the bridge.” “The authorities are enclosing or wrapping the piers with vertical gardens and fibre murals which are indirectly turning out to be the cause for the damage. Aesthetics should be a combination of both beauty and function without putting people’s lives at risk,” Anchuri added. Another civil engineer Raghunandhan Singh, who also inspected the flyover on Tuesday, said, “When concrete is exposed to fire, it can experience both mechanical and chemical changes including peeling of some cement from the surface of the finished slab. The expulsion of portions of concrete from the surface layer is clearly visible here (on the pier opposite Kalyan Jewellers and Y2K restaurant). We must assess the external cracking to find out if it was due to thermal expansion and dehydration of concrete.” Singh also said that to avoid further damage authorities should render the external surface with modified repair mortar and, most importantly, check if the bearing pads have been affected. “The fire in March was so big that the area had to be cordoned off. I did not see any officials coming to inspect the damage after the incident,” said Mohammad Afzal, a security guard who works at a jewellery store near the spot. GHMC chief engineer (maintenance) M Devanand, however, said that there was no need for repairs. “The outer layer might have turned black due to smoke caused by the fire but there is no structural damage. We just need to paint it.” Prof R Pradeep Kumar, head of earthquake engineering research centre at IIIT-Hyderabad, said, “To safeguard flyovers from fires, structural engineers must study the extent of the damage and then take up both, repair and retrofit. While repair is necessary to remove the soot or smoke damage, retrofitting is done by a competent structural engineer who can test the area exposed to fires, identify damages and tell exactly what kind of repair work is required there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fire-mishaps-put-punjagutta-flyover-under-safety-radar/articleshow/85258506.cms||Moulika.KV

Ward number 6 of Kadayampatti town panchayat houses more than 250 families. They were using a pathway on a land for several decades to reach the main road. M Chandrasekaran, one of the villagers, said farmers were also using the road to transport their produce to the weekly shandy regularly. Similarly, ambulances too use the same road to reach the village and main road. According to the villagers, if the road is inaccessible they will have to take a longer route to reach their destination. Recently, the Kadayampatti town panchayat officials had constructed a wall across the pathway. Hence, the villagers are forced to use take the longer route. The villagers said that since pathway was on a poramboke land, no one can claim its ownership. An official from the town panchayat said they wanted to utilise the poramboke land and the villagers were creating an issue unnecesserily. The villagers had submitted a petition to Omalur AIADMK MLA R Mani on Monday. The MLA assured that he would look into the issue. He said he would try and arrange for an alternative route, if the wall can not be demolished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/villagers-urge-officials-to-raze-wall-on-road/articleshow/85255723.cms||---
---||Delhi||Conspiracy hatched to topple an elected govt, claims Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia lashed out at the BJP-led central government on Wednesday, alleging that it had conspired to fabricate false cases against Arvind Kejriwal and “treated him like a terrorist” as the party was scared of his popularity as a chief minister. After a Delhi court discharged Kejriwal, Sisodia and nine other AAP legislators in a case of alleged assault on former Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash in 2018, Sisodia said this decision had also increased the confidence of people in the judiciary and expressed his gratitude. The allegations were so baseless that the court refused to even frame charges, he said. “Today is the day of victory of justice and truth in Delhi,” said Sisodia. “Considering the truth is in front of everyone, Modi-ji’s central government and BJP should apologise to CM Kejriwal and the people of Delhi who chose him.” Sisodia alleged that the case was “hatched” as part of a conspiracy to topple a state government, fearing the increasing popularity of an elected CM. “Officers have been forcibly stopped from working for public good for six months. Today, the Centre has become so busy in all this that the country’s system is failing,” Sisodia said. “This failure can also be seen in the mismanagement of the Covid-19 crisis.” “BJP is scared of Arvind Kejriwal’s popularity, so a fake FIR was made against him using Delhi Police, and his house and office were raided. He was treated like a terrorist,” he said. “This is the first incident after Independence when such a raid was conducted in the house and office of a sitting CM. Police kept interrogating him for six hours continuously.” False and fabricated conspiracies are being hatched from day one to obstruct the government elected by the people of Delhi, Sisodia alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conspiracy-hatched-to-topple-an-elected-govt-claims-sisodia/articleshow/85253011.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra govt flouting rules to upgrade IFS posts||NAGPUR: The state government is in frequent violation of Indian Forest Service (Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations 1966, issued by the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensioners, department of personnel & training (DoPT), by arbitrarily and discriminatingly promoting certain IFS officers. According to papers in possession of TOI, on December 28, 2018, the state government promoted 1987 batch IFS officer Nitin Kakodkar as PCCF (wildlife). This was despite Kakodkar being junior to two IFS officers of 1986 batch — G Sai Prakash and Praveen Srivastava. As per the DoPT, IFS cadre review is done every five years. The next review is due in 2021 but it has not been done yet. The state government is upgrading posts of IFS officers on its own for two years, as permitted. However, officers are holding such posts even after the period of two years has expired. But recently, the state government did not apply the same rule to APCCF TK Choubey, an IFS officer of 1987 batch, who retired on June 30, 2021. His name was cleared by the departmental promotion committee (DPC) in December. Earlier, there have been IFS officers who were promoted as PCCFs for one day. To pave way for Kakodkar, the government went a step ahead by promoting his seniors Sai Prakash and Srivastava as PCCF (budget, planning & development) and PCCF (information, technology & policy), respectively by temporarily upgrading these posts of APCCF rank. This is in clear violation of Indian Forest Service (Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations 1966 issued on August 12, 2016. The period of upgradation of the posts of PCCF (BPD) & PCCF (ITP) was two years — from February 1, 2019 till January 30, 2021. Beyond this period, the government should have taken approval from the central government under sub-rule 2 of Rule 4 of Indian Forest Service (Cadre) Rules, 1966, which has not been obtained yet. Hence, these two posts of PCCFs should have been downgraded to APCCFs and officers appointed to these posts should have been downgraded as APCCFs with immediate effect, but the state government is silent on the issue. The government has no powers to upgrade any post temporarily beyond two years. In another case, the government made arbitrary use of its powers when it temporarily upgraded the post of chief conservator of forests (mantralaya) to APCCF (mantralaya) on August 14, 2018, to favour a specific officer. The same post of APCCF (mantralaya) was downgraded to CCF (mantralaya) for the period from December 23, 2019 and June 22, 2020 for Arvind Apte. It was extended till August 2020. Apte is presently occupying this post as joint secretary. Talking to TOI, Apte said, “As per cadre review done in 2016, the post of CCF (mantralaya) is a sanctioned post and hence no approval of the central government is needed.” Apte added that the temporarily created post of PCCF (production & management) has central government approval till January 31, 2022. Besides, the other post of APCCF (mangrove cell) has approval till April 5, 2022. On the upgraded posts of PCCF (BPD) & PCCF (ITP), a proposal has been submitted to the central government on January 5, 2021. “We have also sent two reminders on January 7 and April 16, 2021, but approval has not been received yet.” TOI also tried to contact principal secretary (forest) B Venugopal Reddy and PCCF (HoFF) G Sai Prakash but there was no response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-govt-flouting-rules-to-upgrade-ifs-posts/articleshow/85250845.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||India||Government silent on removing 50% cap even as OBC bill gets nod||NEW DELHI: The bill to restore the right of state governments to draw up their own OBC lists for reservations in jobs and educational institutes was unanimously passed by Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, even as the government remained non-committal about calls to remove the 50% ceiling on quotas and a caste-based census. The Constitution (127th Amendment) Bill, which was also passed unanimously by Lok Sabha on Tuesday, and will now become law after the President’s assent, was eventually passed after a division vote with 187 members voting in its favour and none against. The treasury benches and opposition parties tried to score political points during the over five-hour debate, which also saw many opposition members demanding removal of the 50% cap, a caste-based census and even reservations in the private sector. BJP accused Congress for not doing enough for SCs, STs and OBCs despite being in office for decades. The opposition, while welcoming the bill, said BJP was eyeing the forthcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states, and had even used “kamandal” against the “Mandal” (commission) in the past. BJP members like Sushil Kumar Modi, Dharmendra Pradhan and Bhupender Yadav, among others, questioned the failure of successive Congress governments to empower SCs, STs, OBCs and economically-weaker sections. The government understands the “sentiments” behind the calls for removal of the 50% cap, imposed by the Supreme Court 30 years ago, but it will need to be studied and discussed further, social justice minister Virender Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-silent-on-removing-50-cap-even-as-obc-bill-gets-nod/articleshow/85259601.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Day after SC bail order, supplementary chargesheet filed against Azam, son; book duo for criminal conspiracy||BAREILLY: A day after the Supreme Court directed that bail be granted to senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan and his son Mohammad Abdullah in a case of alleged cheating and forgery of documents by them for getting a second PAN card, the UP Police on Wednesday filed a supplementary charge sheet in a related case, charging the duo under the non-bailable section of criminal conspiracy. Khan and his son will now have to file a fresh bail application in order to get bail in this FIR, which was filed in 2019 in Ganj police station (Rampur) and pertains to the alleged forgery of a birth certificate. Khan’s wife is also named in the FIR. The Allahabad high court had given conditional bail to all three accused in the case last year in October following which Azam’s wife was released from prison. A district government counsel, who did not wish to be named, told TOI that in cases where supplementary chargesheet is filed with fresh charges — even when the bail is approved by a court — the applicant has to apply for bail in the new sections that have been added. This comes as a fresh setback for the father and son, who have been in jail since February 2020, and who were granted bail by the apex court on Tuesday. The court had observed that since the charge sheet has been filed in the case, bail be granted to them after the trial court records the statement of the informant within two weeks. Azam had allegedly helped his son to get a second PAN card using forged documents. The incorrect date of birth enabled him to contest the assembly elections in 2017 from Suar constituency in Rampur. Several cases of forgery are registered against the duo, but they have got bail in most of them. Police told TOI they added section 120B (criminal conspiracy) in an FIR registered in Gang station in which it was alleged that Khan helped his son procure a second birth certificate with fake documents. Rampur’s additional SP Sansaar Singh said, “We have filed a supplementary chargesheet against Azam Khan, his wife and his son in this case and added section 120B as there was clear evidence of criminal conspiracy.” Asked about the timing of the supplementary chargesheet, Singh said “we had been working on the case”. “We took action after we received an application from the main applicant in this case,” he said. Akash Saxena, a BJP worker, who is the main complainant in many cases against Khan, said he had given a written application to police — dated August 2 — in which he had pointed out that the accused must be booked under the more stringent section of 120B.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/day-after-sc-bail-order-supplementary-charge-sheet-filed-against-azam-son-book-duo-for-criminal-conspiracy/articleshow/85250884.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

In a statement on Wednesday, Vanathi said the raid was ordered by chief minister M K Stalin out of political vendetta. “Stalin nurses a personal grudge against Velumani as DMK could not win even in a single constituency in Coimbatore district. Since DMK is desperate to win in Kongu region in the local body elections, the party wanted to demoralise Velumani and intimidate his associates since Velumani is a stumbling block for DMK’s growth,” she said. Heaping praises on the former minister, Vanathi said that Velumani played a crucial role in saving the previous AIADMK government and brought a number of development projects to Coimbatore.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vanathi-condemns-dvac-searches/articleshow/85255742.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The policemen took video of the leopards. The animals were later seen jumping down the tree. The video shows two persons disturbing the animals by throwing stones at them. The cops also posted the videos on social media which went viral. The incident took place on Tuesday morning when the three cops from Gobarwahi police station and their two friends were returning from Dongri (Bujruk).Bhandara SP Vasant Jadhav, who is a nature lover himself and chairman of district tiger cell, told TOI that the two friends of the policemen pelted the stones. “It is really shameful that the incident took place in front of cops. The animals are not dogs to be shooed away,” he said.Jadhav further said that what is more shocking that cops did not stop their friends from pelting stones at the leopards. “I will take action against these policemen,” the SP said.According to state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe, the act of the two persons implies hunting and invites action under Section 9 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. He demanded that they be arrested immediately.Forest officials are yet to arrest the two persons. Confirming the incident, Bhandara deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) SB Bhalavi said, “We will register a preliminary offence report (POR) on Thursday. ACF Saket Shende will conduct an inquiry.”On Tuesday, RFO Nitesh Dhanvijay tried to reach the two persons but failed to zero in on them. They are likely to be booked on Thursday after forest officials visit Gobarwahi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-watch-as-2-friends-pelt-stones-at-leopards-to-face-action/articleshow/85250908.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||SHO of Adarsh Nagar police station suspended after he misreported firing: Cops||NEW DELHI: The SHO of Adarsh Nagar police station, CP Bhardwaj, was suspended on Tuesday night after an incident of firing on August 6 was allegedly misreported to the area DCP, according to senior officers. Bhardwaj had reportedly told his seniors that it was a case of self-inflicted injury but it turned out that the gunshot wound was received in a crossfire and that even the SHO had fired one round. His suspension generated more than the usual buzz because it coincided with a video clip circulating in social media in which Bhardwaj had read out the riot act to a man, who had a saffron cloth around his neck, for intimidating a member of a particular community over a mazar at Azadpur flyover. On August 6, an incident of firing was reported in the Lal Bagh area in which at least two people received gunshot wounds. Identified as Pravesh and Karan, they were undergoing treatment at a hospital and a police officer was deployed for their security. Later, Pravesh managed to flee, following which the cop on duty was suspended. Later, some persons involved in the incident were arrested, said an officer. The SHO, according to the officer, reportedly told the DCP that it was a case of self-inflicted gunshot injuries whereas it was learnt that the wounds were received in the crossfire and that Bhardwaj himself had fired. Information in this regard was registered in the daily diary, after a lapse of 18 hours. The DCP then recommended departmental action against the SHO and his suspension. Bhardwaj had also reached the scene of crime late, said sources. “His conduct was unprofessional. Casual handling of PCR calls was another reason. He had earlier too not informed seniors about some incidents and, in some cases, tried to downplay the crime,” said an officer, adding that in the video that went viral, he was in civil clothes. “The person being questioned in the video did not object to the questions thrown at him. In fact, he did not give any complaint. To threaten any person saying he would detain them under Delhi Police Act is not justified, especially when you’re not in uniform. An inquiry is being carried out with regard to the mazar incident too,” the officer added. The video shows the SHO ticking off a man — with a saffron gamcha around his neck — who was aggressively questioning a man about the mazar. The SHO told the man that he had no right to put pressure on anyone and had to take legal recourse if he had any grievance. When asked to speak to the camera, the SHO said that according to a Supreme Court ruling, Delhi government has formed a committee to settle the status of such religious structures and that was the right forum to approach. The man then began aggressively questioning the SHO about his views on a temple being “demolished” in Chandni Chowk. This temple had been shifted by the authorities, following court orders, to facilitate the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project. The SHO then warned the man that he would take legal action against him and pushed him away from the spot. “I intervened to protect the citizens of my area. The man in the video was identified as Vijay, who had come from Jahangirpuri. He could give no reason for being there. I took him with me as crowds from both communities had started gathering. Later, I explained the process to him, made him have a cup of tea and let him go,” the SHO told TOI. About the firing incident, he said: “Yes, I fired some rounds. I had to do it for the safety of others as well my policemen. There was an exchange of fire between two gangs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sho-suspended-after-hemisreported-firing-cops/articleshow/85253065.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Mosque opens operation theatre to heal the poor for free in Old City||HYDERABAD: It is like an answer to the prayers of the afflicted poor in the Old City. A mosque in Shaheennagar has now opened an operation theatre (OT) for minor surgical procedures and is the only one outside Osmania General Hospital (OGH) in the Old City where surgeries are conducted free of charge. Masjid Omar Shifa, which has been running a primary health care centre, has now opened the OT for better medical services to the poor. A dedicated team of doctors runs the OT with funds from NGO American Muslim Physicians of Indian Origin (AMPIO). Apart from the full-fledged OT, the mosque runs a dental clinic, a community ophthalmology centre and a non-communicable diseases consultation desk. All the medical services are free for all cutting across religious lines. City NGO Helping Hand Foundation (HHF) manages the OT and other medical facilities. “Most areas surrounding the mosque health centre faced inundation last year and continue to face problems of overflowing drains and flooding. Consequently, these slums are endemic to water-borne and skin diseases. HHF in collaboration with AMPIO has been taking care of the health needs of people in over 20 slums,” HHF managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari said. With about 700 patients daily, the mosque health centre is almost like a mini hospital for the poor. Most patients come for diabetes, hypertension and other chronic diseases. As complications thrown up by lifestyle diseases often require surgical procedures which many cannot afford, the OT at the mosque takes care of these sections. Around 3% of diabetics visiting the mosque health centre have diabetic foot. Cases of patients with corns, lipomas, keloids, ingrown nails, benign fibroadenomas, burns, sebaceous cysts and non-healing ulcers are also reported regularly. “Poor hygiene and non-compliance to treatment has led to complications in many patients requiring surgical intervention,” said Dr Arif Hussain, general surgeon at the mosque clinic. So far, 25 minor surgeries have been performed at the mosque’s operation theatre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mosque-opens-ot-to-heal-the-poor-for-free-in-old-city/articleshow/85258523.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: With long weekend over Independence-Day, tourism boom in region||NAGPUR: In an added attraction for tourists visiting Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), the buffer zone will start kayaking facility at lakes in Mohurli and Gondmohadi from Thursday. A ‘treasure hunt’ has also been organized in MP Pench. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Deputy director (buffer) G Guruprasad said, “Buffer is drawing crowds like core area owing to regular tiger sightings. Tourists have been reporting regular tiger sightings in Nimdhela, Sikada, Alizanjha, Dewada, Agarzari and Junona safari areas. On August 3, a tigress with three cubs was sighted in Agarzari zone too.” “All online bookings are full. Besides, there is demand for discretionary quota too. As there are no rains in the past few days, people have been enjoying safaris in a landscape that has turned beautiful,” said Guruprasad. The kayaking facility seems to have been introduced keeping in mind the influx of tourists during the weekend. Most of the tourists are flocking to wildlife destinations, mostly Tadoba and MP Pench, with three consecutive holidays from August 14-16 ensuring a full house for resorts. “August 14 is a Saturday followed by Sunday and Parsi New Year on Monday. All accommodation facilities in the buffer zone are almost full in Mohurli and Kolara,” said naturalist Himanshu Bagde. Not only wildlife areas, there have been visitors like Swapnil Ajne, whose group of 11 members will be visiting Chikhaldara hill station, though there is no room there. “No hotels and lodges are available in Chikhaldara from August 14 to 16, but we still plan to go and stay at Paratwada, 40km away. Similar is the situation in Pachmarhi, where last-minute travellers are facing difficulty in getting accommodation.” “After being at home for long due to Covid-19 restrictions, most of the visitors are from Vidarbha region. Tourists are avoiding long-distance travel to other states owing to corona fears. A number of tourists are visiting TATR from Hyderabad also,” said Bagde. MP Pench Local Advisory Committee (LAC) member Sandeep Singh said in Pench almost all the resorts and lodges are booked during the three-day vacation. “To attract tourists, a group of dozen resorts has organized a treasure hunt on August 15, to villages in the buffer zone,” he said. “The resorts have tied up with safari vehicles, who will take tourists 70-80km around forested villages in the buffer, to showcase the uniqueness of the villages. It may be art and culture, folk dance, delicacies, historic monuments etc. The guests will win prizes for exploring these activities,” said Singh. Wildlife lover Nikhil Abhyankar says, “Resorts have been receiving many inquiries at short notice for bookings. People are booking two safaris with one night stay. Apart from safari, there is a need to start other attractions like cycling and machan stays.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-long-weekend-over-i-day-tourism-boom-in-region/articleshow/85253184.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

In the past, the RSS offshoot under former mayor Kalpana Pande had ensured that its office bearers were appointed to important posts of vice chancellor and pro-VC, say NU officials.In the appointment of deans, Manch loyalists were rewarded while ignoring merit, said sources. One of the new appointees does not even know how to operate a computer, and his presentation and other documents were prepared in the chamber of a top NU official by the latter’s clerks, they said. “Their names were already finalised, and the interview process was just a formality,” officials told TOI.New dean of science and technology faculty Prashant Maheshwary was director of JD College of Engineering, where VC Subhash Chaudhari was principal and therefore he was obvious choice despite many highly qualified candidates having vast experience being in the fray.Even officiating dean Rajesh Singru, who held the post for 10 months, is principal of Tai Golwarkar College at Ramtek, which is aligned to the RSS. However, the Manch’s staunch loyalists were granted preference even over the Sangh candidate.New humanities dean Dattatray Watmode, of Sharadchandra Pawar Arts and Commerce College, Butibori, is a Shikshan Manch office bearer. He was selected even as more qualified and experienced candidates like Management Council member Urmila Dabir, also from the Manch, and history professor Shyam Koretti, were also interviewed.The officials said NU retained commerce and management dean Sanjay Kavishwar, as he was the only applicant for the interview, though the administration could have re-advertised the post as per rules.The university also retained Rajashree Vaishnav as dean of interdisciplinary studies, but on ad-hoc basis, as no one from Shikshan Manch were in the fray. NU declared other aspirants as “not found suitable”, but the officials revealed that there was political pressure on the administration in this case.Senior academician Baban Taywade slammed VC Subhash Chaudhari, pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe and other top brass for ignoring merit in selection of deans. “It’s an old practice to appoint candidates from the panel which is in dominant position in NU. However, the candidates should at least be capable of doing justice to their appointments. Many qualified and experienced candidates from the Manch and RSS itself were ignored in the quest to reward loyalists. Ultimately, students would suffer due to wrong choices. Every party should play politics, but not at the cost of students,” he told TOI.THE ALLEGATIONS* Science & engg dean Prashant Maheshwary is from VC’s JD Engg College* Humanities dean Dattatray Watmode is Shikshan Manch office bearer* Commerce & humanities dean Sanjay Kavishwar was lone candidate, still NU failed to re-advertise post* Interdisciplinary studies dean Rajashree Vaishnav was retained as no other candidate was found suitable||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/eyebrows-raised-as-shikshan-manch-candidates-named-new-nu-deans/articleshow/85250886.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: If daily oxygen requirement crosses 700MT, restrictions will return||MUMBAI: Even as more Covid-19-related curbs have been eased, the state has decided that a "complete lockdown" will be re-imposed if the requirement for medical oxygen rises to 700 million tonnes (MT) per day. This threshold level for bringing back the restrictions was cleared by the state cabinet on Wednesday while approving the easing of restrictions from August 15. Currently, the state has the capacity to produce 1,300MT of liquid medical oxygen daily and government is setting up an additional 450 medical-grade oxygen plants, of which 141 have started operations. Certain units are also augmenting their supply. "With all this, our production can go up to 1,700-2,000MT,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope. Tope said, “At the peak of the second wave, our oxygen requirement had touched 1,800MT and we had to bring oxygen from other states as well. As per projections, the peak of the third wave will be 1.5 times higher than the second. It is projected that oxygen requirement could go as high as 3,800MT per day and hence the decision that restrictions will be brought back once oxygen requirement touches 700MT.” . “In the third wave we cannot rely on any other state for help as they too may be in a difficult situation,” he said. Officials said this was one of the lessons from the second wave. “The state delayed in locking down during the second wave. Mild restrictions were imposed on April 5, nearly 1.5 months after the beginning of the second wave. This decision (to introduce a threshold for bringing back curbs) was taken to ensure that there is no need to build political consensus once cases start surging," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-if-daily-oxygen-requirement-crosses-700mt-restrictions-will-return/articleshow/85256025.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Dehradun||U’khand needs a strong land law to stop migration of farmers from hills: Rakesh Tikait||Dehradun: Rakesh Tikait, the spokesperson of farmers’ body Bhartiya Kisan Union, supported the demand for a strong land law in Uttarakhand. While interacting with media persons during his visit to Dehradun on Wednesday, Tikait said, “The government should enact a land law to ensure that farmers don’t resort to selling their lands when in financial distress. Also, it is upon the government to provide farmers with more avenues of earning money.” His remarks come at a time when locals and activists have been asking the government to roll out a land law to protect the interests of indigenous people. The demand has been gaining traction on social media platforms for quite some time now and as a consequence, some political parties are also taking up the issue. Similar to his address in Herbertpur in March this year, Tikait again pointed out the need for farmer-friendly policies in Uttarakhand to check migration from the hills. The farmer leader also underscored the need for a ‘village tourism policy’ in Uttarakhand. “On the lines of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand should also come up with a village tourism policy to help villagers earn money. Besides, a transport policy is also required to protect those who ferry goods from hills to plains,” said Tikait. He also proposed a ‘Hill Policy’ to check migration from hills. “The border villages of Uttarakhand that share a border with China should be put under the Schedule Tribe zone. This will help protect the interests of the locals and ensure their land is protected,” Tikait added. Meanwhile, Tikait reiterated his demand of retracting the three contentious farm laws that were introduced by the central government last year. He warned of intensified protests if his demands are not met soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-needs-a-strong-land-law-to-stop-migration-of-farmers-from-hills-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/85250882.cms||Shivani Azad

According to forest officials, they found the carcass of the elephant calf with multiple injuries in Theppakadu range of forests around 9am on the day, while on patrol. As a herd of elephants had surrounded the carcass, the forest field staff could not go near it for more than three hours. After the herd dispersed from the spot, a veterinarian performed the autopsy in the presence of a member of an NGO, biologist and forest officials, said C H Padma, deputy director, MTR-core zone. A week-old injury of carnivore bite was found on the right hind leg and abdomen of the animal. The hind leg bone was also fractured. “Because of the wound and fracture, its movement was restricted. Also, the intestine of the calf was found empty, indicating it did not have proper feed,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/elephant-calf-found-dead-with-injuries/articleshow/85255763.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||We will fulfil all promises: Harish||HYDERABAD: On a day when chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced the party candidate for the Huzurabad bypoll, finance minister T Harish Rao went all out to woo the voters, particularly women, in Huzurabad constituency. He promised that if the TRS candidate Gellu Srinivas Yadav is voted to victory, he would personally take up the responsibility of delivering the pending 4,000 2BHK units and would also extend financial assistance for construction of pucca houses to all those having land or huts. He indirectly warned them not to hold TRS responsible if the promises being made by him are not implemented. “Vote TRS candidate to victory. We are ready to take the burden and responsibility of fulfilling all the promises,” he said. Harish blamed it on Eatala Rajender for Huzurabad people not getting 2BHK units despite being sanctioned nearly seven years ago. The finance minister also sanctioned construction of mahila bhavans in every village in Huzurabad constituency at a cost of Rs 4 crore, new roads and loan facilities to the women. Addressing a gathering of women wherein he distributed interest free loans to women groups, followed by a public meeting at Veenavanka, he called upon the electorate to question Eatala to “announce his plans for development of Huzurabad constituency.” “Eatala could not deliver 2BHK houses despite being a minister and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar not doing anything significant for Huzurabad. BJP government at the Centre is privatising public sector undertakings resulting in job loss and increased diesel price resulting in significant increase in the input costs for farmers who operated tractors for their farm operations. “Eatala will not be able to do anything as an opposition MLA. Don’t think about an individual but vote for the development of the constituency and the people at large,” Harish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vote-gellu-we-will-fulfilall-promises-harish/articleshow/85257842.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Ranchi||CBI seeks 10-day remand to conduct narco test & brain mapping of accused||SINDRI: The CBI team probing the death of Dhanbad judge Uttam Anand on Wednesday sought a 10-day transit remand of the accused, Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma. The central investigation agency sought the permission before special CBI magistrate Shikha Agarwal, stating that they intended to put Lakhan and Rahul through a narco-analysis test and brain-mapping for the sake of investigation at a higher centre. CBI sought their remand a day before the five-day remand of Lakhan and Rahul are due to end. Though the CBI officials are tight-lipped and are not ready to say anything on record as the high profile case is being monitored by Supreme Court and the Jharkhand high court, reliable sources said that CBI is likely to take the accused to New Delhi or Gujarat for narco-analysis and brain-mapping as these facilities are not available here. Earlier, the two accused were subjected to a lie-detection test, forensic psychological assessment and forensic assessment analysis test on the CIMFR campus on Tuesday after the two accused gave consent for undergoing the test. Two experts from FSL Gujarat were especially invited for this purpose by the central agency. The CBI team, so far, has visited the accident site thrice and recreated the scene that led to the death of the judge. They took measurements of the spot from different angles, the angle at which the auto hit the judge and the possible angle at which he fell down with the accused on the driving seat of the auto and the entire scene was video graphed using a 3D camera. The investigating team also collected CCTV footage from the entire Luby Circular road from where the auto passed, including that of the footage near SSLNT Women’s College, to study the movement and behaviour of the auto and its driver to correlate the story narrated by the auto-driver during interrogation. Anand died on July 28 after being hit by an auto around 5.08 am when he was jogging by the road side near Randhir Verma square. The way the auto took an extreme left turn on an empty road and returned back to the center of the road after hitting the judge created suspicion that it might be a deliberate attempt to kill the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cbi-seeks-10-day-remand-to-conduct-narco-test-brain-mapping-of-accused/articleshow/85256760.cms||Anil Ashutosh

Nikki and Salima, who were given a grand welcome by the Jharkhand government on their return from the Games on Wednesday, will now be promoted as gazetted officers in the Indian Railways. Salima, the 19-year-old midfielder from Simdega, was working as a travelling ticket examiner (TTE) and was posted at Ranchi railway station before she headed to the Games. Likewise, 28-year-old Nikki was posted as the chief yard master at the Hatia railway yard of Ranchi railway division under the South Eastern Railways (SER). Both were working as Group C employees. “Based on their stellar performances, the SER is pleased to promote them into gazetted officers rank. An official announcement will be made very soon,” a senior officer at the SER headquarters in Kolkata told TOI on Wednesday. Post their promotion, Nikki and Salima will become Group B officers and will be posted as officers on special duty (OSD). While Salima joined the railways in 2017, Nikki joined a couple of years before Salima. The Ranchi railway division of SER also employs former Indian women’s hockey captains, Sumrai Tete and Asunta Lakra. Former Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni also served as a TTE with the SER at its Kharagpur railway division before he broke into the national squad in 2005. While Jharkhand government dispatched its sports minister Hafizul Hassan to Ranchi airport to welcome Nikki and Salima on Wednesday, none of the senior officials from the Ranchi railway division were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/railways-to-promote-salima-nikki-for-stellar-olympic-show/articleshow/85255312.cms||Dhritiman Ray

While some experts are hopeful of coming out of the dark tunnel, others want to exercise caution in being over-optimistic. Professor of pulmonary medicine at Rims, Dr Brajesh Mishra, said that it was little premature to imagine that the pandemic is over. “We all had observed strict lockdown norms and Covid-appropriate behaviour, cutting the chain of the viral spread but now schools and business establishments have started to reopen. We must wait and watch till the end of August, because the incubation period of the virus is around 10 days,” he said. He, however, agreed that new infections have considerably come down and high seropositivity prevalence can also play a role in stemming the spread. “In case of Bihar, the seroprevalence rate is 78% whereas in Jharkhand it was 62% in the latest survey which indicates that the chances of the viral spread is higher here in comparison to Bihar,” he cautioned. Head, Preventive and Social Medicine (PSM) at Rims, Dr Devesh Kumar, who has been a part of several researches conducted on Covid -19, is, however, hopeful that a third wave could be avoided. Even if there is one, “it is going to be far less virulent than what we experienced during the second wave,” he said. Kumar also said that for any definitive conclusion, experts have to wait for a couple of months more. “It is true that the number of new cases has come down considerably and there could be two reasons — the virulence has actually come down or the RTPCR is failing to detect the virus,” he said. Pointing to a large number of cases in the recent months with Covid-like but milder symptoms, Kumar said a proper study is required to find the cause of such infections which is mostly being ignored as seasonal influenza. The first case of Covid-19 was reported in Jharkhand on March 31 last year and since then the active cases crept up and reached its peak of 15,726 active cases on September 9, 2020. Considered the first wave, the number of cases started coming down gradually and the graph touched the bottom line at 428 active cases on February 6 earlier this year. Though people hoped that the pandemic was about to get over, it was far from the truth. Cases started increasing once again since March 10. All through the month of February, active cases remained around 500, lowest being 428 on February 6. The second wave started peaking and reached the pinnacle of 61,195 active cases on May 9. Once again, the number of new infections were fewer than the number of recoveries and the graph of active cases fell sharply. While the lowest number of cases was 428 in the first wave, it is even lower in the second when the number of cases came down to 202 on August 9. Though it again increased slightly to 208 the next day, the high number of tests being conducted (around 50,000 every day) and fewer new infections, which has been under 30, is a positive sign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-cases-fall-sharply-but-experts-advise-caution/articleshow/85255391.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Lalu along with around 110 people are accused in the case. The court passed the order while stating that online hearing in the case would be held continuously from Friday. It stated that defence lawyers could come to the court to attend the proceeding offline but they have to follow the Covid guidelines. The lawyers could also take their certified copies from the court. CBI lawyer BMP Singh said, “We had opposed the petition on the ground that the Supreme Court and the High Court had directed for speedy disposal of the case.” Lalu’s lawyer Prabhat Kumar said, “We would plan further course of action only after studying the order. It has not been uploaded till evening.” It may be mentioned here that on Monday, Lalu’s lawyer had filed a petition seeking offline hearing while stating that there were voluminous documents to be exhibited. He said that it was not possible to argue the case online. The prosecution side has completed its argument on the basis of 575 witnesses. The defence lawyers will start their arguments from the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/court-bins-lalus-petition-for-offline-hearing-in-fodder-case/articleshow/85255230.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Include Sarna code in Census: JMM urges Union govt||Ranchi: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Wednesday made an open demand to the Centre and sought the inclusion of Sarna religion in the upcoming national census and also demanded that the census should also be held on caste lines. Speaking to reporters at the party’s headquarters in Bariatu, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya claimed that the Centre was moving in a planned manner to abolish reservation entirely. “Our party welcomes the passage of the recent amendment to the Constitution which enables states to identify different castes living within their geographical borders. But at the same time, there is no caste-based census in the upcoming exercise. This implies that even if the states identified different backward castes, they will be deprived of the benefits of reservations in jobs, studies and in social welfare schemes,” Bhattacharya said. Ajsu Party, the BJP’s ally in the NDA, had sought a caste based census. Its chief Sudesh Mahto wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and claimed that a caste based census was necessary to evaluate the situation on the ground and help plan social welfare schemes. Bhattacharya also claimed that even though the national census was conducted in 2011, its findings were not tabled before the Parliament after the BJP-led NDA government assumed office in 2014. “In 2015, Arun Jaitley had assured the House that the findings will be tabled. Three years later, Union minister Rajnath Singh also made the same assurance, but the findings are yet to be tabled,” he said. JMM said it suspected that the Centre’s ignorance towards initiating a caste-based census was aimed at facilitating the smooth handover of public sector undertakings to corporate houses. “Much ahead of the passage of the farm laws, several corporate houses had invested hundreds of crores of rupees and set up their cold chains and godowns. This is suggestive,” Bhattacharya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/include-sarna-code-in-census-jmm-urges-union-govt/articleshow/85255263.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||No dearth of seats in Class XI, assures education secretary||RANCHI: Even though many more students have cracked Class X examinations of various boards this year in comparison to other years, the authorities are confident that those wanting to pursue further studies would get admission in one institution or the other. Notably, 4,15,924 of 4,33,571 students, who appeared in Class X board examination conducted by the Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC), cleared the test this year. The pass percentage this year was 95.92%, which was a whopping 20.85% better than last year. While the improved results have made it difficult for many students to get admission in institutions of their choice, the education department claimed that no student would be denied the opportunity of pursuing higher education. Education secretary Rajesh Sharma said, “We have a flexible approach when it comes to taking admission in our schools. The number of seats could be increased if needed.” He added that the education department was also planning to start a special drive to enrol students in Class XI to prevent drop-outs. A JAC source added that, at present, around 5.25 lakh seats were available for students in Class XI in JAC-affiliated Plus-Two schools and colleges. Experts said that the situation was no different for students of CBSE schools. Nearly 70,000 students in the state passed Class-X exam under CBSE, with a significant proportion notching up more than 90%. Samarjit Jana, the principal of Jawahar Vidya Mandir-Shyamli, said, “There is no dearth of seats for students in Class XI. Many students, however, may not get their choice of subjects.” Notably, there are 112 secondary schools affiliated to the Council of Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), but the number, thereafter, drops to 50. Talking about the limited number of seats in the higher secondary section, the regional coordinator for CISCE, Christopher Francis, said, “After Class X, many of our students shift to CBSE-affiliated schools. Moreover, a significant number also move out of the state. I cannot say how things would pan out for our students aiming to take admission in the state.” As many as 13,640 students passed Class X from CISCE-affiliated schools this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-dearth-of-seats-in-class-xi-assures-education-secretary/articleshow/85256651.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Simdega girl Salima and Khunti girl Nikki were greeted at Ranchi’s Birsa Munda International Airport by a swarm of admirers, journalists, state government officials and state sports minister Hafizul Hassan after they touched down in the afternoon in a commercial flight which arrived from New Delhi. Under overcast skies, the duo strode into two open jeeps, which were decked with flowers and headed for Jharkhand Mantralaya, where chief minister Hemant Soren, social welfare minister Joba Manjhi and a battery of senior bureaucrats were waiting to welcome them. “It is a proud moment for us. Though we fought hard, we missed out on a bronze medal to Great Britain. We as a team will try to bring home a medal at the next Olympics,” Salima said in a brief interaction with journalists from atop her jeep. At Jharkhand Mantralaya, Soren handed over the duo cheques worth Rs 50 lakh each, the keys to scooters, smart phones and laptops. “Even though you lost out on a medal, your spirited performances against hockey superpowers at the grandest stage of them all is no less than a podium finish,” Soren told the duo in appreciation. While their parents occupied the front rows at the auditorium, Salima and Nikki remained humble as ever as they took the dais, along with the CM. “We want you to do well and be an inspiration to the thousands of budding talents in the state,” Soren said. Deepika Kumari, who was also part of the Olympic contingent from Jharkhand, was not a part of the ceremony though. “Deepika also participated but we couldn’t have her here,” the CM said. Laying out his government’s vision for sports development, Soren said plans are afoot to set up eight residential hockey centres, 12 football centres, seven archery centres, six athletics centres and one volleyball and one badminton centres in coming months to provide conducive training atmosphere for the state’s sporting talents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/salima-nikki-get-heros-welcome-cash-awards-and-job-promotions/articleshow/85256711.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||AAI plans to trim runway as Bokaro airport hits hurdles||BOKARO: The length of the runway of the under-construction Bokaro airport will be reduced by 121 metres after the Airports Authority of India (AAI) came across several technical problems during an inspection last month. The AAI’s civil department and safety team, which inspected the final stages of the construction last month, located eight obstacles within the proposed funnel zone and the zeroing threshold points on the runway along the Dundibagh area of the town. Subsequently, the AAI has written to the Bokaro Steel Limited (BSL) management and asked it to remove the obstacles. In aviation parlance, funnel zones are referred to an imaginary flight path which extends outwards and upwards from the runway. Threshold points are referred to the start of a runway that is available for landing. These two clearances are essential for any airport to begin operations. The Bokaro airport project’s commissioning has been delayed due to encroachment and Covid 19-induced lockdown. However, the proximity of the boundary wall built along Dundibagh to the runway has posed a hindrance in terms of getting a threshold. Originally designed to be 1,671 metres long, the engineers are now pruning the runway to 1,500 metres to get the necessary safety clearances. The airport, being built at a net cost of Rs 46 crore by the AAI, will be managed by the BSL once it is commissioned. According to AAI officers, at present, there are four major expansion works left in Bokaro airport, which includes construction of a fire station, approach road, RESA runway works with threshold bar and installation of PAPI lights. The obstacles within the funnel zone include telecommunication towers, advertising boards and big trees outside the airport boundary wall. “Preparations have been made to remove eight obstacles identified by the AAI, which will be completed soon. Work on manual and SOP for applying for license is almost complete. The BSL will soon submit the application for the license,” said Manikant Dhan, chief communications officer of BSL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/aai-plans-to-trim-runway-as-bokaro-airport-hits-hurdles/articleshow/85256615.cms||Divy Khare
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: School dropout builds ‘helicopter’, dies as blades slash his throat||YAVATMAL: A 24-year-old school dropout, who aspired to build a helicopter himself, died after one of the rotor blades of the chopper he was testing, broke and slashed his throat at Fulsawangi village in Mahagaon tehsil of the district on Tuesday night. The deceased Sheikh Ismail Sheikh Ibrahim had stopped going to school while in Std 8 and started working in elder brother Mussavir’s gas welding workshop and mastered the art of making almirahs, coolers and other household articles with steel and aluminium sheets. It was Ismail’s passion to do something different to bring international fame for his village Fulsawangi. “Inspired by the character of Rancho in the film ‘3 Idiots’, Ismail wanted to do something unique and hence decided to build a helicopter in the village. After gathering information about the design and assembly by watching YouTube videos, he started working on his dream project. It took nearly two years for Ismail to collect all the parts needed. He also readied the prototype of a single-seater helicopter by welding steel pipes and fitted a Maruti 800 engine to power it,” said his friend Sachin Ubale. “Ismail wanted to exhibit the helicopter to the public on Independence Day this year and so he decided to test the flying machine near his workshop. On Tuesday night, he occupied the pilot seat and started the engine as some of his friends watched in awe,” said Ubale. While everyone was thrilled when the rotor wings started moving speedily, the tail rotor blade assembly got ripped off from the body and hit the main blades on the top. “Even before anyone could understand what was happening, a piece of the broken blade slashed Ismail’s throat and he collapsed to the ground,” said Ubale. Those watching the experiment rushed to help a heavily bleeding Ismail and he was immediately taken to a hospital in Pusad. However, he breathed his last before any medical aid could be provided. “He used to test functioning of the chopper very often. Earlier, he had been successful in lifting the helicopter 5 feet above the ground. It was his final trial on Tuesday,” said Ismail’s another friend Harish. “He used to wear a helmet and headphone every time he tested the chopper. But on the fateful night, he did not wear both,” Harish added. Ismail had named his flying machine ‘Munna Helicopter’, Munna being his nickname. Some of those gathered to witness the helicopter trial had shot a video, which captured the accident also. The video has now gone viral on social media. Ismail was cremated on Wednesday in the presence of a large number of villagers. “The police have taken Ismail’s elder brother and three friends to the police station for further investigation. The police will also take the helicopter into their custody,” Harish told TOI. A pall of gloom descended on the village as news of death of the local Rancho, as Ismail was known in the area, spread like wildfire. Former MLA of Umarkhed Rajendra Najardhane and many others visited the bereaved family to offer their condolences.

He called on Modi in Delhi on Wednesday evening and submitted two separate letters. Capt Amarinder urged immediate review and revocation of the three farm laws that had “triggered widespread resentment” among farmers of Punjab and other states, who had been protesting at the Delhi borders since November 26 last year. Pointing to the prolonged agitation, which had cost the lives of more than 400 farmers and farm workers, the chief minister said the stir had the potential of posing security threats for Punjab and the country with Pak-backed anti-India forces looking to exploit the farmers’ disgruntlement with the government. Urging the Prime Minister’s intervention for expeditious redressal of the farmers’ legitimate concerns by the Centre to explore an enduring solution, the chief minister said the continued agitation was not only impacting economic activities in Punjab but also had the potential to affect the social fabric, especially when political parties and groups take strong positions. Amarinder noted that he had earlier too sought the Prime Minister’s appointment for a meeting with an all-party delegation from Punjab. He underlined the need to compensate farmers for the management of paddy straw at the rate of Rs100 per quintal and also to address the fears of DAP shortage, which could aggravate the farmers’ problems and the crisis triggered by the farm laws. In another letter, he stressed that due to the fragmentation of landholdings and persistent disputes with lessees and various market operators and agents, farmers are also facing heightened litigation, causing stress on their meagre financial resources. Stressing on the need to reduce the farmers’ financial burden due to such litigation, he noted that the Central Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, provides free legal aid to certain categories of persons, who are perceived to be the vulnerable sections of the society. Pointing out that the country’s farmers are also very vulnerable, he said that they are, at times, compelled to commit suicide due to financial problems, even though they remain proud and prefer to till their land even at the cost of their lives. “It is, thus, the need of the hour to amend Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, to include farmers and farm workers in the category of persons entitled to free legal services to pursue and defend themselves in the courts to secure their livelihood,” said Amarinder. He felt this step would help reduce cases of farmer suicides and ensure better protection of their legal and financial rights. Amarinder urged Modi to advise the concerned central ministries dealing with farmer welfare and laws to carry out necessary amendments to the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, in the larger interest of the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-meets-modi-seeks-repeal-of-farm-laws/articleshow/85256557.cms||---

Godinho said that as the taxi operators are not approaching Lobo, he is showing them wrong dreams. He advised Lobo, who is also the waste management minister, to first take care of the state’s garbage issue before speaking on other issues. Taxi operators are refunded 50% of the meter cost within five days of applying for it, and the remaining 50% is credited to their accounts at the end of the year when they pay data charges for using the server, GPS, panic button, etc, Godinho said. Last week, Godinho said that they were looking to do the installation “in such a manner that when operators go to install the meters, they may not have to pay the 50%, but the remaining 50% they will get at the end of the year”. On why the remaining 50% of the meter cost is refunded at the end of the year, he said, “Who will take the responsibility if a meter is tampered with before it is fully operational. We have given the meter free. At least this way, knowing that they are paying their own money, they will look after the meter for a whole year.” The panic button, Godinho said, is to ensure the safety of tourists, especially women tourists. “If the driver misbehaves then the passenger can press the panic button,” he said, adding that tourist taxis are brand ambassadors of Goa tourism. Lashing out at Lobo for his interference, Godinho said, “It is not healthy to poke one’s nose everywhere.” I could help Lobo handle the waste issue in Goa, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/study-matter-before-speaking-meters-are-free-mauvin-to-lobo/articleshow/85256436.cms||---

The permits, however, are not being given on a large scale, but only on a need-basis,” ESG vice chairman Subhash Phaldesai told TOI. He said that further relaxations will be given as and when the pandemic situation improves in Goa. A strict vigil will also be kept to crackdown on illegal film shootings, he said. So far, ESG has not been granted permission by the government to confiscate shooting equipment of illegal shoots, nor are they authorised to take any legal action against the persons involved. “As and when we receive an intimation of any illegal shooting in the state, we will inform the authority concerned and the police. As of now, the ESG does not have an enforcement agency nor do we have powers to curb such shootings, so we have to route this through the police,” Phaldesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/esg-issuing-nod-for-need-based-film-shooting/articleshow/85256814.cms||---

With the state government celebrating 60 years of Liberation, the pilots were promised a one-time special package as the part of Goa@60 programme. This package was also eligible for operators of auto rickshaws, pick-up trucks, tempo trucks, etc, for which members had to apply by March this year. They said that some applications were not accepted and have requested the release of those funds. “We hereby request you to accept those forms which we had submitted earlier and give them first preference. They should give benefits to the right people who really need financial help,” said association president Suresh Thakur. The association has demanded the continuation of the monthly financial assistance scheme of Rs 2,000 which was stopped after five years. They further demanded that after completion of 60 years of age, the member be directly shifted on to the DDS scheme, so that “pilots who are in trouble because of no business in the pandemic” get financial support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/motorcycle-pilots-want-aid-released/articleshow/85256478.cms||---
---||Goa||Will scrap all land conversions under Sec 16B, says Cong||Panaji: If Congress wins the coming assembly elections and forms the state government, section 16-B of the Town and Country Planning Act along with all land conversions done under Section 16-B will be scrapped, said state party president Girish Chodankar on Wednesday. Chodankar also said that a fish testing laboratory will be setup to ensure that formalin-laced fish is not brought into Goa. Criticising the BJP-led state government for the failure to setup the laboratory despite promising about it almost four years back, Chodankar said that Congress will set one up by Goa Statehood Day in 2022, which is May 30. “We want to promise Goans that the Congress government will scrap Section 16-B and all the land converted under the said section will be reverted back to its original status. We had already warned everyone not to get land converted under 16B on ‘Suitcase to Suitcase’ basis,” said Chodankar. On June 18, AICC Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao had said that Congress would cancel all the three linear projects coming in Mollem. Chodankar said that the party would work to protect Goa’s identity, environment, health and safety. Though Chodankar blamed former CM Manohar Parrikar for allowing “mass conversion of land” under Section 16B and for “patronising the fish mafia” in Goa, most Congress insiders wondered whether Chodankar was also sending a message to Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-scrap-all-land-conversions-under-sec-16b-says-cong/articleshow/85256578.cms||---

In his letter, Faleiro informed Naik that the BJP-led state government has admitted that the Major Port Authorities Act will make some of Goa’s laws redundant. “I have called upon Naik who is representing the North Goa Parliamentary constituency and being the Union Minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways to take a firm stand and oppose this disastrous act which will destroy Goa and its landscape,” said Faleiro. “I have also brought to the notice of Naik that the said act has torn into the federal nature of our administrative set-up, which is condemnable.” During the monsoon session of the state legislative assembly, deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar informed MLAs that the Major Port Authorities Act, 2021, has the potential to usurp the powers of the government and local bodies. Kavlekar also said that some of Goa’s laws such as the Goa Town and Country Planning Act, the Regional Plan/ ODP’s, Goa Municipalities Act, Goa Panchayat Raj Act, Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations, 2010 and Goa Land Revenue Code may no longer apply to those areas declared as port areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ask-centre-to-repeal-major-port-act/articleshow/85256604.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Balli Cheema’s poetic appeal: Don’t ditch morcha for votes||Bathinda: Uttarakhand-based revolutionary poet and farmer leader Balli Singh Cheema has penned a poem to air his anger against farm leaders who are aspiring to become politicians. Concerned by the political actions of a farmer leader who is asking other farm unionists to take the political plunge, Cheema’s poem reads: “Morcha chadd ke vota wale raah te turio na; bhole bhale loka naal dhokha kario na; morche de modhe te chad ke neta banio na; masah masah taan ik hoye han, paada paio na (don’t leave the protest for votes; don’t deceive innocent people; don’t use the protest to become a political leader; we have united after long, don’t create divisions now).” Cheema (69), who is popular for his poems, had got the prestigious Gangasharan Singh Puraskar for outstanding contribution in Hindi literature in 2012, from then President Pratibha Patil. Only recently, he was taken into the five-member ad-hoc committee formed by farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) while setting up Uttrakhand unit of the organisation. Haryana-based farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni had lent support to newly formed party Bhartiya Arthik Party (BAP), which has declared Charuni as its CM face. Earlier, Charuni had been asking Punjab-based farm leaders to contest elections. Cheema said when a farm leader started talking about politics, he felt hurt and now that leader had gone ahead and made his political intentions clear. “Concerned, I have penned down the poem; it is the voice of many who want the kisan morcha to focus only on getting its core demands met. The morcha should not have anything with politics,” he said. Balli said the farm struggle was not a platform for fulfilling the political aspirations of any leader, but the entire nation was looking towards the morcha and even people from many other countries too were looking towards the morcha and its achievements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/balli-cheemas-poetic-appeal-dont-ditch-morcha-for-votes/articleshow/85256751.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Goa||Goa CM Pramod Sawant pitches for skill education, points to 50% jobless graduates||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday made a strong pitch for skill-based education when he pointed out that at least 50% of students remain unemployed upon completing their graduation. He also said the new National Education Policy (NEP) would be implemented in the state from the next academic year. “Skill education is the future for our students. If we don’t provide skills to them when they graduate, they will not benefit,” he said. “Over the past couple of years, several graduates have passed out from our colleges, but we have to ask ourselves whether we are producing quality graduates and how many of these are working towards their futures...Fifty per cent of students sit idle at home upon completing graduation. In fact, I feel bad when they approach me to ask what they should do after completing their MA, MSc or MCom,” he said. Citing an example of why skill-based education is necessary, Sawant said that when the government seeks to fill five vacancies for stenographers, it receives just 25 applications, but if it advertises five vacancies for lower-division clerks, as many as 25,000 applications are received. Proposing that innovative courses should be offered by the state’s colleges, he said Goa is the best state in India where creation of infrastructure for the education sector and human resources is concerned. He also said Goa is the only state to offer grants-in-aid and infrastructure grants right from the pre-primary to the higher education level, and assured that vacant teachers’ posts would be filled within two to three months. Sawant was speaking after inaugurating a two-day seminar aimed at demystifying assessment and accreditation by the NAAC. “After we conducted seminars for students in collaboration with the CMO, the directorate of sports and the directorate of higher education, a lot of students said they got a lot of information about the various opportunities in the hospitality sectorWe have put systems in place, but finally, it is the government’s responsibility,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-pitches-for-skill-edu-points-to-50-jobless-graduates/articleshow/85256774.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vidarbha: Four Delta plus cases found in Chanda, Gondia & Akola||NAGPUR: Genome sequencing of samples of Covid-19 patients has revealed 20 more Delta plus variant patients in Maharashtra on Wednesday. Out of them, 2 are from Gondia and one each from Akola and Chandrapur. This marks the entry of Delta plus variant in Vidarbha. Earlier, the Delta variant, which originated in Amravati, was prevalent in the region. Experts told TOI, there is enough evidence that Delta plus variant is not as dangerous as the original Delta variant, which was predominant in the second wave in Vidarbha. “It has been proved in even in Maharashtra that Delta plus variant patients have mild to moderate level of infection and not serious one. More such variants will continue to emerge,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. The department of public health has appealed to the public to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour without any fear as the virus continues to alter its genetic makeup and is part of the virus’s natural life cycle. Fast vaccination is also effective in controlling further mutations in viruses. If virus doesn’t get chance to multiply, chances of new mutation will also decline, it said. Another respite factor for Vidarbha is that the samples which tested positive for Delta-plus variant were detected at least 2 weeks ago and sent for the testing then only. The fact that no spike or deaths were witnessed during the past two weeks suggests that Delta-plus is not posing any serious threat to the region. Meanwhile, the respite from Covid-19 continued in the region even on Wednesday with only 31 out of 15,560 samples testing positive in 24 hours. The overall test positivity rate (TPR) hit record low of 0.19%. Bhandara and Gondia reported zero new cases, while highest of the day — six — were reported from Buldhana. On the other hand, 52 patients recovered. Vidarbha’s recovery rate is well above 98%. No Covid death was reported for the second day in a row, and fifth time in 11 days of August. This indicates that deaths due to Covid-19 have significantly reduced. Only 449 patients are under treatment now in entire region. Bhandara: The district witnessed another ‘Zero Day’ as no new case was detected out of 616 tests done in last 24 hours. Bhandara had no patient under treatment for one more day. Gondia: No new case out of 394 tests and 1 recovery marked Wednesday in Gondia. Now, 2 patients are under treatment, with 1 of them in home isolation and 1 in Covid hospital under observation. Wardha: A new Covid patient was reported from Deoli out of 436 test reports on Wednesday, taking the total case count to 49,382. After two patients were discharged, total recoveries have increased to 48,049, leaving 8 under treatment. No death was reported in the day and the Covid toll remained at 1,325. Chandrapur: There was no Covid casualty, for the second consecutive day, on Wednesday keeping the toll unchanged at 1,537. With two new detections against three recoveries, now 72 patients are under treatment. Covid caseload grew to 88,550, while total recoveries to 86,941. Amravati: Four new cases against seven recoveries meant the district was fairly ‘Covid-free’ on Wednesday. The caseload has now reached 96,589 and recoveries to 94,598. With no Covid death in the day, the toll stayed put at 1,562. This left 69 under treatment. Yavatmal: The district saw 3 new cases and 2 recoveries on Wednesday. No Covid casualty was reported in the last 24 hours. Gadchiroli: Five new cases and a recovery took total caseload in Gadchiroli to 30,647 and recoveries to 29,864. Overall Covid toll is 745 and 38 are under treatment. Washim: Two new cases and 5 recoveries were reported in the day. With 41,030 patients out of 41,680 total cases recovered till date, Washim has 12 patients under treatment now. Buldhana: The district conducted 2,507 tests in last 24 hours and six of them were positive. Eight patients recovered in the day. Now, Buldhana has 61 patients under treatment. Akola: Total 758 tests were conducted out of which 3 were positive in Akola on Wednesday. With 5 patients recovering in the day, 47 patients are under treatment here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vidarbha-four-delta-plus-cases-found-in-chanda-gondia-akola/articleshow/85254338.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Speaking to reporters, the former deputy chief minister said that the farmers didn’t receive the cane amount paid by Laila Sugar Factory in Dharwad, Karnataka. Farmers have not received the Rs 4 crore sanctioned for harvesting of sugarcane, he said. “The government has to probe all affairs of the factory, including transportation cost of the canes deducted by Laila factory,” Dhavalikar demanded. “The government had even suspended the then managing director of the factory. Now, an investigation is needed to find out who were the actual culprits in the matter,” Dhavalikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/probe-sugar-factory-affairs-says-sudin/articleshow/85256825.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He told the media at Charkhi Dadri: “Indiscipline of any kind can’t be tolerated by any coach or the WFI. I have always taught discipline first to my trainees, and in Vinesh’s case, she refused to wear the official sponsor’s logo during her bout. From whatever details I have, this suspension seems in the best interest of the game.” Made famous by biopic ‘Dangal’, Mahabir Phogat says he was pained to see Vinesh fail when the country had pinned hopes on her for a women’s wrestling medal from Tokyo. Rajpal Rathee, father-in-law of Vinesh, expressed surprise at the WFI’s decision, saying: “My daughter-in-law follows discipline even at home. I could not have a word with her after she returned from Tokyo but the family will respond to the WFI’s notice by August 16, explaining her side of the story.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mahavir-endorses-vineshs-suspension/articleshow/85256835.cms||Sat Singh
---||Goa||Menstrual health campaign to look at reusable products||Margao: A state-wide campaign on sustainable menstrual health and hygiene with an aim to prevent girls from dropping out of school and educating them about affordable, reusable and green sanitary products is being launched in Gaondongri, Canacona on Thursday. The campaign ‘Eco Switch’ will target young girls and address the problem of using disposable sanitary napkins and tampons, which take years to decompose, leading to health and environmental hazards, as well as the case of menstrual poverty where women from the lower income groups don’t have finances to buy menstrual products. “Women across the state of Goa are not aware of reusable menstrual products available in the market. Through the Eco Switch Campaign, we intend to raise awareness among the community on the accessibility of reusable and sustainable menstrual products, like cloth pads and menstrual cups, which decrease environmental and health hazards, and pressure on finances,” Applesta Maryann da Costa, programme lead, psychosocial support for Human Touch Foundation, told TOI. “Through awareness programs and demonstrations highlighting the pros and cons of disposable menstrual products versus sustainable menstrual products, we aim to guide adolescent girls and women to gradually shift to eco-friendly menstrual products,” she said. The campaign is the initiative of Human Touch Foundation and is being supported by other collaborators. The organisers plan to gather testimonials from different rural communities to spread the message and to organise training workshops for teachers to create awareness among their students. The campaign will also educate the young girls on menstrual hygiene and bust myths about menstruation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/menstrual-health-campaign-to-look-at-reusable-products/articleshow/85256853.cms||---

Rethinking the Indian education system is the need of the hour and requires wide deliberations, Pillai said speaking at the inaugural function of Vasantrao Dempo Diamond jubilee lecture series, “Where ideas converge” on Tuesday. Organised by Dhempe College of Arts & Science, the function commemorated 60 years of the institution. The theme was “Re-thinking the Indian educational system.” Pillai said the education policy has to be shaped considering the prospective wealth of the country, the new generation of 18-35 age group that comprises 35% of the population. Quoting Swami Vivekananda, he said education is the manifestation of perfection. India’s vast tradition in education is evident by the existence of ancient universities such as Nalanda, Vikramashila, Vikramashila. In order to create good educationists, lawyers, doctors, teachers, engineers, politicians the education had to have a comprehensive approach, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edu-a-fundamental-necessity-for-every-person-says-guv/articleshow/85256902.cms||---

Captain Manpreet Singh, together with Dilpreet Singh, Harmanpreet Singh, Rupinderpal Singh, Hardik Singh, Gurjant Singh, Varun Kumar, Mandeep Singh, Shamsher Singh, and Simranjeet Singh, landed at Sri Guru Ram Das International Airport around 6.30am. With them was Indian women’s hockey’s star drag-flicker Gurjeet Kaur, whose hard-fighting team had missed the bronze by a whisker but become the country’s first semi-finalist daughters. Their families, senior players, fans, district officials, and former hockey Olympian, legislator Pargat Singh, were at the airport to receive them. There were emotional scenes, as both sides couldn’t hold back their tears. The players went to the Golden Temple first for a thanksgiving prayer. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) extended them a warm welcome. SGPC president Jagir Kaur presented them with a cheque for Rs 1 crore, out of which every player will get Rs 5 lakh for restoring the Indian hockey’s pride. The players also received siropas (robes of honour), a model of the Golden Temple, and mementos. Hockey India general secretary Rajinder Singh and the platers’ families were also honoured.

Our paediatric section admits at least one to two children every day, as it is found that they need to be kept on IV,” the hospital’s health officer, Dr Anil Umraskar said. On an average, the sub-district hospital receives about 200 cases of diarrhoea per month, with most being reported from slum areas like New Vaddem, Khariawada and Zuarinagar. Umraskar said that the problem is more where there are unhygienic conditions, besides monsoons aggravating the situation. “The number of cases have gone up during the monsoon. Many children are being affected and tend to suffer temporary weakness due to continuous loose motions,” he said, adding that it can even be treated by home remedies. The hospital is currently observing an Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight to create awareness about diarrhoea, its symptoms and remedies. The hospital has come up with ORS blocks where information regarding diarrhoea has been displayed and ORS packets are kept for distribution to children free of cost. A 27 year old woman was brought to the Chicalim Sub District hospital on Tuesday with diarrhoea complaint. Doctors said that she was suffering with low blood pressure and diarrhoea. In minutes of arrival before the doctors could treat her she expired in the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rise-in-diarrhoea-cases-at-chicalim/articleshow/85257085.cms||---

He said the government expects Rs 50,000 crore in dividends from public sector companies in the current financial year and is also working on a Rs 6 trillion asset monetisation plan and hopes to come out with plans for GAIL pipelines soon. “The disinvestment agenda has been put on fast track through the unveiling of the new PSE (public sector enterprises) policy, notified on February 4, 2021, which is expected to be an important policy for the next five years and will result in increase in privatisation in the economy”, Pandey told an interaction at the annual session of CII. He said the major disinvestments in pipeline this year as underlined in the Union Budget, include Air India, BPCL, Shipping Corporation of India, BEML, Pawan Hans and Neelachal Ispat Nigam and in all these enterprises, the government has got sufficient interest from bidders, who are now at the second stage of due-diligence. “After 17 years, the country will actually see privatisation, since the last time in 2003-04 in the then NDA government,” said Pandey. He also reiterated that the government aims to list state-run insurance behemoth LIC by year-end. “A mega listing in LIC is planned this year, which will be the biggest of its kind in history of Indian stock market.” The Centre has set a target of raising Rs 1.75 lakh crore from privatisation of state run enterprises in the current fiscal and Pandey said the process had been significantly impacted by the second Covid-19 wave, although it was back on track now. “A big asset monetisation pipeline is in place where the government looks forward to private sector participation. The government is also talking about closure of enterprises quite openly for the first time, in case it cannot be disinvested. In the non-strategic sectors, the direction is that either we privatise or close. Hence, apart from NCLT, there will also be a lot of assets on offer from the public sector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-plans-to-wrap-up-selloff-of-air-india-bpcl-this-fiscal/articleshow/85259755.cms||---

Quite a few of them do not have the basic necessities of life, like a decent home, basic education for their children, adequate food, etc,” he stated in his pastoral letter for 2021-22. “Oftentimes, children and women are forced to live and work in harsh and inhuman conditions.” “Under the leadership and guidance of the parish pastoral council, every parish, by using the necessary means, should offer them the love which will rekindle their hope,” he stated. In the letter sent out to all parishes, he also highlighted the emergency of preserving clean air, water, hills, forests, fields and rivers for future generations. “The more we delay to listen to the cry of God’s creation, the further we walk the path of self-destruction. There is a need for governments and citizens to work together to fulfil their responsibility towards God’s creation,” Ferrao stated. “Goa is a land blessed with scenic beauty. On the one hand, there is ethical, religious, economic and social wellbeing in Goa; there is fellowship and understanding among followers of different religions; our religious and cultural values teach us to love and respect one another,” he stated, adding that “on the other hand, we see dark clouds emerging due to inflation, religious intolerance, rise of forces that silence the voices of democracy, decline in ethics in the political field, destruction of beaches, forests, hills, fields and rivers for the furtherance of tourism, development and merchandise”. “Keeping aside all differences let us all join hands in protecting God’s creation...
