In that case, which is being discussed within the government, India will revise and update its target ahead of the 26th session of the UN climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, the UK which may also be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with other world leaders in November. India’s new ambitious renewable energy target of 450 GW, land degradation neutrality, and making Indian Railways a ‘net-zero’ carbon emitter by 2030, which the country has already been working on, will be part of the country's enhanced ambition (mitigation goals). These actions collectively would not only further reduce the emission intensity of its GDP (GHG emissions per unit of GDP) but also substantially increase the share of non-fossil fuels in the overall energy mix in 10 years. “If you look at these goals which India has already announced beyond its 2015 nationally determined contributions (NDCs), it can well be aggregated to achieve much more than what we had pledged five years ago. Our ambition has, thus, already been enhanced voluntarily. It is just now a matter of putting it out together and submitting it to the UNFCCC," said an official, privy to the discussion on the country’s preparedness for COP26. The issues of India’s overachievement of present NDCs and new ambitious goals on different fronts came up for broad discussion during a meeting of visiting COP26 president-designate and former British minister Alok Sharma with cabinet ministers Bhupender Yadav, RK Singh, Piyush Goyal, and Nirmala Sitharaman, and PM’s principal secretary, PK Mishra, here in past two days. The ministers assured Sharma that India would work constructively for a "successful and balanced" outcome at COP26, reiterating the country's position that the climate action must be “nationally determined”. Extending India’s full support to the UK for COP26, environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Wednesday emphasised that the “climate actions must be nationally determined”. He also underlined India’s position, advocating that the “differentiation and operationalization of flexibility provided in the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement for developing countries should be at the core of decision-making”. Yadav also reminded Sharma of the needs of “higher concrete actions” in terms of climate finance and technology transfer by the developed countries. The COP26 president, in turn, promised to work on India's concerns including the financial contribution of $100 billion per year by rich nations for supporting the adaptation needs of developing countries. Recognizing that delivering on $100 billion is a matter of trust for developing countries, Sharma assured India of a definite delivery plan as per the ministerial meeting held in July. “Minister Bhupender Yadav and I reviewed the issues that were raised at the July ministerial meeting and we agreed to continue to cooperate very closely together to ensure COP26 keeps 1.5 degree Celsius (goal) within reach,” said Sharma. At a media roundtable on Wednesday, Sharma noted that India is already on track to overachieve its current NDC and said he requested India to consider whether as part of any revised NDC, that overachievement is taken into account. Asked about the leaders' summit at COP26 and the participation of Modi, Sharma said, "We very much look forward to welcoming him to Glasgow to set out climate leadership at the international forum." The leaders' summit will be held on November 1-2. The UK is planning to hold another round of ministerial meetings ahead of COP26. Ministers may physically attend the meeting. On the conclusion of his three-day India visit, Sharma in a statement said, “I have had a set of very constructive discussions with ministers here and I am incredibly encouraged by the visionary speech Prime Minister Modi made on Independence Day, in particular the reference to renewables and green hydrogen... I am looking forward to working closely with India and other partners to achieve success at COP26."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-on-track-to-overachieve-its-current-contribution-to-check-climate-change-cop-26-president-designate/articleshow/85440598.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Cardinal Raymond Burke, one of Pope Francis' loudest critics and a vaccine skeptic, tweeted August 10 that he had caught the coronavirus. His staff tweeted Saturday that he was hospitalised and on a ventilator.  His condition and whereabouts since then have been unclear. His staff has provided no official updates. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops referred questions to officials at the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which Burke founded in La Crosse, Wisconsin. On Tuesday, the shrine issued a statement saying Burke is in serious but stable condition at an undisclosed location. He has been sedated and is still using a ventilator to breathe.  He has received sacraments from priests nearby and several relics have been placed in his room. The statement did not elaborate. The statement said no one should try to call Burke's family, shrine staff or Burke's residence in Rome to discuss his condition, saying such communications can become a "burden." The statement said the shrine alone will release updates and then only if Burke's status changes significantly. "In humility, we understand that it is not necessary for us to know every detail of the Cardinal's treatment," the statement said.  "Though his family realizes that the Cardinal belongs' to the Church, they also ask that we respect his privacy. The period of hospitalization, and for now isolation because of the COVID virus, may be prolonged as His Eminence's body fights the infection and recovers strength. For the time being, the sedation assists his own peace and rest."  Burke, 73, holds a doctorate in canon law. He served as bishop in the Diocese of La Crosse before becoming archbishop in St. Louis. He left St. Louis in 2008 to oversee the Vatican's supreme court, becoming the first American to hold that position. He has built a reputation as an outspoken conservative. He drew attention in 2004 when he said he wouldn't give Holy Communion to Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry because Kerry supports abortion rights.  In 2009 he chastised the University of Notre Dame over plans to give then-President Barack Obama an honorary degree because Obama, too, supports abortion rights. Francis moved Burke out of the Vatican court in 2014 after Burke said the church was like a ship with no rudder. He has been on the attack against Francis since then. He joined three other conservative cardinals in formally asking Francis in 2016 to explain why he decided to let remarried Catholics receive Holy Communion. He also has joined a chorus of conservative and traditionalist criticism of Francis' crackdown on the celebration of the old Latin Mass, calling the decision severe and saying he shared the sorrow of Catholics who felt Francis had unfairly attacked them. Burke also has warned people that governments were using fear of the pandemic to manipulate people. He spoke out against mandatory vaccinations in May 2020, saying some in society want to implant microchips in people. He has said the best weapon for fighting the virus is Jesus Christ.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cardinal-in-serious-condition-after-contracting-covid-19/articleshow/85440709.cms||---

The museum was first established in a converted prison quarters on what is now Museum Road on August 18, 1865. It first bore the name Mysore Museum. In 1877, it was shifted to its current premises on Kasturba Road, next to where Visvesvaraya Museum stands. The museum, which was inaugurated with much fanfare, had 80,213 visitors walking in to see the artifacts on display during the first year. Records show that many of the visitors were not literates. The Mysore Gazetteer records the celebrations at the launch with exhibits, including silk, cotton, wool, seeds, oil, drugs, old coins, rocks and stuffed animals exclusively belonging to the region. But the history behind how a prison complex in the city made way for a fine museum lies in the records at Karnataka State Archives. It all started with the transfer and posting of British officer and surgeon Edward Green Balfour from Madras to Bangalore in 1861 as the deputy inspector general of hospitals, Bangalore Cantonment. Balfour, who had helped unveil the Madras Museum, the oldest in south India, on April 29, 1851, proposed that Mysore state with a rich history needed a museum to showcase its specialities, especially in its capital city. From 1863 onwards, a team lead by Dr Balfour started collecting various items for the museum and many Bangaloreans and wealthy people from other parts of the state. Even Travancore contributed rare items in their possession for the cause. Records show that in 1864, the Bangalore Prison Complex — located where SBI state headquarters stands now — was evacuated to be moved to where Freedom Park is today. Also, a decision was taken to open the museum at the jail superintendent’s quarters, which is now the Museum of Communication under India Post on Museum Road. With a total of 3,203 donated items, including rare coins, stones, silk and even hunted and stuffed animals, the first museum of the state opened its doors on August 18, 1865 for the public for free visits from 6.30am to 6pm on all days. Thus the road outside was christened Museum Road in the later years. From the archievesA 150-year-old record at the state archieves from July 1866 shows that the museum had 19,873 visitors for the month and 14,146 were unable to put their signature, but marked their entry. This went to show how the Mysore museum was the first in the country to encourage unlettered visitors even in the 19th century. The Museum Association in London, a premier body, in their 1936 report lauded the museum in Bangalore for its exhibits and the enthusiasm of people in visiting the place. According to historians, the first museum was fondly known as the Tamasha Bungalow among locals as many found the stuffed animals on display the high point. The need for a bigger facility due to growing crowds prompted the museum to be shifted to its present location on Kasturba Road. From its unveiling in 1865, the museum allowed free entry for the public till February 27, 1965, when a fee of 10 paise for adults and 5 paise for kids was introduced, records show. The entry fee now is Rs 20 for adults and Rs 10 for children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktakas-oldest-museum-turns-156/articleshow/85440796.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh govt to file affidavit on challenge to APSDC a/c||VIJAYAWADA: The state government on Wednesday sought time to file an affidavit in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging certain sections of Andhra Pradesh State Development Corporation (APSDC) Act. TDP legislator Velagapudi Ramakrishna moved the high court with a PIL contending that certain sections in APSDC Act are ultra vires. Arguing on behalf of Ramakrishna, senior counsel Basava Prabhu Patil said that the sections, which pave the way for the state government to deposit money collected from various taxes into the account of APSDC instead of depositing in consolidated fund, are against Articles 266, 202 and 204 of the Constitution. The state government has even created an escrow account by pledging future revenues of the state to avail of loans from financial institutions. The state showed the tax amount deposited in the APSDC account as its revenue which otherwise would have been deposited in the consolidated fund. He argued that such a practice was illegal and in violation of the Constitution and hence, the sections in APSDC Act allowing state to divert tax revenues into its account, are liable to be set aside. Arguing on behalf of the state government, senior counsel Dushyant Dave said that the PIL was not maintainable as there was no illegality in creation of APSDC. He said it was formed through a legislative process and in existence since long. He sought time to file a reply to the petition. The high court considered his request and posted further hearing of the matter to August 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-to-file-affidavit-on-challenge-to-apsdc-a/c/articleshow/85438353.cms||Srikanth Aluri

We assure all diplomats are safe,’’ Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told ToI from his Qatar office Wednesday. Shaheen had tweeted on Monday that a secure environment will be provided to all diplomats and charitable workers. Given the uncertainty prevailing in Afghanistan though, with no real government in place, India thought it best to pull out all 192 staff members involved in running the Indian mission. As has been reported, an Indian convoy, which departed from the embassy for the airport on Monday was turned back and Indian officials had to negotiate with the insurgents, through local assets, for their evacuation. A few reports from Kabul have said that the Taliban finally even escorted the Indian diplomats and others, who were evacuated, to the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-us-others-agree-afghanistan-needs-representative-inclusive-govt-with-no-place-for-terror/articleshow/85441110.cms||Sachin Parashar

Gulshan Nazir, who was named as an accused on the basis of entries in at least two diaries seized from the house of a Mehbooba aide, visited the ED office in Srinagar along with her daughter, officials said. The case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act pertains to alleged diversion of discretionary funds during Mehbooba's last term as chief minister of a PDP government. The seized diaries purportedly contain details of some of the alleged payments to various bank accounts, including in Gulshan's name. The summons issued to Gulshan, whose late husband Mufti Mohammed Sayeed had stints both as a Union minister and CM of J&K, had invited cries of political vendetta against PDP. Mehbooba claimed politicians, journalists and activists standing up to BJP were being "punished for speaking the truth in Naya Kashmir". She said her mother was being targeted and questioned by agencies "meant to do serious work" but functioning as tools to be used against (rival) politicians. "Look at the chronology. As soon as I showed my reluctance to meet the Delimitation Commission and staged a protest on August 5, summons were issued again (to her mother)," the PDP president said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-grills-muftis-mom-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/85441801.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||World||Multiple casualties occur at deadly anti-Taliban protests in Afghan cities||ISLAMABAD: Taliban fighters killed two protesters and injured 12 others in the eastern city of Jalalabad on Wednesday during protest demonstrations against the insurgent group’s takeover of Afghanistan by force. The militants fired into the crowd after beating up protesters who attempted to remove a white Taliban banner with Islamic inscriptions and replace it with the country’s green, red and black flag. Firing was also reported from a central square in Daronta district, just outside Jalalabad, when people there also replaced a Taliban flag. There were also reports and videos of violence in the southeastern city of Khost, with some reports suggesting that deaths and injuries had occurred at an anti-Taliban demonstration there. A video shared on social media showed people taking to the street in Khost, with gunshots heard in the background. The militants had seized Jalalabad, capital of Nangarhar province along the border with Pakistan, hours before the fall of Kabul without resistance after negotiating a deal with local leaders. In a show of resistance, hundreds of Jalalabad residents marched through the centre of the city waving flags of the Afghan Republic, whistling and shouting anti-Taliban slogans. Many protesters climbed onto the buildings at the city’s busiest intersection, Pashtunistan Square, to replace the Taliban flags with national flags. When the militants fired to disperse the crowd, some people ran away while others continued with their demonstration, whistling and cheering. Several videos of the firing have been uploaded on social media. "We are not scared of the violence of these barbarians. We will protest again to prevent Taliban from desecrating the Afghan flag," one of the protesters said in a video post. Meanwhile, an Afghan journalist, Hafizullah Maroof, tweeted that "colleagues (journalistas) in the city were in tears after being beaten up by Taliban fighters while covering the protest". People also came out into the streets in Asadabad, Kunar’s capital, as anger at the Taliban takeover grew. Violent incidents continued in the country as former Afghan president Hamid Karzai and former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah, a prominent political figure in Afghanistan, met Taliban representatives in Kabul. They also met Anas Haqqani, a senior Taliban leader and son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, a slain founder of the Haqqani network, which was declared a terrorist group by Washington in 2012. Mohammad Yusof Saha, Karzai’s spokesman, said that these meetings would eventually facilitate negotiations with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the top Taliban political leader, who had landed in Afghanistan on Tuesday. Despite Taliban announcements of a general amnesty and their appeal to people to stay in the country, thousands of people are desperately attempting to flee amid fears of a return to the Taliban’s brutal 1996-2001 regime. Many urbanised Afghans are suspicious at the sequence of events that began after the Taliban gained control of border crossings with neighbouring countries. This was followed by the insurgents capturing Afghan provincial capitals one after another, and then finally entering Kabul, in just 10 days. "This was a major blow as it had choked the road communications of Ghani’s Afghanistan with its neighbours. It seems the Taliban have been given the power through an understanding. If the US wanted peace in this country, they needed first to seek some sort of an understanding between Kabul and the Taliban instead of signing an agreement with the militants without involving the Afghan government," a faculty member at Jalalabad’s State University said. Another faculty member, a professor at the same university, doubted the rapid surrender of cities in the presence of 350,000 well-trained Afghan troops. "Professional soldiers don’t fight without officers’ order. It seems the top civil and military leadership had no clear strategy on how to timely direct and mobilise the forces," the professor opined. He said Afghan troops were apparently trained to fight jointly with Western forces under their command and supervision. "They were demoralised by the departure of their Western partners and the absence of an efficient command structure in their ranks," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/multiple-casualties-occur-at-deadly-anti-taliban-protests-in-afghan-cities/articleshow/85441914.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The study published by Women’s World Banking and Bank of Baroda estimates that by serving 10 crore low-income women public sector banks could attract Rs 25,000 crore in deposits and empower 40 crore low-income Indians. The report recommends that banks design products for women that allows them to make small deposits and overcome inhibiting factors. To get them to use the accounts it asks banks to promote awareness and nudge customers. It has called for transforming business correspondents from human ATMs to relationship managers offering rural women all financial products. Finally, it calls upon banks to disaggregate their Jan Dhan Account data according to gender. “We are blessed to have a platform like the Jan Dhan Yojana accounts which can be the world’s largest women empowerment opportunity,” said Sriraman Jagannathan, Executive Vice President, Asia, Women’s World Banking According to Jagannathan, in any other country, a women empowerment programme would have to be run using a pilot programme, in India, most women already have the Jan Dhan accounts. “A good percentage of women, especially those belonging to the low-income group, still shy away from realizing the full potential of their bank accounts. Rather, they still view it only as a channel to receive and withdraw cash. And, therein lies an unutilized opportunity and an untapped potential from a banking perspective,” said Sanjiv Chadha, MD & CEO, Bank of Baroda. A pilot run by Bank of Baroda on a women-specific savings account linked to Jan Dhan Yojana was highly successful. The basic bank account, without any charges or minimum balance requirement, drew a large number of women after the government announced its decision to transfer Rs 500 a month during the pandemic year to women accounts, “This groundswell of women accounts has made her own agency possible. Banks are now able to get a view on her savings and cash flows and offer loans and other products and services,” said Jagannathan. According to Jagannathan retirement products are crucial for women as they generally outlive men but do not have financial assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/women-save-more-in-jan-dhan-yojana-accounts/articleshow/85442064.cms||---

The same data for about 7.8 million current T-Mobile customers who pay monthly for phone service also appears to be compromised. No phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords or financial information from the nearly 50 million records and accounts were compromised, it said.  T-Mobile has been hit before by data theft but in the most recent case, "the sheer numbers far exceed the previous breaches," said Gartner analyst Paul Furtado.  T-Mobile, which is based in Bellevue, Washington, became one of the country's largest cellphone service carriers, along with AT&T and Verizon, after buying rival Sprint last year. It reported having a total of 102.1 million U.S. customers after the merger.  "Yes, they have a big target on their back but that shouldn't be a surprise to them," Furtado said. "You have to start questioning the organization. How much are they actually addressing these breaches and the level of seriousness?"  T-Mobile also confirmed Wednesday that approximately 850,000 active T-Mobile prepaid customer names, phone numbers and account PINs were exposed. The company said that it proactively reset all of the PINs on those accounts. No Metro by T-Mobile, former Sprint prepaid, or Boost customers had their names or PINs exposed.  There was also some additional information from inactive prepaid accounts accessed through prepaid billing files. T-Mobile said that no customer financial information, credit card information, debit or other payment information or Social Security numbers were in the inactive file.  T-Mobile had said earlier this week that it was investigating a leak of its data after someone took to an online forum offering to sell the personal information of cellphone users.  The company said Monday that it had confirmed there was unauthorized access to "some T-Mobile data" and that it had closed the entry point used to gain access. "If you were affected, you'll hear from us soon," CEO Mike Sievert tweeted in response to a concerned customer Tuesday.  The company now says it will immediately offer two years of free identity protection services and is recommending that all of its postpaid customers - those who pay in monthly installments - change their PIN. Its investigation is ongoing.  T-Mobile has previously disclosed a number of data breaches over the years, most recently in January and before that in Nov. 2019 and Aug. 2018, all of which involved unauthorized access to customer information. It also disclosed a breach affecting its own employees' email accounts in 2020. And in 2015, hackers stole personal information belonging to about 15 million T-Mobile wireless customers and potential customers in the U.S., which they obtained from credit reporting agency Experian.  "It's a real indictment on T-Mobile and whether or not these customers would want to continue working with T-Mobile," said Forrester analyst Allie Mellen. "Ultimately T-Mobile has a lot of really sensitive information on people and it's just a matter of luck that, this time, the information affected was not financial information."  She said the hack didn't appear particularly sophisticated and involved a configuration issue on a server used for testing T-Mobile phones.  "There was a gate left wide open for the attackers and they just had to find the gate and walk through it," Mellen said. "And T-Mobile didn't know about the attack until the attackers posted about it in an online forum. That's really troubling and does not give a good indication that T-Mobile has the appropriate security monitoring in place."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/data-of-40-million-plus-exposed-in-latest-t-mobile-breach/articleshow/85442238.cms||---

Afghan First Vice-President Saleh said on Tuesday he was the "legitimate caretaker president" of Afghanistan after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country as Taliban insurgents took the capital Kabul. Saleh's whereabouts were unknown. Ambassador Zahir Aghbar, a lieutenant general who held senior positions in Afghan state security including chief of police before becoming ambassador, blamed the defeat on Ghani and replaced his portrait in the embassy with one of Saleh. "I cannot say that the Taliban have won the war. No, it was just Dr Ashraf Ghani who gave up power after treacherous talks with the Taliban," he told Reuters in an interview. "And only Panjshir resists, led by Vice President Amrullah Saleh," he said. "Panjshir stands strong against anyone who wants to enslave people." The narrow Panjshir valley is still littered with the remnants of armoured vehicles destroyed by the forces of the former Mujahideen leader Ahmad Shah Massoud during the Soviet invasion of the 1980s. It also became a centre of the anti-Taliban resistance in the decade following and a key stronghold of the Northern Alliance that the United States supported to defeat the Taliban in 2001. However, it was unclear how significant any resistance might be from Saleh, one of Massoud's closest aides, or whether the holdout was a prelude to a compromise with the Taliban, who have so far not entered the area. Massoud's 32-year-old son Ahmad Massoud is believed to be in Panjshir with his supporters. It was not immediately possible to reach a spokesperson for his movement. Unconfirmed reports also suggest that remnants of some of the elite Special Forces units trained by the United States have retreated to the area following the Taliban's lightning campaign that led to the fall of Kabul on Sunday. Possible resistance could complicate the Taliban's attempts to impose a unified government on Afghanistan's complex mix of regions and ethnicities. The Persian-speaking Tajiks of western and northern regions, including the Panjshir valley, have long been opposed to the southern and eastern Pashtuns who make up the core of the Taliban. Aghbar said a coalition government involving the Taliban that would represent all Afghan factions was possible, if they "let others live in peace and accord". Italian aid group Emergency said its hospital in Panjshir was operating and was taking in a growing number of wounded. "Regarding our hospital ... unfortunately we have to report that admissions for war surgery are increasing," said Alberto Zanin, medical coordinator of the group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghan-envoy-says-hold-out-panjshir-province-can-resist-taliban-rule/articleshow/85442259.cms||---
---||India||Shashi Tharoor cleared of charges in wife Sunanda’s death case||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Wednesday gave a clean chit to Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in the case of the death of his wife, Sunanda Pushkar. Special judge Geetanjali Goel discharged Tharoor of all charges in a hearing conducted through video-conferencing. A detailed copy of the order spelling out the reasons has not yet been released. After the judge pronounced the verdict, Tharoor said he was "grateful" and it has been "seven and a half years of absolute torture". Tharoor had been accused of subjecting his late wife to cruelty and abetting her suicide by Delhi Police, which had filed a detailed chargesheet in the matter. Pushkar’s body was discovered in a room of a five-star hotel in the capital on January 17, 2014. An FIR was registered by police a year later, on January 1, 2015, against unknown persons for murder. Tharoor was later booked under IPC Sections 498-A (subjecting a woman to cruelty) and 306 (abetment to suicide). After the pronouncement of the judgment, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, said that the charges of abetment of suicide and cruelty levelled by police against his client were "absurd and preposterous". "I am delighted to hear the pronouncement of discharge for Dr Shashi Tharoor. It was a long battle of seven years. Ultimately, justice has prevailed. He had faith in the judicial system right from the beginning. I had always advised Dr Tharoor not to make any public statement as the matter was sub judice… Even the most essential ingredients of the offences were not present in this case," he said. He added that all the reports of various medical boards, besides psychological autopsy reports, had exonerated Tharoor from the charges of homicide or suicide. "The chargesheet was without any basis. There was no complaint of harassment or abetment of suicide by any of the family members or friends of late Sunanda Pushkar Tharoor. I am happy that at last after seven years, justice has prevailed and he has been honourably discharged from all the charges made by Delhi Police against him," the senior counsel said. The trial saw several twists and turns with police asking the court to prosecute him for abetment of suicide or "alternatively" frame murder charges against him in the case. The public prosecutor, appearing for police, had submitted that the special investigation team in the case had to approach the FBI, stating that the CFSL report into her death was not correct. The additional public prosecutor, Atul Shrivastava, had said that while as per the post-mortem report the cause of death was poisoning, "there were 15 ante mortem injuries which were 12 hours to four days old and produced in a scuffle." Further, relying on three medical reports, he had claimed that the "cause of death was poisoning, probably alprazolam poisoning". He alleged that Sunanda was upset with her husband after she found a BBM message exchanged between Tharoor and Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar. The defence sought Tharoor's discharge in the case and claimed that the prosecution had made "an irresponsible statement by claiming that the CFSL report was not right". It argued that the investigation conducted by the SIT had completely exonerated the politician from all the charges levelled against him and there was no evidence against him in the case, adding that "none of the labs in India say that alprax was found. The FBI report stated that only traces were found because she was consuming one or two tablets… this theory is in the air." "The cause of death could not be determined and they are going from one door to another. We have to speak from the evidence and not just from the air," the senior counsel had said. Pahwa had also read out the statement of Pushkar’s son Shiv Menon, who said that Tharoor "could not have murdered his mother as he could not hurt a fly". He had also moved an application seeking to bring Pushkar’s tweets on record and submitted that her tweets "clearly indicate that the deceased was not having any ‘suicidal ideations’ as is sought to be alleged by the prosecution". The court dismissed the application. Cops to seek legal opinion on course of actionDelhi Police will seek a legal opinion and study the court order to decide the next course of action subsequent to the discharge of Shashi Tharoor in the case. However, an appeal was unlikely to change things much, sources said on Wednesday, citing the kind of investigation which police initially conducted in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tharoor-cleared-of-charges-in-wife-sunandas-death-case/articleshow/85442414.cms||Usha Das
---||World||Chief in charge of intel before Capitol riot returns to post||WASHINGTON: Yogananda Pittman, the Capitol Police official who led intelligence operations when thousands of pro-Trump rioters descended January 6, is back in charge of intelligence as officials prepare for what's expected to be a massive rally at the Capitol to support those who took part in the insurrection. Pittman - elevated to acting chief after then-Chief Steven Sund was forced to resign in the aftermath of the deadly insurrection - was passed over last month for the role of permanent chief. The Capitol Police Board, which oversees the force, instead picked J Thomas Manger, the former chief of the police departments in Fairfax County, Virginia and Montgomery County, Maryland. Pittman's tenure as assistant chief was marred by a vote of no-confidence from rank-and-file officers on the force and questions about intelligence and leadership failures - specifically, why the agency wasn't prepared to fend off a mob of insurrectionists, even though officials had compiled intelligence showing white supremacists and other extremists were likely to assemble in Washington on January 6 and that violent disruptions were possible. But more than six months after the riot, Pittman has been put back in charge as assistant chief of the agency's intelligence operations and supervising officers who protect top congressional leaders. "Supporters of the current president see January 6, 2021, as the last opportunity to overturn the results of the presidential election," said a January 3 Capitol Police intelligence assessment. "This sense of desperation and disappointment may lead to more of an incentive to become violent." Unlike past events, when pro-Trump supporters clashed violently with counter-demonstrations, "Congress itself is the target on the 6th," the assessment added. Police officials in Washington are increasingly concerned about a rally planned for September 18 on federal land next to the Capitol that organizers have said is meant to demand "justice" for the hundreds of people who have already been charged in connection with January's insurrection. Organizers of the event, known as "Justice for J6," have said the event will be peaceful but law enforcement officials fear such an event with thousands of people could devolve quickly into violence. That Pittman remains in the position overseeing intelligence is notable given the internal leadership upheaval that followed the riot - Sund, the House and Senate sergeants at arms and the only other assistant police chief all resigned after January's attack - though on the other hand, removing her from the job could also represent a concession by the department that there was an intelligence failure on their part. Capitol Police officials say Pittman was "given the additional responsibility" of being the acting police chief on a temporary basis and never left her old job, though an organization chart obtained by The Associated Press shows that the position of assistant chief overseeing intelligence was held by a different official, Sean Gallagher. He is now temporarily in charge of the department's uniformed officers. "In that temporary position, Chief Pittman led the Department through numerous reviews. She also directed and led improvements to pivot the USCP towards an intelligence based protective agency," the agency said of Pittman's time as police chief. As the temporary public face of the department, Pittman conceded to Congress at a February hearing that multiple levels of failures allowed pro-Trump rioters to storm the building but dispute the notion that law enforcement had failed to take the threat seriously, noting how Capitol Police several days before the riot had distributed an internal document warning that extremists were poised for violence. Capitol Police had compiled numerous intelligence documents suggesting the crowd could turn violent and even target Congress. The Associated Press has obtained full versions of four separate Capitol Police intelligence assessments in December and January that warned that crowds could number in the tens of thousands and include members of extremists groups like the Proud Boys and Antifa. A January 3 memo, for instance, warned of a "significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike." But none of the assessments envisioned the deadly violence that actually happened when thousands of Trump loyalists overran the building, and police officials have repeatedly said they had no intelligence to suggest that would happen. Arguably the most detailed Capitol Police intelligence document was a December 21 assessment that showed how people had been researching and discussing the tunnels under the Capitol - typically used by members of Congress and staff - on public websites. A January 5 FBI memo from its Norfolk field office contained a similarly ominous warning. Pittman told congressional officials that she had distributed that December 21 intelligence assessment to her command staff, including the chief, the other assistant chief and deputy chiefs, but one recently retired deputy chief, Jeffrey Pickett, told AP that he had not received the document and was unaware of other senior officials who had. In a statement, Capitol Police officials said that the department had "enhanced its security posture" because of the intelligence "indicating increased interest in the tunnels." A law enforcement official told the AP that Pittman had emailed Sund and the other assistant chief, Chad Thomas, about the tunnel information. The department did not say whether Pittman sent the actual intelligence assessment to other chiefs, as she testified. "What the intelligence didn't reveal was the large-scale demonstration would become a large-scale attack on the Capitol Building as there was no specific, credible intelligence about such an attack," the department said in a statement.

---||World||US blocks Taliban access to Afghan central bank assets||The Biden administration has blocked access to Afghan central bank assets in the US to ensure that they are not available to the Taliban, an administration official said on Tuesday. The action, taken by the treasury department, to cut off the Afghan economy’s financial lifeline will put economic pressure on the Taliban as they seek to keep public services operating. The vast majority of the Afghan central bank’s assets, which include $9.4 billion in gross international reserves, are not currently held in Afghanistan. The decision was reported earlier by Politico. As the Afghan government collapsed over the weekend, lawmakers in the US pushed to ensure that financial ties between the countries are severed. The extent of Afghan holdings at the institution is not clear, though it is common for foreign governments to hold accounts at the New York Fed, both for security reasons and to enable smooth cross-border payments and dollar-based transactions. The New York Fed does not, as a matter of policy, acknowledge or discuss individual account holders, a Fed official said. It is unlikely that the Taliban would be able to retrieve any Afghan assets stored with the Fed. When current events affect the status of accounts, the New York Fed and the state department determine who can have access based on a compliance manual the central bank branch disclosed several years ago. Likewise, under the Federal Reserve Act, the secretary of state must recognise individual representatives of foreign account holders. Separately on Tuesday, a group of 18 lawmakers sent a letter to treasury secretary Janet Yellen, urging her to intervene in the scheduled release of $650 billion in International Monetary Fund emergency reserves this month. The allocation, of so-called special drawing rights, would potentially give Afghanistan and the Taliban access to $450 million. It is not clear what Yellen could do at this point to intervene, and it is up to the IMF to determine how a country is recognised. The acting governor of Afghanistan’s central bank, Ajmal Ahmady, said on Monday that he had received a call on Friday saying it would get no further shipments of US dollars. The central bank supplied less currency to the markets on Saturday, a move that "further increased panic", he said. The treasury department declined to comment on the letter to Yellen and the cancelled shipments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/us-blocks-taliban-access-to-afghan-central-bank-assets/articleshow/85442578.cms||---
---||Business||Voda Idea falls Rs 150 crore short on payment of licence fee||NEW DELHI: As it fights a desperate survival battle amidst heavy losses and mounting debt, Vodafone Idea has failed to pay the full licence fee to the government for the first quarter of this fiscal, with a shortfall of nearly Rs 150 crore. This is the second quarter of delayed payments by the company towards its licence fee, and will lead to a fresh penalty and dues demand over and above the nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore that it has to already pay to the department of telecom. As per the company’s own assessment, it’s telecom licence fee for the April-June quarter of fiscal 2021-22 was around Rs 690 crore. However, it could only pay around Rs 540 crore, top sources told TOI. Questions sent to the company remained unanswered. The licence is charged at 8% of the adjusted gross revenues of an operator during the prescribed period, and any delay carries an interest penalty charge calculated at MCLR (marginal cost of funds based landing rate) plus 4%. Notices would be issued to the company soon if the payment continues to remain short, the sources said. Vodafone Idea is currently in the middle of a massive cash crunch, but promoters — Vodafone Plc of the UK and Aditya Birla Group — have refused to make any fresh equity investments, looking to raise finances from outside sources. Kumar Mangalam Birla, the erstwhile chairman of the company, had in a letter to cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba (in June) offered his group’s stake of 27% to the government or any other entity that it deems fit in the name of "national interest". He sought an urgent government bailout, saying that absence of a revival package may lead Vodafone Idea towards an "irretrievable point of collapse". On the other hand, Vodafone Plc global CEO Nick Read told analysts that no more funds will come to India. "… I want to make it very clear, we are not putting any additional equity into India." The government is also working overtime to work out a solution that enables Vodafone Idea to stay afloat, and not head towards bankruptcy, which would give the biggest hit to the exchequer. Vodafone Idea, the third-biggest telecom operator with around 27 crore subscribers, owes a massive Rs 96,300 crore to the government as deferred spectrum payment dues, while being liable to pay another Rs 61,000 crore towards AGR liabilities. Both the payments also carry interest payment worth thousands of crores, leaving the government in a precarious position in case the company defaults and gradually heads towards bankruptcy. Among the various options that the department of telecom is looking at is a plan to extend the two-year moratorium on spectrum payments beyond fiscal 2021-22. Any such relief at the cost of the exchequer, however, will not be restricted just to Vodafone Idea, but would be given to the entire telecom industry, thus benefiting healthier players such as Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel even more. Sources within the government say that any relief package would be "justifiable" if the promoters of Vodafone Idea also step ahead and put in fresh equity. "They need to send positive signals and assure that they are ready to invest and work towards a revival. Without their active interest, any sovereign guarantee or a revival package would be only a temporary reprieve, like it happened previously," the sources said. Vodafone Idea CEO Ravinder Takkar told analysts earlier this week that tariff hikes and a floor pricing (minimum mandated charges on data and voice packs) would be critical measures to enable the company regain health. Speaking during the FY22 Q1 earnings call, Takkar said although Birla had recently stepped down as chairman, "he as well as Aditya Birla Group (ABG) and the Vodafone group are committing to providing support and guidance to the company, in line with the stated positions of both the groups". However, he did not elaborate whether the two will invest directly. On fundraising, Takkar maintained that Vodafone Idea continues to remain in active discussions with potential investors. A note by Goldman Sachs has cautioned that Vodafone Iddea has large repayments due starting December 2021, and at the current EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) run-rate, it could have a Rs 23,800 crore cash shortfall until April 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/voda-idea-falls-150-crore-short-on-payment-of-licence-fee/articleshow/85442601.cms||Pankaj Doval

Varanasi senior civil judge Ravi Kumar Diwakar sought responses of the city district magistrate and commissioner of police on the suit filed by the women led by Rakhi Singh, who through advocates Hari Shankar Jain and Vishnu Shankar Jain argued that the devotees had an indefeasible right to worship the “visible and invisible deities” inside the old Kashi Vishwanath Temple complex, which was allegedly damaged by Mughals during the reign of Aurangzeb. Jain submitted the defendants should be barred from interfering in the “plaintiffs’ fundamental religious rights in decorating idols of Goddess Gauri, Lord Ganesha, Lord Hanuman, in the worship of Nandi Ji in the temple, and not to damage those idols by issuing a temporary injunction”. The judge said, “In the present case, UP has been made a defendant by the plaintiffs. Therefore, it is necessary to hear the defendant. The plaintiffs should plead for notice on the defendants within three days. Put up for resolution of objections on September 10” Jain also said the plaintiffs have filed an application urging the court to call for “on the spot inspection report” from an advocate-commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/women-seek-right-to-worship-deities-inside-kashi-mosque/articleshow/85442750.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Punjab Vigilance Bureau arrests former DGP Sumedh Saini||MOHALI: The Punjab Vigilance Bureau arrested former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, who is already embroiled in murder and corruption cases, in a fresh case late on Wednesday evening from Mohali, confirmed a senior officer.  Sources said that soon after his arrest, Saini’s counsels for defence knocked the doors of the Punjab and Haryana High Court for bail in the night.  According to the vigilance bureau, Saini had arrived at its headquarters in Mohali around 8.10 pm to join the investigations in a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act, as directed by a local court. But it was not clear whether he was arrested in the same case or fresh charges were added against him.  Saini had earlier in the day approached the local court for a pre-arrest bail in anticipation of registration of fresh case against him, but the court directed him to first join the investigations.  The vigilance bureau had made an unsuccessful attempt to arrest Saini earlier when they raided his residence in Sector 20, Chandigarh, on August 2, as he managed to flee before the sleuths converged there. On August 4, he had also withdrawn a plea from the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the corruption case. In the plea, he had requested the court to direct Punjab Police to take the court’s permission before arresting him in any other offence, if added in the FIR registered in the corruption case.  On August 12, the bench of Justice Avneesh Jhingan had granted interim bail to Saini, subject to his joining investigation within one week, in this case.  The Punjab Vigilance Bureau had registered the case under the Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal conspiracy against the former DGP, along with six others, including an executive engineer with the public works department and his father Surinderjit Singh Jaspal on August 2. The agency alleged that Saini had acquired Jaspal’s Sector-20 house in Chandigarh in a fraudulent deal with fake documents, using questionable financial transactions.  Earlier, hearing a disproportionate assets case, being probed by the vigilance bureau, a local court in Mohali issued orders to attach the property in question. The additional district and sessions judge PS Grewal on July 16 also directed Saini to deposit a monthly rent of Rs 2.5 lakh with the court till the case proceedings are not over.  Saini is also facing the charge of murdering Union territory CITCO junior engineer Balwant Singh Multani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-vigilance-bureau-arrests-former-dgp-sumedh-saini/articleshow/85442813.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||India||India may not commit to mid-century ‘net zero’ timeline, but could consider enhanced climate target||NEW DELHI: India may not commit to the 'net zero' mid-century emission timeline as is being pushed by the US, UK and EU but the country appears to be amenable to an idea of putting out an enhanced target of climate action by aggregating all the new steps it has already been taking beyond its existing pledge under the Paris Agreement. In that scenario currently under discussion within the government, India will revise and update its target ahead of the 26th session of the UN climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UK which may also be attended by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with other world leaders in November. India’s new ambitious renewable energy target of 450 GW, land degradation neutrality and making Indian Railways a ‘net-zero’ carbon emitter by 2030, which the country has already been working on, will be part of the country's enhanced ambition (mitigation goals). These actions collectively would not only further reduce emission intensity of its GDP (GHG emissions per unit of GDP) but also substantially increase the share of non-fossil fuels in the overall energy mix in 10 years. “If you look at these goals which India has already announced beyond its 2015 nationally determined contributions (NDCs), it can well be aggregated to achieve much more than what we had pledged five years ago. Our ambition has, thus, already been enhanced voluntarily. It is just now a matter of putting it out together and submitting it to the UNFCCC," said an official, privy to the discussion on the country’s preparedness for COP26. The issues of India’s overachievement of present NDCs and new ambitious goals on different fronts came up for broad discussion during a meeting of visiting COP26 president-designate and former British minister Alok Sharma with cabinet ministers Bhupender Yadav, R K Singh, Piyush Goyal and Nirmala Sitharaman, and PM’s principal secretary, P K Mishra, here in the past two days. The ministers assured Sharma that India would work constructively for a "successful and balanced" outcome at COP26, reiterating the country's position that the climate action must be “nationally determined”. Extending India’s full support to the UK for COP26, environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Wednesday emphasised that the “climate actions must be nationally determined”. He also underlined India’s position, advocating that the “differentiation and operationalisation of flexibility provided in the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement for developing countries should be at the core of decision-making”. Yadav also reminded Sharma of the needs of “higher concrete actions” in terms of climate finance and technology transfer by the developed countries. The COP26 president, in turn, promised to work on India's concerns including the financial contribution of $100 billion per year by rich nations for supporting adaptation needs of developing countries. Recognising that delivering on $100 billion is a matter of trust for developing countries, Sharma assured India of a definite delivery plan as per the ministerial meeting held in July. “Minister Bhupender Yadav and I reviewed the issues that were raised at the July ministerial meeting and we agreed to continue to cooperate very closely together to ensure COP26 keeps 1.5 degree Celsius (goal) within reach,” said Sharma. At a media roundtable on Wednesday, Sharma noted that India is already on track to overachieve its current NDC and said he requested India to consider whether as part of any revised NDC, that overachievement is taken into account. Asked about the leaders' summit at COP26 and participation of Modi, Sharma said, "We very much look forward to welcoming him to Glasgow to set out climate leadership at the international forum." The leaders' summit will be held on November 1-2. The UK is planning to hold another round of ministerial meetings ahead of COP26. Ministers may physically attend the meeting. On the conclusion of his three-day India visit, Sharma in a statement said, “I have had a set of very constructive discussions with ministers here and I am incredibly encouraged by the visionary speech Prime Minister Modi made on Independence Day, in particular the reference to renewables and green hydrogen... I am looking forward to working closely with India and other partners to achieve success at COP26." The UN's Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) in its latest report, released on August 9, projected that the global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degree C of warming in merely over next 20 years under all scenarios. It means the world will have to drastically cut GHG emissions in the next two decades if it wants to spare humanity from the disastrous consequences of climate change. Currently, the global average temperature rise is approximately 1.1 degree C above the pre-industrial level (1850-1900). The further rise of 0.4 degree, as projected in the report, may lead to increasing number of heat waves events, longer warm seasons, shorter cold seasons and faster sea-level rise globally. “We have no time to waste. The recent IPCC report represents a flashing red on the climate emergency dashboard. But, the report also said that the door is still open on keeping global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, but we need to act now,” said Sharma. He said, “The IPCC report has shown very clearly why this is going to be the decisive decade. Ultimately, what we’re all doing is not only for our generation, but future generations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-may-not-commit-to-mid-century-net-zero-timeline-but-could-consider-enhanced-climate-target/articleshow/85442814.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The court found that except for the formal witnesses — two cops part of the probe and a panch — who deposed about seizure of articles from the spot, there was nothing to indicate the complicity of the accused, Rashid Khan. “There is no independent witness to identify the accused. True that the incident is of 1993 and after such a long delay, witnesses cannot be found so as to identify the accused. It is true that the mob consisted of 300 to 400 people and it is difficult to ascertain who actively participated in vandalising the property. No specific act is attributed to the accused,” the court said. The court said the benefit of doubt goes in Khan’s favour. “There is nothing on record to suggest that the accused actively participated in the unlawful assembly,” the court said. Khan was untraceable for decades and finally arrested in December 2020. He pleaded ‘not guilty’ before the court. During cross-examination, a cop who was part of the patrolling duty, denied the suggestion that due to police firing to disperse the mob, one person was injured and to hush up the matter a false case was registered. The prosecution’s case was that on January 12, 1993, around 3.15am, police on npatrol duty saw a mob of 300 to 400 people engaged in throwing stones and hurling soda bottles at each other. The prosecution said to control the mob, cops used lathis but they (the mob) became more aggressive. Finally, police fired in the air. The prosecution said in the rush, one person got shot and he died subsequently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/could-have-been-bystander-court-clears-man-in-1993-riots-case/articleshow/85442891.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||India||A man of impeccable integrity, strong morals: CJI Ramana at farewell of SC judge Navin Sinha||NEW DELHI: Giving farewell to Justice Navin Sinha, Chief Justice of India (CJI) Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana on Wednesday said that the Supreme Court is losing yet another good judge.  "The Supreme Court is losing a good judge today. Brother Sinha carried this burden upon his broad shoulders with ease. In this quest, he always brought forward the humane side of the law. Today I am feeling sad that I am losing such a valued colleague and friend," CJI Ramana said at the farewell function organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Wednesday.  CJI Ramana described Justice Sinha as a man of impeccable integrity, strong morals, and with the conviction to always stand by his principles. "He is fiercely independent and impartial. We judges are often caught in the dilemma of morality versus legality, in our quest to deliver justice. There are multiple sleepless nights, that we go through to resolve such issues. It is often a tight-rope walk, more so, for a Supreme Court judge. After all, the Supreme Court is the final arbiter. This was the reason the framers of the Constitution gave the Supreme Court the power under Article 142, to render complete justice. This is our sacred duty and a burden that we bear gladly," the CJI said. Justice Sinha also said that "the life of a judge is difficult", but "there is a sense of satisfaction and happiness." He also urged the lawyers and especially the younger generation to be more prepared for shaping the judiciary. "There is a lot more expected from the younger generation of lawyers. The younger generation of lawyers is burdened with shaping our judiciary," Justice Sinha said. The outgoing Supreme Court Judge added that the lawyers should be prepared for the worst, as there is a lot of competition and the stress is much more than before.  "You (lawyers) prepare yourself in such a manner and with such a confidence that when a judge sees you in the courtroom, he/she will be forced to say, I know this person, and the rest will follow," Justice Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-man-of-impeccable-integrity-strong-morals-cji-ramana-at-farewell-of-sc-judge-navin-sinha/articleshow/85442892.cms||---

In a joint statement, the Left parties said India should immediately work towards the safe evacuation of all stranded Indian citizens in Afghanistan, after US suffered a “humiliating defeat” in Afghanistan. The Left also said the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani-led government and the National Army shows the “hollowness of the nature of the State set up by the US and it's NATO allies”. Claiming that India’s Afghan policy has been to blindly follow the Americans, the parties also said “this had resulted in its isolation in the region and is hence left with few options”. Separately on Wednesday, CPI Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he said that India, in light of its international position and role in south Asia, should extend refugee status to all Afghan citizens who wish to relocate to India in view of the resurgence of Taliban. He also said the government should provide visa extension to all Afghans currently residing in India, especially Afghan students studying in Indian institutions. “These students are in a vulnerable and helpless situation, and we must offer a safe haven to them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-must-work-closely-with-regional-powers-to-ensure-stable-future-for-afghanistan-says-left/articleshow/85442940.cms||---
---||India||Our priority is to get Indians out of Afghanistan, says Jaishankar||UNITED NATIONS: India’s priority in Afghanistan is safely getting back home its citizens in the country that has been over-run by the Taliban and it is discussing the matter with UN and US officials, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said here on Wednesday. “Our focus is on ensuring the security in Afghanistan and the safe return of Indian nationals who are there,” he told reporters. “That is really what has been very much the focus of my own engagements here, talking to the UN secretary general (Antonio Guterres), to other colleagues who are here, as well as with the US secretary of state (Antony Blinken) a few days ago,” he said. India has been running an airlift of its citizens from Afghanistan and Jaishankar discussed it with Blinken, whose country is controlling the Kabul airport. He said that these were “early days” of the new situation in Afghanistan and “at the moment, we are like everybody else very carefully following developments in Afghanistan”. As regards future relations with Afghanistan, he emphasised the historic people-to-people ties. Asked by a reporter if India, which has made a “considerable investment” in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, would continue that relationship, Jaishankar said: “While you use the word investment, for us it reflected what was historical relationship with the Afghan people. I think that relationship with the Afghan people obviously continues and that will guide our approach to Afghanistan in the coming days.” Responding to a reporter’s question if India was in touch with the Taliban, he said: “At this point of time, we are, we are looking at what is the situation, evolving situation, in Kabul. Obviously the Taliban, and its representatives have come to Kabul so I think we need to take it on from there.” He did not react to a reporter’s question whether India was concerned that Pakistan-based terrorists could exploit the situation in Afghanistan. ians||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/our-priority-is-to-get-indians-out-of-af-says-jaishankar/articleshow/85443024.cms||---
---||World||Grain of history: Exiled 200 years ago, Afghan royals introduced basmati to Doon||DEHRADUN: Their ancestors founded the last dynasty of Afghanistan, were exiled to India by the British and lived out their days in the Doon valley. Now, in a quiet pocket of Dehradun, seven descendants of the Afghan royals, who introduced Basmati to Dehradun, live as a family of farmers. The first trail leading from Kabul to Mussoorie goes back to 1840, a year into the First Anglo-Afghan War, which would set the stage for what continues to be a struggle for power. The British had secured a victory in Ghazni and Dost Mohammad Khan, founder of the Barakzai dynasty and the ruler of Kabul, Peshawar and Kashmir, surrendered. He was “hustled off” to Mussoorie. “He stayed at what is now the Wynberg Allen School. It came to be known as Bala Hissar Estate locally, referring to the fortress in Kabul,” said his grandson’s great grandson Mohammad Ali Khan, 51, a Doon School alumnus. While Dost Mohammad found his way back to the throne in Kabul by 1842, his grandson Yaqub Khan found himself in the same situation about four decades later. It was after the Second Anglo-Afghan War — he was pushed out of Kabul by the British. “He came to Dehradun in 1879,” said Khan. “He loved hunting and the hills. He found both here. He would go to Raiwala for hunting.” The two Afghan royals, historians say, introduced the Dehradooni Basmati. “Dost Mohammad Khan was fond of pulao and missed it during his exile. He brought Basmati to the Doon valley and is credited with improving its genetic variety,” Dehradun historian and heritage activist Lokesh Ohri said. “His grandson Yaqub Khan continued that. He gave Basmati seeds to a Paltan Bazaar trader and asked him to cultivate them in Dehradun. Surprisingly, the Doon valley’s weather suited the rice and it turned out even better than the variety in Afghanistan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/grain-of-history-exiled-200-years-ago-afghan-royals-introduced-basmati-to-doon/articleshow/85443033.cms||Mohammad Anab

Excerpts from the interview:How much has the Covaxin trial on children advanced and by when can a vaccine be expected? Presently, phase II and III trials of Covaxin are going on for children between 2-18 years. Hopefully, the results will be available soon. They will be presented to the regulators. So, by September or just after it, we may have Covid-19 vaccines for children. This apart, Zydus Cadila’s vaccine trial is also going on for children. Apart from these, what other vaccines are in the pipeline? Zydus Cadila’s vaccine will be the first DNA vaccine available for use. Besides, there is Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Ltd’s m-RNA vaccine, Biological-E vaccine, Serum Institute of India’s Novovax and, another interesting one–an intranasal vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech, which does not require a jab and can be delivered through nostrils. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesAre any available vaccines effective on the Delta Plus variant? Firstly, the Delta-plus variant is less likely to spread than Delta, which is present in over 130 countries. In NIV, we have studied the antibodies produced in vaccinated people and checked it against this variant. We found that the efficacy of antibodies against Delta reduces two to three folds. Yet, the vaccines are protective against the variants. Will we require a booster dose? Is any study being conducted? Studies have been going on overseas. At least seven different vaccines have been tried out for booster dose. Now, the WHO has put a stop to it till more countries catch up with vaccination. Is mixing and matching of vaccines studied? There was a situation where inadvertently two different vaccines were given in two doses. We have tested those samples at NIV and found that the patients were safe. No adverse effect was noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-vaccine-for-kids-likely-in-sept-or-soon-after-expert/articleshow/85443039.cms||---
---||World||Biden to require Covid vaccines for nursing home staff||President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced that his administration will require that nursing home staff be vaccinated against Covid-19 as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. Biden unveiled the new policy Wednesday afternoon in a White House address as the administration continues to look for ways to use mandates to encourage vaccine holdouts to get shots. "If you visit, live or work in a nursing home, you should not be at a high risk for contracting Covid from unvaccinated employees," Biden said. The new mandate, in the form of a forthcoming regulation to be issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, could take effect as soon as next month. Hundreds of thousands of nursing home workers are not vaccinated, according to federal data, despite those facilities bearing the brunt of the early Covid-19 outbreak and their workers being among the first in the country to be eligible for shots. It comes as the Biden administration seeks to raise the costs for those who have yet to get vaccinated, after months of incentives and giveaways proved to be insufficient to drive tens of millions of Americans to roll up their sleeves. In just the past three weeks, Biden has forced millions of federal workers to attest to their vaccination status or face onerous new requirements, with even stricter requirements for federal workers in frontline health roles, and his administration has moved toward mandating vaccines for the military as soon as next month. Biden has also celebrated businesses that have mandated vaccines for their own workforces and encouraged others to follow, and highlighted local vaccine mandates as a condition for daily activities, like indoor dining. The new effort seems to be paying off, as the nation's rate of new vaccinations has nearly doubled over the past month. More than 200 million Americans have now received at least one dose of the vaccines, according to the White House, but about 80 million Americans are eligible but haven't yet been vaccinated. Mark Parkinson, the president and CEO of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, praised the Biden decision, but called on him to go further. "Vaccination mandates for health care personnel should be applied to all health care settings," he said. "Without this, nursing homes face a disastrous workforce challenge." Last year CMS used similar regulatory authority to prohibit most visitors from nursing homes in an effort to protect residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-require-covid-vaccines-for-nursing-home-staff/articleshow/85443063.cms||---
---||India||As members praise Taliban, AIMPLB disassociates itself||LUCKNOW/MUMBAI: All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) secretary Maulana Umrain Mahfuz Rahmani and national spokesperson Maulana Sajjad Nomani have come out in support of the Taliban, praising the organisation for taking over Afghanistan “not with means and resources but belief and faith”. All India Muslim Personal Law Board, however, said it had neither expressed any view nor given any statement on the Taliban and recent political situation of Afghanistan. “Opinion of some board members has been portrayed as the AIMPLB’s stand by a few media channels and wrong things are being attributed to the board. These practices are against the spirit of journalism. Media channels must refrain themselves from such acts and no news regarding Taliban should be attributed to the @AIMPLB_OFFICIAL,” the organisation tweeted. Umrain took to social media to call the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan an extraordinary success, a heavenly decision and a sign that wars are won with God’s help. Sajjad Nomani also called the Afghan Taliban brave for throwing out first world armies out of their country and congratulated them for being “weaponless, humble and forthcoming for peace and sacrifice.” “I on behalf of India Muslims send our salaam (greetings) to you for showing courage. You have created history. These are men with not sophisticated weapons or other resources but they forced the world’s mightiest military to leave their country,” said Nomani. Welcoming the general amnesty announced by the Taliban leaders in Kabul after they took over the Afghan capital on August 15, Nomani said that this gesture had sent a positive message across the world and would go a long way in changing the perception of them in the eyes of the world community. He also appealed to the Indian government to engage with the Taliban and help them be part of a peace process in South Asia. “Your brother in India prays that your success multiplies as this news has given us hope. After years of sacrifice you have got a chance to show that Islam is a religion of peace and for all round development of humanity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-members-praise-taliban-aimplb-disassociates-itself/articleshow/85443059.cms||Yusra Husain

---||World||US utility plans to switch 1200 vehicles to electric by 2030||NASHVILLE: The nation's largest public utility plans to switch out 1,200 of its vehicles for electric ones by 2030, furthering its role in that market for a power supplier that also plans to help add charging stations across the region, the utility's top official said Wednesday. Tennessee Valley Authority Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lyash announced the changeout plans within its current fleet of about 3,800 vehicles during a board meeting.  The plan includes downsizing the fleet's 600 light-duty vehicles to 400 electric versions, which are typically sedans and SUVs; and initially changing out 800 medium-duty vehicles, or about half of the fleet's pickup trucks, TVA spokesperson Jim Hopson said.  The utility is also evaluating reductions in the medium-duty vehicles through efficiency and retirements, Hopson said. Possible switch-out of heavy duty ones depends on technology and price improvements, Lyash said.  The changes will occur as current vehicles reach the end of their usable lives, he said.  The plan coincides with the rollout of efforts to install fast-charging stations every 50 miles (80 km) along major thoroughfares in Tennessee, with the goal of starting to deploy those chargers by the end of the year and having them largely in place by the end of 2022, Lyash said. TVA is also joining with other utilities in a coalition to connect a variety of regions with electric chargers, "from New England to West Texas, and from Detroit to Disney World," Lyash said.  The plan is to have 80 charging locations with at least two fast chargers each across the region by the end of 2026, Hopson said.  On Wednesday, TVA's board also voted for a $220 million plan to extend a pandemic-times credit of 2.5% to its customers, which include local power companies and large industrial entities, through the 2022 budget year with the possibility of continuing it through 2023.  Lyash said the pandemic credit for 2021 totaled $200 million, and local power companies used their share to avoid some planned rate increases; cover losses through unpaid customer power bills; and invest in infrastructure.  Of the 153 local power companies served by TVA, 144 are part of a long-term power initiative that results in another 3.1% credit.  Also Wednesday, the board replaced its chairman John Ryder with Bill Kilbride. The board seats of Ryder and Kenneth Allen expired in May, and two other seats are vacant. President Joe Biden has nominated four people for those slots but they have not been confirmed by the Senate yet.  Ryder and Allen remain on the board until their successors are confirmed and take office or until the end of the current congressional session, typically in December, whichever comes first.  The Tennessee Valley Authority was created in 1933 under the New Deal to provide electricity, flood control and economic development in Tennessee and parts of six surrounding states.  Its customers include some businesses and local power distributors serving 10 million people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-utility-plans-to-switch-1200-vehicles-to-electric-by-2030/articleshow/85443112.cms||---

The report, released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR), stated that Papumpare district has 219.8 per one lakh cancer cases among females. Mizoram’s capital Aizawl has 269.4 per one lakh cases among males, it said. Northeast India is the cancer capital of the country with the highest age-adjusted cancer incidence rates of newly diagnosed cancer cases, said Dr Kaling Jerang, the principal investigator of Population Based Cancer Registry (PBCR) at Bakin Pertin General Hospital in Pasighat. The PBCR project under the ICMR-NCDIR, Bengaluru, has been studying the cancer trends under the National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP), he said on Tuesday. He hoped that the cancer data revealed by the project will be used by the government in policy-making decisions regarding cancer prevention, treatment and management. The estimated number of cancer cases in the northeast in 2020 was 50,317, among whom 27,503 were males and 22,814 females, the report said. Oesophagus cancer was most prevalent in the region with cases 5,785 last year, it said. Oesophagus cancer will continue to be most prevalent in the northeast till at least 2025, the report predicted. Breast and lung cancer are the next most common types of cancer found in the northeast, as per the report. There were 3,674 breast cancer cases in the region last year and 3,413 cases of lung cancer, it added. The ICMR-NCDIR study further revealed that Papum Pare also recorded the steepest age adjusted incidence rate (AAR) for cancer of the stomach (males), liver (both genders), cervix uteri, ovary and thyroid. Across northeast, oesophagus cancer (13.6%) is the highest among males, followed by lung cancer (10.9%) and stomach cancer (8.7%). Among females, the breast is the leading cancer site (14.5%), followed by cervix uteri (12.2%) and gallbladder (7.1%), the report said.

The seven-day rolling average of daily cases in the country fell below 35,000 on Wednesday for the first time in nearly five months. The seven-day average stood at 34,965 on Wednesday, down from 40,832 on August 1. The last time the average was below the 35,000 mark was on March 20 this year (34,284). India recorded 36,500 fresh cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, a rise from 35,134 reported the previous day but significantly below last Wednesday’s count of 41,649, as per TOI’s Covid database. For the second straight day, Kerala’s daily tally remained over 21,000. The state reported 21,427 new cases, accounting for 59% of all cases detected in the country on Wednesday. The test positivity rate in Kerala was higher than 15% for the second day running. In Maharashtra too daily case detections and deaths showed an upward tick on Wednesday. After reporting under-4,500 cases for the last two days, the state listed 5,132 cases and 158 deaths, including five in Mumbai. The city added 285 patients testing positive for Covid as against 196 on Tuesday. India reported 524 deaths from the virus on Wednesday, the highest daily toll in six days as Maharashtra and Kerala (179) recorded more fatalities than in the last few days. Odisha reported 65 deaths, Tamil Nadu 31, Karnataka 22, and Andhra Pradesh and Assam 15 each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1st-in-5-months-indias-7-day-avg-of-covid-cases-falls-below-35k/articleshow/85443133.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||‘Vaccine works for 6-9 months; yearly shots could be norm’||BENGALURU: Covid-19 vaccine-induced immunity lasts for nearly 6-9 months from the time the second dose is taken, and hence booster doses are needed, says Dr Ananda Giri Shankar, leading epidemiologist and Incident Director, Covid-19, Public Health Wales, National Health Service, Wales, United Kingdom. Dr Shankar, alumnus of Kempegowda Institute Of Medical Sciences, Bengaluru, recently addressed medicos of his alma mater. He played a key role in policy decisions in Wales and drafted guidelines for reopening schools there. The UK is all set to give booster doses. Why are they needed?The first batch of vaccine receivers has completed nearly nine months after their second dose. Studies show there’s a waning immunity with level of antibodies declining. Boosting can happen in two ways: when a fully vaccinated person comes in contact with live virus or when she gets a booster dose. With chances of contacting in touch with a live virus are low, it helps to get a booster dose. A booster prepared for new variants offers additional protection. Currently available vaccines used the Wuhan strain. There could be immune escape potentials in vaccines available. Vaccines produced using delta, beta and delta-plus variants are getting approved. Annual Covid vaccination could be the norm in future. How is genomic sequencing done in the UK?We do genomic sequencing of all Covid cases with CT value below 28. Genomic surveillance is done very well. Alpha variant was found in December 2020, though it was in circulation since October. Once the swab is collected, the sample has to reach the lab within 12 hours and genomic sequencing takes four days. The clock begins ticking when the sample is received in the lab and the clock stops when the result is authorised. Even before genomic sequencing, we can do PCR reflex assay or Variant PCR which can detect specific mutations of the virus, and results released in 24 hours. We don’t necessarily wait for genomic sequencing to take public health action. They are done parallelly. What’s the experience after reopening schools in the UK? Schools are back full-time since March 8, 2021. Each class has 30 children and is a bubble. If one child in a bubble tests positive, the entire bubble self-isolates for 10 days. There have been such incidents. Only bubbles are isolated for 10 days, the rest of the school continues to function. Sta gg ered opening timings and lunch breaks were followed. School opening was given the highest priority, con-sidering the possible adverse impact on child development when they’re at home without peers. School per se is not a risk for virus transmission, but associated activities like parents dropping children and catching up with others needs to be controlled. Secondary classes were opened first and then the primary ones. With every wave, there’s a change in virus behaviour. What goes into preparations for each wave?It depends on modelling assumptions. What matters are factors such as how much the virus can circulate, how much more transmissi-ble it is, what will be the population compliance (good, bad, worst), what happens to vaccinated individuals and public adherence to guidelines. The Welsh government website updates the public every week about modelling and technical advisories. The principle is to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. We track real-life data with the projection. If there’s a divergence, we stop modelling and redo it. This has happened 3-4 times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vax-works-for-6-9-mths-booster-needed-expert/articleshow/85443451.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Sanoj Kumar Yadav, a resident of Jigani and from West Bengal, boarded the flight at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru and allegedly harassed the air hostess before takeoff.  The incident took place when he was walking towards the toilet. “The toilet was occupied by someone else and he was waiting outside. I was standing near him and was busy with some work. He misbehaved with me. When I sought an explanation, he feigned innocence,” the woman stated in the complaint. The cabin attendant brought the matter to the notice of her seniors and the accused was deboarded from the aircraft. A complaint was lodged with KIA police. Yadav has been booked under IPC section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty).

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Vax boosts immunity 3.6 times, says study||VISAKHAPATNAM: A sample study conducted by Andhra Medical College (AMC) on the level of protection being offered by the Covid-19 vaccine has once again proved its high efficacy in preventing the disease. Even if the vaccinated person contracts the infection, chances of getting seriously ill are low. As part of the study, the medical college’s community medicine department engaged 342 study subjects, including the hospitalised Covid-19 patients and those who opted for home isolation. The average age of the hospitalised patients was 48 years, while that of non-hospitalised group was 44. Of the 342 people, 235 study subjects were males and the rest females. Medical college principal Dr PV Sudhakar said the study subjects included some Covid-19 patients who took admission at King George Hospital. “Correspondingly, non-hospitalised patients were also studied for the vaccine efficacy. It has been found that the recipients would have 3.6 times more protection than the (unvaccinated) general public. A complete analysis is yet to be done to publish the study,” said Dr Sudhakar. Dr Sudhakar pointed out that the study has once again proved that even one dose would offer protection against the disease. “It is more important to complete the two doses to get maximum protection,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vax-boosts-immunity-3-6-times-study/articleshow/85437544.cms||---

As many as 26 animals, including lion, tiger, zebra, Aldabra giant tortoise, two-horned rhinoceros, green anaconda, Nile crocodile, royal python, and rhinoceros iguana, have been listed for exchange. Animal exchange programmes allow zoos to swap surplus animals. Once the zoos agree to an exchange, the details are submitted to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) that gives its approval to both the parties. The state government is in talks with its Gujarat counterpart for the exchange of six Asiatic lions, including two males and four females, in lieu of a female rhinoceros. Besides, a proposal to acquire four tigers from Odisha is in the initial stage. Talks are also in progress for acquiring three Aldabra tortoises from Seychelles and a zebra from South Africa after the approval of the CZA. Dipak Kumar Singh, the principal secretary of the department of environment, forest and climate change, told this reporter on Wednesday, “The process of bringing a pair of two-horned rhinos from Vietnam in exchange for two one-horned rhinos is in the final stage. Besides, Denmark will send a pair of green anacondas, Nile crocodiles, royal pythons and rhinoceros iguanas to the Patna zoo and receive a male and seven female gharials in return.” He added, “The Patna zoo will get Aldabra, one of the largest tortoises in the world, from Seychelles. We received a letter in this regard last week. Now, the paper work will take around six months.” Dipak also pointed out that the proposals for exchange of animals with Gujarat and Odisha were in the preliminary stage. Sources claimed that a pair of Asiatic lions from Gujarat would be sent to the Rajgir Zoo Safari and the remaining kept at the Patna zoo which has only one male lion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/zoo-to-welcome-more-inmates/articleshow/85436727.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||Lost a breadwinner? Help is here||MUMBAI: When 32-year-old Deepa Joshi (not her real name) from Gurgaon lost her breadwinner husband to Covid in April this year, her life changed forever. Deepa had been a homemaker. Given that she had never worked even for a single day, she lacked the confidence to take charge of the situation. She had to rebuild her life from scratch. The brutal second wave of the pandemic may have receded, but it has left behind a void for many such families. Providing a glimmer of hope for the likes of Deepa is Women in Tech’s (WiT-ACE) ‘Family Find the Light’ (FFTL) programme, which is reaching out to people in need to not only motivate and train them, but also help them find jobs. FFTL, which is being implemented on a pro bono basis, has currently enrolled 30 family members. With firms like IBM, Macquarie Global Services and Freshworks coming on board, WiT-ACE aims to cover 5,000 such families. “I never had the confidence to be in charge of this situation. But somehow destiny brought me in contact with this programme. Today, with the help of this programme, I have been working as an HR professional in a real estate firm since last month. This is an entry-level job, but gradually I am learning to manage everything in life,” says Deepa, whose husband used to work with IBM. Like Deepa, 30-year-old Anita (name changed) from Bengaluru, had never worked before. Tragedy struck her family when her husband, who worked as a project manager with IBM, died in May due to Covid. When she came across the FFTL programme, she regained her confidence and that helped her secure a job as an analyst. “Before I joined this programme, I was very demotivated. I thought that I was very unfortunate to lose my husband at a young age. But when I joined the programme, I interacted with a lot of young women who had also lost their dear ones due to Covid. The sessions motivated me to think things from a different perspective. The mentoring and life-training sessions were very helpful in boosting my confidence and made me strong mentally,” says Anita. The programme specifically includes sessions on how to cope with loss, while also assisting with career mentoring and coaching. It helps participants through mock tests and assessments around various points of life. They also get to interact with seniors and mentors who train them on how to manage life at this critical juncture, how to handle job interviews, how to manage job-life with kids & family, and how to get the job. WiT-ACE senior adviser Navin Upadhyay, who is leading these efforts, said a job can bring the requisite calmness to a person. On the other hand, the fear of running out of money can make people vulnerable. “After IBM approached us to understand how the industry could become more useful to families who lost a breadwinner, many other companies have come on board to help those in need with skilling and mentoring, so that they can move towards self-sustenance. We are pushing our network of companies heavily to hire those in need and give them the orientation and confidence to go out and work.” Prachi Rastogi, D&I leader at IBM Asia-Pacific, says, “In a crisis like this, we begin to look for outside support for talent and the process takes a lot of time. We have never seen such a synergy where the company’s demand and supply are met through this programme. We feel utmost gratitude that we could support the dependents of our precious employees who lost their lives to Covid. We never imagined we had such brilliant potential in their family members just waiting to be nurtured. We have trained a sizeable number of people through the FFTL programme. Of course, these are not just numbers, these are rays of hope for those who have lost a very important part of their lives. We respect their call to courage and we are doing everything we can to support them in time of their need.” Freshworks CHRO Suman Gopalan says the organisation is fully committed to making a difference to those who lost their earning family members to Covid and are finding it hard to cope with both the grief as well as loss of income.  “With professional and emotional support, counselling, and mentoring along with skills training, this programme will allow them to move forward with their lives and provide for their kids and family,” said Gopalan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lost-a-breadwinner-help-is-here/articleshow/85442170.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Vijayawada||Mining tenders for calcite put on hold||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Wednesday directed the state mineral development corporation (APMDC) not to finalise and allot calcite mining tenders till August 24. The court, which was hearing a PIL challenging the tender notification issued by APMDC for calcite mining in scheduled area of Visakhapatnam district, asked it to file a counter affidavit. One Siyyari Donnu Dora from Araku, moved the high court challenging the tender notification issued to give mining sub-lease for excavation of calcite at Nimmalapadu village under Ananthagiri mandal in Visakhapatnam district. He stated in the PIL that in scheduled areas, the mining has to be done either by the MDC or by local tribals. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana said the eligibility criteria was set in such a way that no tribal will be qualified to participate in the tender. He added that APMDC does not have the jurisdiction to allocate mining leases to others in scheduled areas. Venkata Ramana further argued that the high court single judge had earlier ruled against APMDC by setting aside the first tender notification. Though the notification was reissued with modifications, it is still not valid as the state mineral body does not have the power to give mining sub-lease in scheduled areas. Arguing on behalf of APMDC, advocate VRN Prashant said the PIL is not maintainable and premature as the tender is not yet finalised and not given to non-tribals. Considering the arguments, the high court bench comprising Justice C Praveen Kumar and Justice B Krishna Mohan directed APMDC not to finalise tenders till August 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/mining-tenders-for-calcite-put-on-hold/articleshow/85438371.cms||Srikanth Aluri

A low purchase rate will eventually benefit over 2.6 crore residential, commercial and industrial consumers whose electricity bills could drop in the near future, officials said. The state is all set to go green by switching to a target of 17,360 megawatts (MW) from solar projects in five years. On Wednesday, MSEDCL announced that it floated tenders and invited bids for 500 MW solar energy recently wherein it got this lowest bid of Rs 2.42 per unit. It got another lower bid of Rs 2.62 per unit for tenders floated for procuring 500 MW wind-solar hybrid energy. This is lower than the average thermal energy purchase rate of Rs 4 per unit, an official said. It was also lower than MSEDCL’s renewable energy purchase rate, which was Rs 2.90, in December 2019. “We got an overwhelming response and the bidders are also willing to provide a total 4,615 MW power to MSEDCL, which includes 3,165 MW solar and 1,450 MW wind-solar,” an official said. Of this, 1,000 MW could be procured in a year. Energy minister Nitin Raut said that the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) had set a target for the state to meet 25% of its demand from renewable sources in the next five years. Raut’s department had announced in the recent past that there will be no new thermal generation units in Maharashtra. In the past, MSEDCL would buy renewable energy at a high cost; it was Rs 2.74 per unit in 2018 and Rs 2.90 in 2019. “As a result, the financial burden impacted our consumers. With the consent of the state government, we decided to conduct a competitive tender process in May this year,” stated MSEDCL managing director Vijay Singhal. Raut said that solar and wind power are now becoming commercially viable. “Solar power will be much cheaper than thermal power, benefiting industries and agriculture (for daytime generation for farmers) across the state,” said Raut. By 2030, there are plans to produce 30% of power from solar only. The MSEDCL will shortly approach MERC and apprise it about the final bids on solar power before signing agreements with power suppliers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/electricity-bills-in-maharashtra-set-to-drop-in-near-future/articleshow/85445514.cms||Somit Sen

Ropeway has been chosen as the ‘MRTS of choice’ after a Metro rail proposal moved during the Samajwadi government was found non-viable for the densely populated city. The officials are expecting completion of the feasibility study, detailed plan and financial viability assessment of the project in the next 20 days, after which the process of floating the tender will be initiated. A pilot project is being finalised by WAPCOS Limited, which is an accredited public sector enterprise under the Union ministry of Jal Shakti, with an aim to launch it in November. Under a pilot project, four-five stations including the terminus will come up between Cantonment railway station and Godowlia. Talking to TOI, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal disclosed that a presentation on the pilot project of the proposed ropeway was given by WAPCOS on Wednesday. “WAPCOS was roped in for the introduction of ropeway in Kashi after the Union ministry of urban development signalled the go-ahead in principle with this mode of transportation under MRTS. The agency has started feasibility study and the project is likely to be in a public private partnership mode. If all goes as per plan the target is to begin the project in November,” he added. “Under the pilot project, the ropeway will come up in the 5-km area between Cantonment railway station (Varanasi junction) and Godowlia,” he said adding, “the main terminus is being proposed at Cantt railway station while two or three stations will come up between it and Godowlia. Ropeway is one of the components of MRTS. Following the rejection of Metro rail plan in June 2018, the Varanasi Development Authority had asked Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) to prepare a proposal by incorporating different means of transportation that remain feasible for the city. As per VDA’s demand, RITES incorporated a light metro, ropeways and a waterways in the revised plan and gave a presentation in this regard in December 2019 by defining their alignment of operation. The revised proposal of RITES for MRTS development in Kashi was forwarded to the Union ministry of urban development through the state government in January 2020. In this proposal, the ropeway was proposed between Khidkiya Ghat and Dashaswamedh via City railway station, Cantt railway station, Rathyatra and Godowlia and the capital cost of this project was estimated around Rs 800 crores. Major exercise for MRTS in Kashi was started in 2015 when then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav announced a Metro rail project for Varanasi. In initial detailed project report of Metro rail, the RITES proposed two metro rail corridors estimating project cost as Rs 17,702 crores. Approving this DPR, Akhilesh government in June 8, 2016 forwarded it to the Union ministry of urban development on August 29, 2016. After formation of BJP-led government in state, VDA paid Rs 81 lakhs to RITES to get feasibility report of Metro rail service. On June 20, 2018 VDA did not find Metro rail project as commercially viable after which RITES prepared new proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashis-ropeway-pilot-project-likely-to-be-launched-in-nov/articleshow/85439800.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Right now, we are giving financial assistance of Rs6,000 to each flood-affected family,” Nitish said. “Our priority is to keep flood-affected people safe during the pandemic. Apart from arranging food for them, vaccination and testing for Coronavirus is being done simultaneously. If a single person is found Covid positive at the flood relief camps, several others will get infected. We are running medical check-up camps for other illnesses also,” Nitish said. Accompanied by deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, Nitish inspected the arrangements at the B M College ground in Laxmipur under Barari block of Katihar district and at the Buniyadi high school in Sapha under Rupauli block of Purnia district. The CM also inquired about the medical facilities for the pregnant women, alternative arrangements for children, vaccination and free medicine distribution at the camps besides arrangements at the community kitchens for the flood-hit families. “We get first-hand experience of the affected areas by visiting there personally and taking the feedback from the people. We get to know about their problems. The administration is running community kitchens at several places,” he said. On the river siltation and its management, the CM said, “We are working for its permanent solution. We keep on interacting with people and hold discussions, but cannot claim that everything will be safe and secure. Occasionally, we see the rise in the Ganga water level. Water from other rivers join the Ganga and the scope of its outflow is minimal. That’s why we are facing a tough situation this year. But, we will definitely find a solution for some areas of the state.” On his return to the state capital, Nitish said, “I conducted an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas in Katihar and Purnia. There has been a sharp rise in the water level of Ganga this year, which has caused damages at several places in the two districts.” When asked whether he would seek financial help from the Centre against the damages caused by the floods, Nitish said the state government always makes such demands from the Centre. He also said the state government has made a policy since 2007 to provide relief to the flood-affected people. “We keep improving that policy every year and also made necessary arrangements for cattle,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-gives-rs-6k-to-each-flood-hit-family-in-state-cm/articleshow/85436999.cms||---

Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant on Wednesday told TOI that at least 45 PNB accounts at different branches in Patna, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Bareilly and other places were targeted by a 12-member gang involved in fraudulent transactions. Those arrested included a PNB clerk, Nitesh Kumar (33), posted at the Mahesh Prasad Sinha Science College branch in Muzaffarpur, Mohammad Zafar Iqbal (42) of Ansari Colony at Ahiyapur, Sanjay Kumar (40) of Pupri at Turki in Muzaffapur and Rajesh Kumar (22) of Lahladpur at Patepur in Vaishali district, the SSP said. He said more than Rs3.5 crore was fraudulently transferred from the Jawahar Lal Road branch and the college branch in Muzaffarpur alone and the amount may increase after further investigation, the SSP said. He said the banking fraud came to light while investigating a fraudulent transaction of Rs22 lakh. The latest victim is Professor Jyoti Narain Singh of the MPSS College, who has his salary account with the college branch. Altogether Rs45 lakh has been fraudulently transferred from Singh’s bank account. He lodged an FIR with Sadar police station on Tuesday. Singh told TOI over phone on Wednesday that Rs5 lakh was transacted on August 8 and Rs40 lakh in two separate transactions on August 9 and August 10. “I rushed to the branch on Monday to get my passbook updated. But bank manager Kanchan Kumari was hesitant to update my passbook though there was no rush. After I insisted, she updated my passbook and I came to know about the fraud,” he said. Kant said they came to know that the gang also committed fraudulent transactions from the PNB accounts in Chhapra, Sitamarhi and Motihari. “Nitesh passed personal details, including the customer user IDs and their cellphone numbers to the trio. Only accounts with hefty deposits were targeted,” he said. Th SSP said Rajesh forged Aadhaar cards to get a fake sim card of the customer issued and used the PNB mobile application to transfer money from the customer accounts. The SSP said it is surprising that the PNB has not launched any internal inquiry yet despite its general manager and other senior staff members were alerted about the frauds a fortnight back. When contacted, PNB DGM (Bihar zone) Brajesh Kumar said all these matters are being handled by bank authorities in Muzaffarpur. “Police are inquiring into the matter. Until they share anything, we won’t be in a situation to tell anything,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-3-5cr-fraudulently-transacted-from-pnb/articleshow/85436909.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The deceased was identified as Shaikh Abdul Jakriya (19), who is pursuing an engineering degree at a private engineering college in Vijayawada. According to Nandigama police inspector Ramakrishna, the incident came to light on Wednesday morning when Jakriya’s parents went to wake him up, only to find him hanging from the ceiling. Upon information, cops reached the spot and examined the scene. Cops said that they are yet to ascertain the reason behind the extreme step but suspect that it could be a combination of failure in love and poor academic performance in the semester exams. Cops said they have examined his mobile phone and found text messages expressing sadness to his friends over his failure in love and academics. “We are conducting inquiries based on SMSes on the phone,” Ramakrishna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/student-ends-life-over-failure-in-love-exams/articleshow/85438409.cms||---
---||Vadodara||In 20 minutes, police dog sniffs out 6 rapists-murderers in Gujarat's Vadodara||VADODARA: An indefatigable 18-month-old female Dobermann, a member of Vadodara rural cops’ dog squad for about a month now, has proved to be the ‘Holmes’ among canines, yet again. Jawa took less than half an hour to end a ghastly murder story by leading cops right up to six criminals who raped and killed a 38-year-old woman. Displaying high athleticism, sharp focus and a tenaciously determined sense of purpose the dog sniffed a dupatta and a bottle on the crime spot and started walking in the northern direction. It walked continuously for around 2 kilometres, through fields and bushes until it crossed the busy Ahmedabad-Mumbai railway line and entered a tent where it started barking agitatedly — making it significantly clear that she arrived at her goal — leading to the arrest of six men on Tuesday. Jawa proved why dogs have an edge in detection — they smell first, see and lastly hear for clues at a crime spot — exactly the opposite of what human investigators do. As for Jawa, this detection has been a hat trick for the 18-monthold canine within 45 days, which had earlier helped in detection of a murder in the neighbouring Chhota Udepur district and more recently, found out a murder weapon in Vadu. In this case, the mother of three children was gang raped by six men in a farm where she was cutting grass as per her daily routine, on the outskirts of Dethan village of Karjan taluka on the evening of August 16. The accused later strangled her to death fearing detection. The body was found around 9 pm by her family who were searching for her as she failed to return home till late. A case was registered at Karjan police station in the wee hours of Tuesday. The next morning, different teams of cops panned out interrogating family members and villagers. At the same time, the forensic team, armed with Jawa, reached the crime scene and the chapter was brought to a close within less than 30-odd minutes by the dog who brought the net down on first accused, 22-year-old Lal Bahadur Girjaram, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, inside one of the five tents on the rail track. “In the past too, tracker dogs have been used for investigation purposes, but this was an important development as this dog led us to one accused and subsequent investigation and interrogation resulted in other accused’s arrests,” said Dr Sudhir Desai, superintendent of Vadodara rural police. Jawa’s handler, head constable Haresh Mohaniya was all praise for his ‘girl’. “Her (Jawa’s) behaviour was unusual as she was constantly barking and walking around inside the tent. Our suspicion was strengthened when she chose only one among around five tents at the spot. I had trained her for a year before she was inducted into the squad. She is a quick learner and is especially sharp when it comes to investigation.” While Girjaram was taken to Karjan police station for interrogation, another team of police questioned the other labourers at the camp. 18-month-old Jawa with Haresh Mohaniya, her handlerFive other suspects identified as Dilip Chaudhary, a 45-year-old resident of Jharkhand, Jagguprasad Pandu (21), Pramod Pandu (23), Ramsurat Pandu (19) and Arjun Pandor (19), all natives of Uttar Pradesh too, were picked up for questioning. “They are all hardened criminals. We got a confession from them after we interrogated them separately and then together for over seven hours,” said inspector D B Vala of local crime branch. All six were working on a contract for the last 10 days for maintenance of railway tracks. Police are now investigating if they have been involved in any other crimes in the past. Accused targeted her:Investigation revealed that the six accused had planned to target the woman when they saw her crossing the railway tracks to go to work on the farm on August 16 evening. Sometime after 6.30 pm, after their work by the railway tracks was over, they attacked her, said cops. All six men held her hands and legs while they all took turns to rape her. Fearing that she will approach police, they decided to kill her and with such ferocity that while strangling her with a dupatta, they even snapped her spinal cord.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/in-20-minutes-police-dog-sniffs-out-6-rapists-murderers-in-vadodara/articleshow/85441053.cms||---

With more and more farmers drawing groundwater using pumps to save their crops, the electricity demand from the agriculture space, too, has reached near its all-time high level. The state’s maximum power demand stood at 19,431MW on Tuesday, which is the highest so far, shows the daily data compiled by the Western Region Load Dispatch Centre (WRLDC), which is a central government entity. Previously, the power demand had touched a high of 19,360MW in April this year. The surge in demand is primarily attributed to the growing usage of electricity by farmers for irrigation purposes. “The consumption in agriculture has spiralled as farmers are drawing more ground water to save their crops in the wake of the stalled monsoon,” said people closely monitoring power demand-supply in the state. The state government also raised the time for supply of power to farmers to 10 hours a day, which has also contributed to the higher consumption. According to sources, around 110 million units (MUs) or average 4,583MW of power consumed in the agriculture sector on Tuesday, a tad lower than the all-time high of consumption of 111MUs (about 4,625MW) in agriculture in the state. It may be mentioned here that subdued monsoon has caused 48% rain deficit in the state when compared with the normal rainfall till August 15. “Poor wind and solar power generation amid record high demand has put pressure on the state-run Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) to procure costly electricity from the power exchange,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based regulatory and energy expert. The power demand of 17,947MW was recorded at 6pm on Wednesday, according to the State Load Dispatch Center-Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farm-use-drives-power-demand-to-new-high/articleshow/85440672.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Postmaster general (east region) of the Bihar circle Adnan Ahmed told this newspaper on Wednesday that they have made special counters for the booking and delivery of rakhis. “As many as 78,000 rakhis have already been delivered and orders for 74,000 more received,” Ahmed said, adding that the rakhis are even getting delivered on holidays. However, some residents rued that they will not be able to meet their loved ones who live far away from the city due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A G Colony resident Usha Singh wants to meet her brother who lives in Nagpur but she cannot because of the pandemic. “Nonetheless, I have sent him a rakhi by post and will see him virtually on the occasion,” she said. Gola Road resident Shraddha Salini has also sent a rakhi to her brother through speed post. “I am eagerly waiting for Rakshabandhan as it is holds a special place in my heart,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schoolgirls-send-rakhis-to-soldiers/articleshow/85436691.cms||---

The ministry of education on Wednesday announced a list of 44 people who will get the National Award to Teachers on September 5 for enriching the lives of thousands of students. Each of them will receive a medal, a certificate and a cash reward of Rs 50,000 from President Ram Nath Kovind during an event in New Delhi. Quadragenarian Chandana, an English and Maithili teacher, told this reporter over the phone that she was indebted to her family and in-laws for supporting her throughout. “I clearly remember that when I had joined the school as a teacher in 2005, there were no girls. While interacting with the boys, I asked them why their sisters did not come to school, but none of them had an answer,” she recalled. It was due to Chandana’s efforts that the villagers, who were initially reluctant to educate their daughters because of poverty and illiteracy, began sending them to Government Middle School gradually. “I began encouraging the villagers in 2006 and my hard work paid off in the end. Of the 900 students enrolled in our school at present, 60% are girls and 40% boys,” she said, adding that the institute was also upgraded from middle to high school in 2020. Chandana, whose ‘Ganga Snan’ was well-received, has also penned stories and poems in other books as a contributor. She is the daughter-in-law of Mithila painter, Bimla Dutt, and has taught the art to many students. Haridas Sharma, on the other hand, painted all the walls of R K Middle School with colourful diagrams, lunar and solar eclipses, numbers, and alphabets during the nationwide lockdown to make the building more attractive. “Since pictures have a greater impact on the minds of children than words, I decided to paint the walls. I also planted saplings and herbs with QR codes in a small garden on the school campus so that the kids could get all information, including uses and scientific names of the plants, on their cellphones,” Haridas said. He went on to set up QR codes in all the classrooms which have been named after B R Ambedkar, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Swami Vivekanand, and Aruni. As soon as the students scan these codes, they get to know everything about these personalities. Haridas pointed out, “We also have two community-based smart classes that provide a better teaching experience to our kids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-teachers-from-bihar-selected-for-national-award/articleshow/85436533.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar: Floodwaters recede in many areas, may cause soil erosion||PATNA: The floodwaters continued to cause havoc in Begusarai, Khagaria, Bhagalpur and Katihar though the water level of various rivers started receding on Wednesday. The water resources department (WRD) now fears the increasing erosion of soil along the river banks. “It is a normal phenomenon that when the river water level falls, it causes soil erosion,” a WRD source said, adding that the most vulnerable and threatening points would be identified for carrying out anti-erosion works. The water level of the Ganga had a falling trend from Buxar to Hathidah, including at Digha and Gandhi Ghat in Patna. However, the river was still flowing above the danger level all along its downstream from Maner to Kahalgaon. In fact, the water level of the Ganga was steady at Hathidah, Munger and Bhagalpur, but rising beyond Kahalgaon, as the Mahananda, flowing through Kishanganj and Katihar districts into the Ganga, was in spate. The most affected blocks are Gopalpur, Naugachhia, Rangda and Khatik in north Bhagalpur, Kahalgaon and Pirpainty blocks in south Bhagalpur, as well as Amdabad and Manihari blocks in southern Katihar district. To make matters worse for the next coming days, moderate to high rainfall has been forecast in the Mahananda basin in Kishanganj and Katihar, as well as in Araria district, on Thursday and Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/floodwaters-recede-in-many-areas-may-cause-soil-erosion/articleshow/85437066.cms||Abhay Singh

This is expected to be done in the next Assembly session. “The government has already reduced burdensome compliances from 390 to 285,” said chief secretary Adityanadh Das. He was participating at a review meet on ‘Ease of Doing Business’ held recently with officials of the industries department at the secretariat in Velagapudi. The chief secretary advised officials to revisit burdensome compliances and drop as many as possible to make the state investment-friendly. Industries director J V N Subrahmanyam told the chief secretary that 36 Acts were identified to be amended or withdrawn to further liberalise the compliances. Proposals would be submitted before the Assembly, he said. The chief secretary stressed the importance of minimising regulatory compliance burden in the state to promote industries and trade. “The decision is also in line with the Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat vision,” he said.

---||Business||Occupancy rate at co-working spaces back to 70%-90%||Chennai: Occupancy rate at coworking spaces went back to 70%-90% in July, largely driven by the BFSI sector, besides the usual demand seen from IT and ITES sectors. What is adding to this demand pick up is more smaller tech companies which had surrendered their office spaces now opting to work out of co-working spaces with a hot desking model. Workafella has recorded a 10%-15% growth of seats filled by fintech companies predominantly in cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Its co-founder & MD Gurbinder Rattha says, “We see a strong demand from the BFSI sector, especially from payments companies who require back offices at the back of a spike in digital adoption. A year ago, the share business from the BFSI sector was marginally lower. The occupancy rate has picked up and stands between 85% and 90% since July.” Workafella has set a target to add 5,000 seats in this fiscal. “This is a good rate of occupancy, as compared to the pre-Covid levels of 95%. We see a definite revival in demand with more businesses wanting to split and work with the same number of seats booked with us, (on a rotational basis), and at no additional charge,” Rattha adds. Srinivas Anikipatti, senior director (TN and Kerala), at realty consultant firm Knight Frank agrees that more fintech companies are keen to operate out of co-working spaces for back office work. “It is much easier to scale up or scale down their business with no long-term commitment, unlike the usual enterprise model. It takes less than 30 days to set up a 25-50 seater co-working space,” he says. Amit Ramani,founder & CEO of Awfis Space Solutions also agrees that there is a strong demand from fintechs, banks and NBFCs too, for processing and back offices. Ramani says, “About 20% of our demand pipeline is from the BFSI sector, as compared to 15% a year ago. Payment processing happens outside of the banking environment. Companies, primarily, do not want to spend their capital and convert it into operating income, especially with the current pandemic situation.” Awfis saw demand for coworking spaces double in July and aims to add 22,000 seats to its existing 40,000 seat capacity. The Hive - Flexible workspaces saw 70% occupancy rate and its general manager of sales, Ajai Kartik says “Companies cut short on their seat requirement by one third since remote working has taken a larger pie of the cake. We charge between Rs 11,000- Rs 13,500 per seat on a monthly basis and will continue to be a Grade A operator attracting premium occupiers.” Chennai-based co-working space Karya Space has recorded a 70% occupancy rate, which has grown by 20% in the last two months. Its founder & MD Arjjun Chander says businesses are keen to avoid the usual rental model to avoid being obligated with big deposits and CAPEX costs with their landlords while also requesting for rental waiver during state-imposed lockdowns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/occupancy-rate-at-co-working-spaces-back-to-70-90/articleshow/85439135.cms||Mamtha Asokan

---||Patna||‘Focus is on improving school education in Bihar’||PATNA: The recent initiatives taken by the state government are likely to bring a sea change in the quality of school education in the state, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary tells B K Mishra in an exclusive interview. Excerpts: The state government has, for the first time, decided to appoint head teachers (headmasters or principals) in all the primary schools by creating new posts. How is it going to benefit the children? It is a fact that the primary schools did not have the provision of a head teacher till date. Hence, at most of the places, there were complaints of indiscipline and absenteeism among teachers as well as students. The government, therefore, decided to create 40,500 posts of head teachers in primary schools and 5,330 posts of headmasters in higher secondary schools of the state and appoint them through the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC). For appointment as head teachers in primary schools, only teachers of government institutions with at least 8 years of experience can apply, while for head masters in higher secondary schools, even outsiders are eligible. How long will it take to make these appointments? The posts are likely to be created in a month after which the education department would send the requisitions to the BPSC for appointments. If everything goes well, the appointments would hopefully be finalized by the end of the current financial year. Why are not these appointments being made by the panchayat samities and local bodies as in case of general teachers? We hope the BPSC would be able to select the most qualified among the lot and this would go a long way in raising the standard of primary and secondary education in the state. So far the quality of teachers appointed through these bodies in the past have not been found to be satisfactory in most cases as many of these appointments were not made in the transparent manner. The appointments of teachers made by these bodies in 2006 are still being probed by the vigilance department on the Patna high court order. You have reportedly asked the education department officials to inspect the schools at regular intervals and submit their reports to the department. Are you planning to revive the old system of schools inspection again? Yes, with an aim to revamp the age-old inspection culture and facilitate direct communication between education officers and students, I have asked the district and divisional officers of the education department to visit the schools under their jurisdiction at least three days in a week and inspect the running of classes and cleanliness on the campus. They must stay in a school at least for an hour and engage themselves in meaningful conversation with the students. The interaction with officers will be a morale booster for students, while the regular visits will prompt school administration to keep the premises clean. The basic aim is to cut the number of dropouts in schools. The Right to Education Act, 2009 provides for at least one primary school within a radius of 1km, one middle school in a radius of 3km and one high school in a radius of 5km. How far has it been implemented in Bihar? So far as the students’ accessibility to high schools in the state is concerned, the education department has already initiated necessary steps for setting up at least one higher secondary school in every panchayat. And, nearly 90% of children have got a primary school within a radius of 1km. The government is facing some problems in opening new schools due to non-availability of land in areas having sufficient habitations. The problem is being sorted out and all the children of the state would have easy access to schools soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/focus-is-on-improving-school-education-in-bihar/articleshow/85436363.cms||---

The day marks the birth anniversary of India’s second President, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. City schools, however, have decided to adopt Covid safety protocols and celebrate Teachers’ Day virtually. Balram Singh, a DAV-BSEB teacher, told this newspaper, “With only 50% attendance, all the students will not be able to celebrate Teachers’ Day. We will, therefore, stick to the virtual mode.” St Joseph’s Convent High School will also celebrate Teachers’ Day virtually. One of its teachers, Alka Jha, said the students had already started the preparations. Another teacher, Namita, pointed out, “Carmel High School will celebrate the day on its campus in the presence of some teachers and the members of the students’ council in order to avoid huge gatherings.” Meanwhile, Army School (Danapur) student, Amisha, is excited for Teachers’ Day celebrations and is preparing a dance video.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/virtual-celebration-of-teachers-day-in-schools-this-year/articleshow/85436642.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Court directs cops to properly probe cases||MADHEPURA: A local court has ordered the Madhepura police to carry out proper investigation in any case before seeking judicial remand of any person. The case is related to one Karan Singh (75) from New Delhi. Madhepura police seized a truck laden with India made foreign liquor (IMFL) on July 5. The truck had the registration number plate of NL 02 N 9917. Liquor is banned in Bihar. An FIR was lodged on the basis of the truck registration number. Police traced Karan at Rohtas Nagar, Dabri (Dwarika) in New Delhi as the vehicle owner, without matching the chassis and engine number of the vehicle seized and the one owned by the Delhi resident. Karan was served a notice to record his statement before the investigating officer of the case in Madhepura. When he appeared, the police arrested him and produced in the court of in-charge additional sessions judge Nishikant Thakur on Monday, who turned down their request to remand him in judicial custody for lack of evidence against him. Karan showed his truck of the same registration number already parked at his Delhi residence and its papers to the police, but in vain. Interestingly, police held a press meet on August 12 and claimed to have arrested a big kingpin of liquor smugglers. Police allegedly prepared a confessional statement of Karan and forwarded him to the court for remand in that case. Karan narrated everything to the court and showed papers of his vehicle and its chassis and engine numbers. “Police had not mentioned the chassis and engine numbers of the seized truck in their forwarding memo submitted to the court,” said Pankaj Kumar, the advocate of Karan. He said fake number plates are frequently used in the vehicles for illegal purposes. “Police failed to respond to the court’s query about chassis and engine numbers of the seized vehicle,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/court-directs-cops-to-properly-probe-cases/articleshow/85437320.cms||Deo Narayan Saha

A low purchase rate will eventually benefit over 2.6 crore residential, commercial and industrial consumers whose electricity bills could drop in the near future, officials said. The state is all set to go green by switching to a target of 17,360 megawatts (MW) from solar projects in five years. On Wednesday, MSEDCL announced that it floated tenders and invited bids for 500 MW solar energy recently wherein it got this lowest bid of Rs 2.42 per unit. It got another lower bid of Rs 2.62 per unit for tenders floated for procuring 500 MW wind-solar hybrid energy. This is lower than the average thermal energy purchase rate of Rs 4 per unit, an official said. It was also lower than MSEDCL’s renewable energy purchase rate, which was Rs 2.90, in December 2019. “We got an overwhelming response and the bidders are also willing to provide a total 4,615 MW power to MSEDCL, which includes 3,165 MW solar and 1,450 MW wind-solar,” an official said. Of this, 1,000 MW could be procured in a year. Energy minister Nitin Raut said that the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) had set a target for the state to meet 25% of its demand from renewable sources in the next five years. Raut’s department had announced in the recent past that there will be no new thermal generation units in Maharashtra. In the past, MSEDCL would buy renewable energy at a high cost; it was Rs 2.74 per unit in 2018 and Rs 2.90 in 2019. “As a result, the financial burden impacted our consumers. With the consent of the state government, we decided to conduct a competitive tender process in May this year,” stated MSEDCL managing director Vijay Singhal. Raut said that solar and wind power are now becoming commercially viable. “Solar power will be much cheaper than thermal power, benefiting industries and agriculture (for daytime generation for farmers) across the state,” said Raut. By 2030, there are plans to produce 30% of power from solar only. The MSEDCL will shortly approach MERC and apprise it about the final bids on solar power before signing agreements with power suppliers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/electricity-bills-in-maharashtra-set-to-drop-in-near-future/articleshow/85445513.cms||Somit Sen

Suneel was suspended along with others for his alleged nexus with sand smugglers. EOU conducted raids on her government quarter and office at Paliganj, the couple’s flat in Patna and at Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh on August 13 after registering a disproportionate assets case of Rs1.4 crore allegedly amassed by Suneel. Altogether 35 officers, including the SPs of Aurangabad and Bhojpur, have been suspended in the sand smuggling case. When contacted, EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan on Wednesday said the agency has got to know about a few investments in the raid and needs thorough inquiry. “EOU also got to know about a suspected property in the name of the woman officer. We are ascertaining if the details of the properties have been disclosed to the state government or in their annual IT returns,” he said. Khan said the outcome of the investigation would decide whether the CDPO should also be booked in a DA case or not. He refused to disclose anything further at this stage. Meanwhile, another senior officer privy to the ongoing preliminary inquiry against other suspended officers, said, “Separate teams of EOU are working to collect the details of movable and immovable properties of the suspended officers to ascertain if they are disproportionate to their known sources of income or not.” EOU sources said the inquiry against the former Dehri SDO took less time as the state government had already received a large number of complaints against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-probes-assets-of-suspended-sdos-wife/articleshow/85436700.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Free darshan resumed at Srisailam temple from Wednesday, in keeping with Covid-19 guidelines. Temples across the state were closed in May and June due to the second wave of Covid-19. As many as 60 staffers working at the Kanaka Durga temple alone tested positive for Covid-19 and two of them succumbed to the pandemic. When endowments authorities reopened temples in June, only a limited number of devotees were permitted. Temple authorities were directed to permit devotees with online darshan tickets while free darshan was stalled. Arjita Seva was also performed online mode as a preventive measure. The flow of devotees continued in July despite restrictions by endowments officials. At Simhachalam, Dwaraka Tirumala, Annavaram and Mopidevi temples, a rush of devotees was registered from the second week of August on account of Sravana Maasam and endowments authorities conducted a review on relaxing darshan timings and Arjita Sevas. “We have received hundreds of requests from devotees to permit free darshan. The health department gave reports that the Covid-19 positivity rate is under control. So we have decided to permit free darshan. Tokens will be issued for free darshan and only a limited number of devotees will be permitted. We are also thinking of issuing free darshan tokens online,” endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas told TOI. Covid-19 protocols should be strictly followed at temples and spots for queues will be sanitised every hour, the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/free-darshan-to-resume-at-temples-amid-covid-curbs/articleshow/85438317.cms||Venu Lanka

JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha on Wednesday said all the ministers from the JD(U) have been informed about the decision to sit in the party office on every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from next week. The ministers from BJP have already been doing it since August 2 under the party’s ‘Sahyog’ programme. “Under our ‘Sahyog’ programme, two or three ministers of Bihar government sit at the BJP state office on their respective scheduled day and hear the grievances of the party workers and common people on every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday,” BJP’s state media in-charge Rakesh Kumar Singh told TOI. Singh said the BJP ministers have been participating in the ‘Sahyog’ programme probably since 2006, months after the saffron party first came to power in Bihar as an ally of the JD(U). Kushwaha told TOI that the JD(U) ministers also used to hear the people’s grievances at the party office once in a month during the first term of CM Nitish Kumar from November 2005 to 2010. “As per the new programme, each JD(U) minister will sit in the party office at least once in a week,” Kushwaha said, adding that three ministers would be in the party office on a given day. As per the schedule issued by Kushwaha, the state’s education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, food and consumer protection minister Leshi Singh and the minority welfare minister Zama Khan would remain present at the party office from 11.30 am on every Tuesday from next week.

The AT-1 bond issue is the largest so far and its success is significant considering that investors had turned risk-averse after the collapse of Yes Bank had resulted in the write-off of its AT-1 bonds, which are quasi-equity instruments. HDFC Bank had initially circulated a 4.13% price guidance for the bonds, which had a Baa3- rating by Moody’s and BBB- rating by Standard & Poor’s (S&P). Bonds issued from India are constrained by the sovereign rating. The bonds are callable from year five. Bank of America Securities, Barclays, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered Bank are the joint global coordinators, lead managers and book runners. Speaking to TOI, a senior banker said that the issue has re-opened the international AT-1 market for the Indian banking sector. “The issue received huge interest from marquee investors across the US and Asia. The success of this issuance reflects the strong fundamentals of HDFC Bank and India’s long-term growth story,” said a banker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-raises-1bn-from-at-1-bonds/articleshow/85442362.cms||---

Earlier, the e-KYC of either the head of the family or the spouse was enough. Now all members of the rice card have to provide their Aadhaar number and have it verified by the civil supplies department. Sources said the decision to synchronise data of all ration beneficiaries was taken following the instructions of the Union government. The Centre has made it mandatory to link the Aadhaar and synchronisation of the data of all the family members of ration cardholders. Although the Centre has asked state governments to complete Aadhaar synchronisation a year ago, the state government had delayed the process due to the spread of Covid-19. However, the government assured that no ration card will be cancelled. Civil supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar said over 80% of eKYC was completed through village volunteers or ration vehicles and dealers. “Only those who do not have Aadhaar need to go to enrolment centres. Others can get Aadhaar linked through village/ward volunteers,” Sasidhar told TOI. He said about 50 lakh people out of 4.3 crore beneficiaries of ration cards are yet to complete e-KYC. “This is 11% of total beneficiaries,” said Sasidhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ration-beneficiaries-rush-to-complete-ekyc/articleshow/85437546.cms||Samdani MN
---||Mumbai||Electricity bills in Maharashtra set to drop in near future||MUMBAI: Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has got a record low rate of Rs 2.42 per unit for purchasing electricity from renewable energy sources for consumers across the state. A low purchase rate will eventually benefit over 2.6 crore residential, commercial and industrial consumers whose electricity bills could drop in the near future, officials said. The state is all set to go green by switching to a target of 17,360 megawatts (MW) from solar projects in five years. On Wednesday, MSEDCL announced that it floated tenders and invited bids for 500 MW solar energy recently wherein it got this lowest bid of Rs 2.42 per unit. It got another lower bid of Rs 2.62 per unit for tenders floated for procuring 500 MW wind-solar hybrid energy. This is lower than the average thermal energy purchase rate of Rs 4 per unit, an official said. It was also lower than MSEDCL’s renewable energy purchase rate, which was Rs 2.90, in December 2019. “We got an overwhelming response and the bidders are also willing to provide a total 4,615 MW power to MSEDCL, which includes 3,165 MW solar and 1,450 MW wind-solar,” an official said. Of this, 1,000 MW could be procured in a year. Energy minister Nitin Raut said that the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) had set a target for the state to meet 25% of its demand from renewable sources in the next five years. Raut’s department had announced in the recent past that there will be no new thermal generation units in Maharashtra. In the past, MSEDCL would buy renewable energy at a high cost; it was Rs 2.74 per unit in 2018 and Rs 2.90 in 2019. “As a result, the financial burden impacted our consumers. With the consent of the state government, we decided to conduct a competitive tender process in May this year,” stated MSEDCL managing director Vijay Singhal. Raut said that solar and wind power are now becoming commercially viable. “Solar power will be much cheaper than thermal power, benefiting industries and agriculture (for daytime generation for farmers) across the state,” said Raut. By 2030, there are plans to produce 30% of power from solar only. The MSEDCL will shortly approach MERC and apprise it about the final bids on solar power before signing agreements with power suppliers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/electricity-bills-in-maharashtra-set-to-drop-in-near-future/articleshow/85442808.cms||Somit Sen

A survey and subsequent analysis of the condition of those who recovered from Covid-19 indicated that their immune system had suffered considerable damage, not to mention the weakened state of their lungs, increasing the chances of their contracting TB. Tuberculosis spreads through air, and from droplets expelled by an infected patient. The sooner it is detected, the better the chances of recovering from the disease. In Mysuru, nearly 82% of the 4,232 patients in Mysuru who contracted TB recovered from the disease, while 79% of the 3,194 people who were diagnosed with TB were cured in 2020. As on Wednesday, the district has recorded 2,140 cases of tuberculosis in 2021. The district health department, meanwhile, compiled a list of more than one lakh patients who have recovered from Covid-19, sputum samples from whom are being collected and tested for TB in the course of a 15-day campaign. In Mysuru, as many as 88 samples were collected on the first day of the campaign. Mysuru district TB control officer Dr Mohammed Shiraz said, “We are hoping to subject all 1.14 lakh patients who have recovered from Covid-19 across Mysuru district to a TB test. Those who contracted Covid-19 between January and June 2021 will be tested during this campaign. If any of them exhibits symptoms of TB, we will collect their sputum sample at their doorstep. We appeal to the public to cooperate with the health department personnel.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/patients-who-recovered-from-covid-susceptible-to-tb-finds-survey/articleshow/85436388.cms||Lawrence Milton

---||Patna||TET-qualified teachers oppose cabinet decision||PATNA: The TET-qualified teachers lodged a strong protest on Wednesday against the decision of the state cabinet to appoint head teachers and headmasters in primary and secondary schools through a competitive test. At a state-level virtual meeting, they pointed out that according to the Panchayati Raj Teachers’ Regulations, only TET-qualified teachers were eligible to become head teachers or headmasters. They alleged that the government, in utter violation of the regulations, had decided to appoint headmasters through a test to be conducted by the Bihar Public Service Commission. The convener of the Bihar State TET Teachers’ Association, Amit Vikram, said, “The Right to Education Act states that qualifying TET is mandatory for becoming a teacher in schools, but the state government has arbitrarily decided to create a separate cadre of headmasters and head teachers. We are not against any departmental examination for promotion to the post of headmasters, but will certainly oppose the creation of a separate cadre of headmasters.” The association’s general secretary, Uday Shankar Singh, and the organizing secretary, Gyaneshwar Shandilya, however, welcomed the government’s decision to keep headmasters out of the panchayati raj institution system. They urged the government to place in the district cadre all the teachers who have been appointed after passing TET in 2011. They also warned the government that they would move the court if teachers of private schools were allowed to write the test for the appointment of headmasters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tet-qualified-teachers-oppose-cabinet-decision/articleshow/85436419.cms||B K Mishra

He reiterated the bank’s plan to be “back with a bang” in the card space and regain lost market share. In a communication to all employees informing them of RBI’s decision, Jagdishan said that while the bank will now source new credit cards, the restrictions on new digital business generation activities under Digital 2.0 initiatives will continue till further review. “I am thankful for the ‘rap on the knuckles’ from the regulator. This rap has opened our eyes to the world of possibilities,” said Jagdishan. “In the coming time, we will be able to demonstrate the technology transformation that we have embarked on,” said Jagdishan. He reiterated the bank’s plans for a ‘digital factory’ and an ‘enterprise factory’, which will securely enable it to scale operations. “In today’s day and time, there could be technology issues, but we have started building an architecture that will ensure our systems bounce back quickly while ensuring minimal inconvenience to our customers and having multiple channels available for customers to complete the transaction,” said Jagdishan. Responding to criticism that “HDFC Bank has lost its Mojo”, Jagdishan urged employees to draw inspiration from India’s Olympians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/thank-you-rbi-for-embargo-hdfc-bk-ceo/articleshow/85442084.cms||---

---||Business||New Taliban regime casts shadow on India biz in Afghanistan||MUMBAI/HYDERABAD: Taliban seizing control in Afghanistan presents a fresh challenge to Indian companies inking new business deals in the strife-torn nation. Though companies such as KEC International and Kalpataru Power Transmission will complete ongoing infrastructure projects in Afghanistan through locals, they face business uncertainty following the changed situation on the ground. Both companies have recalled their Indian employees. While the existing projects are financed by international agencies and are insured, Indian companies are wary of business prospects under the Taliban regime. “We are following the emerging situation in Afghanistan. We will wait and watch and then decide. It’s very early to comment on new contracts,” said KEC International chief executive Vimal Kejriwal. Concurring with Kejriwal, a Kalpataru Power Transmission spokesperson said, “The overall situation in the region is still evolving and it would be premature to speculate on its long-term outcomes.” Taliban took control in Afghanistan after two decades following the drawdown of the US military. In its first presser on Tuesday, the fundamentalist Islamic force said Afghanistan’s interactions with foreign countries will continue and assured security to international organisations. However, Wapcos, a public sector agency offering services in water, power and infrastructure development, isn’t certain if it will bid for new projects in Afghanistan, executive director A N N Prasad told a financial daily. Wapcos was involved in the construction of the Salma Dam, India’s most expensive infrastructure project in Afghanistan in recent years at Rs 1,775 crore. India has been the largest regional contributor to Afghanistan’s development and reconstruction projects, investing more than $3 billion in the Islamic nation, in the last two decades. The period also saw the entry and exit of some Indian companies such as Tata Motors and Hyderabad-based BSCPL Infrastructure in Afghanistan. The challenging situation on the ground forced BSCPL to exit Afghanistan after more than a decade in 2015, said MD Bollineni Seenaiah. The infrastructure company was involved with projects worth Rs 2,000 crore, including the construction of Parliament building in Afghanistan. “We did not want to take any further risk because of our employees. Hence, decided against participating in new projects,” said Seenaiah. The company used to have 300-400 people working in Afghanistan, of which over 50% were from India and the rest were locals and Pakistanis. Pointing to the hardships the company faced, Seenaiah said in 2004, two employees were kidnapped during a road project and, on another occasion, while constructing the Kandahar-Herat road, the Taliban launched rockets on the site. “No casualties happened as the rocket had landed in the kitchen late at night when no one was there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-taliban-regime-casts-shadow-on-india-biz-in-afghanistan/articleshow/85442308.cms||Reeba Zachariah

With a net worth of $19.2 billion, translating into about Rs 1.4 lakh crore, Damani is now placed at the 98th spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. From about $12 billion as on March 1 last year, in nearly 18 months, his net worth has jumped more than $7 billion, or by about Rs 50,000 crore. The promoters of DMart currently hold 74.9% in the company. This is just a tad below the regulatory requirement of sub-75% promoter holding in listed entities. Among others, Damani also holds an 11.3% stake in India Cements, 26% in VST Industries, 2.4% in Sundaram Finance and several other companies. Over the last 18 months, the stock price of Avenue Supermarts, the holding company that runs DMart, has jumped 64% to its Wednesday close of Rs 3,652 on the BSE. In between, at the peak of Covid-induced selloff in March last year, the stock had also fallen to below Rs 1,800. Since then, the stock has more than doubled as DMart has shown strong resilience to weather the economic slowdown. In addition, latest broking house reports said that the company’s digital services are making good strides to compete with established e-commerce giants. The company has also managed to enhance the pricing power of the articles sold in its shops. “Based on our FMCG products pricing data, we believe DMart’s price offering vs JioMart is currently the strongest since the latter’s launch in 2020. Compared to its online competitor, Big Basket, DMart’s pricing basket remains competitive and the gap is almost highest compared to the historical range,” Goldman Sachs said in its latest report on Avenue Supermart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/with-19-2bn-dmart-owner-breaks-into-world-top-100/articleshow/85442219.cms||---

Gagan is a law student. When asked about the reason for removing Aakash from the post, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, “No one has removed anyone. This post was lying vacant for a long time and the party was looking for a suitable candidate. As per the party’s constitution, the state president has the right to nominate.” However, Tej on many occasions, had introduced Aakash as the Chhatra RJD state president and the former had also been rendering his duty in that capacity. Sources said Singh, who follows strict discipline, was not happy with the way Chhatra RJD had been functioning. Singh had stopped coming to the office since Tej, who is the patron of Chhatra RJD, compared him with Hitler on August 8 and insulted him by his remarks from public platforms on other occasions.

Fazalullah, an Afghan youth who is in India on student visa, is presently pursuing MSc agronomy at Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology (CSA University) in Kanpur. He is keeping his fingers crossed and praying to Allah for the well-being of his family. A resident of Maidan Wardak province in Afghanistan, some 30 kms from the country’s capital Kabul, Fazalullah is a bright student and had come to India under the Indo-Afghan fellowship programme in 2019. Since then, he is staying at the International Hostel in CSA University and pursuing MSc. But life has totally changed for him in the past one week. A disturbed Fazalullah said, “Life has changed for me. When I had come here in 2019, my country had Ashraf Ghani as President. Life was normal for us. But now the country has fallen to Taliban. My family still lives in Maidan Wardak province in Afghanistan. Due to Taliban’s fear, my family has not stepped out of the house for the last two days. I am worried for them. My mind is not at peace.” While talking to TOI over phone, Fazalullah said, “It is through WhatsApp call that I am connected to my family. I am in touch with my elder brother who is a teacher there. They are fine as of now. But the situation is very tense, and I hope it eases quickly.” He also said that he had applied for visa extension and the Indian government approved it for the next three months. “I am here in India for a few months now. Let us see what happens in future,” said Fazalullah. He praised CSA University for giving him a conducive environment for studies. At present, there are three Afghan students enrolled with CSA university. While Fazalullah is still on the campus, two other students from Afghanistan had left the university for their homes during lockdown. They have not returned to the campus since then. Dean of Student Welfare (DSW), Dr RP Singh said, “We have three Afghan nationals enrolled here on the campus. However, only Fazalullah is present, and the other two students had left for Afghanistan during lockdown. They have not turned up but we are in contact with them. Owing to the tense situation in their country, we are not sure how and when will they return. Both the boys are fine and so are their families.” The dean also said that due to the lockdown, the sessions of MSc and other courses have got delayed. If the session had started in due time, these two Afghan students—Shams Rahman pursuing BSc Agriculture and and Humdard pursuing MSc Vegetable Science—would have completed their degree by now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/afghan-student-in-kanpurs-csa-university-worries-about-his-family-back-home/articleshow/85439912.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

The study, published by Women’s World Banking and Bank of Baroda, estimates that by serving 10 crore low-income women, public sector banks could attract Rs 25,000 crore in deposits and empower 40 crore low-income Indians. The report recommends that banks design products for women that allows them to make small deposits and overcome inhibiting factors. To get them to use the accounts, it asks banks to promote awareness and nudge customers. It has called for transforming business correspondents from human ATMs into relationship managers offering rural women all financial products. Finally, it calls upon banks to disaggregate their Jan Dhan account data according to gender. “We are blessed to have a platform like the Jan Dhan Yojana accounts, which can be the world’s largest women-empowerment opportunity,” said Women’s World Banking executive VP (Asia) Sriraman Jagannathan. According to him, in any other country, a women-empowerment programme would have to be run using a pilot programme. In India, most women already have the Jan Dhan accounts. Bank of Baroda MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha said, “A good percentage of women, especially those belonging to the low-income group, still shy away from realising the full potential of their bank accounts. Rather, they still view it only as a channel to receive and withdraw cash. And, therein lies an unutilised opportunity and an untapped potential from a banking perspective.” A pilot run by Bank of Baroda on a women-specific savings account linked to Jan Dhan Yojana was highly successful. The basic bank account, without any charges or minimum balance requirement, drew a large number of women after the government announced its decision to transfer Rs 500 a month during the pandemic year to women’s accounts. “This groundswell of women accounts has made her own agency possible. Banks are now able to get a view on her savings and cash flows and offer loans and other products and services,” said Jagannathan. He added that retirement products are crucial for women as they generally outlive men but do not have financial assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jan-dhan-women-save-more-than-men/articleshow/85441939.cms||---

Former dean and director (in-charge) of IIM Bangalore and chair of the faculty development and evaluation committee of IIM Visakhapatnam, Prof V Nagadevara, inaugurated the lab on Wednesday. IDeAL is a Centre of Excellence dedicated to interdisciplinary research. Director, IIM-Vizag, Prof M Chandrasekhar, said that IDeAL would play a vital role in bringing industry, government and academia together to address socioeconomic issues of an interdisciplinary nature, particularly being faced by aspirational districts such as Visakhapatnam. The inauguration of the lab was attended by industry leader Dr Jai Ganesh, senior vice-president and head of Mphasis research and innovation center (Next Labs). Dr Ganesh talked about the interplay of data sciences, artificial intelligence and machine learning in the transformation of industry and society at large. Chairman, department of management studies, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Prof Parthasarathy Ramachandran, in his address, spoke about current research challenges in interdisciplinary decision sciences. Prof Nagadevara, in his inaugural address, highlighted the interdisciplinarity of decision sciences and how even areas such as ‘organisation behaviour’ could benefit immensely from analytics. The address emphasised the importance of developing a use-case repository, which is only possible through deep engagement with the industry. “The Lab could act as a trusted third-party among various players, resolving issues of confidentiality,” said Prof Nagadevara. Head of the IDeAL at IIM Visakhapatnam, Dr Shivshanker Singh Patel, explained how the Lab would deploy mathematical optimisation and data science as the core for modelling and analysis. “It will work at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, operations research, economics, computer, and social sciences and spawn solutions that address real-life challenges. Extensive use of tools and techniques such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cloud computing, graph analytics, game theory, pervasive computing would be used,” said Dr Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/iim-vizag-gets-decision-science-analytics-lab/articleshow/85438438.cms||---

The Centre had allocated Rs 1,216.9 crore to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for the redevelopment project which is likely to be ready by December 2023. K S Vijayan, the general manager (engineering) of the AAI- Patna, told this newspaper on Wednesday that nearly 28% of the work on construction of the new terminal building had been done. “Earlier, the redevelopment project was likely to be completed by March 2023, but it got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the non-availability of construction materials as well as workers. Now, we expect that the new terminal building and other structures will be ready by December 2023,” Vijayan said, adding that an inline baggage handling system was being imported from abroad and other materials and equipment from different states. The two-storey terminal building, which will handle up to 80 lakh passengers every year, will have a departure lounge on the first floor and an arrival area on the ground floor. It will also consist of 52 check-in counters, an inline baggage handling system, five conveyor belts, and aerobridges. Its interiors will highlight the rich culture, art and heritage of Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-airport-28-work-on-construction-of-new-terminal-building-completed/articleshow/85436657.cms||Faryal Rumi

But profit-taking at higher levels pulled the index down, which finally settled 163 points lower at 55,629. On the NSE, the Nifty rallied past the 16,700-point level for the first time, but closed 46 points lower at 16,569. According to Geojit Financial Services head (research) Vinod Nair, markets gave up early gains due to profit-booking. Strong selling in banking, realty and metal stocks dragged, while mid-caps provided some relief. But the broad trend was weak, Nair said. For future, market players are keeping a watch on global and domestic developments relating to Covid, geopolitics and the US market. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, continuous spread of new Covid variants globally and political turmoil in Afghanistan continues to hover over investor sentiments and pose a risk to the positive momentum in the market. “Investors are awaiting the US Fed meeting minutes due (late on Wednesday), which could provide cues as to when the central bank will end its pandemic-era emergency programs,” Khemka wrote in a post-market note. On the domestic front, the overall market trend remained positive led by the easing of restrictions locally, lower active Covid cases and the slow but steady pickup in vaccinations, market players said.Technically, too, there are signs of weakness in the market. Kotak Securities executive VP (equity technical research) Shrikant Chouhan said that, after a long time on daily charts, the Nifty has formed a bearish candle and intraday charts are also indicating a further weakness from current levels. “In the near future, the benchmark index may consolidate between 16,420 and 16,700 levels,” Chouhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-hits-56k-but-ends-lower/articleshow/85442411.cms||---

Sharda died at her Khanjarpur residence under Barari police station area in the city on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) vice-chancellor Prof Neelima Gupta convened a condolence meeting to pay homage to Sharda, who was born on September 6, 1938. She had her early education in Delhi and did her bachelor’s in political science from Ramjas College, University of Delhi. She was married to engineer Shyam Krishna Sahay, the son of Mukteshwar Prasad. Prof Saroj Sinha, retired TMBU professor and sister-in-law of Sharda, said the inception of Bhagalpur University, now TMBU, was a gift to Bhagalpur by Rajendra Babu after the marriage of Sharda with Bhagalpur’s Shyam Krishna in 1956. TMBU subsequently came up on July 12, 1960. Prof Raman Sinha, principal of SM College, while recalling her meetings with Sharda, said she used to wear khadi sari woven on charkha by late Rajendra Prasad. Denizens, teaching fraternity, social activists and others visited her home to pay obeisance to the departed soul, who believed in the joint family system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/granddaughter-of-first-prez-dies-at-bhagalpur/articleshow/85437332.cms||---
---||Business||Industry seeks review of tax refund scheme||MUMBAI: The tax refund scheme for exporters that has ignored strategic sectors like pharmaceuticals, chemicals and iron & steel has raised concerns, with industry associations seeking a review from the government. The Centre had announced the scheme, which provides succour to about 8,500 products (or tariff lines) with refunds ranging between 0.5% and 4.3%, on August 17. Exporters, hit by sky-high freight rates and other levies over the last 15 months, were hopeful of relief through the government’s Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme, announced to boost exports. In certain sectors, the scheme offers little respite as exporters feel the ‘low rates’ would largely make their products uncompetitive. “The pharma industry has submitted a comprehensive report proving at least wherein 5-6% of duty remission was logically and scientifically justified. Not giving RoDTEP remission of duty will lead to intense pressure on the industry and affect exports. The industry is becoming extremely competitive globally, and China has become abrasively aggressive in RoW (rest of world) markets which have a 50% share globally. In the other 50% — highly regulated markets of the US and the EU — prices are already under pressure. Alongwith MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) dues and exclusion of RoDTEP duty, both the top-line and bottom-line of the $25-billion export industry will be severely impacted, he added. Exclusion of steel, which contributes about 2% to India’s GDP, from the scheme has also raised concerns. Jindal Stainless MD Abhyuday Jindal said, “This is an encouraging move by the government to fire up the export potential of the country. However, the steel industry anxiously awaits inclusion in the RoDTEP list. It’s a much required move to fulfil this government’s vision of ‘Made in India; made for the world.” Further, the government has postponed the implementation of the RoDTEP scheme for export-oriented units, and units in SEZs. “Until these units are covered, they have to face stiff competition from other competitors such as Turkey, Vietnam, Morocco,” Vijay Kalantri, president, All India Association of Industries, said. India’s export-oriented units from agro-processing sectors are facing stiff competition from these countries, who have duty free access to the EU. “We have asked all our 27 councils to resubmit the data (where rates are low) so that the issue can be taken up. Also, we hope the committee will be formed quickly to address the issue,” A Sakthivel, president, FIEO, told TOI. Denial of RoDTEP to certain sectors (which are doing well), amounts to whipping the winning horse, an industry expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/industry-seeks-review-of-tax-refund-scheme/articleshow/85441995.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The new SUV will be launched around Diwali and bookings will begin next month though the launch schedule is dependent on semiconductor chips availability. “We expected the shortage of chips to ease out from July but it is now worse and not expected to ease out before next year,” said Rajeev Chaba, president & MD, MG Motor India. “We have been adjusting our production and we have taken 30%-40% production cuts every now and then which will continue,” he added. The production hiccups mean the company’s plans to ramp up will not happen before February or March 2022. MG is targeting doubling of its production at its Halol plant even as it launches its most mass market product. Astor will take on best-sellers like the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Renault Duster, Suzuki S Cross among others. MG’s current production ranges from 4,000-4,500 units a month and it plans to take it to around 7,000 units a month in the next 6 months, said Chaba.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mg-motor-to-launch-astor-before-diwali/articleshow/85439058.cms||---

Arrested in July 2019 in the case, Abdul Kadir was sentenced to seven years’ rigorous imprisonment on Tuesday. He also told the special NIA court that he is suffering from paralysis and needs medicines. The court directed jail authorities to verify the medicines he was carrying and ascertain through the chief medical officer if they are necessary. The NIA had accused Malda natives Kadir and his brother, co-accused Sabir Ali, of procuring fake currency from absconding accused Karim Shaikh in Bangladesh. It was further alleged that they had then given the fake currency to co-accused Samir Mandal for further circulation. The case was originally registered at Bhiwandi under sections of the Indian Penal Code relating to recovery of fake Indian currency of face value of around Rs 4.5 lakh. It was allegedly recovered from the possession of Bandra (E) residents Rehan Shaikh, Shafahad Ansari, Anees Shaikh, Kishor Fular and Rohit Singh. Subsequently, on December 4, 2018, the NIA took over the case. During further probe, the NIA found the alleged involvement of four more persons—Kadir, Mandal, Sabir Rahaman and Mohammad Khan —and arrested them. The NIA submitted the first chargesheet in the case in 2019. The trial against the other accused will continue before the special court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fake-currency-case-accused-pleads-guilty-gets-7-years-ri-in-mumbai/articleshow/85441325.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation panel approves plan to lease out amenity spaces||PUNE: The standing committee of the civic body on Tuesday approved a proposal to lease out amenity spaces to private parties for development under the public private partnership (PPP) model.  According to the proposal, amenity spaces will be given on rent for 90 years. The proposal states that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will lease out 270 amenity spaces. “It will be mandatory for an amenity space to be developed within five years of taking possession. The PMC’s revenue has gone down drastically due to the pandemic and this will help generate income,” said Hemant Rasane, chairperson of the standing committee. The BJP said the proposal would generate an estimated Rs 1,753 crore in revenue for the PMC. Rajya Sabha MP Vandana Chavan said the civic administration should draft a master plan for the development of these spaces. “A demand to this effect was made several times but was not considered by the municipal commissioner,” said Chavan. Urban forestry must be promoted, as per the Constitution, but the civic body is promoting concrete jungles on amenity spaces with such a proposal, she said. Condemning the move, Congress leader in the Pune municipal Corporation, Aba Bagul, said the proposal will benefit private developers. “The decision appears to have been taken to serve the interests of some leaders in the ruling BJP, and developers,” he alleged. Citizen groups have strongly opposed the move. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch demanded that the proposal be scrapped. “The civic body cannot wash its hands off its responsibility to develop amenity spaces ,” he said. “Leasing out amenity spaces to private parties to generate revenue is not the right approach,” said Vaishali Patkar of the Aundh Vikas Mandal. The proposal will have to approved by the PMC’s general body and then sent to the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-panel-approves-plan-to-lease-out-amenity-spaces/articleshow/85438982.cms||---

Taking a lead over rival political parties, the SAD has kick-started its campaign for the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab nearly six months in advance. Sukhbir said SAD would implement its 13-point programme announced by it in the same manner in which it had implemented earlier commitments made to the people earlier. “Our credibility is our biggest strength,” said the SAD chief, while addressing people before the start of a massive motor cycle rally which culminated at Gurdwara Singh Sabha, where he addressed his first public meeting. There was a massive outpouring of support for the yatra across the constituency, with youth accompanying the SAD president in large numbers. Sukhbir, who addressed 12 public gatherings during the day, said SAD was committed to implementing the 13-point programme in the same manner in which it had implemented promises made to the people, including extension of the free power facility to farmers and making the state power surplus. Sukhbir said the SAD-BSP alliance was committed to giving relief to farmers and had decided to make diesel cheaper by Rs 10 per litre for agricultural purposes. He said to give relief to all households it had been decided to give an aid of Rs 2,000 per month to woman heads of families of all blue card holders. “We will also give free power amounting to 400 units per month to all domestic consumers,” he said. He also announced there would be 33% reservation for rural students in professional colleges and that the government would pay their fee. “ Students can also avail Rs 10-lakh student loan, for which the government would offer a guarantee and also the interest,” he said. He also announced that 75% jobs would be reserved for Punjabis in the industrial sector. Speaking about the Congress and AAP, the SAD leader said both had befooled people with false paths. “Capt Amarinder took a false oath in the name of the holy Gutka Sahab to promise a complete Rs 90,000 crore loan waiver, jobs for each household and eradication of drugs,” he sadi, adding that AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal had taken a false oath in the name of his children that he would not have any truck with the Congress. “Even AAP convener Bhagwant Mann swore on his mother to abstain from consuming liquor, but did not honour the oath.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/eyes-on-polls-sukhbir-starts-tour-of-100-seats-in-100-days/articleshow/85441094.cms||Dinesh K Sharma

It is located over the coastal areas of Odisha. It is likely to move west and north westwards. The monsoon trough is now passing through New Delhi, Varanasi, centre of the low pressure area and the Bay of Bengal. A trough line is extended from the low pressure area to the north of Tamil Nadu. Because of these weather phenomena, moisture incursion is taking place over Maharashtra. As a result, all four meteorological divisions of the state have started receiving rainfall in the last two days,” a senior IMD official said. Rainfall activity in August has remained subdued due to the absence of a weather system over the state, said the Met official. Pune district has reported over 60% rainfall deficit in August. The district has received 373.2 mm seasonal rainfall, which is 30.2 mm below normal, since June 1, IMD records revealed. The Konkan and Goa region received widespread rain with isolated heavy rainfall in some pockets in the past 72 hours. Madhya Maharashtra districts, including Pune, have started getting fairly widespread rainfall. “The ghat sections in this region have received heavy to very heavy rainfall as well,” said the official. On August 20 and 21, some districts in Marathwada region are expected to get scattered to moderate rainfall. Some areas of Jalna and Parbhani districts are also expected to get isolated heavy rainfall in the coming days. Similarly, the Vidarbha region is likely to get scattered widespread rainfall for the next couple of days. “Pune city is expected to get light rainfall, while its outskirts may get isolated moderate rainfall. The ghat section of the district will get isolated heavy rainfall. On August 22 and 23, the moisture incursion over Pune district is expected to increase. This might result in more rainfall. The city’s day temperature would hover between 26ºC and 27ºC for the next few days,” the official said. Rainfall activity in the district remained subdued on Wednesday. Shivajinagar and Lohegaon got 0.4mm and 0.2mm of rain, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/low-pressure-area-activates-monsoon-over-state-again/articleshow/85439027.cms||Sandip Dighe

P Moorthi, 43, of Poolakkattur near Kumarapalayam, runs a roadside food stall (dhaba) in the same village. A Tasmac shop is also located near the dhaba. As the bars attached to Tasmac outlets remain closed due to the pandemic, tipplers visited Moorthi’s dhaba for side dishes and tiffin while consuming alcohol. “The business in the dhaba was brisk,” a police officer said. However, alcoholics who did not have money to buy tiffin or side dishes in the dhaba, sat under the roadside trees and consumed liquor. “Because of these alcoholics, Moorthi got irked,” the police officer added. He employed a tree cutter Mariappan, 44, to fell the trees which were dotting close to the dhaba. “Mariappan chopped off nearly 30 roadside trees,” he said. Acting on a tip-off, Kumarapalayam tahsildar Tamilarasi, police inspector Ravi and other officials rushed to the spot and inquired with Mariappan for felling the trees. “Mariappan informed us during inquiry that he felled the tress as per Moorthi’s direction,” the tahsildar said, adding that she lodged a complaint against the dhaba owner for felling government trees without obtaining permission. Police registered a case against Moorthi. “We will take necessary action against him after his offences are proved,” the police officer assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/dhaba-owner-fells-30-trees-booked/articleshow/85441121.cms||---

The ex-serviceman lodged a complaint accusing the woman and the four men keeping him confined in a room in Narayangaon for four days, from August 12. The suspects asked him to pay them Rs50 lakh or else they would implicate him in a rape case. The victim was let off on August 16 after he gave them bearer cheques worth Rs30 lakh. However, he approached the police before the suspects were able to encash the cheques, police said. Senior inspector Bharat Jadhav and his team arrested Dattatray Yadav (47), Uttam Tanaji Kurhade (40) of Ale in Junnar taluka, Narayan Jadhav (38) of Junnar town and Anil Walmiki (45) of Katraj, following the complaint. “The four men accepted the bearer cheques from the victim, but did not deposit them in the bank. Instead, they started demanding Rs10 lakh in cash while issuing threats to him on phone,” said deputy commissioner of police (zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh. In his statement recorded with the police, the victim said he received a call from the woman asking for a job at his packaging unit about a month back. When he told her that there was no immediate need for employees, the woman kept in touch with him and even started texting messages to him. On August 12, while the victim was on way to a place along the Nashik Road, the woman called and asked him to visit her in Narayangaon. He went there in his car. “The woman met and took him to a house about 2km from Narayangaon. After they settled down in the house, her four aides, armed with sharp axes, arrived. They issued threats to him and threatened to file a rape complaint against him if he did not pay them Rs50 lakh, the victim said in his complaint. “Two of the suspects came to Pune city on Tuesday to collect cash and were staying in a hotel when the police nabbed them, leading to the arrest of other two suspects,” Jadhav said, adding that Walmiki is a real estate agent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-held-woman-booked-in-bid-to-extort-ex-serviceman/articleshow/85439039.cms||---

The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) ward coordinators have been asked to clean up the parks before Puja. TOI on Wednesday visited a number of parks across Salt Lake to check o the condition. While there are many parks that are well maintained, some need immediate attention. A portion of the HB block park boundary wall has been damaged and broken for quite sometime and has not been repaired. Grass and weeds could be seen overgrowing. At the adjacent GD block park, damaged paver blocks and rubbish were spotted dumped and stacked on the footpath surrounding the park. “The civic authorities had taken up work of revamping the park which stopped mid-way as the rubbish and paver blocks have been stacked at the place,” said a block committee member. At AD block park, the children segment is almost inaccessible with tall weeds and creepers and the swings and slides are badly damaged. A few plastic packets were also spotted lying inside. Locals said that most of the parks had a facelift before the assembly elections this year, but has not been maintained since then. “We clean the portion where the puja pandal is set up but we cannot look after maintenance of the parks,” said GD block committee president Kumar Shankar Sadhu. “Most of the parks are well maintained and looked after by the respective ward committees. Grass and weeds have grown up in some due to the monsoon and could be cut with electric grass cutters once the rain scales down,” said BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/overgrown-salt-lake-parks-to-be-cleaned-before-puja/articleshow/85439024.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||After CNG, West Bengal gets an eco-friendly dual-fuel bus||KOLKATA: After launching a retrofitted CNG bus, Bengal transport minister Firhad Hakim on Wednesday inaugurated a dual-fuel bus by driving it down a few yards at Kasba depot. The bus runs both on diesel and CNG. It will experimentally run between Kolkata and Asansol. “If the trial is successful, we will replicate the model of retrofitment in other buses,” said Firhad Hakim. Hakim added that if the experiment was successful, the model will be replicated for both private and government buses. “The modified engine which runs on 60% CNG and 40% diesel, will reduce the operating cost by 35 to 40%, with reduction if carbon monoxide(CO) emission by 50%, oxides of nitrogen(NOx) emission by 60%, non methane Hydrocarbon(NMHC) emission by 50% and 90% particulate emission,” said Chinmoy Chakraborty, an automobile engineer, who has retrofitted the dual-fuel engine in an old bus. However, automobile engineering experts said otherwise. “There are research organisations to decide on the type of engine and possible retrofitment. We have no problem if it is run on CNG or only on diesel. But the engine will cause problems if the fuel is mixed,”said Professor Prabir Bose, an automobile engineering expert. Somendra Mohan Ghosh, auto emission consultant for modified IC engines said, “Any technical modification requires type approval from authorised agencies like ARAI to earn it’s roadworthiness. I am not against any experimentation, but for the safety of people, the trial should have been on the test track, not on the city road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-cng-bengal-gets-an-eco-friendly-dual-fuel-bus/articleshow/85439072.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Pune||Prolonged use of earphones, lack of exercise increase ear infection risk||PUNE: Prolonged use of earphones, among other lifestyle changes because of pandemic, has resulted in increased incidence of ear infection among both professionals and students working or studying from home, this rainy season. “I wear ear pods throughout my shift as I have to attend meetings and be on calls. After work, I switch to bigger headphones when I watch shows to unwind. I have started getting pain and watery discharge coming out from my ears now,” a BPO professional from Kharadi said. Jonisha Matthew, mother of a 14-year-old, had a similar experience to share. “My son had terrible pain in his left ear. The pain was so intense that he started getting a fever too. We later found that the skin inside his ear was scraped as he was trying to break in his new earphones, which aggravated the infection,” Matthew said. ENT specialist Ajay Kinjare said, “Clogging the ears by wearing earphones for long time can create buildup of ear wax and bacteria, leading to infection. Ear pieces can also scrape the skin inside the ear, which can worsen the infection.” Symptoms of ear infection include inability to concentrate that affects productivity, irritation and disorientation, itchiness, ear ache, decreased hearing, watery discharge, dizziness, severe headaches, fever and vomiting. Another ENT specialist, Purva Lunavat, said, “On a daily basis, 7-8 new patients come for treatment to me. They are prescribed ear drops to dissolve the ear wax and clean out the infection. In worst cases, a medical practitioner may advise surgery.” The risk of ear infection is higher among smokers. “Smoking also affects the respiratory tract, which may aggravate existing ear infections. Passive smoking can be equally bad,” said ENT specialist Siddharth Rajput. Lifestyle factors such as poor diet can also make one prone to recurrent ear infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/prolonged-use-of-earphones-lack-of-exercise-increase-ear-infection-risk/articleshow/85439061.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Cow deaths in temple spark row||VISAKHAPATNAM: As the death of over 20 cattle in 30 days in Simhachalam temple gosala (cow shed) triggered a controversy, the temple management has gone into damage control. Death of cows and calves has become a routine affair in the gosala where bovines donated as offering to lord Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha are kept. The sorry state is allegedly due to the negligence on the part of administration. The issue has once again hit headlines as 10 cows died in four days. AP Sadhu Parishad president Swamy Srinivasananda Saraswathi visited the gosala and expressed dissatisfaction over the maintenance of the cowshed in which he found a few empty liquor bottles and pieces of glass. Around 400 cows are presently kept in the cowshed.  The temple authorities have given 100 cows to tribal farmers of Araku and Anantagiri free of cost. It may be recalled that more than 80 cows and calves had died of starvation at the gosala in one week in 2013. Deaths were due to scarcity of fodder and water, unbearable heat and cramped space. After this incident, the temple management decided to accept only indigenous breed of cattle as offering and not the mixed breed or Jersey. But still devotees offer Jersey cows and mixed breeds, besides sick ones, the temple management alleges. “ We have been receiving even sick animals. When we reject them, devotees leave them at the foothill of the temple.” one of the employees said. Tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao visited the gosala on Wednesday and asked the police, revenue, animal husbandry and temple management to work in coordination to address the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cow-deaths-in-temple-spark-row/articleshow/85439096.cms||Siva G

Further, the amount will be paid by the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (MHADA), the nodal agency for the project. In a tweet, environment minister Aditya Thackeray, in whose constituency is the Worli BDD chawl, said this would ensure that tenants do not have to bear the burden of paying stamp duty. Recently, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray performed the bhoomipujan to relaunch the redevelopment project. Residents have been demanding an agreement before being shifted to transit camps. Meanwhile, the state government has also decided to provide 500sqft homes to police personnel who are staying in these chawls. They will have to pay the construction cost for the flats.

The department of information and technology has also put up 45 micro industrial zone plots, ranging from 300sqm to 800sqm, for allotment to component manufacturers who are part of the larger supply chain. The department has offered larger industrial plots, which range from 7,000 sqm to 38,900sqm, at a lower rate of Rs 540 per sqm to attract investors, while the micro industrial plots are being offered at Rs 1,200 per sqm. The Union ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has granted financial assistance under the EMC scheme to set up the Tuem greenfield electronics manufacturing cluster. The key objectives behind the Tuem EMC are to create an ecosystem for electronics industries, to promote local employment and development of nearby villages. The Centre granted final approval for setting up the greenfield EMC at Tuem and has assured Goa Rs 73.8crore as grants for the Rs 161.3 crore project. Goa has already paid Rs 36.7lakh to Jones Lang LaSalle Property consultants for consultancy services for carrying out transaction advisory services for the Tuem ESDM.

This was Sameeran’s first-ever visit to the land earmarked for the airport expansion after taking charge as the district collector. The collector had earlier held a meeting with airport director S Senthil Valavan to discuss various bottlenecks delaying the project and solutions for the same. The airport director said owners of the land to be acquired were asking for an alternative path around the airport. While revenue officials are looking for solutions, he said, the collector has looked into the possibilities. Sameeran has also discussed the possibility of CSR funding for solid waste management plant at Chinniyamplayam. “The airport expansion work will commence immediately after the completion of land acquisition,” Senthil Valavan said. The expansion project requires acquisition of 627.89 acres land, including 134.2 acres defence land and 28 acres non-cultivable (poramboke) land, that fall under 24 blocks. While the state government had sanctioned Rs 263 crore for land acquisition, the district administration has reportedly used only Rs 168 crore to pay off the land owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/collector-takes-stock-of-airport-expansion-work/articleshow/85441160.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Healthcare sector growth boosts work opportunities||PUNE: Experts in the education and healthcare sectors have pointed to the ample opportunity for students in the healthcare field which offers diplomas, certificates, degrees and even doctoral programmes which do not always require NEET qualifications. The Covid-19 pandemic brought into focus deficiencies in the healthcare sector including a shortage of medical staff in the state. Apart from doctors and nurses, an equally important role is played by the pharmacists, technicians and other paramedic staff that ensure smooth functioning of hospitals, clinics and laboratories. While good doctors and nursing staff are important for any healthcare facility, similarly any healthcare provider needs equally skilled, paramedical and support staff to deliver the required services in a better manner, said Rekha Dubey, chief executive officer (CEO), Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital. “This is to ensure that the best treatment is offered to patients and the idea of precautionary care is encouraged. When a student chooses to make a career in any of these fields, it is important to complete these degrees/ diplomas from hospital-affiliated colleges to get first-hand experience and to have authentic knowledge and skills. Apart from paramedical field, epidemiology, equipment management, speech therapist, drug inspector, pharma/ drug expert, nutritionist amongst others will be in demand in the coming years,” she added. Rajesh Deshpande, president of Baner Balewadi Medicos’ Association, who also works as a consultant with hospitals on their business development felt if the student is in dire need of a job after Std X or Std XII, then instead of taking up a conventional degree course, it is always better to take up a certificate or diploma course as a technician. “There are all kinds of pathological and diagnostic laboratories where people can get jobs easily. Apart from that, there are MRI technicians and cath lab assistants who are paid very well,” said Deshpande. Bhavesh Barde, consulting orthopaedic surgeon at Suretech Hospital in Nagpur, said standardisation of courses and entry to them is necessary. “Nowadays, any institute can offer these courses. There is no quality check on the syllabus as well as the certificate or diploma offered. All these courses must be on the same level nationally. Though there are jobs after completing the courses, the pay scale of many technicians is not good. If the curriculum is standardised and placements begin at colleges, the pay scale would also improve. But, not all technicians or paramedics get paid poorly. There are courses such as dialysis assistants or cath lab assistants or even OT assistants who are paid well. Hence, there is ambiguity in these allied medical fields which need to be properly standardised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/healthcare-sector-growth-boosts-work-opportunities/articleshow/85439078.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Goa||Flat owners facing sale deed hurdles pin hopes on bill||Panaji: A prominent professional operating from a commercial premises that he purchased in the city around 25 years ago has still been unable to get a sale deed registered in his name because the builder of the structure has thwarted all his attempts. Incidentally, several complaints similar to his have been pending before the registrar of cooperative societies. In many instances, buyers have been unable to register a sale deed for a flat/shop they purchased some years ago either because the builder is not alive or he is unwilling to initiate the process. The recently passed Goa Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill, however, is set to improve the fate of such property owners. The bill has a provision for enforcement of title in the name of the member. It also empowers a registrar to appoint any of his empanelled nominees to decide on a dispute arising in the housing society concerned within the meaning of section 83 of the Act. An official at the registrar’s office said every zone will have a competent authority to address grievances of property owners, clear long-pending cases and facilitate execution of a sale deed after authentication either by way of a sale agreement or share certificates. “It will take us at least two years to dispose of pending complaints,” the official said. Recounting his ordeal, the Panaji-based businessman said that although he has been pursuing the builder for several years to execute a sale deed for his commercial premises, the latter has kept citing several excuses. “There are a few like me in the building who are yet to get a sale deed done. If the builder still refuses, I will go to court,” the businessman said. An official said that in the past, some people refrained from executing a sale deed just to evade payment of stamp duty and other expenses linked to the process. This favoured builders as they continued to have right of ownership of the construction and could use open spaces — especially parking lots — and erect structures by bypassing opposition from the housing society concerned. With section 104A added to the Act, all existing co-partnership cooperative housing societies will be converted to co-ownership cooperative societies. After conversion, the rights of the co-partnership cooperative housing societies shall stand transferred, along with encumbrances and liabilities, to the members of the co-ownership cooperative hosing society as per their proportionate shares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flat-owners-facing-sale-deed-hurdles-pin-hopes-on-bill/articleshow/85439099.cms||Bindiya Chari

The high court, in its order, said, “The accused is not named in the FIR; there is no allegation against him.” Earlier on August 5, 2021, Mahant Rupendra Prakash of Prachin Avdhoot Mandal Ashram had written a letter to the Union ministry of education asking if the panel, set up by the Mahavidyalaya as per the ministry’s direction, was authorised to issue the renewal of the Mahavidyalaya’s registration. “As far as document Ex. CA-3 dated 24.07.2016 is concerned, it is signed by the President Sri Bhagawan Das Adarsh Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya although it was attested by the present accused, but there is no allegation regarding preparation of the documents."

Kavya, a class VIIIth student of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Jalalpur Nagin in Kanpur Dehat, secured the first rank in the online competition by describing the struggle between the Britishers and the villagers in a temple in Ghatampur during pre-Independence time. Kavya, daughter of farmer Mannilal, a resident of Jawahar Nagar, Ghatampur, participated in an online writing competition organized by the National Book Trust and the Central government on Independence Day. Through the article, Kavya said that the Britishers were present on August 14, 1947 in a temple in Ghatampur. Later, the Britishers were surrounded by the villagers, who killed a few of them. The Central government and National Books Trust have celebrated Amrit Mahotsav on 75th Independence Day. In this, an online international competition was organized for writers up to the age of 30 years. “Under the competition, I had to write an article on the place and person of the freedom movements, about which people do not know and also that the information with regard to the same is not even available on the Internet. Indians living abroad were also given a chance to participate in this competition. Being the 75th Independence Day, 75 contestants were selected, who managed to highlight the untapped aspects,” Kavya told reporters. She further said that the Prime Minister himself congratulated her through an email. The PM’s mail stated, “I cannot believe that a 12-year-old daughter wrote such a wonderful article on Independence and also shared important information related to the Freedom Movement at this very young age.” “The class VIIIth girl has brought laurels to the school by securing the first position in the international competition on the untouched aspect of freedom. The Prime Minister has praised the student by mail. The student is very talented. We are all overjoyed at her success,” said Suman Kumar, principal, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Jalalpur Nagin.

His fleeing from the spot immediately after seeing blood from the body...also indicates that he did not intend to commit murder,” the court said. The accused, Nelson Canady, and his associate allegedly attacked the victim, Shakil, on the night of March 24 over an argument that took place at a mutual friend’s wedding. His associate is accused of kicking and punching Shakil. After the attack, Shakil ran to a man, now a witness in the case, and demanded water. The witness then took him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. The court also said that since the investigations are over and the chargesheet filed, the detention of the accused even if the offence concerned is serious, is not warranted. Imposing conditions, the court said Canady was to not tamper with the prosecution witnesses and evidence in any manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-granted-to-19-yr-old-accused-of-murder-on-doubt-over-intent/articleshow/85442825.cms||---

The crew member, identified as Ervie Ferraren Dagpin, fell ill around midnight on Monday while the cargo carrier was en route Port of Tubarao in Brazil. The vessel authorities contacted the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) Mumbai, which in turn alerted the operations division at the Goa Coast Guard headquarters. “A crew of MV Christina J, operating way west of Goa demanded medical attention. The crew named Ervie Ferraren Dagpin with a history of hepatitis complained of occasional abdominal and upper back pain and the ship relayed the distress message,” the Indian Coast Guard said in a statement. The bulk cargo carrier had departed from Dahej Port, Gujarat on August 14 and was in the Arabian Sea when Dagpin fell ill, said officials. The coast guard operations team, on analysing the location, provided the patient with interim medical assistance and simultaneously directed the vessel to head for Mormugao Port Trust. The vessel authorities informed the local shipping agent and port control and the various authorities coordinating the medical rescue of the ailing seaman. The vessel arrived at MPT outer anchorage late Tuesday evening and Dagpin was transferred to a smaller patrol boat and brought to MPT jetty. “The medical team of the Indian Coast Guard, Goa, assessed the medical status, provided first aid and with the help of an agent and shifted the patient to the hospital,” the coast guard said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coast-guard-rescues-ailing-seafarer-from-brazil-bound-vessel/articleshow/85439122.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Hearing a petition filed by UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and Anjuman Intazamia Masazid, Varanasi, Justice Prakash Padia directed both the sides to exchange the pleadings and directed to list the case on September 28 for the next hearing. Appearing for one of the petitioners, senior advocate SFA Naqvi contended that the suit, by which the order of the civil judge (senior division), fast-track court (FTC) of Varanasi (dated April 8, 2021) is under challenge, is itself not maintainable under Section 4 of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, as it bars filing of suit or any other legal proceedings with respect to conversion of religious character of any place of worship, existing on August 15, 1947. Hence, no claim can be made regarding a religious place which existed on August 15, 1947. As per the Act of 1991, no relief can be sought for changing the status of any religious place as it existed on August 15, 1947, contended the petitioner’s counsel. Hence the order for conducting survey is illegal, the counsel added. The petitioner’s counsel further contended that when the high court has already reserved its judgment on the issue of maintainability of the aforesaid suit, the court below should not have passed any order in the suit till the issue of maintainability of the suit was decided by the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-centre-state-response-in-plea-against-asi-survey/articleshow/85440044.cms||---
---||Pune||Petition against 15% fee reduction order||Pune: The Maharashtra English Schools Trustees Association (MESTA) has filed a petition in the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court stating that the reduced fee should be reimbursed by the state government as schools were running into huge losses since the past two years. Founder president of MESTA Sanjayrao Tayde Patil told TOI on Wednesday that initially, they had voluntarily announced that the parents of the students who had lost their jobs, suffered losses in business and others in need would be considered for reprieve. “The education minister failed to comment on our good deed and now they have issued a generalised order that we are completely against reducing 15 % fees and that is why we have taken the legal route. We tried to speak to the education department authorities before approaching the court but our demands were not agreed to,” he said.

This was after multiple instances when people have been duped after using “look-alike” websites of top online portals. The Kolkata Police cyber cell is likely to question a gang of five men arrested by the Delhi Police two days ago for allegedly using search engine optimisation technique to push bogus e-commerce websites for duping people. Investigation shows over 10,000 people have been cheated of at least Rs 25 crore in the last three years by this Delhi-UP gang, including several from Kolkata. “Gullible netizens looking for online shopping of gadgets and apparels through online search were directed to these sites, and were induced to pay affront using the bait of highly discounted prices,” a senior officer explained. The purchased products were never sent. The detective department said it was taking up the probe as frauds were trying to tap into people’s emotions at this time of crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyber-cell-to-grill-5-over-online-fraud/articleshow/85439119.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Inmate’s death in Tihar: Delhi high court seeks report from police, jail officials||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought a status report from both Delhi Police and Tihar Jail authorities on a plea concerning the alleged murder of an inmate Ankit Gujjar in the jail earlier this month. Justice Mukta Gupta issued notice to Delhi Police, the jail administration, the Centre and the CBI on a petition by Gujjar’s family members and ordered the preservation of CCTV footage of the time of the incident as well as before and after. The petition seeks transfer of the investigation from Delhi Police to the CBI and adequate, round-the-clock-security for the family members. In the petition filed through advocate Mehmood Pracha, the family alleged that Gujjar, 29, was being harassed by the jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money” and was murdered “as a part of pre-planned conspiracy”. It is also alleged that the deceased inmate “faced much more brutality” at the hands of a jail official who “directed his subordinates to use all their might at him to finish him and make an example out of him for other inmates.” The plea adds that “brutality meted out to the deceased as evidenced from the photographs of his corpse, coupled with the fact that he was left to die in a solitary cell without any medical attention whatsoever, renders to the present case a colour of the rarest of rare category.” The plea further claimed that “Tihar Jail authorities are operating an organised extortion syndicate and the police are trying to manipulate the investigation.” The petition states that although an FIR for commission of offences of murder was registered pursuant to the directions of a magisterial court, “a free and fair investigation by a neutral investigation agency would inevitably lead to invocation of not just further provisions under the Penal Code but also under special laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/inmates-death-in-tihar-hc-seeks-report-from-police-jail-officials/articleshow/85441338.cms||---

It is a rare species of flying squirrel that has been seen in Uttarakhand after 25 years. Sanjeev Chaturvedi, chief conservator (research) Uttarakhand forest, told TOI, “In India, 13 species of flying squirrel are found. However, a study to ascertain the number of flying squirrel species in Uttarakhand is yet to be conducted. So far, the research wing of the Uttarakhand forest department has spotted four species of flying squirrel in the hill state." “The Kashmir flying squirrel is a small creature, mostly found in Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. It was last seen in Ranikhet in 1997. Under a project to ascertain the distribution of flying squirrel species in Uttarakhand, we set up cameras at several places on August 14. Two days later, a Kashmir flying squirrel was spotted,” said Jyoti Prakesh, a researcher working for the Uttarakhand forest department. Prakesh added that the number of rare squirrel species is on a decline as forest cover is depleting rapidly. “We must save their habitats to save them,” he said.

In the past too, Akalis have started campaigning earlier than rivals, but this time the scale of campaigning six months before polls is unprecedented. This is likely to put pressure on rival parties too. Badal has also been announcing candidates from different constituencies and getting enough time to handle any dissidence, while alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party has also been settled even as the latter is facing internal dissidence from party cadres over quality of seats. BSP leaders have also been working at the ground level in an organised way and they are holding a big rally at Phagwara on August 29. In comparison, both Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are holding smaller events and are also battling with internal issues. AAP was way ahead in campaigning as compared to other parties in 2016, but then it peaked early and ended up losing steam by the end. It had chances to form the government in Punjab in 2017, but could not even touch the vote share it had in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Its decision to sack then state unit chief Sucha Singh Chhottepur had boomeranged on the party. A few other mistakes and internal contradictions did in the party. Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal has already announced that AAP would project a Sikh as CM face. However, party has been grappling with this question and the search is still on. Though party is holding small events, it seems that it can go in for major campaigning only after settling this question. Unlike previous election, this time state unit chief and MP Bhagwant Mann is also not showing the level of activity which he showed during 2017 elections. In ruling Congress, the internal crisis is far from over even as Navjot Singh Sidhu has been appointed Punjab Congress president. Though Sidhu has been holding meetings with party leaders and workers at different level and the party workers also appear to be charged up, tension between him and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh continues to brew and it continues to cast a shadow on the party’s affairs in the state. Though Sidhu has already started strengthening his control on the organization, Amarinder is holding his fort. As assembly elections in Punjab take place during winter, parties have been starting mass mobilizations when weather would be better but Akali Dal is sweating out literally at mass level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sad-early-lead-puts-pressure-on-rivals-cong-aap/articleshow/85441250.cms||IP Singh
---||Pune||Japanese liver transplant method comes to the rescue of two babies in Pune||PUNE: A team of surgeons from Jupiter Hospital in Pune have transplanted very small grafts of the liver, just 120g and 175g, in two babies who were merely six months and eight months old and neither weighed more than six kg in June 2020 and May 2021. The surgeons used the Japanese technique of reduced small-for-size-liver graft which benefits babies not matching the 10kg weight norm. Both the babies have recovered well, their liver grafts have also grown in size, and they are expected to have a normal life. Living donor-liver transplant in infants with extremely low body weight comes with a rider—surgeons cannot perform the high-risk transplant till the baby is at least 10kg in weight. Newborns not fitting the transplant criterion either run the risk of being denied the treatment or have life-threatening complications. Jupiter Hospital’s multi-organ transplant surgeon Gaurav Chaubal said, “This technique achieves good results in small and low-weight infants requiring liver transplant. It is life-saving. It showed good results in the two babies for the first time in India.” He is the babies' treating surgeon. In emergencies, the established practice of waiting till an infant is at least 10kg may not work. A highly reduced small liver graft is the only solution as standard size grafts cannot be accommodated in the infant’s small abdomen, Chaubal added. Both babies had growth liver failure and their medical conditions necessitated urgent transplants. The race-against-time surgery prompted the surgeon to fit the babies with a smaller (size of a chikoo) liver graft carefully drawn from their healthy grandmother and mother, respectively. “Both babies have good growth of their liver,” the hospital's other treating surgeon Aditya Nanavati said. New livers keep pace with the overall growth in infants. “We expect them to have a normal life once appropriate care is taken,” he added. Senior transplant surgeon Mohamed Rela, who has an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for a liver transplantation surgery on a five-day-old baby, said, “The technique that the Pune surgeons have used could be different. I have been doing liver transplant surgeries on small and newborn babies not fitting the 10kg criterion for years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/japanese-liver-transplant-method-comes-to-the-rescue-of-two-babies/articleshow/85439151.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: MP Shafiqur Rehman Barq who called Taliban freedom fighters booked for sedition||BAREILLY: Shafiqur Rehman Barq, 91, represents Sambhal in the Lok Sabha as a Samajwadi Party MP. On Tuesday, he allegedly said the Taliban is fighting for the “freedom of Afghan people”, adding that India, too, “had fought for freedom.” Later that night, on the basis of a complaint by BJP regional vice-president (western UP) Rajesh Singhal, police booked Barq for sedition. “The SP MP made some statements at a press meet, where he was seen defending the Taliban's move and comparing it with India’s fight for freedom. The video of the incident went viral on social media,” Sambhal SP Chakresh Mishra said. “The Taliban has been declared as a terrorist organisation by the government of India and praising it or defending its moves is an act of a traitor. Taking cognizance of the video and considering the complaint, a case has been registered under sections 124a (sedition), 153a (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, etc) and 295a (deliberate or malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion) of the IPC.” Two others have also been named in the FIR after they made similar statements and uploaded “similar content” on social media. “Two individuals, Mohammad Mukeem and Chaudhary Faizan, have also been booked,” SP Mishra said. “Defending such terrorist outfits is a punishable offence and anybody supporting such content or promoting it will not be spared.” Barq, a five-time MP and four-time MLA, reportedly said the Taliban was a “force which did not allow Russia or the US to establish themselves in Afghanistan” and its actions were the neighbouring country’s “internal matter”. On Wednesday, however, Barq told a news agency that his statement was being misinterpreted. “I didn’t make any such statement. My statement has been misinterpreted. I’m a citizen of India, not of Afghanistan, so I have no business with what is happening there. I support my government’s policies,” the agency quoted him as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/samajwadi-party-mp-91-charged-with-sedition-for-comparing-talibans-af-takeover-with-india-freedom-struggle/articleshow/85437362.cms||---

Both media advisers are from the electronic media, while Jagtar is also a veteran print journalist. Ever since Sidhu resigned from the Punjab council of ministers in 2019, the former cricketer is off the press largely, except for a few interviews, and uses Twitter and Facebook to share his opinion with the public. Already his party apponted four working presidents, while he has appointed his confidant, MLA and former hockey captain Pargat Singh, as general secretary (organisation). A complete Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) is yet to be announced. Under Sidhu’s letterhead in a viral social media post, the name of another TV journalist with first name as Jagtar was mentioned, apparently due to a confusion. Sidhu’s office tweeted a new letter. The journalist concerned went on Facebook to clarify that he wanted to remain an active TV journalist and his name had appeared by mistake. “I am a free journalist and have nothing to do with any party,” he stated in the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-names-2-media-advisers/articleshow/85441300.cms||---
---||Allahabad||AU faculty part of team involved in development of new med device||Prayagraj: A team of experts from the field of biochemistry, medicines, orthopaedic and surgery, including an assistant professor from the Department of Biochemistry in Allahabad University, Munish Pandey, have designed a device through which medicine or Nano-medicine can be delivered directly into the muscles of the patients. The device has an inbuilt needle and the doctors can also control the quantity of the drug or any other medicine being administered to the patient through the device. The Kolkata-based Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, has recognized the patent for this design for 20 years. The story behind developing this device by professor Pandey and experts of other institutions proves the saying that ‘necessity is the mother of invention’. “This idea clicked me in December last when my wife Vandana fractured her leg. For the next four months, she had to be hospitalised every 15 days. Doctors used to deliver medicine to the body through a drip which was both cumbersome and often the liquid would come out of the needle and spillover. Following this, she used to bleed and developed swelling on the part the drip was administered. Witnessing the pain and suffering of my wife, I thought of developing a device which could deliver the medicine into the muscles,” said Pandey. A team of experts from different fields started developing the device on the idea derived by Pandey. When the device was ready, the team applied for getting it patented and the same has been approved. “If we get an offer for industrial production of the device, we will consider the same,” said Pandey. This device can be pasted over the part of the hand where the medicine has to be administered through the muscle. It also has a syringe and a button and by pressing this button, medicine or vaccine can be delivered to the patient’s body as needed. Pandey added, “Medicine can be delivered directly into the muscle of patients suffering from chronic disease. With this device, nanomedicine drugs, i.e. drugs that are in microscopic amounts, can also be easily delivered to the muscles and this will also reduce the side effects”. Dr Santosh Singh, Surgeon of Motilal Nehru Medical College, says, “The device also has a mechanism that it locks itself at a time when fluid starts flowing backwards. In this sense, this invention will prove to be very beneficial for the medical world.” Apart from Munish Pandey, the team members include Dr Sivakumar Vijayaraghavalu of Narayana Translational Research Center and Narayana Medical College, Nellore, Selvam Arjunan — Assistant Professor, Department of Applied Science in Ramaya University, Bengaluru, S Vijayananda and Challaraj Emmanuel — Associate Professor of Life Sciences at Krishna Jayanti College, Bengaluru, Dr P Rajarajan — Head of the Department of Microbiology at Indian Academic Degree College, Bengaluru, Dr UB Yadav — Senior surgeon of Prayagraj, Dr P Karthageyan of Puducherry and research students including Zainab Feroze, Priyanka Gautam and Anurag Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-faculty-part-of-team-involved-in-development-of-new-med-device/articleshow/85440065.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Pratapgarh engineer returns safely from Afghanistan with help of US Air Force||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when thousands of people are fleeing from the strife-torn country of Afghanistan, and the Indian government is evacuating its nationals from there, a 35-year old engineer from the neighbouring district of Pratapgarh was also able to leave Afghanistan and reach home. Ashok Kumar Singh is native to Kunwar Ka Purva in Babuganj Bazar of Lalganj tehsil. He returned to India via Kuwait with the help of US Air Force. Ashok Kumar Singh, who reached Pratapgrah on Wednesday, spoke to TOI on phone and narrated the sorry affairs in the country which is now fully controlled by the Taliban. Ashok was working as an IT engineer at the American Army base camp in Kabul at the time of Taliban takeover. Ashok said, “Our base camp was located about 8-10 km from Pul-e-Charkhi, the biggest prison in Kabul, and employed 60 people. Among them were five Indians, 35 Americans and 20 British nationals. Two hours before the Taliban were about to reach Kabul on the night of August 14, we received a call from the US embassy to vacate the camp. Before leaving the camp, we secured back-up of the entire data and destroyed around 200 laptops. As many as 40 armed vehicles of the US army were burnt. After this, six Chinook helicopters of the US army airlifted us. “We were taken to Doha by a US Air Force plane on the night of August 15. After staying there for the next day, we reached Kuwait, and then landed in New Delhi on Tuesday night,” he informed. Talking about the present scenario in Afghanistan, Ashok said, “Although the Taliban are being welcomed by some Afghans, a substantial part of the population wants to escape for their freedom and better opportunities because their fate is very bleak in their own country now.” He also informed that although the Indian government is evacuating their nationals from several locations, there are still a lot of Indians who are yet to be flown back to safety as soon as possible. “There is utter chaos in Afghanistan. When locals are trying to get out by all means possible, one can imagine the plight of many Indians who are still stuck there,” said the young engineer who was lucky enough to reach his home within three days of being airlifted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pratapgarh-engineer-returns-safely-from-afghanistan-with-help-of-us-air-force/articleshow/85440113.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Volunteers step up to help flood victims in dist||Prayagraj: Although the water levels of Ganga and Yamuna are receding, many low-lying localities of Sangan city remain inundated. And at this hour of need, young student leaders and voluntary organizations are helping out flood-affected locals with food and other necessary items, many even using boats and wading through waist-deep waters to deliver the essentials to the flood-affected needy people. The timely help to the flood-hit populace, especially those of the rural areas of the district, bears significance as, despite mammoth efforts of the district administration, the help by both voluntary organisations and individuals went a long way in lessening the challenges being faced by these people. One such help was being extended by the student leaders of Allahabad University. A team of volunteers, led by Adeel Hamza, who had been vice president of AU student union (AUSU) in the year 2017 are busy distributing food packets and other essential items to different areas inundated in trans-Ganga villages. Travelling in the boat, these youngsters served packed food in different villages of the trans-Ganga area of the Phaphamau assembly seat. For over ten days, the day starts early for Hamza and his friends who get the food prepared at his house and leave for affected villages by around 9am. He later distributes the same through boats and on his vehicle, as and when the need arises. “The administration is also helping but during such crisis, every effort counts as I have seen the wait for help in the eyes of rural folks who shower their blessings in abundance”, said Adeel. Similarly, another youth, Sandeep Yadav too was seen helping out to locals trapped in floodwater in different localities. When he couldn’t find a boat to sail in the thin lanes of the flood-affected localities and heard students crying for help in Chota Baghada, Sandeep carried the food packets and travelled in deep water to provide them with food. “As we were helping the flood victims, suddenly several students started shouting for help from the first floor of a lodge. Without caring for what could be the condition of the road, we decided to go forward," said Sandeep. Equally important is the work being done by volunteers of Sri Satya Sai Seva Samiti, Prayagraj. Every day, since the floods have inundated parts of Ashok Nagar, Rajapur, Beli Goan, Jhunsi etc., the Samiti’s volunteers have been preparing healthy food and distributing it to the needy by forming different teams, informed Sameer Neb of the Samiti. “Despite a lot of help, both at the urban and rural areas, a lot has to be done especially now when the floodwater is receding. Now on, our efforts would be to make the people aware about following cleanliness and how to keep themselves safe from ailments”, said Akhilesh Singh, another senior member of the Samiti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/volunteers-step-up-to-help-flood-victims-in-dist/articleshow/85440146.cms||---

The local corporators, following up the issue with the civic administration, said the work was expected to get over in the next two weeks. “The work faced many interruptions in the past few years. But we continuously followed up the issue with the administration. The officials have told us that the work would get over in the next few days,” said local corporator Nana Bhangire. The corporator said he, along with the residents of the area, had resorted to agitation at the local ward offices and the Cantonment water works to expedite the pending works. The work was also hampered during the two waves of the Covid pandemic. A proposal was tabled before the officials to consider the pending work as a special case and expedite it, he added. Sanjay Mate, a local resident, said, “The entire area has been facing erratic and inadequate water supply. Geographically, the entire area is very uneven. Some pockets located uphill always receive water supply at low pressure. We have been waiting for improvement in water supply.” Bhangire said around 15,000 residents in the area would benefit once the overhead tank started storing and distributing water. Water would be supplied to the existing distribution network from the newly constructed tank having storage capacity of over 25 lakh litres. Aaysha Inamdar, another resident of the area, said the residents also want the administration to improve the water distribution network in the area because many new housing societies had come up. “Water distribution is not equitable. The officials should visit every area and check the water pressure,” Inamdar said. Local corporator Prachi Alahat said the work of laying distribution lines to improve the availability of water in all the pockets in the entire area had been under way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-expect-better-water-supply-as-overhead-tank-nears-completion/articleshow/85439170.cms||Sarang Dastane

Saldanha has slammed him for interfering in her constituency of Cortalim. Responding to his statement on Tuesday, Saldanha said that, “It is utter shame that a man of his age indulges in lies and false allegations just to prove himself right. Godinho is insecure in his own constituency (Dabolim) and that is why he feels a need to interfere in Cortalim constituency.”“Godinho was MLA of Cortalim constituency for 20 years, and he failed in carrying out developmental work in Cortalim,” Saldanha said. She said even the foundation stone for the Sancoale panchayat building was laid down twice, but the work never started.Talking about the completion of Kala Bhavan, Saldanha slammed him for riddling the project with controversies. “Godinho could not even complete it. He only built the outer structure. Right from the tiling, electricity and water connections, everything was done by me. The project will be inaugurated shortly,” she said. She said he was trespassing in her constituency with the help of a few people backed by him in Sancoale panchayat. The same sarpanch of Sancoale, Ramakant Borkar who eight months ago spoke ill of Godinho, today is full of praise for the MLA for the same things Borkar used to criticise him for, she said.On the market complete at Cansaulim, she said, “Godinho claims that he worked for it and I am sure he must have done it, but only in his dreams.”"I would like to request our party (BJP) to put some sense in him…. because he is losing control and doesn’t know what he is talking," the Cortalim legislator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/show-us-your-list-of-works-in-cortalim-alina-tells-mauvin/articleshow/85439186.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||BU increases upper age limit of research supervisors to enrol PhD scholars||Coimbatore: Bharathiar University has amended its regulations to increase the upper age limit of research supervisors by two years to enrol PhD scholars in affiliated colleges. The decision comes after the state government increased the age of superannuation of state government staff from 58 to 60.Research supervisors are not allowed to enrol PhD scholars with less than a year remaining before their superannuation. Earlier, the upper age limit for registering fresh candidates for PhD was fixed as 57 for research supervisors in affiliated colleges, as they were retired at the age of 58. The same was 59 years of age in the case of the university teachers as they retired at 60.Now research supervisors in colleges can enrol PhD candidates till they attain the age of 59 years. In the case of faculty and scientists whose retirement age is not specified, the upper age limit to register fresh candidates under their supervision was fixed as 64 years.Speaking to TOI, Bharathiar University vice-chancellor P Kaliraj said that increase in the age of superannuation of research supervisors by the state government necessitated an increase in their age limit for enrolling fresh PhD candidates. “There was a confusion as the age of superannuation was revised twice in the last two years. In order to fix the age at which research supervisors can enrol PhD candidates, we brought the amendment,” he said.University teachers after superannuation can continue as co-guides for research students with the consent of the concerned authorities.

---||Coimbatore||More than 20 lakh vaccine doses administered in dist||Coimbatore: The district achieved a significant milestone in Covid-19 vaccination on Wednesday, when the total doses that it administered crossed the 20 lakh-mark.According to a public health official, the district has inoculated 16,26,901 people with the first dose of vaccine and another 3,83,305 with the second dose.The official said they had administered 20,10,206 doses of vaccine in the district till date. On an average, health officials have vaccinated 10,000-12,000 people a day. In the recent past, there were days when they inoculated 30,000 people daily.While the vaccination drive started in mid-January for the frontline workers, it was extended to the people aged above 45 years after a few weeks. However, there were apprehensions among the health staff about getting inoculated.The situation changed in the district soon, with people waiting in long queues overnight in front of vaccination camps to take the jab.More than the awareness drives by the state and central governments on vaccination, the official said, it was the second wave and the mortality rate that pushed the demand for vaccines up.P Aruna, deputy director of health services, confirmed that there was an unusual demand after the initial hesitancy to take the shot. “The supply couldn’t match the demand, forcing people to wait in long queues to get inoculated. We have, however, managed to streamline the vaccination drive in the recent weeks.”She said vaccinating the majority population would help reduce Covid-19 cases and prevent health complications to a large extent, even if one gets infected.Asked about the widening gap between those vaccinated with the first dose and those with both the doses, she said exclusive camps for administering the second hadn’t evoked much response. “People who are due to take the second dose haven’t turned up at the camps. We are discussing the possibility of calling them up to remind them to visit any nearby vaccination centres to take the second dose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/more-than-20-lakh-vaccine-doses-administered-in-dist/articleshow/85441285.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, dozens of these protesting farmers were taken into preventive custody and shifted to the police lines in the city. SP Crime Mithilesh Singh reached the spot with a heavy police force and detained the protesters. The farmers — under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) and Tarai Kisan Mahasabha (TKM) — were protesting against the three contentious agri-reform laws passed last year. Later in the day, they were later released by the police after Bhatt left for Lakuan in Nainital for the yatra. Condemning police action against the protesting farmers, Tejender Singh Virk, TKM president, said those in office have forgotten that they are the representatives of the people and that suppressing the voice of the farmers is an attack on the entire farming community. Meanwhile, Bhatt received an exhilarating reception from the BJP workers in Rudrapur. In a meeting held at the City Club, Bhatt said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji is the true champion of social justice and under his leadership, India will lead the world.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/farmers-protesting-bjps-jan-ashirwad-yatra-held-in-rudrapur/articleshow/85437377.cms||Aakash Ahuja

If colleges are found violating guidelines, action will be taken against their management, the letter added. Pathak, in his letter dated August 17, said that the department has been receiving complaints of violation of government guidelines in several matters, including extending benefits to non-teaching staff and suspension/termination of service of some employees. This, said Pathak, is leading to several disgruntled employees approaching the high court and as a consequence, the state government has to incur unnecessary expenditure on litigation. TOI, in a report on August 7, had highlighted that a few government-aided private colleges were denying promotions to teachers fulfilling eligibility conditions. This comes even as the central government has laid down provisions regarding promotions of teachers in 2010 and then again in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/private-colleges-violating-government-rules-will-be-held-accountable-says-director-higher-education/articleshow/85437371.cms||---

Fake Indian currency notes with a face value of Rs 39.6 lakh were seized from a Malad hotel room where the two foreigners stayed before fleeing. The police arrested Tarun Kachhwa (29) last week; he has been sent to police custody. The two Cameroon nationals are wanted accused in the case. Kachhwa had booked a room for the foreigners at a hotel. When they left without informing the hotel, its staff asked Kachhwa if they would return. After Kacchwa told them that the two foreigners would not return, the housekeeping staff began cleaning the room and found the fake notes. The hotel informed the police who arrested Kachhwa. During interrogation, he told the police that he met the two foreigners on social media and when they came to Mumbai, he booked the hotel room for them. He told police that the duo had told him they had millions of dollars and wanted to wrap it in Rs 2,000 notes so that an ink mark on the dollars would be erased. The duo allegedly promised to give him commission. When they asked him to get Rs 2,000 notes, he brought color print-outs of the currency. The duo apparently suspected the notes were fake and left the hotel, the police said. —Mateen Hafeez||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jeweller-prints-rs-2000-notes-of-face-value-of-rs-39l-held/articleshow/85441445.cms||---

On July 31, TOI had reported that projects in 15 wards would have been affected because of the 10km buffer zone. Suburban areas include Kurla, Chembur, Bhandup, Mulund, Ghatkopar (E), Kandivli, Borivli, Dahisar, Andheri (E) and Bandra (E). Island city areas include Dadar, Matunga and Parel. The BMC had issued a circular stating that no building approvals be granted until the developers with projects falling in this zone get clearance from the forest department first. The circular had referred to a letter from the deputy forest conservator, Thane division, stating that prior permission is required for all development/construction works falling within the 10km buffer zone. “The reduction of the buffer zone has reduced the concerns of developers and most of the projects, especially redevelopment ones in the suburbs, will be put on the fast-track again,” said developer Hitesh Thakkar. “The Union ministry’s nod to modify and rationalise the eco-sensitive zone around Thane Creek sanctuary comes as a huge relief for MMR development. This will enable construction activities, while ensuring a safe environment for the flamingos...” said developer Boman Irani. However, civic sources said a formal notification from the ministry is awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-nod-to-shrink-thane-creeks-buffer-zone-a-relief-in-mumbai-builders/articleshow/85442908.cms||---
---||Agra||Agra Mufti booked for slamming hoisting of tricolor inside Jama Masjid, calling it un-Islamic||Agra: A prominent Muslim cleric of Agra, who oversees the city’s 17th century Jama Masjid, was on Wednesday booked for allegedly dubbing recitation of national anthem inside the mosque as “un-Islamic”, two days after a group led by a local BJP leader entered the place of worship, hoisted the tricolor and sung the anthem to mark the Independence Day. The FIR against city Mufti Mazidul Kudhush Khubaeb Roomi, 75, was registered by local police on the basis of a complaint filed by a mosque management committee member and local leader Haji Aslam Qureshi. The event was headed by Ashfaq Saifi, a BJP leader who was recently appointed chairperson of the UP’s minority commission. Apart from the complaint, police also took note of an audio clip in which the cleric can be heard purportedly slamming the flag hoisting inside the mosque. He can also be heard saying that it was an act of sacrilege. Cleric Roomi’s son Hummdul Khudhush was also named in the FIR. Station house officer (SHO) of Mantola police station, Vinod Kumar, said, “The FIR was registered under IPC sections 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 508 (act caused by inducing person to believe that he will be rendered an object of the divine displeasure) and section 3 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.” Qureshi, the host of the programme, said, “By releasing an audio opposing the Independence Day programme, Mufti Roomi has attempted to disturb the public peace and tranquility." While Saifi said, “Mufti and his son should realise that they have insulted the national honor. They should apologise for it. We recited national anthem, hoisted the national flag and chanted ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ in the mosque. An unnecessary controversy has been created by the city Mufti and his son over the event.” Meanwhile, several local Muslim leaders came out in support of the city Mufti. They claimed that a flag was always hoisted at the main gate of the mosque. But such an event was never organised inside the place of worship. Vice president of All India Jamiatul Quresh, Haji Jamilluddin Qureshi, said, “The Independence Day programme was organized in part of the mosque where people offer prayers. This has never happened in the past. The mosque should not be dragged into such a controversy.” President of Bharatiya Muslim Vikas Parishad, Sami Aghai, said, “Usually, flag hoisting is done at the entrance of religious site. This controversy was created for political gains as elections are approaching. Shahar Mufti is like a father figure to us, the entire community is feeling insulted by the FIR registered against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-mufti-booked-for-slamming-hoisting-of-tricolor-inside-jama-masjid-calling-it-un-islamic/articleshow/85437396.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Higher education enrolments rise but growth rate falls||JAIPUR: The state recorded a 5.26% increase in enrolments in higher education during 2019-20 to 2020-21, data released by the state higher education department said. Though enrolments jumped from 11.96 lakh to 12.59 lakh, growth rate fell from 7.18% (2019-20) to 5.26% (2020-21). Experts have called the rise an ‘achievement’ since lockdown led to student dropout in huge numbers across the state. “The credit for growth goes to the state government for repeatedly extending the admission deadlines followed by continuing the scholarship programme and opening new colleges when the nation was in the midst of uncertainty,” said Puneet Sharma, a higher education expert. The growth rate would have crossed the previous year mark had the girls’ enrolment matched that of the boys. The girls’ enrolment registered a growth of 2.61% as against 8.21% of the boys. In absolute numbers, girls are still leading in the enrolments with 6,46,378 in 2020-21 while boys are at 6,13,103. Experts believe that those girls who have been left out in the pandemic years should be given special provisions to admit them in colleges. The exception to the trend is found in communities registered under Scheduled Tribes where girls registered a higher growth rate than the boys. “The data shows that communities under the Scheduled Caste have recorded the highest growth of 14.36% while the lowest growth of 4.86% as compared to the 2019-20 figures was recorded by general category. When underprivileged communities outperform the privileged communities it means that programs related to special assistance are working in the right direction,” said KB Kothari, former policy planner, Unicef (New York). He believes that the state should run a special assistance program by motivating those who were not able to take admission in 2019-20. The opening of 123 new government colleges in educationally backward blocks by the Congress government in the last two years has provided an opportunity to many students to take admission in colleges who otherwise would have to discontinue due to expensive education in private colleges. Over the years, the consecutive governments have brought in several institutional changes in the higher education scenario. At present, 11 scholarships for different categories of students are worth Rs 4,899 crores. The CM Scholarship for Higher Education, Dev Narayan Chatra Scooty Yojana, Kali Bai Bheel Medhavi Chatra Scooty Distribution Yojana etc are making a strong impact on the enrolments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/higher-edu-enrolments-rise-but-growth-rate-falls-study/articleshow/85442860.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Delhi||Empowering kids, innovation: 2 from Delhi to get national teachers’ awards||NEW DELHI: The head of the government school who ensured that the students did not miss out on engineering and medical courses for lack of coaching and another principal who innovatively provides students with experiential learning are the recipients of this year’s national teachers award from Delhi. Vipin Kumar, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Sector 11, Rohini, and Suruchi Gandhi, principal, Bal Bharti School, Dwarka, will receive the award from the President of India on Teachers’ Day, September 5. Kumar, 50, started his career in a Delhi government school as a maths lecturer. He has been the head of the school since 2014. In 2018, he received the state teachers’ award. “I have worked to see that students from government schools do not miss out on the medical and engineering seats because they cannot afford coaching. I have made provisions for necessary study materials and guidance for them to be able to achieve success. One year, 35 students cleared JEE and NEET,” Kumar told TOI. Kumar also led the Delhi government school team to the Fourth International Olympiad of Metropolises in Moscow, where the city school won bronze medals in chemistry. Gandhi has been a teacher for 35 years, 15 of them as principal of Bal Bharti School. In 2013, she was honoured with the state teachers’ award and in 2019 with the best teacher award. “This is an award for teamwork,” smiled Gandhi. “For any leader to realise her vision, she needs a supportive team. I have cooperative teachers, a supportive management and bright students. One needs to constantly aim to do better and not rest on your laurels.” Gandhi’s focus has been experiential learning. “I allow children to innovate and experiment. When teaching them about how a cow gives milk, we even brought a cow to school,” she said. “We have taken students to the kitchen of a pizza outlet to let them see and learn how it is done. Because of their exposure, my students have won awards for developing a pothole sensor, robotic arms, e-bicycle and many other innovations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/empowering-kids-innovation-2-from-delhi-to-get-national-teachers-awards/articleshow/85441473.cms||Shradha Chettri

As the Local Planning Authority is now empowered to give approvals to plans up to 2,500 square metres, we can finish the process within three months,” said Gugan Elango, president of Credai, Coimbatore.Elango also said the government has been positively considering their other demands like creating the Coimbatore Development Authority, similar to the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority. Credai has also been urging the state government to usher in a single window system to give approvals as in for setting up new company within 30 days. On the industry growth, builders said the demand for housing units in Coimbatore is good. As there are only a few completed projects awaiting sale, many projects are taking shape at a quick pace to meet the demand. “Despite the pandemic, ongoing projects are progressing. Around 80% of the migrant labourers, who form a major chunk of workforce, are still available for work. They are vaccinated to ensure safety at the workplace,” said another office-bearer.Office-bearers also said builders are trying not to pass on the rise in prices of raw materials like steel, cement and sand to the customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/enhanced-power-of-lpa-will-help-expedite-projects-builders-body/articleshow/85441433.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Tribal girls enrolled in Rajasthan colleges outnumber boys||JAIPUR: The communities under the Scheduled Tribes are leading the way in girls’ education with the highest of 115 girls for every 100 boys enrolled in the higher education institutes, says the higher education department report on enrolments. The worst female-male ratio came at 93 girls enrolled for every 100 boys from Scheduled Caste communities. The ST communities have made a major jump from 30 girls in 2005-06, completely reversing the trend in fifteen years. “The figures are testimony to the fast-changing mindset of the orthodox communities in the state. A higher enrolment means higher job opportunities. In our research papers, it is proven that an educated family gives away orthodoxy, leading to overall development including liberation of women,” said Rashmi Jain, head of department, sociology. The average ratio of girls to boys was 105:100 in 2020-21. Experts say that state policies like opening only girls’ colleges and free education for girls, along with several scholarships schemes, turn out to be game changers. Of 322 government colleges, 60 are only girls’ colleges, especially in blocks that are dominated by the communities known for poor girls’ education. Meanwhile, humanities continue to have a lion’s share in enrolments with 66.41% of the total enrolments in higher education in social sciences. The next share of 24.07% goes to science, while commerce stood third with 7.22% enrolments. “Girls are fast catching up with boys in the field of law. In the 2020-21 academic year, 18,255 boys enrolled for law while 8,319 enrolled for law were girls. It’s no longer taboo for girls to enrol for law. Even them opting for agriculture is surprising, as it is still considered to be a boys’ bastion. In the survey year, 225 girls enrolled for the degree programme while 505 were boys,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tribal-girls-enrolled-in-raj-colleges-outnumber-boys/articleshow/85442877.cms||---

The decrepit building was taken up for restoration based on the recommendation from the judicial department.An official from PWD said that the building has two court chambers with Madras terrace-roofing. The building was constructed using lime mortar.A couple of years ago, a PWD team found the building completely damaged during their visit. Trees had rooted deeply through the walls. Hence, major portion of the structure could not be restored. However, the old structure would be exactly replicated using the same lime mortar material and Madras terrace-roofing.The structure was known for its high pillars and elevation works. The bricks that were intact have been retrieved from the old structure. They will be reused. Meanwhile, triangle shaped bricks required for the construction of pillars have been procured and kept at the construction site, officials said.“We took up the work in February-end. It was scheduled to be completed in a year. However, owing to pandemic it might take a few more months for completion. A heritage contractor has been awarded the work through bidding process,” an official from PWD said.The structure could also be converted into a museum if required as the building would be suited for it as well, the official said.Carpenters are also working on the site to make the required number of wooden frames for roofing. The old frames, which were exposed to sun and rain for a very long time, got damaged.Once the restoration work is completed, landscaping would be done around the building, which would enhance the look of the building with lawns and beautiful plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kuthirai-vandi-court-building-renovation-work-gathers-pace/articleshow/85441483.cms||V Devanathan

With the vaccination drive, opening up of borders and many countries returning to normal, students have started applying for foreign universities. This year, due to the pandemic, many universities in USA, Canada and Europe removed the criteria of SAT and some have removed GMAT as well. Students have been given admission just on the basis of IELTS and TOFEL marks. It was difficult to score well in these exams but with the removal of these scores, it has become even easier to get into foreign universities. Kailash Dixit, a student preparing for a foreign university this year said, “I have difficulty in clearing mathematics in SAT. So, with the current opportunity, I have decided to apply as soon as possible. It is a good time to get a good foreign degree, especially in Humanities.” The coaching institutes that provide classes for GMAT/GER/SAT have also accepted that many factors combined have boosted the number of queries and applications for foreign universities this year. Manager of Jamboree Education Institute in Jaipur said, “Last year, due to pandemic, there was a decline in application for foreign universities but this year, students who dropped a year in 2020 and new students in 2021, both have applied. Hence, there has been a rise in the applications for foreign universities.” Many institutes have said that applications and students preparing for foreign universities have increased. Although people know that in many countries, classes are still online and borders have not opened yet, but the value of the degree is making them take the admission. Dwijendra Srivastava, head of IMS Institute Jaipur said, “Students have already wasted a year, but now with full vaccination, opening of borders and relaxed rules, they have again started applying for foreign universities. High scorers prefer USA and UK universities. Then Ireland, Germany, Australia and Canada colleges come into picture.” Some students are taking examinations this year for GMAT and GER to take admission next year. Ankush Agrawat, a mechanical engineer said he expects Covid to come under control by next year’s end. As the GMAT score is valid for five years, he has started preparing to get a good score.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/more-students-apply-for-intl-universities-as-rules-eased/articleshow/85442900.cms||---

The project is likely to cost about Rs 14.9 crore along with operation and maintenance costs for 10 years. This will benefit Lajpat Nagar-4 area that has several commercial zones and markets. A senior civic official said that the Amar Colony area was prone to traffic congestion as it had both residential and market zones. “This area is regularly visited by a large number of shoppers and visitors resulting in traffic jams on roads all around the market zone due to lack of adequate parking space. The project site for automated parking is already accommodating a south corporation’s community centre and a post office, and it has 1,428 sqm vacant area,” the official explained. The peripheral area of the community hall is used for parking vehicles during any function that leads to chaos and congestion in the colony. “The community centre can accommodate 250-300 people at a time, therefore, the estimated demand of parking space is for 75-80 cars. There is another project to set up a dispensary building in this complex, which will also generate parking demand,” the official said. On Tuesday, the standing committee of South Delhi Municipal Corporation approved construction of automated puzzle parking that can accommodate 81 vehicles. The approved proposal will now be sent to the House of councillors after which tenders will be invited. Puzzle parking is an automated system that enables horizontal and vertical movement of parking spots, just like a puzzle, to park and retrieve cars. The multilevel puzzle parking system is adopted at the place where less space is available. Earlier this month, SDMC had cleared a proposal of constructing multilevel parking facilities at Greater Kailash 2 and Punjabi Bagh crematorium to cumulatively accommodate 450 cars. The civic body had last year approved construction of automated multilevel puzzle parking lots at M Block Market in Greater Kailash 1, Waste to Wonder Park near Sarai Kale Khan, B1-Block Janakpuri and at a space along slip road near Lodhi Road Flyover on Lala Lajpat Rai Marg near Nizamuddin Basti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-14-9cr-automated-puzzle-parking-for-amar-colony-soon/articleshow/85441525.cms||Paras Singh

But the OSR land, reserved for park or recreational purpose, was sold to 10 people soon after getting the approval. Periyar Nagar residents recently approached activist S P Thiyagarajan seeking his help to retrieve the land. “While getting approval from the local body, it was shown that five cents was allotted to borewell, 47 cents for park, 66 cents for community hall and 13 cents for shops as per the rules. While the 47 centres were taken over for construction of a government school, 66 cents were sold. On that plot, houses are constructed on six cents and the rest is lying vacant,” Thiyagarajan said.“The corporation had identified 150 encroachments eight years ago. But no action was taken to remove them. Many of the landowners know that it belongs to the local body. They have rented out the lands for money. Some people who bought the plots without checking are facing trouble,” the activist added.The corporation has erected a board to prevent misuse. The value of the retrieved land is Rs 10 crore, residents said.Meanwhile, corporation officials erected boards at two OSR lands at Sivakami Nagar Extension in the west zone on Wednesday to retrieve 35 cents of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/periyar-nagar-residents-retrieve-reserved-site/articleshow/85441491.cms||---

DM Umesh Mishra said that the potholes have led to several accidental deaths in the last two months. The NH-74, which connects Bareilly to Haridwar and cuts through Bijnor, was recently widened with a budget of Rs 1,200 crore. DM Mishra said, “We have requested the national highway authorities to repair the road. Despite repeated pleas, no action has been taken by national highway authorities. It is unfortunate.” “Now, if any person dies in an accident on the highway due to the potholes, action will be taken against the officials of NHAI. District administration is committed to protect the life and property of the general public. Negligence at any level in this matter will not be tolerated.

Madkaikar said that the Union minister has failed to bring about the desired development in his North Goa constituency as an MP. Madkaikar said he would get first preference for the Cumbharjua ticket as the sitting MLA. He also sought to put to rest any speculations over his health, and said that he is fit to contest the elections. “They (the Naik father-son duo) want to increase their bargaining power. They may not bargain with me, but they will definitely bargain with the party.” “The sitting MLA should always get the ticket. BJP is a national party. It is not that someone’s father is a minister, so he will get the ticket. Finally, the party will see who is the sitting MLA and who has the potential to win there,” said Madkaikar. Madkaikar said constituents in North Goa are only talking negatively of Naik senior’s performance as an MP. “His (Siddhesh’s) father is contesting elections for so long, and people talk very negatively about him, that even after being a Union minister, no development has been taking place in North Goa,” the MLA said. He said “health-wise I am very fine” and that he would win the upcoming 2022 assembly polls with an even bigger margin. Madkaikar was dropped from the cabinet by then chief minister Manohar Parrikar in September 2018, three months after he suffered a stroke during a visit to Mumbai. He had joined BJP from Congress a few months before the 2017 assembly polls “Not only getting the ticket, I am also confident of winning. I will win with a bigger margin than before, as day by day, I am increasing my strength,” said Madkaikar. He said he has been working in his constituency throughout the pandemic. “We cannot ask anyone not to contest. It is good for them to contest the polls and know where they stand. It (the challengers) is not a new thing for me. It happens every election,” said Madkaikar about many claimants expressing interest in his Cumbharjua constituency. “They feel they can throw money and win elections. But it does not work that way. If that was the case, Salgaocar and Dempo (the industrialists) would have been the chief minister,” Madkaikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/madkaikar-hits-out-at-shripad-over-sons-claim-to-cumbharjua/articleshow/85441509.cms||---
---||Goa||Sandesh Jhingan backs himself to succeed in Croatia||Panaji: It’s not often that an Indian footballer gets noticed by a top-tier club in Europe. Prior to every transfer window, HNK Sibenik, like most top-tier clubs in Europe, receive hundreds of player profiles. They glance through each of them; most are dismissed, only a handful ever make the cut. But when Sandesh Jhingan’s name was proposed, the Croatian club took notice. Then the background work started. Four of the club’s analysts studied his matches in detail, coach Mario Rosas looked at his movements on the field and calls were made to national coach Igor Stimac, a central defender in Croatia's 1998 Fifa World Cup bronze medal winning campaign. “Your coach (Stimac) told us very good things about Sandesh. He is a good player. I don’t care if he is from India or Argentina. For us, it’s important that he’s good,” HNK Sibenik CEO Eduardo Zapata told reporters on Thursday. Jhingan has started training with HNK Sibenik under Rosas – a La Masia graduate and former Barcelona player – but breaking into the team won’t be a cakewalk. “It will be challenging, but I trust myself, my work ethic, and all aspects of football involved (to make it),” Jhingan told TOI. “Time will decide (about stint in Croatia). It will always be on me. If I play well, I’ll tell myself, ‘well done Sandesh’; if not, ‘work hard Sandesh’.” India’s footballer of the year is backing himself to make a mark in a country that made it to the World Cup in 2018 and in a league that has produced some of the best footballers, including Luka Modric, the first player other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo to win the Ballon d'Or in more than a decade. “I am a believer. Croatia is a strong league; the growth of the national team is immense. That’s why I chose to play here. I will be tested to the limit, and when that happens, you improve. “I know that everything depends on me. The challenge is to perform at the optimum (in training and matches). If I train hard, like I always do, then I see myself if I can get into the starting 11. If not, I’ll have to work harder,” said Jhingan. Croatia will be hard. Europe has the most competitive and glamorous leagues. For most Asian footballers, it’s a dream. But not everyone can get here; even if you do, not many can thrive. So why did the 28-year-old leave the comfort of a lucrative four-year contract – among the best for an Indian footballer – and a guaranteed starting spot in any top Indian Super League (ISL) club? “I am someone who has always taken decisions to be outside the comfort zone,” said Jhingan. “If there is no risk, you are too relaxed. You need to step up when you start feeling comfortable. You need to make yourself uncomfortable. I wanted to go somewhere where I can excel more.” So Jhingan chose Croatia, a decision that is certain to pinch him financially. The Croatian top-tier offers him better competition and opportunities, but his contract wouldn’t come anywhere close to what he earned at ATK Mohun Bagan. Not that Jhingan cares. “I am a person who never went after money. I always choose glory over gold. That’s my decision-making process. Money is important, I won’t lie. I just felt European football was what I wanted “I’ve taken so many decisions that have cost me money. At the end of the day, I go to bed with a clear conscience that I did what is right for me,” said Jhingan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sandesh-jhingan-backs-himself-to-succeed-in-croatia/articleshow/85469194.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Calangute teen death: Cops examine CCTV footage, find nothing useful||PANAJI: Police probing how the body of the 19-year-old woman washed ashore on Calangute beach in a semi-nude state have drawn a blank after examining CCTV footage from nearby shacks. Sources in the department said that the video has not proven useful to investigators as the CCTV networks had only close-range cameras, which do not capture much beyond the immediate surroundings of the shacks. The woman’s body was found around 400-500m from the shacks. “The cameras installed are useful only to capture footage in close range, and are more focused on filming the shacks' guests. They have not captured images in the distance,” said a source. The body was discovered on the morning of August 13 on a busy stretch of the beach in a semi-nude condition, with her clothing nowhere in sight. The police have said that the postmortem report has ruled out sexual assault, whereas her parents suspect that the death is not a simple case of suicide. Police said that none of those they have spoken to as part of the investigations have pointed to any suspects yet. “We have not closed any angles. We are probing the line as per the inputs provided by her family,” an officer said. They are in the know of the investigations taking place. Even if the family feels there is another line or angle of investigation they want us to take, we are open to it,” said an officer. Meanwhile, the deceased woman’s father said that as the case has drawn the attention of people across the state, he has been offered financial help. However, he said the family is not looking for any monetary help, and only seeks a fair probe in the death. “The manner in which I toiled and brought up my elder daughter, I am capable of working hard and bringing up my other children too. The MLA said I will get compensation. I do not want any compensation. I just want justice for my daughter,” said the father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-teen-death-cops-examine-cctv-footage-find-nothing-useful/articleshow/85441532.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Mumbai||Rape accused granted bail as court says he ‘may not be involved’||MUMBAI: A 29-year-old man arrested in a gang rape case over a year ago has been granted bail after the chemical analysis (CA) report did not detect semen on the clothes of the survivor or bed sheets. The court said based on the report, there appears some substance in the argument of the accused and possibility of him not being involved cannot be fully ruled out. The woman had alleged that the accused had invited her to a birthday party where she was sexually assaulted by four men after her drink was spiked. The incident took place in June. Defence advocate for the accused Abdul Shaikh said there are discrepancies in the FIR, the survivor’s history before the medical officer and statement recorded before the magistrate. The court, however, said the discrepancies are not sufficient to come to the conclusion that this is a false case. “But the CA report produced is mentioning that no semen is detected, therefore, there appears some substance in the argument of the counsel for accused and possibility of accused not being involved cannot be fully ruled out,” the court said. It said that considering the CA report and that there are no criminal antecedents of the accused and that chargesheet is filed, it would be proper to release the accused on bail. The co-accused have been given bail. The prosecution said the survivor and accused stay in the same area and it may pressure the woman and witnesses. Imposing conditions on the accused, the court said, “He shall not... make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the case...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rape-accused-granted-bail-as-court-says-he-may-not-be-involved-in-mumbai/articleshow/85441514.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The government, however, is yet to take a call. “We have placed our request to hold the event, but we have also told the government that we on our own will cancel it if the Covid-19 situation doesn’t favour (the event). We need permission in advance to prepare for the big event,” Harindra Singh, chairman and MD, Percept, told TOI on Wednesday. Singh also said they would ensure that all their staff and artistes are fully-vaccinated, and that tickets too would only be sold to those who are fully-vaccinated. Tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar said that the application has not yet come to him, but that the government has no intention of allowing any event at the cost of the safety of the people of Goa. As of now, we are not giving anyone permission, but whatever decision is taken will be in consideration of SOPs of the government, and by taking into account the ground situation”, he said. Last year, the organisers were granted in-principle permission to hold Sunburn during the the last week of December, but the decision was revoked after the government came under intense public pressure. Congress held a protest against the organisers and condemned the government for allowing an event that’s a big crowd puller even as the state was not fully out of the first wave of the pandemic. In 2020, Goa’s Covid-19 cases soared from June, and only started dipping by September-end. It was also when the state loosened travel and other restrictions, and there was a bumper rise in domestic tourists till March, giving a much-needed boost to the hospitality industry. The tourism minister said that they want tourists to come to Goa, as also EDM-like events that bring footfalls to the state, but the government does not want any event that will comprise the people’s health and safety. Since last month, the inflow of tourists has gone up, with some hotels that have resumed their operations doing fairly well. Most tourism-related activities have not opened yet, and while the government hasn’t indicated when the hospitality industry will be permitted to function fully, some event organisers have started advertising and marketing their events planned for the year-end. “Some clubs have started selling tickets for music events that will be held in December. Though they may be small events, it is unfair to those waiting for the industry to open,” a stakeholder said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sunburn-organisers-seek-nod-for-edm-fest-in-dec/articleshow/85441562.cms||---

AAP’s national secretary, Pankaj Gupta, alleged BJP was aware that it was going to lose in the municipal elections and was selling off public property. AAP said it would continue to protest till the decision was withdrawn. “We want to take this issue to every citizen of Delhi and tell them how BJP has been committing corruption in the corporation,” he alleged. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the sale had been done through an open transparent tender and the value of the plot was Rs 19.5 crore as per commercial circle rate. Calling AAP’s charges baseless, Kapoor said a large part of the plot would remain open with hardly 225 FAR being allowed, unlike small plots around it on which 300-350 FAR was allowed.  He said that if the AAP government felt that the plot was being sold at below market value, it should help the cash-starved corporation by buying the plot at its own claimed market value.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-gheraoes-bjp-hq-on-novelty-cinema-issue/articleshow/85441581.cms||---

The man, who had murdered the two on Monday, was caught after he made a third futile attempt at taking his life. The accused was identified as Varun Pandya who had strangled his uncle Amul Pandya, a retired employee of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, and his mother Vandana Pandya, 62. Isanpur Inspector J V Rana said, “Looking at the blood which had spilled on the floor, it appeared that he had attempt to stab himself on Wednesday.” Rana said, “Varun was unemployed and undergoing severe financial crisis. This appears to be the primary cause for the murder.” According to the police, Varun’s father had died 15 years ago. He lived with his uncle and mother. “After killing the two, he stayed with the two bodies on Monday and Tuesday. He first tried to strangle himself, but failed. Then, he tried to commit suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan. However, the blades of the fan broke and his second attempt flopped too,” said police. On Wednesday morning, he used a kitchen knife to cut himself. “However, unable to bear the pain, he finally called his relative, who also works with AMC, and informed him of the act. The relative called the police control room which informed the Isanpur police. They rushed Varun to L G Hospital where his condition is said to be critical,” said police. Police said, “Varun has been booked for murdering his mother and uncle. At present, it seems that financial crisis drove the man to take such a step. However, once he is in a position to give a statement, the reason for murder will be known.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-murders-mom-uncle-takes-stab-at-suicide/articleshow/85439414.cms||---

Born to a farmer in Jeevna village of Muzaffarnagar, Arti, an MPhil in physics from Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, made a mark when she was selected for the prestigious MEXT scholarship (5% success rate) under which the Japanese government “adopts” 15 foreign scholars annually from all over the world to study and conduct research at any of the top 30 universities in Japan for three years. Arti, who has specialised in nanotechnology, will study the impact of pollution on plants by injecting nanoparticles through the water as a medium at Saitama University. Having studied in a village school and later graduating from Delhi University, where she found it difficult to continue with the English medium, Arti braved all odds like losing her best support system in her grandfather and father that plunged the family into a financial crisis. “My father died of a sudden heart attack in 2018, only a couple of years after my grandfather had died. It was a shattering experience for me. At one point, I even considered taking up a humble job to support my mother, but destiny had other plans. I wish my father and grandfather were alive. I would have rushed to them to show this great achievement,” she said. Head of the department of physics at CCSU Beerpal Singh, who had recommended her name for the programme, told TOI, “During her MPhil, I found her exceptional in research-based activities. At the same time, she was passionate about environmental conservation. We are proud to say that she is the first student in our university, ever since its inception in 1969, who has made it to such a prestigious scholarship programme and is going abroad.’ Concerned over environmental degradation and its impact on the food chain which is threatening life on the planet, Arti aspires to neutralise the impact of toxic elements by flora and fauna through her research. “Increased anthropogenic activities like mining, urbanisation, industrialisation, burning of fossil fuels, excessive use of chemicals in agriculture, irresponsible dumping of e-waste, etc, has considerably increased the concentration of heavy metals in the nature which then enters the food chain causing fatal diseases,” said Arti. “We are directly or indirectly dependent on plants for our survival. They form the base of the ecological pyramid and are, therefore, more susceptible to invasion by heavy metals. My research will help early detection of heavy metals in plants so that we could cultivate contamination-free crops,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/how-a-up-village-girl-defies-all-odds-to-win-prestigious-japanese-scholarship/articleshow/85437474.cms||Sandeep Rai

Chairing a meeting of senior officials from related departments including district administration, transport, energy, urban and local-self-government, the minister said rooftop solar power systems, solar parks, solar street lights and solar powered-power electric vehicles will be key features of the cities. “All the energy requirements of these cities will be met from solar sources,” Kalla said. The projects will be implemented under the solar city scheme of the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation will work as a nodal agency. The programme aims at reduction in projected demand of conventional energy which can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency measures and enhancing supply from renewable energy sources. The exercise involves preparing the master plan taking into the needs of various sectors. Energy base-line for the city has to be documented in detail factoring in existing energy demand and supply scenario. It consists of sector-wise energy consumption matrix and energy supply-mix for the base year. The programme assists urban local governments in preparation of a master plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy supply in the city, setting-up institutional arrangements for the implementation of the master plan and creating awareness and capacity building activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaisalmer-pushkar-to-be-developed-as-solar-cities-energy-minister/articleshow/85442934.cms||---

The report says that when the company’s submissions to the Income Tax Department and to the Assistant Excise Commissioner were compared by the auditor, it found a huge discrepancy between the two. “The discrepancies found in the consumed material indicate that the assessee (Wave Distilleries and Breweries Ltd ) had understated the consumption of input/intermediates which resulted in evasion of excise revenues including interest of 1,646.04 crore over an extended period from 2013-14 to 2016-17,” the report said. The report goes on to say that even though assessing offices of the excise department are located in the premises of the assessee, they failed to monitor the quantity of inputs utilised by the assessee and the products manufactured by it. Due to this lapse, the report says, the company managed to evade payment of a large amount of excise duty. “The amount of non-realisation of revenue to the Government on account of this is extremely large. The Finance Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh, in its instructions dated 11 June, 2020 had also specifically advised the Excise Department that in all cases where it is established that the assessee has suppressed/concealed particulars in its returns, demand should be raised to protect the interest of revenue,” the report says, adding that despite this, no action with respect to raising demand from the assessee has been intimated to the Audit. The total shortfall in excise revenue till the end of FY 2019, was Rs 1,839 crore, the report says. Similarly, a loss of Rs 239 crore was found in mining, Rs 108.20 crore loss in sales and commercial tax, Rs 91.69 crore in stamp and duty, Rs Rs 1,427.40 crore in transport, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rs-1646-cr-excise-tax-evasion-by-wave-distilleries-between-2013-17/articleshow/85441629.cms||---

---||Delhi||Communal slogans at Jantar Mantar: Court pulls up Delhi Police for not questioning interviewer||NEW DELHI: A court has pulled up Delhi Police for not questioning a YouTube news channel reporter “seen deliberately putting up leading questions” to “incite” people, in connection with communal slogans allegedly raised at Jantar Mantar. The observations came when the counsel for Pinki Chaudhary, the president of Hindu Raksha Dal who is under investigation in the case, said police were relying on an interview given by him to a YouTube channel. The investigating officer (IO) submitted before the court a transcript of the 11-minute video featuring Chaudhary at Jantar Mantar. Additional sessions judge Anil Antil reserved the order on Chaudhary’s anticipatory bail application and extended his interim protection from arrest till Saturday. Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, appearing on behalf of Chaudhary, submitted that police were going beyond the FIR and the alleged video featuring the interview had been added later to the case. The judge asked police, “Have you served notice to the reporter? He is seen deliberately putting up leading questions. To incite them and agitate him and say something. He is trying to incite them. He must have been the first person to be called.” When the court asked Jain whether the words uttered by Chaudhary in the video were his client’s, the counsel said, “His (Chaudhary’s) intention was not violence… The wordings are his. The video needs to be seen in entirety. If you see the whole video, you will see that he is innocent.” Jain claimed that Chaudhary had not been named in the FIR and allegedly did not raise any communal slogan and was not present at the place when the alleged hate speech was given. “The IO has tried to improve his case. He is looking at an interview given to a news channel. Police are going beyond the FIR,” he said. The advocate told the court that despite what had been allegedly said in the video, a case under IPC 153(A) — promoting enmity between different groups and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony — was not made out. Additional public prosecutor S K Kain opposed the anticipatory bail plea, saying it was clear that the interview was promoting enmity between different religions. “Two groups of people are being incited by the accused. This is against the country,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/communal-slogans-court-pulls-up-city-cops-for-not-questioning-interviewer/articleshow/85441638.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Post agri budget, FPOs express need for awareness||Krishnagiri: After the Union government announced last February that 10,000 farmer producer organisations (FPOs) will be formed across the country in the next five years, the Tamil Nadu government has given farmer collectives a boost in its separate budget for agriculture on Saturday with a plan to organise 1,100 new FPOs in the state. While welcoming the decision, executives of a few existing FPOs in the state shed light on the lack of awareness among people about the workings of FPOs. They claimed that this hindered the growth of organisations in their initial stage. S Prabhu, the CEO of Mannargudi Rajagopalswami Ulavar Urapathi Niruvanam in Thiruvarur district said that misplaced expectations of members lead them to lose interest in FPOs after some time. “Some Farmers expect too much from FPOs and miss out on major benefits like removing middlemen, value addition and collective bargaining power,” he explained. Prabhu, who also manages another FPO, said, “Making farmers aware of the benefits of FPOs in the initial stage will help producer companies become successful in the long run.” P Precilla, former CEO of Rajakkamangalam Block Coconut Produce Company Limited in Kanyakumari district said that lack of interest among FPO members will prevent its growth. “This also delays decision making and it breeds distrust among members. This makes them averse from spending government grants or profligate them wastefully.” Precilla, who now oversees the functioning of an FPO in her native Karur district, said, “Such conditions have led to non-use of even initial grants given by the government to the Kanyakumari FPO. She suggests frequent meetings, exposure to successful FPOs and constant interactions can make members more active in FPOs.” K Mahesh also faced the same problem while managing Kosasthalai Collective Farming Farmer Producer Company Limited in Tiruvallur district. “However, farmers became more involved when the FPO received a Rs 60 lakh grant to set up a seed processing unit,” he said. Prabhu said that sometimes grants are given to the same FPOs. “Some of those FPOs get overwhelmed soon and the FPOs that didn’t get any grants lose steam.” He further suggested giving benefits like subsidies, technological training to an individual farmer through FPOs will keep farmers interested in the collective organisations. FPOs which operate for collective welfare succeed, said another executive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/post-agri-budget-fpos-express-need-for-awareness/articleshow/85441636.cms||---

Sultan Ahmed Ismail, part-time member of the state development policy council, is the chairman of the seven-member committee which has been asked to submit its report within four months. The study will include assessment of the impact of drilling technologies like hydro-fracturing for exploring and extracting hydrocarbons on the groundwater level. It will also assess their impact on the quality of surface water, flowing water, ground water, soil and fertility of the land, irrigation sources and cultivation of crops. The impact on air quality, sea water intrusion and flora and fauna due to the usage of chemicals on the on-share areas away from the protected agricultural zone will also be assessed. Assessment of the quantity of groundwater to be drawn out for exploration of coal bed methane, shale gas, petroleum and natural gas will be part of the study. The committee will also check whether such largescale pumping of groundwater will lead to depletion of groundwater besides assessing if the explorations will lead to any subsidence of land and de-stabilise the tectonic plates below the area of exploration. The study will also assess the impact of the projects on the livelihood of people and food security of the region. The other members of the committee are Professor, IIT Madras Indumathi M Nambi, Professor, TNAU, M Maheswari, former senior director, M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) V Selvam, chief engineer, Water Resources Department S Ramamoorthy, executive engineer, Groundwater Resources, PWD S Raja and general manager, TIDCO R.

The complainant, Kamlesh Maheshwari, 46, is in the denim business and was in need of money because his dealers were unable to pay him due to the pandemic. Maheshwari said that in 2017, he had taken a home loan of Rs 32.85 lakh from a private bank for his property in Isanpur. Due to financial hits caused by corona crisis, he needed another Rs 11 lakh. Vishrut Mehta, 48, a resident of Vasna, had been in contact with Maheshwari.

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Ariyalur vaccinates 99% of expectant mothers||ARIYALUR: Ariyalur district administration has covered 99% of the targeted antenatal mothers’ population under the Covid-19 vaccination drive. As of August 17, Ariyalur has vaccinated 7,091 of a total of 7,190 antenatal mothers, registering 99% coverage. Apart from expecting mothers with a contraindication to the vaccination and mothers who recently recovered from the infection, the health department also covered those anticipating childbirth. Health officials attributed the massive coverage to 125 village health nurses (VHN) who managed to interact with the pregnant women on a daily basis and persuaded them to take the jab. Those who expressed hesitation were not compelled, and instead their relatives who accompanied them were given the jab. Noticing that their relatives are normal, the pregnant women also agreed. Dr V C Hemachand Gandhi, former deputy director of health services Ariyalur, was credited for the strategy to allow consultation for antenatal mothers on all days, so that the vulnerable population can be sensitised frequently. “High-risk mothers were sensitised directly by the medical officers and mobile units were used for doorstep vaccination,” said Dr R Geetharani, DDHS Ariyalur. Nilgiris (77%) and Perambalur (68%) have achieved second and third places .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ariyalur-vaccinates-99-of-expectant-mothers/articleshow/85441651.cms||Deepak Karthik

On Wednesday, scientists of the Remote Sensing Application Centre held a meeting with LDA authorities and gave a presentation of the satellite survey and mapping activities carried out by them in Ghaziabad district. Following the meeting, vice-chairperson of LDA Akshay Tripathi instructed them to make the system more technically robust and profitable. He said that digital mapping of the city is essential to prevent illegal constructions. The remote sensing department has been asked to prepare a proposal for the complete action plan. “The LDA has about 1,050 square-km of area under its jurisdiction. We need to prepare a database of satellite images of the entire area every month so that every unauthorized construction taking place in the city can be monitored. The mapping needs to be done in six to seven layers through satellite view, drone survey and Google map so that the plot area, constructed area and land-use can also be known,” Tripathi added. He further said that the system should be made in such a way that mobile location of any type of illegal construction can be found at latitude-longitude level. In future, all this data can be linked up with the portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lda-to-start-digital-mapping-to-check-illegal-construction/articleshow/85441694.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Private hospital warned for changing second vaccine dose to beneficiaries||JAIPUR: While a study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) shows that a cocktail of Covaxin and Covishield is not only safe but mixing and matching of both show better results, the state health department registered complaints against a private hospital here which had administered the cocktail of the vaccines twice accidentally. The incident happened last month. “So far, we have not received any directions from the Centre which allows mixing and matching of Covid vaccines. The existing guidelines on vaccination allows that a beneficiary should get the same jabs,” said a senior health department official. In July, the health department had received a complaint against a private hospital, which had administered first and second dose of different vaccines. “We served a notice to the private hospital that if such carelessness continues in vaccination, we will close the vaccination centres of the hospital,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). Orders have also been issued to medical officers to keep a close watch on the health of the two beneficiaries who had received first dose of a vaccine and second dose of a different one. However, no reports of adverse event following immunisation had been reported, the officials claimed. The ICMR study has demonstrated that immunisation with a heterologous combination of an adenovirus vecto rplatform-based vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine is safe and elicits better immunogenicity than two doses of homologous vaccination, using the same vaccines. The health department officials pointed out that on the basis of the ICMR study, it may allow mixing and matching of vaccines, but as of now it is not allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-hosp-warned-for-changing-2nd-vax-dose-to-beneficiaries/articleshow/85442970.cms||---
---||Trichy||Activists slam Trichy corporation for not sharing resolutions passed sans council||Trichy: RTI activists and citizens welfare organisations have flayed the Trichy Corporation for hesitating to make public the resolutions passed in the absence of an elected council. While local bodies in other cities are sharing the resolutions on their official websites to ensure transparency, Trichy Corporation has not done it for the past three years now. The resolutions comprise details of infrastructure projects and contingency plans taken up by the civic body and information on project cost, objective, design and successful bidder to execute the works. Discussions including with the state highways and railways to arrive at a solution for road and bridge projects involving multiple stakeholders will be shared as the minutes of the resolutions. The resolutions were supposed to be made public on a monthly basis to keep the locals informed. However, the corporation website has details of resolutions passed only till March 2018. Though three civic body budgets were tabled since then, the resolutions were not uploaded. “Through the details provided in the council resolutions, we can scrutinise the quality of proposed civil work.

---||Meerut||Cops clueless as don Badan Singh Baddo continues to be active on social media||MEERUT: Exactly 29 months after convicted fugitive don Badan Singh Baddo escaped police custody during his transit from Fatehgarh Central jail to Ghaziabad court for hearing, he has surfaced again on social media and has been regularly putting up posts. His latest post, on Wednesday, claimed how a former DGP-turned-politician Braj Lal ruined his life and turned him into a criminal. Baddo was convicted for life in a murder case. Police are, however, clueless about his whereabouts ever since he disappeared from a hotel in Meerut on March 28, 2019. SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary has now set up a cyber cell team to track the IP address of the Facebook account to ascertain from where the posts are being uploaded. This is not the first time Baddo has become active on social networking sites. On November 5, last year, the Allahabad High Court had taken a serious note. In fact, the Uttar Pradesh government was asked to file an affidavit in this regard. Continuing his tirade against Lal, Baddo wrote, "Braj called me cunning in the media but the truth is if I wasn't cunning I wouldn’t have been able to fight him and the system he controls nor would I have been able to survive for so long." He compared himself with the likes of freedom fighters and mentioned the British Raj. Baddo also blamed the Meerut police and local administration for "Illegally" demolishing his bungalow which he says was not his but his relative Kuldeep Kaur. Lal was a UP DGP during Mayawati government and is now a Rajya Sabha member from BJP. When contacted, Lal refuted all allegations and said, "What to comment on the statements of a convicted murderer who is currently on the run. He should be given the same treatment as a criminal of his calibre should be given. That's all I can say about him."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cops-clueless-as-don-baddo-continues-to-be-active-on-social-media/articleshow/85437517.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Amritsar||Punjab govt: Rs 590 crore waiver for landless farmers, workers tomorrow||BATHINDA: Taking ahead its farm loan waiver scheme, Punjab government has decided to extend a Rs 590-crore waiver to landless farmers, farm labourers, and SC/BC beneficiaries on Friday. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh will virtually launch the disbursal of debt waiver and cheques will be provided to beneficiaries in their respective districts. On July 14, it was announced that the beneficiaries will be handed over cheques in a state-level function to be held on August 20, which coincided with the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The waiver, up to Rs 20,000 per beneficiary, will be handed over to farmers/labourers, who have availed loans from district cooperative banks for being members of primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS). In all, a benefit of Rs 520 crore will be extended to 2.85 lakh landless farmers and labourers. The remaining will be provided to 7,600 beneficiaries belonging to scheduled castes and backward classes. In all, the state government has provided a debt waiver of Rs 4624 crore to 5.64 lakh small and marginal farmers. Punjab revenue minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar said, “Ministers will provide the waiver to beneficiaries in the districts”. Muktsar deputy commissioner M K Aravind Kumar, who also hold charge of Bathinda district, said some clarifications were yet to be received, but the programme of debt waiver would be launched on August 20. A debt waiver of Rs 14.11 crore will be provided to 8,900 beneficiaries in Bathinda. Meanwhile, the state government has yet not finalised the schedule for handing over appointment letters to kin of farmers who have died during the ongoing protest against the three farm laws passed by the Centre last year. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, on January 22, had announced jobs to kin of farmers apart from ex gratia compensation of Rs 5 lakh. After SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal announced jobs to kin of farmers upon forming government in 2022, Congress government had made claims to provide jobs to kin of 220 farmers who have lost lives. When Amarinder met PM Narendra Modi on August 11, he had advocated repeal of farm laws and had said that over 400 farmers and farm workers had lost their lives in the stir. He had stated that the stir had the potential of posing a security threat for Punjab and the country as Pakistan-backed anti-India forces could look to exploit the farmers’ disgruntlement with the Centre and attempt to hijack the ongoing protests. Sources said though the state government has cleared class 3-4 jobs to kin of 220 farmers, they have stopped action on the file as the government is now looking to give jobs to kin of all farmers who died during protest and the casualty count could be over 400. Punjab agriculture department director Sukhdev Singh said they had sent the file. “The state government might be looking into the issue,” he said. Punjab revenue minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar said his department had to give jobs too and government was looking into it. “We hope to hand over appointment letters at the earliest,” he said.

The trio, who stayed in shanties near the nagar panchayat office in Jewar, would frequently visit Tappal to collect discarded plastic goods from dumpyards. The three have been identified as Vijay (28), Jiggo (30) and Vijjo. “While collecting plastic and scrap, they found some liquor and drank it. However, soon after they had returned home, they started vomiting.

Justice Paresh Upadhyay also ordered the government to restraint itself from taking stringent action like detention under PASA in GST cases. The case involved three traders — Amitkumar Patel, Sanjay P Patel and Sanjaykumar M Patel — who have been charged under Section 132 of the GST Act and criminal conspiracy for alleged multi-state scam. The case against them is pending in a local court. They feared invocation of PASA and moved the HC for protection. The state government told the court that one of them could be detained under PASA. The government also submitted that a proposal is being contemplated to detain them under PASA, but when the decision would be taken was not certain. This led the HC to ask the state finance department whether such a sword should be kept hanging on the trader community. The government did not respond to this query and instead the state’s GST department said that there was no proposal made to detain them under PASA so far. The HC took strong exception to the use of words “so far” and observed, “Citizens cannot be left in the lurch like this. When the state on the whole and the economy in particular is trying to regain the momentum post-Covid, such hanging sword situation cannot be permitted to continue.” The court further said, “In facts like this, the state authorities cannot be permitted to resort to stringent provisions like detention under the PASA against the petitioners. The state is restrained from resorting to the said option against the petitioners in these cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remove-pasa-sword-hanging-over-traders/articleshow/85439550.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Three Ghana women caught at Mumbai airport with 5kg of gold biscuits in bodies||MUMBAI: Body packing, a term applied to the practice of hiding narcotic substances in a smuggler’s body, is not new. Now, gold smugglers are also taking to the trick. The Narcotics Control Bureau has detected a case at Mumbai T2 where three women from Ghana were found to have inserted 5kg of gold biscuits into their bodies. The NCB suspects the three inserted the gold through the vagina. Acting on specific intelligence, it intercepted the trio, who came from Dubai on Tuesday. When asked to declare if they were carrying gold, they denied it. But an X-ray nailed their lie. NCB officials conducted X-ray on the three Ghana women at J J Hospital after seeking permission from the additional chief metropolitan magistrate. The report confirmed the presence of gold biscuits. “It is shocking how they inserted these gold pieces in their bodies,” an official said. Each woman was hiding between 1kg and 2kg of gold. Officials said the procedure to extract the gold might not be easy and some risk to the women’s health was not ruled out at this stage. The officials said they were taking medical advice on the procedure. Once the gold is extracted and the accused discharged from hospital, they will be placed under arrest under the provisions of the Customs Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-ghana-women-caught-at-airport-with-5kg-of-goldbiscuits-in-bodies/articleshow/85443001.cms||---

---||Lucknow||NCTE recognition for Lucknow University BEd, MEd not renewed since 2015||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow University’s effort to get a good grade from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has suffered a setback. The NAAC has found that the recognition granted by National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) to two courses run by LU’s faculty of education - Bachelor in Education (BEd) and Master in Education (MEd) - expired in 2015 and has not been renewed. Significantly, LU is also the nodal agency for conducting state-level entrance examinations for admission to BEd courses run by various colleges and universities in the entire UP. However, its own courses in the same discipline are not recognised. In fact, on Wednesday evening, the varsity also removed the information about the two courses offered by it from the official website. The anomaly came to the fore recently when the LU submitted its institutional information to NAAC for assessment. During verification of the information provided by LU, the NAAC officers found that NCTE recognition for BEd and MEd courses expired in 2015. As per rules, the NCTE gives permanent recognition to BEd and MEd courses but if the duration of the course is changed, the varsity has to apply for revised recognition. Since in 2015 the BEd course was changed from one year to two years, LU had to apply for the revised recognition but even after two reminders from NCTE, the varsity failed to do so. LU vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai admitted that the NAAC had written to LU about lack of recognition of the two courses. “We had written to NCTE last year for the issuance of a recognition certificate but things could not materialize. Now we have sent a reminder to the NCTE and updated NAAC about it,” he said. “The process has been affected because there have been changes in the duration of the BEd courses from one year to two years,” he added. LU got B Grade in the NAAC assessment done in 2014. This assessment expired on May 5, 2019. Now, LU has applied for reassessment. When asked whether LU will take admissions in these two courses this year or not, LU said that there will be no impact on admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ncte-recognition-for-lu-bed-med-not-renewed-since-2015/articleshow/85441729.cms||---

The courses offer a promising career in fields like animal husbandry, forestry, farm management and others,” said Neetu Singh, who scored 92% in ISC. Students opting for unique courses are not giving weightage to hefty pay packages but are looking for courses through which they can transform their hobbies into professions. Fond of computer programming, Abhimanyu Diwakar, who scored a 100 in computer programming in class XII, has chosen to study ethical hacking at a private institute in Darjeeling. “I don’t want to go for a regular BTech course but a hardcore specialized course that makes me an expert in the field. I have applied to pursue a bachelor’s in Ethical Hacking. It is a trending career as legal and companies look for ethical hackers for security purposes,” said Abhimanyu, while adding that in India the field is less explored with only a few private institutes offering the course. “Globally, the course is in high demand,” he said. Chitra Das, who loves to visit museums and gets into each and every detail of the exhibits on display, has opted to pursue a Bachelor in Museology. “Since childhood history fascinated me a lot which is why I fell for museum visits since I was in class VI. I want to learn museum management and museum collections hence I will apply for a bachelor’s in Museology from the University of Calcutta,” said Chitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chasing-passion-students-opt-for-offbeat-courses/articleshow/85441792.cms||Mohita Tewari

We will take measures to expedite the work after evaluating the reasons for the delay,” industries minister P Rajeeve said. According to the contractor, there are errors in calculating the quantity and rate of the civil structure. “As per the Central PWD rate, on the basis of which the estimate of the project has been prepared, there are separate rates for work of the basement floors and that of the floors above the basements. An additional of Rs 1,000 per cubic metre is to be provided for the work on all the floors above the basement,” an official associated with the project said. “But, the Inkel marked three floors as basements. This led to the contractor getting a rate of Rs 1,000 less per cubic meter for the work on the first three floors. They have raised the issue with the government, but a decision is yet to come,” officials said. As a result, the contractor has almost stopped the work for the past five months. The Inkel awarded the work to the contractor who quoted Rs 129 crore for completing the civil structure, while the estimate prepared by the Inkel was Rs 150 crore. But, now the contractor claims that he has completed work to the tune of Rs 93 crore, whereas the authorities have disbursed only Rs 88 crore as it is the value of the completed work as per the nodal agency. The contractor has come up with a demand that the remaining amount should be paid soon. According to the contractor, now the total cost of the work will go up to Rs 134 crore from the original estimate of Rs 129 crore. Of the total eight floors, work for six floors of the civil structure has been completed. But, the government is yet to invite tenders for the mechanical, electrical and plumbing works. The plan is to construct the super specialty block with 14 modern operation theatres and 112 ICU beds. The government has already allotted Rs 285 crore of the overall Rs 378 crore required for the development of the medical college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lack-of-monitoring-impedes-super-specialty-block-work/articleshow/85437710.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

On being questioned, the parents informed the officials that they were afraid to leave the kids by themselves at home lest they hurt themselves accidentally. Stakeholders have repeatedly expressed concerns over children being exploited for cheap labour owing to the protracted closure of schools during the pandemic. A DPI official who visited MM Hills on Wednesday said, “Since there is no school, no midday meals, parents are bringing their children to work, and the kids are working along with them.” He opined that reopening schools, and restarting the midday meal scheme was the best solution to the problem of child labour. Hanur block education officer Swamy TR confirmed that officials from the DPI visited the shrine on Wednesday and warned the parents against engaging their children in work. “Our officials found around two or three children working with their parents. The parents were warned that a police complaint would be lodged if they continued to press their kids for work,” said Swamy, adding that he would visit the area again on Thursday. Mysuru child welfare committee member E Dhananjaya attributed the increased presence of children in the labour force to the closure of schools. “In fact, many children are taking to work against the wishes of their parents. Reopening schools, with all safety measures to prevent an outbreak of Covid-19, is the only solution,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/children-found-working-with-parents-at-mm-hills-shrine/articleshow/85436191.cms||Shrinivasa M

The committee, a whistleblower group, said the university information officer refused to furnish details of the selection process followed by the university for the selection of candidates to the posts of assistant professor. The university authorities, said the committee, rejected the application on the grounds that the lives of selection-panel members would be at risk if the interview score sheet and related documents are given to the applicant. Bindhu was one of the applicants to the assistant professor post and the selection of CPM leader A N Shamseer’s wife by the panel had become a controversy. Following the refusal by the university to part with the documents, the applicant had approached the chief information commission and fetched favourable orders. However, the university again refused to budge, claims the campaign committee. “The university refuses to give the copy of the document as it would corroborate the allegations that Shamseer’s wife was selected out of the way,” it said. The committee had earlier come out against the selection process as the university had included the guide of Shamseer’s wife as the subject expert in the selection committee that interviewed her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/action-sought-against-cu-official-for-suppressing-docus/articleshow/85439621.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals look forward to welcoming back Bangladesh patients||KOLKATA: The resumption of flights from Bangladesh on Sunday may see a spurt in patients from the neighbouring country, who often combine tourism with treatment and account for around 8%-10% of the footfalls in private hospitals across the city. The hospitals are getting ready to welcome them back even as a third Covid wave looms. The return of patients from Bangladesh — even though it could be a slow and gradual one since roads remain shut — will also boost tourism and business in Kolkata, felt those associated with the travel trade. Till the pandemic struck, around 15% of the patients at Peerless Hospital would be from Bangladesh. They contributed 8%-10% of the hospital’s annual revenue. “We received around 40-50 patients from Bangladesh every day, which has dropped to zero now. Once the flights resume, we expect 20-22 patients to visit a day and the number would double once the roads are opened up,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Ruby Hospital has already started processing “visa invitation” forms for Bangladesh patients who have sought treatment based on their medical and travel documents. “We expect only the serious patients, like those suffering from cancer, to visit initially. If more flights operate and roads are opened, the number will rise,” said Subhasish Datta of the hospital. Till early 2020, Bangladesh patients would be around 12% of outpatient and inpatient admissions every day at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS). “When things were settling down after the first wave, the numbers came up to around 40% of pre-pandemic volumes which again slid down considerably after the second wave. Now with flights resuming, we may expect similar numbers which appeared after the first wave. The Mukundapur area is logistically supportive to patients from Bangladesh which helps them,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. AMRI Hospitals that received around 3,000 Bangladeshi patients a month across its three units before the pandemic, expects a rush from the neighbouring country. “Many have deferred their treatment and will now be keen to seek consultations and admissions. We have already processed 300-400 visa invitation forms for Bangladesh patients who will be visiting us next week,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Medica Superspecialty Hospital would receive around 8-10 patients from Bangladesh every day before the pandemic. “They generated around 10% of our annual revenue. Now that flights are resuming, we will definitely accommodate them,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-hospitals-look-forward-to-welcoming-back-bangla-patients/articleshow/85439616.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

He said the government has not initiated any action against the encroachers so far. The survey and the map were submitted by the survey officials to Fort Kochi RDO. He questioned the silence of Thrikkakara MLA P T Thomas on the issue, since most of the encroachments happened in his constituency. “The government has not taken action against the encroachers till date. By proposing to construct a retaining wall by KMRL on the shores of the lake, the government seems to be silently supporting the encroachers all these years,” Cherian said. Environment activist C R Neelakandan said that larges-cale encroachments along the shores of Chilavannoor lake will no doubt destroy the lake in the long run. “The lake is a natural holding pond that takes in rainwater and acts like a buffer against possible floods in the city. The government should have the political will to act tough against the encroachers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/131-encroachments-around-lake-survey/articleshow/85437739.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Health dept focus on in-house diagnostic tests at govt hospitals||Kolkata: The state health department is set to strengthen in-house diagnostic services in government-run hospitals and scale down its dependence on labs run on PPP model. For that, diagnostic tests have been classified into three categories, where a good number of tests have been categorized as “essential”, indicating that these must be done in the in-house lab. Tests like haemoglobin count, blood glucose, LFT, malaria, X-ray of the chest, bone and abdomen have been marked as “essential” for all grades of hospitals — starting from primary health centre to a district hospital. So these tests have to be conducted in hospital labs. According to sources, the state government in the past few months has recruited a good number of medical technologists and technicians. A circular from the health department on Wednesday said the quality of in-house labs has also undergone an impressive change in terms installation of high-end equipment, quality testing kits. “On the basis of the above, the state has decided to switch over from diagnostic services on PPP model gradually and to concentrate on in-house diagnostic services round the clock at state-run hospitals,” states the circular. Even as patients do not have to pay for diagnostic tests conducted in the PPP labs, the government has to reimburse the amount to the agency running the lab. Sources also said that the labs are often far away from the health unit and on many occasions, the quality of test is not good enough. “Why would the state keep depending on private labs when it has enhanced infrastructure, manpower and quality of its in-house labs? This is going to save money and ensure quality diagnostic services. This is a good initiative,” said a doctor working under health service. Apart from essential tests, the rest has been classified into desirable tests and specialized tests. While the first the hospital for which it is categorized as desirable is expected to provide the service depending on available logistics and specialized tests are high end tests to be conducted as select facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-dept-focus-on-in-house-diagnostic-tests-at-govt-hospitals/articleshow/85439627.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kochi||Kerala PCB reluctant to put information in public domain, says study||KOCHI: A majority of India’s pollution control agencies remain closed entities when it comes to sharing information with the public. A new rating study by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has found that a mere handful of India’s pollution control boards (PCBs) and authorities are adequately putting out environmental and governance information into the public domain through their websites. Odisha, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh boards have been rated as the most transparent among 35 such organisations studied. The Kerala state pollution control board (KSPCB) does not perform well in many of the 25 parameters that were used to measure their transparency in a five-year period of 2016-2020. However, it has a total score of 56.3%, with the toppers — Odisha and Telangana — at 67%, followed by Tamil Nadu at 65%. “Kerala PCB does not put out its orders against polluting industries in the public domain. As for its annual reports, we didn’t see any online, except 2013-14,” said Shreya Verma, programme officer-CSE and author of the study. “For this study, CSE collected data from two sources — websites of SPCBs/PCCs and their annual reports. A few key indicators used in the study include the availability of information on direction/show-cause/closure notices issued by boards, information on public hearings and EIA reports, non-attainment cities and polluted river stretches, etc,” she said. One of these functions under Section17(C) of the Air and Water Acts is to collect and disseminate information related to air and water pollution and also about its prevention, control or abatement. The law asks the boards to share the data in the public domain. But this is rarely done in practice. Most boards have been protective of industries polluting the environment. Of the 35 SPCBs, only five — J&K, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttarakhand and West Bengal — have shared soft copies of directions and show-cause/closure notices issued on their websites. Only five boards — Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Tripura and Uttarakhand — have shared minutes of their board meetings on their websites. Nine SPCBs/PCCs — Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Goa and Mizoram — have provided detailed information on public hearings, which includes the executive summary, draft EIA report of the project, and minutes of the meeting. However, Kerala PCB scored good points for displaying their CEMS data. The study found huge laxity in sharing information on solid waste. “The study also found a lack of uniformity in displaying data. For instance, all surveyed SPCBs/ PCCs have different website formats, which makes accessing information quite difficult. Similarly, there is no format for annual reports. Hence the information available varies from board to board,” Verma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-pcb-reluctant-to-put-info-in-public-domain-study/articleshow/85439637.cms||---

Ronak Patel, with the help of others, was able to nab one of the two accused who had allegedly carried out the loot at Rameshkumar Ambalal angadia firm. The accused who was caught was identified as Jatin Patel, a resident of Bavla. The other accused, Ronak Chudasama who is a resident of Rajkot, managed to escape. Narrating the incident, complainant Govind Patel (55), who is employed with the angadia firm, said that two unidentified persons came to the firm and asked him if they had received the cash meant for them. Before Patel could realize that something was off, one of the accused allegedly pulled out a knife and asked for the money while the other tied him up with cloth lying around in the firm. The two grabbed Rs 7 lakh in cash kept in the drawer. They also seized Patel’s mobile phone and the DVR of the CCTV system. According to the complaint, Patel tried to shout for help but the two threatened him with dire consequences. Before fleeing, the accused allegedly locked the glass door and downed the shutter to keep Patel from escaping. Meanwhile, Patel somehow freed himself and opened the glass door with the help of a screw driver. He managed to open the shutter and run out when he saw that a crowd had gathered in the vicinity. When he rushed to the spot, he found that people had caught hold of one of the accused involved the robbery. Ronak Patel, a trader who also works in a tiles showroom nearby, saw the two men running with a bag and a DVR and grew suspicious. He nabbed one of them, but the other accused managed to escape. The Sola police have registered a case and are investigating it further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/alert-trader-foils-rs-7l-robbery-in-gota/articleshow/85439623.cms||---

Junior classes are set to resume from August 23 while primary classes will reopen from September 1. As per SOPs, only schools with high enrolment will be allowed to run in two shifts while others will have to conduct classes in one shift only. Schools have been asked to avoid functions and celebration of festivals where physical distancing is not possible. Proper sanitization will have to be undertaken before and after the school. The government has directed Schools to allow students to study from home if their parents are not willing to send them to school. Follow-up on the progress of learning outcomes of all such students should be planned appropriately by schools. Releasing the SOPs, the basic education department asked schools to discourage awards and incentives for attendance. During admission to new classes, only parents/guardians will be consulted and children will not be required to accompany them as far as possible. At least 6 feet distance should be maintained between students and if there are single-seater desks, schools will have to provide 6ft space between them. Similarly, physical/social distancing will have to be maintained in staff rooms, office, and common area. In case a classroom is small, classes may be held in rooms with more space like computer room, library, laboratory etc where physical distancing is possible. No event should be undertaken where physical distancing is not possible. However, school assembly may be conducted in classrooms or halls or outdoors under guidance of class teacher. Prior to reopening, schools will have to collect a self-declaration from students, parents and teachers regarding their health condition and recent inter-state or foreign travel. Schools must display posters, messagesand signages at appropriate places reminding students about physical distancing on campus. Total ban on spitting has to be enforced on campus, the SOPs said. On sanitization front, schools will have to ensure thorough cleaning of campus and disinfecting of furniture, equipment and all parts of the campus and ensure air flow in indoor spaces. No student should be involved in cleanliness drive and schools have been asked to ensure water, sanitation and waste management facilities along with compliance of cleaning and decontamination procedures. As per the SOPs, schools must ensure proper handwashing facilities and availability of thermometers, disinfectants and soap. The SOPs also directs schools to ensure sanitization of school transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-issues-sops-for-schools-resuming-primary-jr-classes/articleshow/85441822.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana workers back home from Afghanistan face uncertainty||HYDERABAD: They served in a hostile atmosphere putting their lives at risk. But having been forced to return from Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover, hundreds of workers from Telangana stare at a bleak future. Many of them from India and other countries were assisting the NATO troops in the camps. Initially, the journey back home had begun in an orderly fashion before it disintegrated into chaos once the Taliban drove into Kabul. In June, at least 30 men from Velpur village in Nizamabad, who served in the NATO and US military camps, were sent back as the US had begun its withdrawal. While these men reached home easily, the life ahead for them and others now waiting for that ticket home is likely to be anything but easy. But long before these men, some had ended their Afghan adventure and returned home. It was risky in war-torn Afghanistan, but they soon found it wasn’t a cakewalk at home either. Ramesh Gandhepally from Jankampet village in Velpur, who had returned home in 2018, had put all his money into 30 borewells. All failed. Though he is able to eke out a living from his land now, it’s not enough, he said. Recalling the seven years he spent at the largest camp at Bagram airbase, Ramesh said: “We did not know anything about life outside the camp. If we had to go to some other camp, we were ferried in a chopper.” Similar is the fate of P Srinivas from the same village who called it quits in 2020 after eight years at the Bagram base. The 45-year-old, a commerce graduate, wants the government to help people like him. “We should be helped with jobs, loans or any means to earn a decent livelihood,” Srinivas said. “We lived in constant fear of Taliban attack. Being away from family and cut of from outside world in the camp really frustrated me. So I came back. But I don’t think I have a future here without help,” Srinivas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-workers-back-home-from-af-face-uncertainty/articleshow/85441826.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The track has been in a dilapidated condition for the past several years due to lack of proper maintenance. TOI had carried a series of reports demanding reconstruction of the synthetic track. The higher education department has issued order allotting the amount. “The PWD has already prepared the detailed project report (DPR) for the reconstruction of the synthetic track. With the government allotting the funds, we will be able to start the works without much delay. A committee comprising people’s representatives, old students’ association and other stakeholders will monitor the work,” said Maharaja’s College principal Mathew George. “The support from the media, old students and people’s representatives was instrumental. The higher education directorate and the state government have been proactive to the request by us,” he said. Last month, sports minister sports minister V Abdurahiman had visited the college ground and promised measures to reconstruct the synthetic track. There were efforts by the Kerala Sport Council to take over the synthetic track from Maharaja’s College. The sports council offered to maintain the ground with the support of private partners. But old students and college authorities objected to the proposal citing that the move will lead to alienation of the sporting asset. Private partnership may result in the public losing opportunity for using the track. At the same time, the Rs 8 crore which the government decided to allot to the college as compensation for the land taken over for the Metro station is yet to be dispensed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-allots-funds-for-synthetic-track/articleshow/85437767.cms||---

Uttam Kumar Sarkar, who took charge on Wednesday, has been associated with the institute for two-and-a-half decades. Sarkar succeeds Anju Seth who resigned in rather unfortunate circumstances in March following irreconcilable differences with the institute’s board of directors and members of the faculty. Dean of external relations Prashant Mishra has been heading the institute in the interim period. Unlike Seth, who was at the Pamplin College of Business at Virginia Tech before joining IIM-C in 2018, Sarkar has been a faculty member at the institute in three stints — first between 1997 and 2000, then 2002 to 2006 and finally from 2008 onwards. He has been teaching management information systems. Between 2015 and 2018, he was also dean of new initiatives and external relations at the institute. Sarkar has also been a visiting professor at the University of Miami, Florida. Between 1990 and 1995, he was lecturer in the department of computer science and engineering at Jadavpur University. An alumnus of Ramakrishna Mission Residential College Narendrapur, he did his BTech, MTech and PhD in computer science and engineering from IIT Kharagpur. He is a leading researcher in the field of information systems with numerous publications in prestigious international journals to his credit. Congratulating Sarkar, IIM-C board of governors chairperson Shrikrishna Kulkarni said, “Professor Sarkar knows IIM Calcutta intimately, its history, culture and the aspirations of its large body of faculty, students, alumni, staff, board, and all stakeholders. Moreover, he is aware of what needs to be done and how it must be done to help IIM Calcutta achieve its global aspirations.” Sarkar said it was a happy moment for IIM Calcutta fraternity. “The institute is poised to take a big leap forward towards excellence. It’s an honour to take the leadership position of this great institute,” he added. His task is cut out to guide the institute forward after the rather tumultuous tenure of Seth who departed almost a year before her tenure was to end. She had put in her papers in March-end in the backdrop of a full-blown confrontation between her and the chairperson of IIM-C. Tensions had first stirred in December when over 75% of the faculty wrote to the education secretary, expressing grave concerns about the state of affairs at the institute citing Seth’s “arbitrary and discriminatory” style of functioning and alleged she had “a very narrow vision”. The matter had escalated on March 4, after the board of governors at IIM-C passed a resolution against Seth and divested her of the powers to make appointments and take disciplinary action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iim-c-fills-directors-post-after-5-months-with-a-faculty-member/articleshow/85439636.cms||---

Some jails in the state have been overcrowded up to four times their capacity. To decongest prisons across the country, the Supreme Court had in March last year asked states to identify prisoners who could be released on interim bail. But by March this year, about 90% of them were back in prison. The apex court stepped in again and asked states to release those who had come back. So, in May, UP released 2,474 inmates from its jails as the second wave of the pandemic peaked. Now, with the Covid situation not relenting, UP has extended the special parole granted to these prisoners — by 90 days for 1,018 convicts and by 60 days for 1,456 — releasing on Wednesday the ones who had come back. The latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data show that UP reported the highest overcrowding among states in 2019, at 167.9%, second only to Delhi across the country (174.9%). Against a capacity of 60,340, UP’s prisons were holding 1,01,297 prisoners — the highest in the country. When Covid hit, it was going to be a challenge. Even after Wednesday’s releases, prisons remain filled beyond capacity. In Moradabad, for instance, the district jail has a capacity of 717. But it holds 3,300 convicts — over four and a half times what it can. The special parole has been granted to 102 inmates, still leaving the jail with 2,481 more prisoners than it can hold. In Lakhimpur Kheri, similarly, the 650-capacity jail has over 1,800 inmates. “Many Nepalese citizens are also incarcerated here after being arrested for smuggling narcotic substances across the India-Nepal border,” jail superintendent PP Singh said. And in Shahjahanpur, 1,350 inmates are taking up a space meant for 511. The jail is in the heart of the city and a proposal to relocate it has been accepted but land has not been identified yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/jails-overcrowded-up-to-4-times-up-extends-parole-for-2500-prisoners/articleshow/85433935.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The deceased was identified as Vijin Kumar, son of Valsan of Thekkinezhath, Ezhikkara. North Paravur police said the death was prima facie, a case of suicide. According to police, he had gone to his home on Tuesday late evening and left for his studio, saying that he had to do some pending work. “Although a relative went to the studio late at night, he saw light inside the studio and went back thinking that he was working. Around 3am, he again went to look for him and found him dead, hanging in the studio,” said an officer with the North Paravur police station. According to police, he had told his relatives about facing financial difficulties recently and this is suspected to have made him take the extreme step. The exact cause of the death, however, can be confirmed only after the autopsy, said the officer. Body was handed over to the kin after an autopsy. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/photographer-found-hanging-at-his-studio/articleshow/85437846.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation builds vaccine buffer on first dose-second dose demand gap||KOLKATA: There has been a sudden drop in demand for Covishield second doses, but the Kolkata Municipal Corporation health department has decided to keep ready a buffer stock for second-dose recipients. The demand is expected to rise from next week, when the second-dose schedule for recipients in the 18-44 age group is likely to come up. After witnessing a low turnout of recipients of second doses following the introduction of the new vaccination schedule from Monday, the KMC health department senior officials on Wednesday decided to keep aside a significant portion of Covishield second doses at vaccination clinics and mega centres, where the demand is expected to rise from next week. Most of recipients in the 18-plus age group will be scheduled for their second shots around that time “Based on the feedback from the KMC vaccination clinics at the ward levels and from mega centres, we have taken a conscious decision to keep a portion of the stock reserved for second-dose recipients, demand from whom is expected to rise from next week,” said a KMC health department official. At the same time, the civic body has decided to experiment with the vaccination schedule afresh, fixing Wednesdays and Saturdays as vaccination days for recipients of second dose and Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays for recipients of first dose. However, this change is temporary and the vaccination schedule may again get altered next week, depending on the demand for the second dose, said a civic official. According to a KMC medical officer, who has been assigned to look after vaccination at a Covishield clinic located in Tollygunge after the introduction of the new civic vaccination schedule from Monday—alternate days for first and second doses—the number of recipients of the second dose in the past two days had barely stood at 60. But, the KMC medical officer said, he was expecting a surge in the demand for a second doses once the fresh group of 18-plus recipients joined the vaccination queue at his clinic from next week onwards. “Going by the vaccination record of my clinic, I have reasons to believe that we will need to keep a good stock of vaccines for recipients of second dose for next few weeks as the demand is likely to rise from next week,” the civic official said. At the KMC-run vaccination mega centres, the recipients of Covishield first dose has outnumbered the second dose recipients. For example, while the number of recipients of the first dose at Bhawanipur Education Society on Tuesday stood at 430, the number of second dose recipients on Wednesday didn’t exceed 110. But, once the second dose demand soared, the mega centres will need to tackle a heavy rush, felt a KMC health department senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-builds-vaccine-buffer-on-1st-dose-2nd-dose-demand-gap/articleshow/85439723.cms||Saikat Ray

Cops later traced the call to a mentally unstable youth residing in Bongaon’s Kandupur in North 24 Parganas. The youth made two calls to the Air India office — one at 6.50pm when he threatened to hijack a plane belonging to the airline, and again at 7.15pm when he apologised for the earlier call. Though additional security measures including ladder-point hand-luggage checks and frisking are being carried out before passengers board the aircraft due to the heightened alert around Independence Day, the authorities still decided to search an AI flight that was stationed in the apron area. Luckily, boarding had not yet commenced for the Delhi-bound flight. However, nothing was found in the plane. The flight though was delayed due to the incident. The caller’s parents said he was prone to making calls and getting into trouble. However, cops decided not to act against him after verifying his mental condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hijack-call-to-ai-puts-police-on-toes/articleshow/85439700.cms||---

So far, eight rock painting sites were identified in the hillocks. The stone formations, spread all over the place, look like natural carvings with unique shapes. Historian Sriramoju Haragopal said, “This area is under threat due to mining. These petroglyphs belong to the Pakal basin. They are 54 crore to 250 crore years old. These rocks are 6000 metre thick. They extend from Telangana to Madhya Pradesh in the Godavari and Pranahita valleys and in the north-western and south-eastern parts of Maharashtra.” Former deputy director general, Geological Survey of India, Chakilam Venugopal Rao said, “The middle, late Proterozoic rocks exposed in the Pranahita-Godavari valley are termed as Pakal basin. These are divisible into three groups —Pakhal super group, Penganga and Sullavai groups. Each group is distinct in lithological character and angular unconformity separates each group in ascending order.” These are touristic attractions and repositories of human culture, rock art, ancient rock shelters and much more. “The area merits the attention of state and central government agencies, particularly ASI and GSI, to study the area and to protect the suitable sites as monuments,” Venugopal Rao added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandavalagutta-under-threat/articleshow/85441892.cms||---

Dixit scaled the Elbrus peak (5,642 meters), situated in the western part of Caucasus Mountains in Russia, amidst adverse weather conditions on August 15. Dixit had earlier climbed the highest peak in Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro in 2020. He now wants to complete the task of climbing seven summits consisting of the highest point on each of the seven continents. Dixit has also set his eyes on mount Aconcagua, which is in Argentina and is South America’s highest peak. Talking to TOI, from Russia after getting down from the peak, Dixit said, “It fills my heart with utmost pleasure to hoist the country’s flag on the 75th year of Independence in Europe. Three other cops from other states had also gone with me to scale the peak but due to adverse weather conditions and ill health they could not complete the expedition,” he said. Dixit further said it was not easy to withstand minus 20-degree Celsius temperature with winds blowing above 60 km/hr during the trekking of the Elbrus peak. “It requires grit and passion to carry yourself in inclement weather conditions,” he added. The cop started this climb on August 11night and by August 15 he was on the top. Thereafter it took him two days to return. It was my dream to climb all top peaks in the seven continents of the world. “I had joined the NCC where I was trained for trekking and gradually started with Indian peaks in Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir,” he said. Hailing from Unnao district, life has never been a bed of roses for Dixit, whose father died when he was very young.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-police-ats-commando-scales-europes-mt-elbrus/articleshow/85441906.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

With this, all three administrative units in the district — the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas and the rural belt — have the same relaxations. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had on August 15 said the rural areas should also follow the relaxations along with two civic areas. All the relaxations in Maharashtra which are applicable in the PMC and PCMC areas, are in place in the rural areas as well. Like in the city areas, all shops, malls and restaurants in the rural areas will now operate till 10pm. The new directives also allowed people to travel by local trains 14 days after getting both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Wednesday said directives have been issued following the deputy CM’s order. “It was decided on Saturday that the rural areas will follow the Level 3 restrictions. But after assessing the situation on Sunday, the rural areas were granted the same relaxation because the weekly positvity rate was less that 5%,” he said. The Pune rural areas registered a 4.9% weekly positivity rate, 0.6% less than 5.5% during the August 5-11 week. The rural areas were kept in the Level 4 of the restrictions in the last two to three weeks due to the high positivity rate.The district registered a 3.8% weekly positivity rate for the period between August 5 and 11, lowest in the past seven months and 0.9% less than the preceding week’s 4.7%. The weekly positivity rates of the PMC and PCMC areas were 2.5% and 3.7%, respectively.A government official said the next weekly review meeting on the Covid situation in the district would be conducted either on Friday or Saturday. But any change in the restrictions was unlikely, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-area-residents-can-now-enjoy-same-ease-as-urban-counterparts/articleshow/85439789.cms||---

The panel also approved work order for laying oxygen pipeline and executing civil works at the cost of Rs87.3 lakh at the Paediatric Covid Hospital which will take at least two months for completion. Chairman of standing committee Prakash Bhoyar told TOI that corporator Sangeeta Girhe from ward no. 11 requested for carrying out works in layouts under NIT using unspent funds of Mangalwari Zone. “Majority of areas in the ward are under NIT and lacking basic amenities. Also, people facing serious inconvenience have lodged complaints with the corporator. Therefore, approval has been given as a special case,” he said. Bhoyar said that the same decision will not be implemented in other parts of the city. Congress corporator Sandip Sahare said it is a wrong and biased decision. “When NMC is not able to execute basic works in its areas, spending money on layouts under NIT is unjustified. Such decision should also be taken for many wards having NIT layouts,” he said. Majority of layouts under NIT’s jurisdiction are not sanctioned and it never spends money on areas under NMC. On Paediatric Covid Hospital, Bhoyar said that the work order will be issued immediately. The 200-bed hospital is being constructed as a part of preparations for third wave of Covid-19 pandemic. According to Bhoyar, right from equipment to oxygen plant, everything has been donated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). “NMC has to execute civil works and lay down oxygen pipeline. Directives have been given to complete works within two months,” he said. The hospital is being developed on first, second and third floors of NU’s new building on Ambazari lake road. In another decision, the committee approved Rs2.9 crore for executing interior works at proposed e-library at Lal School, Geetanjali Chowk. Notably, the civic body is yet to provide funds for a couple of e-libraries developed some years ago. NMC sources said that mayor Dayashankar Tiwari has proposed the project that will come up in his ward. Bhoyar said the project was need of the hour but ruled out similar approvals for other wards. The committee also approved work order of Rs1.99 crore to Bajaj Innovations for reparing potholes using Road Instta Patcher Machine. The panel chief said that NMC’s hotmix plant is not working up to the capacity. “Potholes cannot be repaired with hotmix during rains. Instta Patcher Machine is a new technology and will be helpful in filling potholes, especially in rains,” he said. --------------------------------------- Other decisions * Procuring two high flow suction machines at the cost of Rs80.8 lakh to clear sewage lines blockages * Four-month extension to retired NMC engineer Mohammed Israil for coordination of Nag River Rejuvenation Project * Civil works in ward no. 25, 24, 4, 23 and 1 ------------------------------ Only 3,360 potholes in city: NMC Nagpur: Chairman of NMC standing committee Prakash Bhoyar on Wednesday claimed that there were only 3,360 potholes in the city. He also said target was to repair them using new technology and NMC’s hotmix department. Activist Anil Wadpalliwar told TOI that there could be 3,360 potholes in just one ward. NMC spends crores of rupees every year for repairing potholes and roads but the situation is same every year during and post-monsoon. Despite Union minister for road transport and highways is city’s MP, the situation has not improved. NHAI should take over all roads from the NMC,” he said. A few days ago, the civic body claimed it had repaired 5,465 potholes in the last eight months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-layouts-in-1-ward-to-gain-from-nmc-largesse/articleshow/85439799.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya seer files plaint against Trust over nazul land deal||Ayodhya: Mahant Dharam Das, the seer of Hanuman Garhi temple in Ayodhya, has filed a police complaint against Ram Mandir Trust secretary Champat Rai, all trustees, MLA Deep Narayan Upadhyay, Ayodhya mayor’s nephew Rishikesh Upadhyay and sub-registrar of Faizabad tehsil for criminal conspiracy, fraud and misusing the funds donated by devotees of Lord Ram in buying nazul land. Dharam Das is the disciple of late Mahant Ram Abhiram Das, who had reportedly placed the idols inside the disputed structure on December 22 midnight in 1949. Das, a prominent face of Ram Mandir Movement and one of the main litigants from Hindu side in the Ram Janmabhoomi title suit, lodged a complaint at Ram Janmabhoomi police station. He has accused the members of temple trust of criminal conspiracy, fraud and misuse of funds donated for Ram temple construction. Das has also named Faizabad sub-registrar S B Singh as accused. He said, “Was the office of sub-registrar not aware that ‘nazul’ land was sold twice. Mahant Devendra Prasadacharya had sold this plot of 676 sq mt to Deep Narayan, nephew of Ayodhya mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay, for Rs 20 lakh in February. Deep Narayan sold it to the trust for Rs 2.5 crore in May. The value of this land, as per DM circle rate, is approximately Rs 35 lakh.” He also named BJP MLA from Gosaiganj (Ayodhya) Indra Pratap Tiwari and trustee Anil Mishra for being witnesses in the deal. He demanded sacking of Rai as secretary and handing over responsibilities of the trust to seers of Ayodhya. “The government should not get involved in temple construction,” said Das. No trustee reacted on the development, though Prakash Gupta, the in-charge of camp office, said, “If it is nazul land, complaint should have been filed with nazul officers, not police. We bought land and paid money, where is corruption in this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-seer-files-plaint-against-trust-over-nazul-land-deal/articleshow/85441915.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The women sugar cane cutters had gathered in Beed on the appeal of Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch (MKAM), which has been consistently raising the issues of discrimination, bias and exploitation of women farm workers in 24 states of the country. Members of MKAM, along with the women workers, pledged to unanimously strive and take steps to not only get equal pay and social security, but also get health facilities from the sugar cane companies and contractors hiring these workers for their services. On Wednesday, they started enrolling women sugar cane cutters and workers from different villages so that they could come handy for getting majority of them registered in accordance to the latest GR with respective gram panchayats. Activist Seema Kulkarni, member of core team and national facilitation team, told TOI, “Women farm workers continue to remain amongst the most exploited of the workers in the country. They are exploited socially, psychologically, physically, financially as well as sexually.” During the meeting, women sugar cane cutters narrated their tales of woes to the members of the manch and also how the contractors even lock them daily so that they do not flee away from the sugar cane cutting sites due to sexual as well as financial exploitation. Beed-based member of the manch Manisha Tokle said, “Beed district has several lakh sugar cane cutters, of which, half are women. Despite they working shoulder-to-shoulder, in over 90% cases, their husbands or male members of the families collect all their wages from the contractor.”  Members of the manch have set a target to get majority of the women sugar cane cutters in another two months as post October, they travel hundreds of kilometres while cutting sugar cane and return home only six months later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/women-cane-cutters-pledge-to-join-hands-for-equal-pay-social-security/articleshow/85437906.cms||Mohammed Akhef

She said that her party stood with tribals for podu cultivation rights. Sharmila, who held a ‘podu deeksha’ in Lingala village of Tadwai mandal in Mulugu district, alleged that the TRS government was going to sell podu land to corporate giants. She said that while former CM of united AP, the late Y S Rajashekhara Reddy, had given rights to 3.31 lakh tribals on podu land, CM KCR had been behaving like a new Nizam since Telangana was created to deny tribals their rights. She said that TRS government was encouraging attacks by forest staff and foisting illegal cases on tribals for podu land cultivation. The YSRTP chief accused the state government of taking back all podu land from the tribals in the name of ‘Haritha Haram’. Taking a dig at KCR for launching Dalit Bandhu scheme in poll-bound Huzurabad, Sharmila said that the CM would have given pattas for podu land too had there been an election in tribal areas.

---||Aurangabad||With 400 crore monthly losses, Maharashtra State Road Transportation Corporation struggles to pay staff salaries||AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra State Road Transportation Corporation (MSRTC) has at present suffered bleeding monthly losses to the tune of Rs 400 crore, posing difficulties in even crediting monthly salaries of its over 97,000 staffers. While MSRTC workforce usually receives salary on seventh day of every month, none of the employees and staffers claimed to have received monthly pay for July till Wednesday. “The state transportation has monthly expenditure of Rs 700 crore against the depleted income in the range of Rs 290 crore to Rs 300 crore. Even if the Covid-related curbs are relaxed considerably now, the passenger movement is yet nowhere near the pre-Covid times, causing huge losses,” MSRTC spokesperson said on Wednesday. While the state transportation had introduced special cargo service in May 2019 to boost the revenue during the current pandemic, the initiative could fetch only around Rs 65 crore for the loss-making state transportation. Almost a year after a formal announcement, the MSRTC has failed to come up with fuel stations on its available lands at key places across Maharashtra, including six in Marathwada, as an alternative measure to boost the revenue. “We required different NOCs from the respective district administration and other government departments for allowing oil companies to start fuel stations. Out of 30 such proposals, we could achieve such NOCs only for Dhule so far,” MSRTC spokesperson said. Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress, meanwhile, has demanded financial aid worth Rs 600 crore from the state government for releasing salaries of staffers. “The Covid-19 outbreak has wreaked havoc for MSRTC as it has suffered revenue loss to the tune of Rs 7,000 crore towards passenger movement since March 2020. While staff salaries for January to June could take place due to help from the government only, we demand another such aid for releasing salaries for July now,” union leader Shrirang Barge said. Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts to contact. Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress, citing its discussion with the minister of state for transport Satej Patil, has said that the state government was expected to offer another helping hand to MSRTC shortly. The MSRTC spokesperson, however, said that salaries for July are least likely to get credited anytime soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/with-400cr-monthly-losses-msrtc-struggles-to-pay-staff-salaries/articleshow/85437946.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Malpractices flagged as early as 2015-2016 in Karuvannur Service Cooperative Bank||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The cooperation department’s audit division had been flagging serious irregularities and malpractices in the Karuvannur Service Cooperative Bank since the annual audit of 2015-16, it is learnt. However, no corrective action was initiated until the skeletons began tumbling out of the closet. The cooperation department had, on August 11, suspended 16 of its audit wing officials on the basis of an inquiry into the irregularities in the bank. A comparison by TOI of the interim report submitted by the nine member inquiry committee and the audit reports of the last five years shows that most of the observations in the interim report were there in the audit reports too. Two major observations in the 2015-16 audit report were enough to prove that all wasn’t well in the bank. The bank’s credit-deposit ratio, which should never go beyond 75%, was found to be 98% and the savings bank accounts of its employees were showing negative balance. While the first observation showed that loans were being indiscriminately given, the second showed that the employees were drawing more money than what they had in their accounts. The 2017-18 audit report found that the bank had lent loans heavily outside its permitted area of operation, a violation of cooperation acts and rules. In March alone, a large number of loans were disbursed without proper reports, including the legal reports on the loan applications. This has been explained clearly in the interim report too. It was also found that interests usually offered to individual senior citizens were being given to several institutions, another violation of law. In the 2019-20 audit, the auditors had flagged loans being offered by flouting all norms posing a serious threat to the very existence of the bank. As many as 24 loan confirmation documents sent to the customers returned unable to locate the addressees, thereby unable to take any legal action against them. The probe committee, meanwhile, found that after giving membership to people outside the area of operation, the bank did not maintain their identity proofs. From this it can be inferred that such memberships, against which huge loans were granted, were fake. As per rules, for providing membership and loan, the person should be a permanent resident within the area of operation of the bank or should own a property there. While the rules say that the property on which the loans are sanctioned needs to be evaluated, records show that loans were disbursed beyond permissible limits (a maximum of Rs 50 lakh for an individual) and for this the property value was accordingly corrected. This means that loans exceeding the limits were given without proper evaluation of the property. Worse still, such loans were granted multiple times over the same property. Also, discrepancies were found in the signatures of the applicants in the various loan documents, showing that the applicants were bogus. The committee also found that a team functioning under a bank member, Kiran, was engaged in locating people, property, preparing the Gehan, evaluating the property for estimating the loan amount etc. As many as 52 loans, totalling Rs 215.71 crore, were sanctioned by mortgaging eight different properties and a share from each of these went into the account of Kiran, it was found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/malpractices-flagged-as-early-as-2015-16/articleshow/85439843.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Aurangabad||AMC owns up tree-cutting at Savangi dam||Aurangabad: A day after TOI carried a report on indiscriminate tree cutting at Savangi dam in Aurangabad district, civic authorities on Wednesday visited the site to take stock of the situation. After the visit, garden superintendent at Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Vijay Patil said the trees in question were axed by the civic body only for the purpose of structural security of the lake. “The water supply department had requested for cutting of trees on the embankment areas. The authorities concerned said that the roots of trees could weaken the wall of the dam,” he said. The civic authorities said only some trees were cut at Savangi dam. “Our local staffers have not axed all the trees, but those only found to have posing threats were removed,” Patil said. Conservationists, however, have questioned the rationale behind such tree-cutting stating that some other earthen dams from the region have trees on embankments. “It needs to be seen whether the proposal for cutting these trees was formally passed by the local tree authority of AMC. Such a process, if followed, could ensure weighing of pros and cons before carrying out such indiscriminate cutting of trees,” Honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak said. Pathak, who is also a bird-researcher, said trees located in and around dams provide much needed roosting and nesting habitats for different winged creatures. Located in the immediate vicinity of Aurangabad, Savangi dam has reported sighting of some rarely found birds in recent past, including turtle dove and red-necked falcon, besides being the home for a host of migratory and resident birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-owns-up-tree-cutting-at-savangi-dam/articleshow/85437966.cms||---

Steps have been taken to ensure social distancing at the offices of the returning officers, mustering centres and polling booths. The authorities have decided to permit political gatherings with only 100 members, and to use video cameras to keep tabs on maintaining Covid guidelines properly during such gatherings. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said, “We have decided to intensify action against violation of Covid norms. Sanitizer will be provided at offices of the returning officers and AROs. We will take extra care to ensure social distancing.” “Using video cameras, all political gatherings will be recorded, and we will initiate stern action and also file cases if norms are violated,” he added. According to sources, the district administration is said to have assured to sanction video cameras to record all political gatherings. Itnal said political events have gained momentum. “While issuing permission through a single-window system, strict instructions were given to political parties to adhere strictly to Covid guidelines,” he said. Ramesh S, a social activist, said the authorities should not neglect Covid measures yielding to any kind of political pressure. “After a bypoll in Belagavi for a parliamentary constituency recently, the spread of Covid was rampant which resulted in a lockdown.

He was welcomed by his wife Sumana, daughter Hanishka and friends Lokesh Ankadakatte, Abhishek and Prakash. With them he proceeded to Kundapur. Sumana, an anganwadi teacher, told TOI: “The release of my husband would not have been possible without the support of several people and organisations. When I first heard that my husband was arrested, it was as if the world had come to an end, and I had almost lost hopes of seeing him again. Initially, we did not have much support. However, once the Facebook report came, and a case was filed, I was confident that justice would prevail. It has been a difficult phase, emotionally and financially and in the beginning it was difficult to even speak to my husband over the phone. However, gradually, I was allowed to speak to him once a week. I will not allow him to leave behind his family and travel abroad again. We now need support to start a new life,” said Sumana. Recollecting the challenges, she said: “After giving birth to our daughter, I gave up my job to look after her. But once my husband was in trouble, I had to look for a job and manage everything on my own.” Harish Bangera, resident of Goyadibettu in Beejadi village, Kundapur, was an air-conditioning technician for a company in Dammam. He was arrested for allegedly posting derogatory messages on Facebook against Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammad bin Salman and a community. Last year, the Udupi district police had filed a chargesheet in connection with the arrest of two brothers for hacking the social media account of Harish and posting provocative posts. Dr Ravindranath Shanbhag, president, Human Rights Protection Foundation, Udupi, who also worked on this case said all the documents had to be translated from Kannada to English and Arabic. Harish was working in Saudi Arabia for nearly six years, visited his home town on January 4, 2019, and returned on May 4, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/udupi-man-arrested-in-saudi-arabia-returns-home/articleshow/85436395.cms||---
---||Mumbai||1993 riot accused let off: He ‘may’ve been a bystander’||MUMBAI: Twenty-eight years after a now 62-year-old man was accused of being part of a mob of around 400 hurling stones, soda bottles and fireballs at each other during communal riots in the city, a sessions court acquitted him after observing that even if it’s assumed that he was on the spot, it is possible he was just an innocent bystander. The court found that except for the formal witnesses— two cops part of the probe and a panch—who deposed about seizure of articles from the spot, there was nothing to indicate the complicity of the accused, Rashid Khan. “There is no independent witness to identify the accused. True, it is is difficult to find witnesses after so long. It is true the mob comprised 300-400 people and it is difficult to ascertain who actively participated in vandalising the property. No specific act is attributed to the accused,” it said. The court said that the benefit of doubt goes in Khan’s favour. “There is nothing on record to suggest that the accused actively participated in the unlawful assembly. Though accused is apprehended from the spot, but there is no identification parade. Considering the totality of the evidence tendered in the case, there is nothing to suggest the complicity of the accused,” the court said. Khan was untraceable for decades and finally arrested in December 2020. He pleaded ‘not guilty’ before the court. During the cross-examination by the defence, a cop who was part of the patrolling duty, denied the suggestion that due to police firing to disperse the mob, one person was injured and to hush up the matter, a false case was registered. The prosecution’s case was that on January 12, 1993, when the police were on patrolling duty in Dinbandhu Nagar, Wadala (east), Mumbai, around 3.15am, they saw a mob of about 300 to 400 people engaged in throwing stones and hurling soda bottles at each other. The constable warned the crowd to disperse, however, the mob of people was uncontrollable and started getting aggressive. It was further alleged that the people who were part of the crowd were also throwing burning balls and tubelights at one another. The prosecution said that to control the mob, cops used lathis but they (the mob) became more aggressive. Finally, police personnel fired in the air. The prosecution said that in the rush, one person suffered bullet injuries and subsequently died. The police apprehended 15 people from the mob and they were brought to the police station. The accused were booked under the charge of ‘attempt to murder’. In a separate trial, 10 accused were acquitted in 2003. Four others are still untraceable. The cops, in their deposition, identified the picture of the accused but accepted that at the time of the investigation, no identification parade or confrontation of the accused had been conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/93-riot-accused-let-off-he-mayve-been-a-bystander/articleshow/85443065.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Aurangabad||4 flying squads to check on excess admissions in Jr colleges||Aurangabad: A section of junior colleges in and around Aurangabad will not be able to carry out admissions in excess to their sanctioned capacity and regularise the same by seeking additional students division at the eleventh hour. The office of deputy director of education has decided to form flying squads to detect whether junior colleges have admitted excess students over and above their sanctioned intake for the academic year 2021-22. “Four flying squads will be formed under the aegis of education officer (Secondary) to scrutinize admissions in junior colleges. These squads will pay visits to colleges to verify sanctioned intake capacity and stream-wise admitted students. The colleges violating intake capacity will face action,” deputy director of education Anil Sable said. Stating that his office will not entertain any proposal for increasing the intake directly, Sable said such proposals must be routed through a proper channel. “Such proposal will be accepted only if other colleges situated in the periphery of 10 km complete admissions against the intake capacity,” he added. Stating that no proposals for sanctioning new divisions will be accepted directly at the eleventh hour, authorities have asserted that colleges will be solely responsible if students fail to appear for HSC exams. The set of instructions to this effect, which has been issued in the wake of Aurangabad getting excluded from the Centralised Admission Process (CAP), has been welcomed by many stakeholders. “There is a need for imbibing more discipline in the admission process at the level of junior colleges. A section of junior colleges try to create pressure on authorities in twisting the process for their benefit at the cost of interests of other colleges and students at large,” student activist Tukaram Saraf said. With no CAP in place, the college-level admission process for junior colleges in Aurangabad has already begun from this week and is expected to get over in a week’s time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/4-flying-squads-to-check-on-excess-admissions-in-jr-colleges/articleshow/85437968.cms||Prasad Joshi

Speaking after Janasheervada Yatre programme held here to create awareness about the central government’s schemes, she said: “Middlemen who were part of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Punjab and Haryana are protesting as they used to fleece farmers for a good commission.” She also said that protests in Karnataka against these acts are also politically motivated. “The new laws will support farmers to trade their produce out of the APMC ambit. This will help farmers get better prices for their produce,” she claimed. Farmer’s protest Angered by the minister’s statement, farmers, led by their leader Kurubur Shanthakumar, staged a protest and also gheraoed her during the launch of the yatre. “How dare she calls farmers as brokers and middlemen? During his speeches in 2014, Prime Minister Modi had promised to introduce the Swaminathan Commission report. But the report is yet to be implemented. Modi had promised to double the income of farmers. But what has increased is the price of fertilizers and seeds, doubling the expenditure on farming activity,” Shanthakumar said. He also alleged that Shobha, by sowing paddy seedlings in Mandya, tried to get cheap publicity. “As a minister, it is not her job. She should bring welfare programmes to save farmers. For the past two years, farmers have not got the compensation money for the crop loss.

In its working committee meeting held online recently, the board decided to launch the journal in both English and Urdu. It was also agreed upon by members, under the leadership of Maulana Raabey Hasani Nadwi, to launch a campaign for protection of waqf properties in the country. “Some groups are asking for the present Waqf Act to be scrapped and political moves are also being made around this. We condemn this. A peaceful movement, Tafaffuz-e-Auqaf, will be run in the country by the board to safeguard our waqf properties,” the board said. “It has also been realised that the majority of these properties have been encroached upon by Muslims themselves. The campaign will apprise Muslims and waqf mutawwalis against such encroachments and ask them to secure the lands,” it further said. The board also condemned demolition of Masjid Ghareeb Nawaz in Barabanki by the district administration earlier in May and expressed satisfaction over the board’s legal progress on the case. “There is a need for educating people about the aspects of Sharia related to Personal Law. The law journal to be published in English and Urdu will have information on the legal rights of minorities and the various court judgments on minority issues in a simplified manner,” the board said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/personal-law-board-to-dispel-misinfo-about-sharia-with-new-journal/articleshow/85441923.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena & BJP in bitter spat over yatra by union ministers||MUMBAI/KALYAN: The BJP’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra (JAY) has become the latest flashpoint in the conflict between the party and its former ally, the Shiv Sena. On Wednesday, Sena MP Sanjay Raut alleged the yatra would be “an invitation to the third wave of Covid.” The issue was even discussed in the state cabinet meeting. Without naming the BJP, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that if one cannot play the role of a Covid warrior, at least he should not be a Covid spreader. The BJP has hit back by asking whether Covid did not spread in the Sena’s rallies. Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted in response to Raut’s statement, saying, “I have taken note of this, but we don’t stop taking govt policies to the people. I shouldn’t say this but look at the scenes when concerned leaders aren’t wearing masks, are in close proximity to each other and are in the well of the house.” The JAY was launched a week ago by recently inducted ministers of state in the Union cabinet Kapil Patil, Bharti Pawar and Bhagwat Karad from the BJP. Speaking to the media, Sena’s Raut said, “Everyone knows that ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ is nothing but a show of strength and will be an invitation for the third wave of Covid. But it is being done deliberately to trouble the state government.” Responding to Raut, BJP’s Kapil Patil said, “There are always huge crowds at Sena’s programs. So doesn’t Covid spread in Sena rallies? If BJP does something, how does Corona get an invitation immediately?” He claimed around 8,000-10,000 people had gathered at the Sena’s event in Pune recently. Later in the day, Thane police registered three separate FIRs in three different police stations in Kalyan-Dombivli against the organisers for alleged violation of Covid-19 norms. Meanwhile, during the presentation on the Covid situation in the cabinet meeting, Thackeray said that at least ruling parties should follow all Covid protocols while organising any event and should avoid political events. “People are organising social, political, religious and other events without following Covid protocols. Considering the festive season ahead, everyone should take care and not violate Covid norms. If you cannot become a Covid warrior, at least do not be a Covid spreader,” said a statement from Thackeray’s office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sena-bjp-in-bitter-spat-over-yatra-by-union-mins/articleshow/85443099.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Digital resurvey to be done in 4 years, says revenue minister K Rajan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government will complete the resurvey process using digital technology within next four years, said revenue minister K Rajan on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the cabinet had decided to sanction Rs 807.98 crore for the resurvey of 1550 villages in the state. In the first phase, the government will provide Rs 339.438 crore under the Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI) for the resurvey. The government has also given administrative sanction for Rs 156.173 crore for the second phase, Rs 156.189 crore for the third phase, and Rs 151.186 crore for the last and the final phase, the minister added. The government will utilise a continuously operating reference station (CORS), real-time kinematic (RTK), drone, Lidar and electronic total station (ETS) for the resurvey depending on the nature of the land. The government is expected to complete the resurvey in a village using CORS in fiveand-a-half months, the minister said. The limited manpower requirement will be the added advantage for the resurvey, as the earlier resurvey initiated by the government had suffered due to the lack of enough manpower. While using CORS and drone technologies only a surveyor and a helper is required. One team can survey up to four hectares using CORS technology. The minister said that the resurvey was completed in 87 villages much earlier. The people will receive better services with regards to ownership documents of the land, dispute redressal, and land records and sketch. TOI had, on Sunday, reported how the state kickstarted the ambitious survey of villages abadi and mapping with improvised technology in village areas (SVAMITVA scheme) project launched by the Centre that intends to provide an integrated property validation solution for properties in rural areas using advanced drone survey technology. As per the order issued by the revenue department in this regard, the government has formed the state steering committee, district monitoring and review committee, taluk-level committee and panchayat and urban local monitoring committees, as part of implementing the scheme in the state. The additional chief secretary (revenue), district collector, tahsildar and the panchayat president or the municipal chairperson, will be the chairman of the four committees at the four levels, respectively. There are as many as 1670 villages in Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/digital-resurvey-to-be-done-in-4-yrs-min/articleshow/85439886.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Govt seeks details on West Bengal school building conditions||KOLKATA: The school education department has asked government and government-aided schools to submit a report on the condition of their buildings and the infrastructure. Many in the academic circles see this as the first step towards government’s preparations for resuming in-person classes after Durga Puja in a phased manner. Several CISCE and CBSE schools, too, have decided to undertake maintenance work, now that no students are visiting the campuses. Earlier this month, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had announced that the government planned phased reopening of schools and colleges after Puja, provided the number of Covid cases did not rise. The education department has now sent schools a list of queries on the physical conditions of the buildings, classrooms, furniture and other infrastructure, especially since all the campuses have been shut since March last year. “Schools have got a notice from the education department, asking about the condition of the premises, classrooms and furniture as campuses have been shut for over 16 months. There have been two cyclones and extreme weather conditions that might have affected the structures,” said Chandan Maity, general secretary of Advanced Society of Headmasters and Headmistresses. The education department wants to make sure the school buildings have not fallen to disrepair so that when campuses reopen, students, teachers and staff do not come to any harm. “In Amphan and Yaas, many school buildings were damaged with trees uprooting and balconies collapsing. There have also been floods in many parts of the state. We want to gauge the situation before campuses open,” said an education department official. Jadavpur Vidyapith principal Parimal Bhattacharya said maintenance work was carried out throughout the year and they could start classes whenever government decided. “We have been carrying out maintenance work as and when required. The school is ready for in-person classes,” he said. “As the premises have been empty, many institutes have been taking this opportunity to repair the buildings.” It’s not only state schools, but CBSE and CISCE schools have also been carrying out repairs. “It is an ongoing process in our school and we are always prepared,” said Meena Kak, director, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Principals pointed out that whenever the government gave the go-ahead, they would start with practicals. “We are getting our labs cleaned and replenished so that we can start with practicals straightaway,” said the principal of an ICSE school in central Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-seeks-details-on-state-school-building-conditions/articleshow/85439898.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Based on the complaint lodged by victim’s mother, Neknoor police station arrested Vikram Pawar and slapped him with the charges of rape along with stringent sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. He was produced before a local court on Wednesday and has been remanded to police custody. Superintendent of police R Raja said that Pawar was immediately arrested after the incident and directives have been given to ensure timely completion of probe and filing of chargesheet. Police said that the accused, a resident of Vidyanagar of Beed town, had visited his relative’s house in Sakhre Borgaon village. During his visit, he spotted a minor girl residing in the neighbouring house of his relative. After casually interacting with the minor girl during the day, the accused on Tuesday evening asked her to come along with him to the neighbouring field. The accused, who was well aware of the victim’s poor financial conditions, offered her money in exchange of work. The victim fell prey to the trap and followed him to the corn field where he allegedly raped her. Hearing her cries for help, some villagers rushed to the spot and caught the accused red-handed. Pawar was bashed and handed over to the police who registered an offence on late Tuesday night. The incident resulted into serious outrage in Beed on Wednesday with women activists, including those from NCP, took to the streets.

---||Jaipur||Afghan nationals stuck in Jaipur face an uncertain future||JAIPUR: Every phone call from home stirs an alarm. For Khan Agha (40), a Kabul-based jeweller now stuck in Jaipur, home is now a wistful dream. There were already whispers of trouble when he had left for India on a business trip about a month ago. The Taliban were making rapid advances in rural areas. But he did not anticipate the Taliban to roar into Kabul so quickly to take over the entire country. “I laboured hard for several years to build a jewellery business in a struggling economy. I was in my hotel room in Jaipur when a few days ago I learned that Talibs (Taliban) had marched into Kabul. I would have never left, only If I knew what fate had in store for me,” said a sleep-deprived Agha, adding that his entire family is terrified. Another Afghan national, Shamsul Aziz (36), a Kabul-based trader, said there was no way he could go back home now. “Airports, schools, and colleges have been closed down. There is complete chaos and panic. People have not forgotten the atrocities of the past. The Taliban will set off a chain of reprisals. They talk of peace, but none of us are convinced,” he said, blaming former president Ashraf Ghani for “surrendering the country” without resistance. Both Aziz and Agha said that their return to Kabul remains uncertain, and wish to move to India with their families. “I have a young daughter and she is deeply concerned, she wants to see me because she is scared of what she has heard about the Taliban,” Aziz said. Sohail Ahmad Amerkhail, a BBA student in a private college in Jaipur, said that an entire generation would be wasted under the Taliban’s repressive regime. “I had hoped to go back to Afghanistan to help my country. All I can see now is a bleak future ahead. My father has told me not to come back home because there is nothing left for me there,” he said, adding that two of his friends who had gone to Afghanistan for a brief vacation are stuck there. “Now, there is no use of any education under the new regime,” he said. Khan Agha said that he could see the future of his country and his business slipping away. “Years of civil war racked the country. As soon as things began to normalise, the Taliban returned. I am very concerned about my family,” he said, his eyes red from tension. The Afghan nationals said that there is no rule of law under the Taliban, and said that they wish to move to India to give their children a good future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/afghan-nationals-stuck-in-jaipur-face-an-uncertain-future/articleshow/85441930.cms||Dishank Purohit

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Schools to submit info on teaching of Marathi||MUMBAI: A year after Marathi was made compulsory in schools in Maharashtra, all non-state board schools have to submit their progress report on the local language. Marathi has been a compulsory subject for state board schools. From the academic year 2020-21, it was made compulsory for Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Council of Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE), Cambridge Board International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), International Baccalaureate (IB) and National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). The Maharashtra Compulsory Teaching and Learning of Marathi Language in Schools Act was introduced in June 2020, when non-state boards had to introduce Marathi as a subject for Class I and VI. The act made it mandatory to introduce Marathi in schools in a phased manner. In this academic year, Marathi has to be taught to students of Class I, II, VI and VII. The state school education department on Wednesday directed non-state boards to share details of how the Marathi language is being taught in schools. Schools have to provide information about the number of students learning the language, how many Marathi textbooks have been purchased, and whether Marathi lessons are being taken online. Schools have to share details of teachers appointed to teach the language and whether they want the state to train teachers. A legislative committee of MLAs was set up in October to ensure that Marathi is implemented in schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-schools-to-submit-info-on-teaching-of-marathi/articleshow/85441949.cms||Sandhya Nair

These practices are against the spirit of journalism. Media Channels must refrain themselves from such acts and no news regarding Taliban should be attributed to the @AIMPLB_OFFICIAL,” the organisation tweeted. Umrain took to social media to call Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan an extraordinary success, a heavenly decision and a sign that wars are won with God’s help. Sajjad Nomani also called the Afghan Talibs brave for throwing out first world armies out of their country and congratulated them for being “weaponless, humble and forthcoming for peace and sacrificing.” “I salute you for your courage, bravery and decades of sacrifice. As an unarmed group with science and technology not at your side, you have ousted the most advanced forces from your region. It will now bring an era of peace for Afghanistan and the region,” said Nomani, in a video statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aimplb-members-hail-taliban-board-terms-it-as-personal-opinion/articleshow/85441962.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Hyderabad||Dengue stings amid Covid-19 in Hyderabad, similar symptoms a concern||HYDERABAD: A huge jump in dengue cases is being reported from hospitals and clinics across the city, with individual doctors seeing up to 20 cases each daily since the past eight to ten days. Health authorities have also sounded an alert on the rising dengue and malaria cases. With focus currently on Covid-19 and symptoms of dengue being similar, health officials are worried about missing cases and misdiagnosis. Stressing on the need to differentiate between the two while cautioning against self-medication, director of public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao said: “Self-medication or taking Covid medicine for dengue and malaria can be fatal. People need to be alert as symptoms of fever, chills, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhoea are similar to that in Covid patients.” The director of public health further added, “While cases are not very high right now, they are increasing. Hyderabad and Khammam are seeing highest cases of dengue, while Kothagudem and Mulugu are reporting the maximum number of malaria cases currently. The number of cases is increasing across districts.” Explaining the dangers of wrong medication, Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant physician, Care Hospitals, said, “If a dengue patient is given treatment for Covid-19, especially anticoagulants, it can worsen the dengue and be very dangerous. Since the symptoms are similar, it is better to start symptomatic treatment but avoid steroids and anticoagulants. Also, false negatives are common for both dengue and Covid tests and hence extreme caution should be taken in treatment. If things are not clear, repeat tests and observation of progress of fever are required.” In a recent case, a senior nephrologist from Vijayawada who had self-medicated assuming that she was infected with Covid-19, succumbed to dengue shock three days back. With numbers rising, health authorities have advised people to seek medical attention to get a grip on their condition instead of self-medicating. “We are currently doing 1,500 tests per diagnostic centre daily and have enough platelet separating machines (platelets are useful in dengue treatment) so that people don’t have to run to blood banks. But maintaining cleanliness in and around the house and taking all measures to prevent mosquito bites is essential,” a health department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dengue-stings-amid-covid-19-similar-symptoms-a-concern/articleshow/85440208.cms||Amrita Didyala

This drive was launched across all urban primary health centres located in Rasoolpura, Bolarum, Picket, Bowenpally and Trimulgherry. Parents can take their children any of these centres to avail of this facility, said deputy DHMO, Raj Kumari. Elaborating on the reason for launching the PCV drive, the deputy DMHO said that it is aimed at protecting children from pneumonia, which can be done through immunization and adequate nutrition. While the cost of a PCV dose in the market is around Rs 4,000, the state government is providing it free of cost at these centres. Regarding the procedure being followed for the vaccine, the official said, “The first dose will be administered to infants within six weeks of being born and second dose will be given within 14 weeks. The booster dose will be administered in the ninth month.” “Mothers don’t need not panic. Babies will not suffer from any side effects after being administered the PVC. Also, anganwadi staff and health staff are available to resolve any issues that parents face,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pneumonia-vax-for-newborns-in-scb/articleshow/85440749.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government encroaching on liberty of citizens, high court raps authorities||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday criticised the state authorities for encroaching upon the liberty of citizens by using powers under the Gujarat Police Act and externing people not only from different districts but also from the nearby Union territories, upon which they do not have any jurisdiction, and where the state’s law does not apply at all. After coming down heavily for putting the freedom of citizens at stake, Justice Paresh Upadhyay ordered the government to pay compensation of Rs 10,000 to one Ankit Dubey from Navsari district, who was externed by the subdivisional magistrate in December 2020 for two years from Navsari, Surat, Valsad, Tapi and Dangs district as well as from the Union territories of Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli. He was externed by the revenue authority on a proposal by the superintendent of police after being booked twice for bootlegging. The HC had stayed the externment order in February and now quashed it with observation that externment order could not have been passed on basis of the two FIRs, said his advocate Zubin Bharda. The HC also quashed a similar externment order in case of Sagarbhai Bhamre and had ordered the authorities to pay him Rs 10,000. Justice Upadhyay was upset with the SDM’s decision of externing the petitioner from the UTs, particularly, where the GP Act is not even applicable. When questioned, the concerned SDM told the high court that if Dubey was allowed to live in UTs, he would continue to supply liquor to Gujarat. The SDM also submitted before the court that for last 10 years, in most of the externment orders passed, bootleggers were externed not only from the nearby districts, but from the UTs as well. This is a routine, and even the superintendent of police also makes proposal to revenue authorities to expel them from UTs. The SDM also clarified that it was in February for the first time that the state’s DGP issued a circular saying that the provisions of GP Act should be exercised for within Gujarat territories and if a person is externed from the areas in nearby state or UTs, the police should inform their counterparts about the activities of the externed persons. After perusal of the SDM’s reply, Justice Upadhyay observed that this shows “how casually and unauthorisedly the police and the revenue authorities are encroaching upon the liberty of the citizen. It also shows that circulars are required to be issued by the state authorities to educate the officers working as Sub-Divisional Magistrates, where the territory of the state of Gujarat ends and further where the powers cannot be exercised by the Sub-Divisional Magistrates”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-encroaching-on-liberty-of-citizens-hc-raps-authorities/articleshow/85440734.cms||---

Mohammed Hameedduddin, the complainant, submitted that he purchased a ready-made blazer from the Raymond MTM, Banjara Hills by paying Rs 58,500 on December 12, 2018, and was supposed to collect the blazer on December 22 after necessary alterations. He said that when he went to collect the blazer, he found that it was not altered as per his requirement and that it looked ugly and did not fit. Hameedduddin said he refused to collect the blazer and demanded that Raymond refund the amount. He added that he had to purchase another blazer to attend a family function. He said that subsequently the blazer was brought to his office claiming that it was altered again, however, after wearing the blazer, he and the representative of Raymond, who brought the blazer, noticed that sleeves were stitched from inside and the representative had to take it back to rectify it. The complainant said that he even got a legal notice issued seeking refund and compensation as Raymond failed to deliver the blazer after necessary alterations. In pursuance of the same, he filed this complaint. The manager of the store, in the written version, denied the allegations of deficiency of service and contested that as a goodwill gesture, they offered to remake the suit/blazer with fresh measurements for the complainant after receiving the legal notice. The opposite party claimed despite several efforts to rectify and resolve the issue, the complainant failed to respond and take delivery of the altered blazer. During the trial, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission-III noticed that the opposite party contacted the complainant with an offer to make necessary alterations or remake the blazer, only after the event and that too after the legal notice was issued. “Be it a ready-made blazer altered to suit the measurements of the complainant or a MTM Blazer, the fact remains that the opposite party failed to deliver the blazer on time to the satisfaction of the complainant. The complainant is entitled to reasonable compensation for the inconvenience and disappointment caused,” said the consumer court bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/store-ordered-to-pay-customer-over-ill-fitting-suit/articleshow/85440947.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Hyderabad||Justice Hima Kohli took a stand for the common man||Hyderabad: Chief Justice Hima Kohli’s expertise in handling coronavirus-related cases at the Delhi high court came in handy for Telangana during the last eight months of her tenure here at Telangna high court as its CJ. She could instil a sense of fear in minds of errant hospitals and inevitability created for the state to rein in errant hospitals. The state finally agreed to adopt Centre’s clinical establishments Act for the purpose. The CJ’s monitoring of the lawyer couple murder case and the lock-up death of Dalit woman Mariamma has kept investigators in the right stead. Her order that allowed probe agencies to continue their investigations in the big loan fraud cases had dealt a blow to the defaulters because the stay order they obtained in respect of the RBI circular on declaring their accounts as fraud was separated from criminal investigation. She made life uncertain for bureaucrats convicted in contempt cases and made it clear to them they have to appear before the court when they file contempt appeals against convictions. She also introduced the practice of penance for bureaucrats and allowed them to skip jail by doing social service under official supervision. Her efforts to protect and revive the glory of heritage structures Golconda Fort and Qutub Shahi tombs and also the determination she displayed to help the state earn and retain the Unesco tag for Ramappa temple have received applause from heritage lovers. Justice Kohli also made it mandatory for lawyers to explain their absence inprevious hearings before arguing cases in next hearing. The appellate authority over the pollution control board came into being solely on account of her monitoring. The same is the case with appointment of public prosecutors. An injured NSG commando and widow of a slain IFS officer got state aid only because of her intervention. She also settled many matrimonial disputes by acting tough on erring parties regardless of gender. Justice Kohli was a senior judge of Delhi HC before taking over as CJ of Telangana HC on Jan 7, 2021.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Why single-use plastic phase-out lacks teeth||NEW DELHI: Despite the first stage of phasing out single-use plastic announced by the central government being just five weeks away, officials of Delhi’s three civic bodies state that there are still no enabling bylaws for implementing the ban or enforcing rules. A senior official from the sanitation department said the draft Plastic Waste Management Bylaws were sent to Delhi government in 2019, but no notification had been issued till date.  “There is still no legal basis for confiscating or imposing challans for possessing the items that are being banned,” added the official. The civic bodies had been asked to be ready by September 30 to ensure that plastic bags less than 120 microns were not available in the market, compared with the existing 50 microns. The Centre had asked for single-use plastic items to be eliminated from across the country in three phases. In Phase-II starting from January 1, 2022, the sale and manufacture of earbuds, plastic sticks, balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks and polystyrene (thermocol) would be stopped. From July 1, 2022, 13 items, including plastic plates, cups, glasses and other cutlery, would be phased out. Another sanitation department official said action against plastic bags less than 50 microns was being carried out on the orders of National Green Tribunal, but new bylaws would be needed to take action against other single-use items. “We are still waiting for the notification of the bylaws. It seems the process was delayed due to the elections and then the pandemic,” added the municipal official. From hefty fines up to Rs 50,000 as a deterrent, to transferring more responsibility on plastic manufactures and importers, an attempt has been made by the draft bylaws to rein in haphazard flow of plastic waste in Delhi, which is the largest producer in the country. A report released by Central Pollution Control Board in 2015 stated that Delhi was producing 689.5 tonnes of plastic waste everyday and a large chunk of it remained unprocessed. Therefore, at the secondary storage level, the bylaws proposed creation of a material recovery facility by the corporations where plastic would be segregated. The draft bylaws proposed that the primary responsibility of collection of multilayer plastic packaging would be on producers/importers, who would have to establish a system for it. The plan of collection would have to be submitted to Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Failure to make modalities for waste collection as part of extended producer responsibility would invite a fine of Rs 50,000. The timeline for phasing out non-recyclable multilayer plastic was also set.  Under chapter 7 of the bylaws, there is a provision of levying user fee for plastic waste. Ban on single-use plastic items, including disposable cups, plastic bottles, etc, would be imposed on institutions like government or private offices, colleges, universities, malls, hotels, farmhouses and tourist or religious places. A DPCC official told TOI, “The file for notification of plastic waste management bylaws is with the urban development department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-single-use-plastic-phase-out-lacks-teeth/articleshow/85441985.cms||Paras Singh

The collegium also passed an unanimous resolution recommending the central government to appoint them as judges of Telangana high court. The names of high court registrar General A Venkateswar Reddy, Hyderabad city civil court chief judge C Sumalatha, P Madhavi Devi from income tax appellate tribunal and senior district judges P Sree Sudha, G Radha Rani, M Laxman and N Tukaramji were recommended. They will soon become HC judges upon notification by the Centre. All these elevations are from district judiciary. Soon a batch of lawyers too would become judges because the high court has already sent to Supreme Court a panel of advocates for elevation. A notification to this effect is expected from Supreme Court soon. If that happens then that would pave the way for filling the vacancies of HC judges in the high court soon. Telangana HC has 12 judges now hearing scores of cases every day. When the Telangana HC was formed, the court had a sanctioned strength of 24 Judges. Later with the intervention of CJI NV Ramana, the sanctioned strength was increased to 42.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-hc-to-get-7-new-judges/articleshow/85441067.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||US conglomerate’s tech arm sets up AI R&D centre at IIT-Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Honeywell Technology Solutions (HTS), the engineering and technology development arm of US-based giant Honeywell, has inked a pact with the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, (IIT-H) for setting up a centre for Artificial Intelligence (AI) research to conduct joint research on AI and related emerging technologies. As part of this, a fully equipped lab has been set up at an investment of Rs 1 crore by HTS that will be managed, maintained and upgraded by IIT-H. The lab was inaugurated virtually by Union education, skill development and entrepreneurship minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday. Pointing out that HTS and IIT-H will research technologies that solve problems of the future with AI as the major focus area, HTS president Samuel Pratap said efforts would largely focus on AI research in Honeywell’s focus areas like aerospace, smart cities and building materials, among others. “The creation of this lab will blend experiences between fundamental research and applied research. Our vast pool of talented industrial application engineers will support this endeavour with their knowledge and experience in AI and emerging technologies to help solve real-world problems,” he explained. The association will not just provide industry collaboration for IIT-H but also an academic environment for Honeywell employees to conduct research while enabling students to upgrade their skills and improve their employment opportunities, Honeywell said. As part of the collaboration, they will be providing industry-specific domain training, remote project mentoring, engineering certificate course, training workshops and hackathons for IIT-H students and select HTS employees. Honeywell had earlier funded a materials research lab at IIT Hyderabad and also enrolled a few employee-engineers for PhD courses at the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/us-conglomerates-tech-arm-sets-up-ai-rd-centre-at-iit-h/articleshow/85440891.cms||---

Of the 1,485 dengue cases reported so far this year, Nagpur district has recorded the highest 950, with cases spiralling in the last six weeks. Six deaths — three each in city and rural — have been reported in Nagpur.The division also recorded 5,526 malaria cases, the bulk of them from Gadchiroli district. Gadchiroli and Chandrapur also account for a sizeable number of malaria cases. All the six districts have witnessed malaria cases this time.All the four malaria deaths in the division came from Gadchiroli, which has seen a large number of cases in last two years as well. Last year, over 7,000 malaria patients were reported there while so far 5,500 cases have been detected in the densely forested belt.Surprisingly, Gadchiroli has reported only eight cases of dengue, which also spreads due to mosquito bites.While health officials didn’t answer TOI calls, some doctors raised a question over recording fever with chills patients as malaria cases.In Nagpur city, private and public hospitals said they have a large number of dengue patients. Most of the cases have been recorded in July and August.GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said around 70 to 80% of dengue patients can be managed on OPD basis with regular follow ups. “However, patients and relatives take the advise otherwise and don’t keep the doctor updated about their health. They are advised on home-based care as per the day’s status report. Sometimes, patients are asked to come after two days but they return only in case the condition deteriorates,” he said.The high number of admissions in private hospitals also indicate the incidence of dengue in posh localities.Dr Mohan Nerker, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospitals, said, “Daily five to six dengue patients are getting admitted and as many are discharged. Two dengue encephalitis patients two were admitted at our hospital. This is a rare condition. Many of the patients were referrals after they become serious. We are treating many other patients on OPD basis too.”Dr Nerker added that those coming in shock, with bleeding or haemoerrage are admitted immediately. “They come in serious condition. Heart involvement is also seen in some patients. This year’s first dengue patient was admitted in March during Covid surge. Of late, the spike has increased manifold,” he said.BOXNUMBER GAMEDengue ----------------2019------------------2020---------------------2021Deaths----------------11---------------------2---------------------9Cases ----------------1396------------------402------------------1485Malaria----------------2019------------------2020---------------------2021Deaths----------------6------------------13---------------------4Cases----------------2728---------------7051------------------55262021Dengue ---------cases -------------------deathsNagpur ---------1005-------------------6Gondia ---------63-------------------0Bhandara ---------16-------------------1Chandrapur ---------229-------------------1Gadchiroli ---------8-------------------0Wardha ---------164-------------------1Malaria ---------cases -------------------deathsNagpur ---------5------------------0Gondia ---------235-------------------0Bhandara ---------4-------------------0Chandrapur ---------79-------------------0Gadchiroli --------5199-------------------4Wardha ---------2-------------------0||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-toll-rises-to-9-in-division-malaria-claims-4-in-gadchiroli/articleshow/85438018.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The Pune District Retailers’ Association has said that a mobile app is under development to provide an online platform for retailers to reach out to local customers. Retailers will be trained to increase their presence online and offer home deliveries. Traders have already witnessed an increase in home delivery orders during the pandemic. Sachin Nivangune, president of the association, said members have understood the importance of online trade and home deliveries to boost business. “Most traders faced stiff competition from e-commerce companies during the last year. Even many regular customers opted for e-commerce services. Therefore, we are planning to be aggressive in bringing back customers. Going online is the need of the hour and shopkeepers are ready to for it,” Nivangune added. A shopkeeper from Shivajinagar said that the government must provide support to local shopkeepers as they have faced losses because of the restrictions. “We followed all the norms during the last year. However, e-commerce services continued despite the lockdown restrictions. Retailers are planning initiatives on their own to regain business in the changing scenario, but the government should also provide some online platform so that shopkeepers can reach customers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/local-retailers-plan-to-increase-online-presence/articleshow/85439923.cms||Sarang Dastane

His latest app — of English word play — has been selected as the best app in the ‘Educational App for Primary Students’ category in India by the Central Institute of Educational Technology (CIET), a unit of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), New Delhi. Hankare will receive a trophy and prize amount of Rs 40,000 at a later event. Some of Hankare’s apps are much sought-after among students preparing for scholarship and Navodaya school entrance exam. Some have been downloaded over 1 lakh and 50,000 times so far. “I started learning app development on the internet. I signed up for free courses and over the past three years, I have been making basic educational apps. After joining the teaching profession, I found students in the rural areas have less or no access to the quality coaching to prepare for scholarships and entrance exams. The coaching for such exams is costly and to overcome this challenge I decided to develop the apps which can run on mobile phones even in the offline mode,” he told TOI.“The app which has been selected by CIET-NCERT helps increase the vocabulary of students. In schools, A for apple is tought, however through the app, the student can learn multiple words for each alphabet. The image with the word helps with memorising, retention and recall which may have made the jury to select the app as the best one among thousands of entries from across the country,” said Hankare.The school in which Hankare teaches is a two-teacher school with 30 students. Witnessing the urge of both the teachers of the schools to teach the poor students, local public representatives have made a ‘smart projector’ available to the school. The smart projector is otherwise only available to schools with high enrolments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sangli-zp-school-teachers-edu-app-gets-rs-40000-national-award/articleshow/85436508.cms||---

The officials said that the time is right to reopen schools and colleges. While the government is also thinking on these lines and will take a decision soon, it has been proposed that only vaccinated staff will be allowed. “We will ensure that Covid-19 tests are conducted regularly,” said state director of public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao, adding that, in future only vaccinated persons will be allowed inside malls, cinema halls and other public spaces. Health officials said that case positivity rate has come down to 0.5 per cent while the R-factor is now at 0.7. They have, however, warned that despite the number of cases being under control, people should not let their guard down and seek timely medical attention in case of illness. “With seasonal fevers (like) dengue and malaria on the rise, people should not delay treatment at all. Covid appropriate behaviour should be maintained and people should get themselves vaccinated at the earliest,” the director of public health said. The director of public health also informed that 85 per cent within GHMC limits and 100 per cent in Hyderabad, have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-second-wave-over-in-t-health-dept/articleshow/85440336.cms||---

Naik was absconding since then.Recently, Hasan received a tip-off that Naik was staying in Thane. Accordingly, PSI Avinash Jaibhai, police constables Ritesh Mulgulwar, Fahim Khan and Pravin Falke reached Thane. After camping in Thane for two days, the city police team succeeded in nabbing Naik, said senior PI Dinkar Thosre. Thosre said Naik continuously changed his address due to the fear of being arrested. “Naik was well-versed in English and used to hold online and offline seminars to lure investors,” he said.City police have been looking for him for the last eight months, which gave sufficient time to Naik to hide the wealth he had illegally amassed.He was produced before the district court which remanded him in police custody till August 23.So far, police have arrested 14 persons, including the prime suspect Vijay Gurnule, within days after unearthing the scam.Police said Gurnule used to offer expensive items like cars, washing machines, laptops to the agent through lucky draws, while Naik was a master in conducting seminars in English. Due to this modus operandi, they lured agents to invest heavily in the company.The firm duped thousands of investors from across 10 states by promising lucrative returns from various schemes of real estate, crypto currency, stock market and multi-level marketing.Gurnule had hidden around Rs48 lakh in a pit at his relative’s house in Amravati. Along with this, police had also recovered Rs7 lakh from Gurnule from other places too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/absconding-multi-level-marketing-scam-kingpin-held/articleshow/85438028.cms||---

In undivided Dakshina Kannada, a major chunk of Afghan students are at the Mangalore University campus in Konaje. The campus alone has a total of 53 Afghan students, 18 of whom are undergraduates, 13 are pursuing postgraduate degrees and 22 are PhD scholars. Mangalore University vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya said that the students are worried about their families back home, due to the ongoing crisis. “We are trying to reach out to the Afghan students for any assistance during this time of crisis. The university has made elaborate arrangements to help the students. We are also offering counselling to them, if they require it.” The university started welcoming international students from the 2014-15 academic year. A majority of international students have taken admission at the university under the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) programme. Yadapadithaya said that several Afghan students have graduated from Mangalore University and returned to their country. On being asked as to what would be the next course of action if the crisis continues, and students are unable to return home? Yadapadithaya said that the university has no role to play about the expiry of visas, and decisions will be taken at the government level. “Currently, we are making sure that students who are anxious due to the crisis are counselled and taken care of,” he said. Sources from the university said that the Afghan students enrolled were disturbed and feeling helpless. One of the students had recently returned to the campus, after dropping his family in Afghanistan. The Afghan students and other international students stay in private accommodations arranged by the university. The university is also providing transportation and other facilities to them. The Afghan students were not willing to speak about the condition of their families in their country. H S Ballal, pro-chancellor, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, said that 4-5 Afghan students are expected to study in Manipal under a scheme. “There may be delays in their arrival, or changes in plans due to the current crisis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mu-offers-counselling-services-for-afghan-students/articleshow/85436471.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

According to sources in the party, many local leaders are hesitant to enter the fray as it will test the waters before assembly polls and affect ticket prospects of certain MLA aspirants. When the committee headed by former minister BM Patil arrived here to gather opinion, the leaders expressed it would be ideal not to field candidates as the party may not stand a chance. The poll is slated to be held on September 3.However, Karnataka Congress in-charge general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala has differed with the state leaders who have convened the message. Surjewala is of the opinion that the party would look weak in the state if it failed to throw a hat in the ring. “If not a majority, the party should win at least 15-20 seats in the polls to send out a message to the opposition. At a time Belagavi is seeing polls fought on party symbols for the first time in the history, abstaining will leave a black spot on state Congress,” he reportedly said. Ashok Chandaragi, a Kannada activist, said the staying out from electoral politics will also pose questions on the stance of the party on burning linguistic issues. In areas dominated by Kannada speaking people, voters get an impression that Congress is not committed towards protecting the interest of Kannadigas. Congress leader MB Patil said there are many rumours floating around but the party will take a final call at appropriate time. The high command has gathered information from the ground. He added that it is not true that the party is not interested in contesting elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/congress-compelled-to-contest-bcc-polls-as-abstaining-makes-party-look-fragile/articleshow/85436499.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Hyacinth growth leading to mosquito menace||HYDERABAD: Uncontrolled growth of water hyacinth, seen as being a major factor for breeding of mosquitoes and reduction of dissolved oxygen in the water, continues to invade the lakes in several parts of the city. The weed can be noticed covering a major portion of the water bodies such as Shah Hatim Talab, Katora Houz, Fox Sagar Lake, Kapra Lake and Banjara Lake to name a few. “The hyacinth keeps coming back even after the GHMC cleans the water body every year. Two of my family members are suffering from fever and we are afraid if this is due to the mosquitoes in the area. The mosquito population rises only when the water is covered with this weed. Officials should find a permanent solution ,” said Farhan Sheik, a resident of Golconda. While the hyacinth has already started growing in most of the 39 lakes that were cleared earlier, another round of tenders for removal of hyacinth from 20 more lake is still under process. The GHMC has taken up a project to clear the hyacinth in 39 lakes across its limits at an estimated cost of Rs 31 crore. “We have requested the authorities to address this problem several times, but it seems like there is no permanent solution to this problem,” said Mohammed Ahmed, a social activist. “Officials should have at least cleared the hyacinth before onset of monsoon,” he added. While agreeing that the hyacinth in many lakes is found to be resurfacing despite clearing it every year, GHMC chief entomologist Dr Rambabu said, “In a recent meeting with the commissioner, all zonal commissioners were asked to deploy labour and clear hyacinth on a daily basis to contain the spread.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyacinth-growth-leading-to-mosquito-menace/articleshow/85440714.cms||Moulika.KV

Ganesh festival is less than 25 days from now and hence, these artisans are restarting their work on the idols that could be saved from the floods. Shahupuri kumbhar galli was the worst affected as the Jayanti Nullah water flooded the area for more than eight days. CM Uddhav Thackeray and former CM Devendra Fadnavis, both met these artisans after the floods and assured them of immediate help. Satish Vadangekar, artist from Shahupuri kumbhar galli, said, “As of now, we have not received any help for the flood losses. Even the road leading to our kumbhar galli is full of mud. When the CM came, they fixed the road he was going to travel on. CM Uddhav Thackeray, Deputy CM Ajit Pawar and Ex CM Devendra Fadnavis all visited here, but still we haven’t received a single penny from the government.” The artisans are working day and night before the Ganesh festival. Sambhaji Purekar, another clay idol maker, said, “Forty of the sixty clay idols I had made, got dissolved into the flood waters. One clay idol takes nearly one or two days to be completed. Our earning for the entire year depends on the idols sales in Ganesh festival. We have set aside the flood memories and are working day and night to complete the idols, which were already booked by the customers.” Artisans from the Bapat camp kumbhar galli also faced heavy losses due to the floods to the Panchganga river water. Bharti Kumbhar, artisan from Bapat camp kumbhar galli, said, “Around 200 Ganesh idols, moulds and colours costing around Rs 2 lakh got damaged due to the floods. The survey for the flood losses was carried fifteen days back but even after these many days no help has been received yet. If we could have got some relief amount, then at least we can purchase raw material and make as many idols as we could before the Ganesh festival.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/ganesh-idol-makers-back-at-work-await-flood-relief/articleshow/85436537.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kolkata||‘High Plus-II marks to push up cut-offs by 1.5%’||KOLKATA: Cut-off marks for undergraduate admissions merit lists would rise by 1.5% this year, given that hundreds of students had scored 95% and beyond in their Plus-II, principals said.  At some colleges, merit list cut-offs for certain subjects have already gone up to 98%-99%. These institutes said they were flooded with applications with 100% marks in the subjects and beyond 99% in the aggregate. So, principals said, students might have to face rejection by a whisker despite high scores. In English, economics and commerce, the number of applications at some colleges have gone up to 7,000, making principals and admission committees sit up. They fear that a large number of candidates would either have to settle for not-preferred subjects or wait for subsequent lists. Though the hope for wait list might be slim in English, economics, commerce, physics, maths, statistics and sociology, colleges said, adding the absence of admission tests had made it worse. “ I can see a clear growth of at least 1.5% in cut-offs owing to the high scores. For English and economics, where we just have 60 seats each, we have had more than 3,000 applicants. We have 600 seats in our sought-after commerce stream, for which 7,000 applications have come in,” said Fr Dominic Savio, principal at St Xavier’s College. At St Xavier’s University in New Town, more than 3,000 applications have come in for commerce, which has 500 seats. “There is a huge demand for English and economics, too. Students with very high marks are pushing up the cut-off by 1.5%,” said vice-chancellor Fr Felix Raj. At Jadavpur University, the eligibility cut-off for English is kept at 90% and 3,000 students have already applied. “The eligibility cut-off is also very high for economics. Comparative literature is the only subject that has been allowed to have a group discussion. There are arrangements for tie-breakers,” said Madhumita Chattopadhyay, dean of arts at JU. Many colleges are waiting for all applications to come in before deciding on the merit list cut-off. “Going by the deluge of applications and the high number of students who have scored above 90%, the merit list cut-off might increase,” Asok Mukhopadhyay, principal at Seth Anandaram Jaipuria College. “The number of applications have gone up several times this year,” said Swami Ekachittananda, principal at Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira. Presidency University authorities pointed out the absence of screening would impact the cut-off. “We could not conduct tests or online interviews to filter out candidates. Students have got so much marks, the cut-off is bound to be impacted. A decision will be taken after the portal is shut,” said an official. Asutosh College has introduced the system of online reporting before admissions. “We hope to check the students’ credentials and weed out some non-serious candidates,” said an admission committee member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-plus-ii-marks-to-push-up-cut-offs-by-1-5/articleshow/85440042.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Dehradun||Kejriwal names Army veteran as AAP's CM face in U'khand||Dehradun: Retired Army Colonel Ajay Kothiyal will be Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) chief ministerial candidate in the Uttarakhand assembly polls due early next year. The announcement was made on Tuesday by the party’s national convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who also promised that AAP would develop the hill state as the "spiritual capital" of Hindus. According to Kejriwal, Kothiyal became the party’s choice after AAP took feedback from people. “People said that they need a deshbhakt fauji (patriotic defence personnel) and not a neta (politician). Only a deshbhakt fauji can do justice to Devbhoomi,” said the AAP leader while addressing a press conference at the Institute of Research Development and Training (IRDT) auditorium in Dehradun. Kejriwal added that Kothiyal, who joined AAP in April, had played an instrumental role in rescue and reconstruction efforts in Kedarnath during the 2013 flash floods. “Now he has taken up the mantle for navnirman (reform) of the state,” he said, adding that Kothiyal is fondly referred to as "Bhole ka fauji" by local residents for his work in the aftermath of the Kedarnath tragedy. Kothiyal, who was the principal of Uttarkashi-based Nehru Institute of Mountaineering in 2013, said, “My vision is to make Uttarakhand the kind of state we had envisioned in 2000 when it was carved out of Uttar Pradesh.” The retired Armyman added that the AAP government has already shown effective governance in Delhi when it comes to education, health and employment — three sectors that are crucial for development of Uttarakhand as well. “Give us just six months to prove ourselves,” he said. The party’s choice of an Army veteran as the CM pick assumes importance in the state which contributes a significant number to the national defence and paramilitary forces. Kothiyal also runs an organisation that trains youngsters in the hills to join the defence forces. AAP has not fought any previous assembly elections in the state, but the party unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. This time, however, the party started mobilising grassroots workers months ahead of the polls, with top leaders like Manish Sisodia making frequent visits to the state. Kejriwal also conducted a roadshow in the state capital. The Delhi CM said that tourists from all countries flock to Uttarakhand for spiritual activities. “With proper arrangements, I’m confident that the number of pilgrims can go up by 10 times. Therefore, it is my promise that we will develop Uttarakhand as the spiritual capital of the world and Hindus,” he said, adding that Delhi would be the country’s “administrative capital” while the hill state would be the spiritual capital for Hindus. According to the 2011 Census data, Uttarakhand's population is made up of 82.9% Hindus, 13.9% Muslims and 2% Sikhs. The AAP leader said that migration and unemployment were the two major issues plaguing the youth in Uttarakhand. “We are chalking out strategies to generate employment,” said Kejriwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kejriwal-names-army-veteran-as-aaps-cm-face-in-ukhand/articleshow/85427415.cms||Kautilya Singh

Sheikh, a teacher at the ZP Upper Primary School (Asaralli village), is among 44 teachers across the country who will receive the awards at the hands of the President of India. From Maharashta, another teacher from Osmanabad, Umesh Khose, has been selected as well. These awards, under the aegis of union ministry of education, are given for exemplary work in the education field by active/serving teachers. For Sheikh, this is a culmination of sheer selfless dedication to a district which he fell in love with almost three decades ago. Speaking to TOI from Sironcha taluka, Sheikh said, “I am originally from Jalgaon and had come to Gadchiroli 25 years ago for my Bachelors in Education (B.Ed). My stay here made me realize that the need of teachers is actually in these remote villages where there is so much work to be done. And I never left.” Sheikh has been recognized for his contribution in helping students overcome the learning gap. “I teach in an upper primary school where students till Std VII are enrolled. Since we are located near the Telangana border, mother tongue of majority of these kids is Telugu. Others speak Madia, a very common dialect here. Our curriculum is in Marathi, which is why a learning gap is created. Over a period of time we developed a system in which even their language is used as the starting point to crossover to the mainstream learning,” said Sheikh. While an extremely poor network made most the of conversation indecipherable, the humility of Sheikh was crystal clear. “I want to serve more tribal students and ensure that they get a good education. Gadchiroli is now my home and I will strive to be worthy of it,” said Sheikh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/teacher-who-made-gadchiroli-his-home-gets-national-award/articleshow/85438072.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Emphasis will be placed on providing parking facility at a nominal charge. Parking in markets and on the streets will be smoother and the NMC will get revenue.The driver will have to recharge the card of his or her vehicle every month. A flying squad will be formed to monitor and curb illegal parking. This is how the system will work, said Daga.On charging a monthly fee, people will be allowed to park vehicles at the designated places across the city.The mayor instructed the company director to submit a proposal with a financial plan within seven days. He said the entire responsibility of managing the parking arrangement should rest with the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-mulls-qr-code-card-for-vehicle-parking/articleshow/85438043.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

For the first time in the last five years, the project with huge outlay has been approved for development work in Kolhapur city. District guardian minister Satej Patil and Shiv Sena’s former city MLA Rajesh Kshirsagar took efforts to convince urban development department minister Eknath Shinde to approve the project. Patil said, “The KMC had submitted the proposal in 2019 after the floods. The proposal with a revised outlay of Rs 203.82 crore has been approved. As per the government norms, the KMC will have to share 25% of the total outlay, however, I have requested the minister to bring KMC’s share down to 10% and increase government’s share.” Shinde approved the plan in the meeting held on Tuesday. Both Patil and Kshirsagar attended the meeting along with officials of the urban development department. Kshirsagar said, “The minister has asked the KMC to submit the proposals in two slots. The funds will be released accordingly and the work will be undertaken in a phased manner. We will ensure most of the roads damaged in the floods are covered in the final plan. Also, the focus will be on building roads strong enough to sustain floods and torrential rain.” Shinde has also sought a report of the development work pending despite the release of funds. Due to Covid, there is negligence towards development work from KMC’s side. Getting the project approved of such magnitude is expected to help both Congress and Sena in the civic body election, which is due for the last nine months. The election is expected to take place by November or December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/govt-okays-kmcs-rs-203-8cr-proposal-for-development-work/articleshow/85436547.cms||---

They found that sand deposited by the river owing to the flood was being mined and loaded into the truck under the cover of the night.They stumbled upon earth moving machines into which sand was being loaded, and started quizzing the drivers of the vehicles. Although initially hesitant to answer, the drivers subsequently revealed that Hirekodi GP vice-president Bharath Devdkar and fellow GP colleague Shankar Mayannavar had hired them for the purpose. The villagers on Wednesday approached the Hirekodi panchayat development officer to confirm if the GP had authorised extraction of sand.Hirekodi resident Krishna Kumbar told TOI, “The PDO informed us that the GP had authorised no such work, following which we decided to file a complaint against the suspects at the police station. The district administration appears to be a mute spectator to the activities of the sand mafia in Chikkodi taluk. Multiple complaints alleging their activities have gone unheeded.”Chikkodi police inspector, confirming that the Hirekodi residents had lodged a complaint, said that he had written to the public works department to ascertain whether those named in the complaint were mining sand or mud. “Once the PWD files a report, police will file an FIR,” the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/villagers-discover-involvement-of-gp-members-in-illegal-sand-mining/articleshow/85436531.cms||---

Billed as one of the smallest in the history of UP assembly, the supplementary budget, if utilized properly, could leave an impact on the lives of a large number of people in the state in the election year, believe political obervers. While the Opposition termed it useless as the money of the main budget was yet to be utilized, many felt it was meant to either create or keep the ruling party's vote bank intact. The initial size of the supplementary budget to be tabled in the UP Assembly was supposed to be around Rs 35,000 crore. However, it was scaled down to Rs 7,301.5 crore to keep focus on only those projects that could be completed in six months’ time or were socially significant. In a bid to make the youths of the state digitally capable, a budgetary provision of Rs 3,000 crore has been made. Besides, youngsters would be the main beneficiaries of many other allocations. A sum of Rs 265.70 crore has been earmarked for the increased honorarium to anganwadi workers, mini anganwadi workers and anganwadi assistants, Rs 123.55 crore for increased honorarium to shiksha mitras, Rs 28.91 crore for part time anudeshaks, Rs 129.78 crore for Asha workers, Rs 40.62 crore has been earmarked for the increased honorarium to rozgar sevaks, Rs 61.07 crore for increased stipend to PRD personnel, Rs 47.88 crore for increased honorarium to village guards, etc. A sum of Rs 90 crore has been earmarked for lawyers under the social security fund scheme. The lawyers who have completed 30 years as members would get Rs 5 lakh. Earlier, this amount was around Rs 1.5 lakh. The same was increased by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. According to analysts, the amount earmarked under such heads is small but could make around 20 lakh people in the state happy. On the infrastructure front, the budget has earmarked Rs 5 crore for Uttar Pradesh National Law University in Prayagraj. Similarly, Rs 40 crore has been earmarked for the widening and beautification of road from Kashi Vishwanath Temple to Ganga. Provisions have also been made for multilevel parking and other public amenities in Ayodhya. In the agriculture sector, Rs 200 crore has been earmarked for cane dues of Cooperative Sugar Mills while around Rs 300 crore has been earmarked for stray cows and Rs 200 crore for Swachh Bharat Mission. "The government has made a loan arrangement for the sugar mill of the Co-operative Sugar Mills Association to make the payment of the due cane price of farmers. Through this, the state government is going to give further impetus to sugarcane yield and the sugar production in the state," said a govt spokesperson. For felicitation of winners of Tokyo Olympics, a supplementary budget has been provided to the sports ministry. Yogi is here to defeat evil forces: KhannaEarlier, when Chaudhary opposed Khanna claim that his government had created several records, he was interrupted by the members of treasury benches.

We are vaccinating more now than what we were when we were allocated the doses two weeks ago,” said Nivedita Oswal, director and paediatrician of Hadapsar-based Parasmani hospital that got 1,000 doses of Covishield on July 28.Confirming, Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, an association of small hospitals in Pune, said, “The technical hurdles were defeating the purpose of speedy vaccination initially. However, most of the small private hospitals and nursing homes have now overcome the teething issues now and are reporting more vaccination numbers every day.”However, there has been low vaccination numbers at municipal corporation run vaccination centres in PMC and PCMC in the last two days, which is attributed to the shortage of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccination-picks-up-pace-in-small-private-hospitals/articleshow/85439966.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Dehradun||‘Conquering of Afghanistan has never really been possible’||DEHRADUN: Their ancestors founded the last dynasty of Afghanistan, were exiled to India by the British and lived out their days in the Doon Valley. Now, in a quiet pocket of Dehradun, seven descendants of the Afghan royals, who introduced Basmati to Dehradun, live as a family of farmers. The first trail leading from Kabul to Mussoorie goes back to 1840, a year into the First Anglo-Afghan War, which would set the stage for what continues to be a struggle for power. The British had secured a victory in Ghazni and Dost Mohammad Khan, founder of the Barakzai dynasty and the ruler of Kabul, Peshawar and Kashmir, surrendered. He was “hustled off” to Mussoorie. “He stayed at what is now the Wynberg Allen School. It came to be known as Bala Hissar Estate locally, referring to the fortress in Kabul,” said his grandson’s great grandson Mohammad Ali Khan, 51, a Doon School alumnus. While Dost Mohammad found his way back to the throne in Kabul by 1842, his grandson Yaqub Khan found himself in the same situation about four decades later. It was after the Second Anglo-Afghan War — he was pushed out of Kabul by the British. “He came to Dehradun in 1879,” said Khan. “He loved hunting and the hills. He found both here. He would go to Raiwala for hunting.” The two Afghan royals, historians say, introduced the Dehradooni Basmati. “Dost Mohammad Khan was fond of pulao and missed it during his exile. He brought Basmati to the Doon Valley and is credited with improving its genetic variety,” Dehradun historian and heritage activist Lokesh Ohri said. “His grandson Yaqub Khan continued that. He gave Basmati seeds to a Paltan Bazaar trader and asked him to cultivate them in Dehradun. Surprisingly, the Doon Valley’s weather suited the rice and it turned out even better than the variety in Afghanistan.” When Yaqub died in 1923, Afghans in Dehradun were moved to Burma. “For over a year by the British. They feared there might be a retaliation by the Afghan community here,” Khan said. Even until 1947, more than 500 relatives of Yaqub lived in Dehradun. “Some went to Afghanistan, Pakistan. The sons of Yaqub’s brother Ayub Khan, who led the Afghans against the British in the Battle of Maiwand (1880), settled in Allahabad,” Khan said. Khan’s side of the family stayed on. He lives with his father Mohammad Akbar Khan, mother, elder sister, wife and children at their Rajpur Road bungalow and owns farmland in Haridwar. In Afghanistan, meanwhile, monarchy was teetering. It ended in 1973 when Zahir Shah’s regime was overthrown while he was vacationing. A single-party republic was formed and the USSR entered Afghanistan. Back in India, Khan’s uncle, Mohammad Aslam Khan, became a minister in the Mulayam Singh government in 1989. It was the year the USSR withdrew. “The Russians started the systematic elimination of the Afghan royals. Later, the Taliban took over the country. The US stayed for two decades but could not oust the Talibs … Historically, anyone who has thought of conquering Afghanistan has failed miserably,” Khan said. “I met the CM on Tuesday. I’m concerned about people’s lives. We never thought we’d see people holding on to a plane in flight.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-exile-defeat-afghan-royals-found-refuge-in-doon-valley-200-yrs-ago/articleshow/85438077.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Chennai||State temples open up by shutting door on caste bias||By N RavikumarWhen Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin distributed the appointment orders for priests in the state temples, a day before Independence Day, it was described as the fulfilment of more than an eight-decade dream of Dravidian movement’s founder EVR Periyar, who raised the demand in his daily ‘Kudiarasu’ on August 8, 1937. The move evoked widespread celebrations among Periyarists as it was considered a much awaited legislation to free Hindu temples from brahmin domination, an objective of the Dravidian movement.Paradoxically, the move fulfils the principles of Hindu saints like Sri Ramanuja Acharya and Swami Vivekananda who also wanted to ensure temple worship for all communities. This also removes a major ground cited for conversion from Hinduism to other religions like Christianity and Islam which allows people from all communities practising the faith to become priests.The government’s step does not indicate a change or deviation of existing religious practice, but only a restoration of tradition, said Saivaite scholar M P Sathyavel Muruganar. The practice of nominating only brahmins as priests was imposed by the Vijaynagar emperors, who captured Tamil Nadu in the 16th century. There was no such discrimination before he asserted, and denied that there was any ‘agama’ stating that brahmins alone could be made temple priests. "Anyone who attains ‘theetchai’ from a Sivacharya could be a priest and caste is not a qualification," he said. Citing an example from Thiruvilaiyadarpuranam, a much revered Saivaite work narrating the history of 63 revered saints of Saivaite faith, he said "Appoodhi adigal, a Sivacharya by birth was given ‘theetchai’ by Saint Thirunavukkarasar, belonging to the Saiva Velalar community".The classical Sangam-age poems describe the priest in Muruga temples performing a ritual called ‘Velan Veriyaattam’. The priest performed ‘mari aruththal’ (goat sacrifice) and ‘kuruthi thooval’ (sprinkle its blood). The non-vegetarian priest of those days bear no resemblance to the brahmin priests of the six abodes of the same deity in Tamil Nadu. The first attempt to appoint temple priests from all castes was made in 1970 by chief minister M Karunanidhi, but it fell through following a Supreme Court verdict. But, an apex court judgment, by a bench comprising Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice N V Ramana in 2015, gave a new lease of life to the much awaited temple reform when it observed that inclusion or exclusion as per the ‘agama shastras’ should not be based on the criteria of caste, birth or any other Constitutionally unacceptable barometers.Following the verdict, the Kerala government overtook the Tamil Nadu government in appointing priests from all castes including dalits. Tamil Nadu becomes the second state to implement the reform, but this progressive legislation has been challenged in the Madras high court on the basis that appointment of priests should be done only on the basis of rules in the agama governing the temples. Advocate C Raju differs, he says only rituals can be governed by agama rules, "The appointment of priests by the government must be based on the law which ensures equality and there can be no discrimination based on caste or birth," he said.The DMK government’s Archaka Act, is a queer case of rationalists fulfilling the teachings of a revered Hindu saint Ramanuja, who offered ‘theetchai’ to all communities. Not a single political party including the major opposition AIADMK had opposed the move. It was the AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran, who appointed the Maharajan commission, which recommended that people from all castes be appointed as archakas. The BJP, too, welcomed the appointment of trained priests to the temples.However, a section of priests had approached the Madras high court. Reacting to the opposition, Kolathur Mani, founder of the Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam said, "Aagamas bar ‘smarthas’ from entering some of the famous temples like Nellaiappar temple, but they are working as priests in some of the temples, which bar their entry."The opposition to reforms in Hinduism must have been more intense during the times of Vivekananda since he had said, "Fleshless and bloodless skeletons of the dead body of past India, …. on your bony fingers are some priceless rings of jewel, treasured up by your ancestors, and within the embrace of your stinking corpses are preserved a good many ancient treasure-chests. Up to now you have not had the opportunity to hand them over. Skeletons of the past, there, before you, are your successors, the India that is to be. Throw those treasure-chests of yours and those jewelled rings among them …. No sooner will you disappear than you will hear the inaugural shout of Renaissant India."(The writer is a freelance journalist)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/state-temples-open-up-by-shutting-door-on-caste-bias/articleshow/85422661.cms||---

ZP CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar told TOI that this was possible due to the ‘vaccination at your village’ drive. “Health department officials, public representatives, anganwadi sevikas and others identified the eligible people. We want to ensure all 18+ in the rural areas are full vaccinated at the earliest,” he added. Kumbhejkar said that the resumption of vaccination of the 18-44 years age group helped in removing hesitancy some 45+. “There is great enthusiasm in 18-44 years age group. They are bringing their elders and ensuring vaccination of the entire family. Also, people who are yet to take the jab are turning up on seeing the young people,” he said. Awareness programmes explaining the importance of vaccination and also announcing the names of prominent people who have taken the jab helped. On June 11, the number of villages where all 45-plus had taken the first dose stood at 13. There are around 1,700 villages in 13 tehsils of Nagpur district. Vaccination of 60-plus and 45-plus with comorbidities started on March 1 and for everyone above 45 on April 1. Among the 35 villages, seven — the highest — are from Katol tehsil.

The government is already in discussion with the industry to invest in IT parks in districts beyond Bengaluru,” said Chandrasekhar. He said tier-2 cities like Mangaluru and Hubballi-Dharwad have good potential to promote remote working, and that these cities should focus on setting up better infrastructure for cloud computing and internet connectivity. The minister, interacting with the media on Wednesday as part of the Janaashirvada yatra, said, a digital village project in every district to provide connectivity to every house has been launched. “In the post-Covid world, employees are dictating models and prefer to work from home. Thus, there is a structural change in the way IT companies are being managed, not just in India, but the world. More companies are expected to invest in remote working, as it gives more flexibility to companies and more safety to employees. Remote working is the new normal, and hence cities need to have internet and cloud infrastructure,” he said, adding the department is focused on accelerating the BharatNet Project in the state. At the vision group meeting organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mangaluru chapter, Chandrashekar on Tuesday said that stakeholders in tier-2 cities should focus on strengthening infrastructure that promotes remote working, which has gained traction in the post-Covid situation. The districts outside Bengaluru should work towards building an eco-system by which their potential in the fields of education, health and other sectors can be showcased to the world, he said, adding there is a good demand for electronic goods, research and development, and the use of the internet for software as a service. The central government is ready to support the districts in training youth in the new skillsets that will make these regions as human resource providers in skilled areas, he added. The MP also recollected his bond with Mangaluru and Manipal, where he became a computer engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/govt-to-diversify-technology-beyond-bluru-rajeev/articleshow/85436552.cms||---

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who is also the state finance minister, held a meeting with the heads of the district central cooperative banks of Pune, Raigad, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. The heads agreed to provide loans at 5% to 6% interest rates. Earlier, the appeal was made to all banks, mainly the commercial banks, to provide loans to flood-affected businesses. However, there was hardly any response. Many traders, vendors have suffered losses due to floods, landslides and torrential rains. The assessment of damage is being carried out by the revenue department. Hasan Mushrif, the rural development minister and the head of Kolhapur District Central Cooperative Bank, said, “The decision to provide ex-gratia amount of Rs 50,000 to small traders and vendors has already been taken. For many, the amount is insufficient to stand back on their feet. To address this concern, all cooperative banks, as part of social responsibility, have decided to allow loans at cheaper interest rates to such flood-affected people. The interest rates have been fixed on ‘no profit, no loss' to the banks.” Thousands of vendors will benefit from the decision. The state government has also requested the central government to direct the insurance firms to settle the claims of damages to the shops and materials inside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/traders-to-get-loans-at-cheaper-interest-rates/articleshow/85436549.cms||---

Synod is yet to make a decision on the subject as it is facing opposition, especially from a section of priests of various dioceses. On Wednesday, the synod further discussed the subject in the aftermath of archbishop Leopoldo Girelli, the apostolic nuncio, speaking about the issue in detail during his address to the synod on Tuesday evening. The synod is being held for two hours each evening from Monday to Friday till August 27. On Tuesday, the discussions over liturgical matters had begun after the address of the apostolic nuncio. Synod’s Wednesday session began at around 5pm and went on till 7pm. Church sources said that the discussion on the liturgy was expected to continue for at least a few more days. The nuncio in his address had referred to the letter of Pope Francis, in which he refers in favourable terms to the agreement reached by the 1999 synod regarding a uniform mode of celebrating the Qurbana. “In the present situation of your Church, the Holy Father’s desire for a “prompt implementation of the uniform mode of celebrating” is an appeal to unity and not to cause division, and thus needs to be contextualised. Therefore, I encourage the synod judiciously to evaluate the timeframe for a prudent process of implementation in order to safeguard the unity of your Church,” the nuncio had said in his address. He said that there was need for immediate clarity on the uniform 50/50 orientation (in other words, celebrating the Liturgy of the Word facing the people, and the Liturgy of the Eucharist facing the altar) as a primary objective to be achieved at once in all the eparchies of the diaspora, in places of pilgrimage, and in major and inter-diocesan seminaries. Meanwhile, the nuncio’s appeals for unity has further fuelled demands from a section of priests who reiterated that such an important decision should only be implemented after formal discussions with bodies of priests and laity so as to avoid ‘division’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/synod-mulls-uniformity-in-celebration-of-mass/articleshow/85440045.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Khanna made the remark when the leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary objected to the finance minister’s speech during the presentation of the supplementary budget and termed it against the rule and tradition. Khanna’s remark left Chaudhary surprised even as the treasury bench erupted in loud cheer and thumping of tables in appreciation and the chief minister, who was sitting next to Khanna, smiled. Earlier, when Chaudhary opposed Khanna claim that his government had created several records, he was interrupted by the members of treasury benches. In the meantime, Khanna stood up and pointing towards CM Yogi, said: “Manyawar yeh to rajneeti ke Ram hain, yeh aasuri shaktiyon ko parajit karne ke liye yahan baithe hue hain (Dear sir, he is the Ram of politics who is here to defeat the evil forces).” Chaudhary stood in silence for a few seconds and said, “He is not a sage by political standards but the head of Acharya Peeth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fm-terms-yogi-as-rajneeti-ke-ram/articleshow/85442114.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No free vaccination for two days; demand for Covaxin rises||MUMBAI: The BMC has called off the vaccination drive for Thursday and Friday due to shortage of doses. This will be the second closure of public vaccination in a week as the drive was suspended last Thursday and Friday as well. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the state has assured some doses would arrive by Thursday night, which will be distributed on Friday. The drive will resume on Saturday, she said. On Wednesday, vaccination numbers dropped to 85,418 after two back-to-back days of one lakh-plus shots. Interestingly, private vaccination centres are witnessing a rise in demand for Covaxin, largely because of the shorter gap between doses. “People who walk in always ask for Covaxin first. The linking of train travel with full vaccination could be driving the demand despite it being more expensive,” said Dr Prince Surana, CEO of the Surana Group of Hospitals. Two shots of Covishield cost Rs 1,560 in private and Covaxin up to Rs 2,800. The head of a Malad hospital said supply of Covaxin has improved for the past few weeks. Of the 82.4 lakh doses administered in Mumbai, 76.1 lakh is Covishield, 6 lakh is Covaxin and 24,830 is Sputnik. Gomare said they get about 20,000-30,000 doses of Covaxin, which is mostly set aside for second doses. “Also, priority is given to special segments, like bed-ridden people who have been advised Covaxin,” she said. Under CSR, H N Reliance has committed to 3 lakh doses of Covaxin, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-free-vax-for-two-days-demand-for-covaxin-rises/articleshow/85440076.cms||---

Yadav, who comes from OBC category, will start his rally from the Yadav stronghold Alwar district, which is the epicentre of farmer protests in the state. The formal thanksgiving programme includes meetings at 40 places including farmers’ groups in a bid to reach them as part of the party’s plan to end the months-long stir. The battery of BJP leaders including state president Satish Poonia, leader of opposition Gulabchand Kataria, deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore will be present with Yadav during the three days. The rally is part of a nation-wide programme being led by newly inducted central ministers. Yadav, a Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan, who holds the environment ministry, is the fourth minister from the state including Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, minister of state for culture Arjun Ram Meghwal and MoS for agriculture Kailesh Choudhary. Political commentator Avadhesh Akodia said Yadav is the closest leader to Modi and home minister Amit Shah from the state. “It is a testing time for the backroom strategist to plunge into mainstream politics. Here is the entry of another stalwart in the top league of state BJP leaders. Having the longest experience of serving the organisation among all leaders in the state, it should be seen as a beginning of his presence in Rajasthan,” said Akodia. Notably, Yadav held a rally in Narnaul in Haryana with CM Manohar Lal Khattar on August 16 and received a warm reception from locals. Many raised slogans of him as the next CM of Haryana. Former CM Vasundhara Raje played a key role in his nomination to Rajya Sabha in 2012. Yadav was known for planning Raje’s Swaraj Sankalp Yatra in the 2013 assembly polls. He, however, was not much involved in the assembly elections in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/union-minister-yadav-to-lead-jan-ashirwad-yatra-in-state/articleshow/85442124.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Rajya Sabha member Kirori Lal Meena cancels plan to hoist tricolour on temple||JAIPUR: Rajya Sabha member Kirori Lal Meena on Wednesday called off his ‘Tiranga Yatra’ from Dausa to Kho Nagaurian (KN) in Jaipur to hoist the tricolour at a temple dedicated to Lord Meen on August 21. Meena had announced to hoist the tricolor to register his protest against alleged encroachment at Kho Gang, a historical site that belonged to Meena rulers. Kho Gang, now known as Kho Nagaurian, is dominated by the minority community which has made the matter sensitive for the local administration. The move comes after members of the minority community offered to resolve the issue amicably earlier in the day and declared it over within an hour. Thereafter, Meena along with the members of the Muslim community, reached the Khadim area to hoist the national flag. “The issue is over on a very high note. It scripted a new chapter in Hindu-Muslim unity. Almost all our demands have been met,” said Meena while addressing a joint gathering of Hindus and Muslims at the temple site. Meena had declared to hoist the Meen flag at Awasari Mata temple located at Badli Talai in Kho Nagaurain to register his protest against the alleged encroachments in the land he claimed belonged to the rulers of the Meena community. The flashpoint between the two communities was land that the minority community had claimed belonged to a madarsa. “The madarsa land will now be used for parking. Collective effort will be made to get a government land for the madarsa,” said Satish Meena, spokesperson of the RS MP. Soon after the agreement, both the communities under the leadership of the MP went to the site to hoist the tricolor together. Also, it was decided that both the communities will make sincere efforts to stop encroachments of land in the area. Satish Meena said the area belonged to Meena ruler Aalan Singh over 350 years ago. “The place has sites of sanctity for the Meena communities like temples, monuments and community centres,” said Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mp-meena-cancels-plan-to-hoist-tricolour-on-temple/articleshow/85442134.cms||---

These minors would be followed up for six months after being inoculated with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart.The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine — NVX-CoV2373 — developed by the American biotechnology firm Novavax, has been branded Covovax in India. It would be the fourth Covid-19 vaccine to undergo a clinical trial for children in India.Vaccine major Serum Institute of India is partnering with Novovax to launch Covovax for adults in India by September, and for children by the end of this year. The country’s regulator, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), has given the go-ahead to the paediatric trials for 920 minors at 10 sites across the country.According to the trial design, enrolment of the minors aged 12-17 would be done first, followed by those in the 2-11 age group.“Children in Pune would be the first to be enrolled within the next two weeks. Trial sites in Mumbai, Nagpur, Wardha, Mysuru, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, New Delhi and Bhubaneswar would kickstart the recruiting process thereafter,” said a senior SII official.Confirming the development, Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani said, “We will be enrolling about 150 children initially and have obtained the hospital ethics committee’s permission. The parents can enrol their wards by visiting the hospital’s paediatrics department.”Bharati Hospital’s medical expert Sonali Palkar will enrol the children in both age groups in Pune.KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch trial site chief investigator and gastroenterologist Ashish Bavadekar said, “Eligible children primarily living in Vadu in the rural parts of Pune would be enrolled for the trial. We are aiming to enrol 100 children initially.”Vadu village in Pune’s Shirur taluka is 32km from the city. “We will prefer eligible children from Vadu village as this will facilitate their monitoring post-inoculation,” Bavadekar said.SII would submit the interim trial findings on safety and immunogenicity after three months of the advanced clinical trial for licensure.According to the latest guidelines of the DCGI, the company can apply for a licence of the vaccine before the completion of the trials, based on the global test results.The child cohort comprises about 13 to 14 crore population. India would need about 25-26 crore doses for them, experts said.HL: ABOUT 26 CRORE DOSES NEEDED FOR CHILD COHORTThe child cohort is not a small cohort comprising about 13 to 14 crore population, and for which India will need about 25-26 crore dosesZydus Cadila has concluded its trials for those aged between 12 and 18 years, and has applied for emergency use authorisation of its DNA-plasmid vaccineAt present, Phase II and III trials of Covaxin are going on for children in the age group of 2-18 years. The results are likely to be available very soon“By September or just after it, India may have Covid-19 vaccines for children,” said an expert from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)OBJECTIVE OF TRIALS IN KIDSThe primary objective of the trials of Covovax in children in India is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine among childrenSeven days after the first dose for 25 participants (children of 12 to 17 years), safety data would be reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)Based on its recommendation, the study would progress by recruiting the remaining participantsAfter the completion of recruiting participants in Group 1 (12 to 17 years), the recruitment of participants for Group 2 (two to 11 years) would beginThe same process would be repeated in Group 2TWO OUT OF EIGHT SITES IN PUNE8 sites for Covovax paediatric trials2 are in Pune — Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch3 more sites — Nair Hospital (Mumbai), Government Medical College (Nagpur) and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (Wardha) — are in Maharashtra5 other paediatric trail sites of Covovax in the country are Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (Bengaluru), JSS Medical College and Hospital (Mysuru), Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) Chandigarh, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences & Research (HIMSR) in New Delhi and Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (Bhubaneswar)(Source: Serum Institute of India, Pune)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/done2-sites-in-pune-to-start-enrolling-children-for-covovax-trial-within-2-weeks-sii/articleshow/85440029.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||Delhi: 16 reasons why efforts to clean up Yamuna are going down the drain||NEW DELHI: A report by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on the assessment of water quality of drains says 16 out of the 30 drains that discharge into the Yamuna are not meeting the prescribed parameters of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).  Some drains are also flouting prescribed standards of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS). Apart from analysing the Yamuna water quality at eight sites, DPCC took samples from the drains to identify the polluting ones. The latest water quality status report, which is based on the samples collected in June, stated the Sweeper Colony drain was the most polluted. It contributed 120mg/l BOD, 544mg/lCOD and 310mg/lTSS. The prescribed standards for drains are 30mg/l for BOD, 250mg/l for COD and 100mg/l for TSS. Two more drains, which did not meet the prescribed standards of COD, were Molarband (384mg/l) and Metcalf House (256 mg/l) drains. Nine drains failed to meet TSS parameters. A DPCC official said, “As each drain gets trapped, the improvement in water quality is accessed through these parameters. Many minor drains get merged with major drains and hence, the assessment of water quality helps in identification of minor drains that discharge a heavy load of pollutants ending up in the river.” The analysis will also help in identifying from where sewage is entering into the system or industrial areas that discharge untreated effluents into the river, he added. The monthly report is shared with various authorities to help them improve the water quality. According to officials, there are 18 major drains that fall into the Yamuna in the stretch between Wazirabad and Okhla in Delhi. “Of these, trap has been completed in 13 drains and two major drains — Najafgarh and Shahdara — are included in Interceptor Sewer Project where substantial flow of sub-drains under their command areas will be trapped and treated. Further, in situ treatment in these drains are also being proposed,” said a report submitted by the environment department to the Union jal shakti ministry. The report stated that for the remaining three drains, an action plan has been prepared, which requires construction of sewage treatment plants (STPs) at the mouth of two drains, Mori Gate and Barapullah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/16-reasons-why-efforts-to-clean-up-yamuna-are-going-down-the-drain/articleshow/85442204.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Madurai||HC reprieve for advocate who filed PIL hiding facts||Madurai: Dismissing a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought to stop police officials from imposing wrong and improper fines on the vehicles under the Motor Vehicles Act, the Madras high court on Wednesday let off a junior advocate without imposing cost for filing this petition by suppressing certain facts.The court was hearing the petition filed by K Chinraj, of Tuticorin district, who appeared as party-in-person. He stated that the Madurai district police had wrongly imposed a fine of Rs 200 for not wearing a helmet, claiming that he was at his native place at Kovilpatti on the date of occurrence. Though he paid the fine amount, he had filed this petition to prevent such wrongful fines being imposed.A division bench of Justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that on a careful consideration of materials available on record, it could be seen that the petition is not a public interest litigation. The petition involves personal interest of the petitioner as the vehicle inspection record produced by him itself would establish that he himself was driving a two-wheeler without helmet during the complete Covid-19 lockdown period on July 15, 2020, for which a fine was imposed on him.The judges observed that when the petitioner is involved in traffic violation, the writ petition cannot be entertained. It is also brought to the notice of this court by government counsel that the petitioner, for the very same occurrence, had also earlier filed a civil revision petition before a single bench challenging the fine which was imposed on him by the police.The judges observed that the petitioner chose not to divulge anything about the pendency of the civil revision petition while filing this present PIL, which is a clear suppression of material fact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-reprieve-for-advocate-who-filed-pil-hiding-facts/articleshow/85440091.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Pune||WPR still higher than state average in 7 out of 11 ‘dists of concern’: Tope||Pune: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said seven out of 11 “districts of concern” continue to register higher weekly positivity rate (WPR) than the state average of 2.44%.“There should be no districts of concern. When the state has granted relaxations, it is up to the local administration to keep a close watch and ensure that the WPR does not increase,” he said after the state cabinet meeting.The seven districts recording higher WPR than the state average are Satara (5.43%), Sangli (4.83%), Ahmednagar (4.42%), Pune (4.37%), Osmanabad (3.89%), Solapur (3.29%) and Sindhudurg (3.16%). Tope said local administrations should strive to reduce WPR in these districts.“Unless Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed strictly, WPR will rise. These districts would be closely monitored every week. The local administration would decide on curbs if there is a sudden spurt in cases in these places. Ideally, WPR should be below 5%,” Tope said.Stressing that there was an overall decrease in Covid cases in the state, Tope said these districts of concern should not remain so. Only then, he said, people of these areas could reap benefits of relaxations adhering to all the protocols. “The only way forward is to increase vaccination and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said.State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI that the second wave of Covid seemed to have waned in the state with a drastic drop in daily cases from 8,000 to 4,000 and dip in active cases. “Initially, there were 11 districts of concern which has now dropped to seven. There should be no districts of concern remaining.”Joshi said, “It is a good sign that there are more green zones, but one should remember that there is a sprinkle of Delta-plus variant according to the genomic surveillance report, and active Delta virus in circulation. The local administration should take its cognisance as they announce relaxations.”Joshi said, “The current focus should be on aggressive vaccination and double-masking for the state. We do expect some degree of herd immunity threshold and hope that no new variant disrupts the current trend now. We need to be careful and should not allow complacency to seep in.”State task force member and technical adviser Dr Subhash Salunkhe called for an intensive surveillance and genome sequencing in the “districts of concern”.Experts stressed that while relaxations were being announced, places of concern should be monitored very closely for mortality and WPR. They also stressed on genome sequencing, surveillance for SARI and increase of cases, especially in the rural areas.(GRaphic matter for Page 1)HL: ABOVE AVERAGEDistrict Weekly positivity rateSatara 5.43%Sangli 4.83%Ahmednagar 4.42%Pune 4.37%Osmanabad 3.89%Solapur 3.29%Sindhudurg 3.16%Maharashtra 2.44%||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wpr-still-higher-than-state-average-in-7-out-of-11-dists-of-concern-tope/articleshow/85440070.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Jodhpur in-charge Ramlal Jat, who is at the centre of these allegations, is accused of giving tickets to candidates with hardly any chances of winning. The allegations have been levelled by ex-MP Badriram Jakhar, one of the confidantes of chief minister Ashok Gehlot. He claimed that Jat had given tickets to candidates in his constituency under the pressure of Osian legislator Divya Maderna and hardly any of the candidates has any winning potential. “The observers have the duty of selecting appropriate candidates on the basis of their potential. But both the observers, Jat and Prashant Bairwa, gave tickets under Divya’s pressure in Bhopalgarh area. Why should she be intervening in this area instead of Osian,” Jakhar said. Jat refuted the allegations and said the tickets had been given on the basis of merit and allegations of partiality or influence are baseless. Both Jakhar and Maderna families are political rivals and with these elections, this rivalry has once again come into the open. While Jakhar has been putting his might for the victory of his daughter Munni Devi for the post of zila pramukh, Divya’s mother Leela Maderna has also thrown her hat to become zila pramukh. Both are trying their best to pave the way for their respective family members for the coveted seat. These allegations, however, are not limited to Jodhpur only. Former zila parishad member from Sirohi, Pukhraj Gehlot, has also accused Jat of irregularities in ticket distribution. He went on to challenge that if his allegations were found baseless, he would polish shoes outside the AICC for the rest of his life. He also charged PCC secretary Nimbaram of giving five tickets against a huge sum and claimed that the deals had taken place in Rajsamand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ticket-distribution-sets-off-dissidence-in-cong/articleshow/85442192.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Lens on the past, eye on the future||On World Photography Day, Ashish Bhonde writes how he cannot resist capturing the play between old buildings, nature and humansNagpur: Eons have gone by and all that is left now are echoes of our past. Strewn across our land, we find pieces of architecture with innumerable stories, people and cultures. They leave us wondering about civilisations erased by time. Whispers haunt us, footprints question us, compel us to stop and ponder our situation and journey into the future. There photographs here too capture the magical essence that binds our history, heritage, and omnipresent nature so very powerfully with mankind.Looking through the camera lens, we may catch nature, architecture, and people engrossed in a dialogue. Associations of heritage have formed between people, structures and natural surroundings, to eventually become inseparable. These spaces engage and magically transport us into one large frame of time and space where, even if I am living in the 21st century, I am surrounded by tales and experiences passed down over centuries.What caught my attention was the powerful presence of nature. Especially in untouched spaces, where time has the liberty to blur natural and manmade elements. History and heritage highlight interdependency of nature, man and architecture. Each photograph tells us a unique experience I shared with the peaceful presence of water, the reflections of the stoic built forms, wild growth of trees and groves, the all encompassing skies and the immense sprawl of civilisation answering my thoughts and raising more questions.Up close, the architectural creations, sadly abandoned, captured my attention with their sensitive planning and response to context. The indigenous materials used, the age old courtyard planning to control natural ventilation and regulate micro climate, the fantastic engineering for water supply and sewage canals, the use of openings to let in natural light and vantage points to observe the surroundings, a flawless blend of interactive spaces inside and outside, the attention to structural details made it possible for the buildings to survive centuries. The scale and proportion of all elements, the functional planning of the buildings, it was a pleasure to clasp these moments and freeze them in photographs. The ingenuity of such structures has to be protected, just like we nurture our people. Their legacy, heritage, peculiarities tell us what ought to be passed onto next generations. We can only make an humble attempt to offer testimony to these spatial gems of history and architecture.In contrast to these frozen moments of time and architecture, today’s world — rushing towards unseen goals and ambitions, ever increasing use of technology, unconsciously hurls us away from simplicity and grace of life. The art of appreciating simple things, calmness in the presence of nature and simply realising the beauty of life is somewhat disappearing. Photographs tell us to take a pause, look back, stay still and breathe in the space and time together, and admire and cherish the coexistence of nature, architecture and mankind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lens-on-the-past-eye-on-the-future/articleshow/85440061.cms||---

Moreover, given the slippery surface of the highway beneath the Dwarka flyover, the police had to shut the road for vehicular traffic.Since Tuesday, parts of the city have been getting light to moderate rainfall and the effect of the same could be seen on the roads that were damaged in many places. On Wednesday, motorists were seen negotiating the potholes on the wet roads.A large number of bikers lost balance and fell on the road beneath the Dwarka flyover made slick due to the accumulated slush. As a result, the police had to shut down a stretch of the highway beneath the Dwarka flyover to avoid road accidents.ACP Seetaram Gaikwad, of the city traffic branch, also said that traffic was moving slowly due to the rain and wet roads.Commuters said it was frustrating to see the road condition deteriorate so fast at the slightest hint of rain in the city.“Riding a scooter becomes difficult on roads riddled with potholes. The threat of falling while going over the potholes or a speeding vehicle running you over from behind is always there. Therefore, when it rains, going to work on a two-wheeler is always worrisome,” said Wilson Umap, a resident of the Nashik Road area.In the Panchavati area, residents called up the fire brigade department to clear the mud off the road to prevent bike accidents.The police said that motorists should not speed on wet roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rain-leaves-nashik-roads-slick-slushy-pothole-riddled/articleshow/85436578.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Though they broke the shutter and walls of the bank, the thieves did not touch the Rs 6.95 lakh kept in the locker. They, however, took away the DVR of the CCTV. The incident came to light on Wednesday morning following which bank personnel informed police. Police are investigating a case of lakhs of rupees of loans disbursed through fake documents, an FIR for which was lodged recently. According to information from Ramgarh police, the thieves entered by breaking the shutter of the back door and broke the lock of the chest room in which lakhs of rupees were kept. They did not touch the cash almirah but searched files kept in another almirah. There was another almirah in which all files of the loans that were approved were kept. In those files, original documents of the lands and fields were kept. The thieves tried to break that almirah, but could not succeed. While leaving, they took away the CCTV recorder with them.

A division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi observed that the statutes mandate the local bodies to provide and maintain the public toilets in a neat and clean manner. Free public toilets in adequate numbers with all facilities should be provided across the state. Steps should also be taken to publicise about the locations of these toilets. The judges directed the state government to conduct a survey on the existing public toilets to ensure that they are functional. If some are not functional, then appropriate steps should be taken to make them functional. The judges observed that the maintenance of public toilets shall be carried out by engaging NGOs and by getting sponsorship or by making advertisements on the walls of the toilets. The judges further directed the state to put in place a complaint mechanism to monitor and ensure maintenance of public toilets in a clean and hygienic manner. All the public toilets should be cleaned regularly. Responsibility should also be fixed on the authorities concerned for the proper maintenance of the toilets. People should be sensitised on the proper usage of the public toilets. Instructions shall be displayed wherever possible, said the judges. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest petition filed by P Saravanan from Madurai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/provide-neat-clean-public-toilets-across-state-hc-tells-state-govt/articleshow/85440079.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Delhi||Connected on the go: Your call may not drop in Delhi Metro||NEW DELHI: There’s good news for Delhi Metro commuters, particularly those who use the south Delhi stretch of the Magenta Line (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West). The problem of poor mobile connectivity and frequent call drops in this sector could be a thing of the past with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation licensing space for the installation of telecom towers. To improve the perennial problem of poor cell-phone connectivity, DMRC has already provided space for mobile towers in other locations. Nearly 100 towers have come up along the busy Blue Line corridor (Dwarka-Noida City Centre/Vaishali) and Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli-HUDA City Centre). Now DMRC plans to license space for telecom towers or masts at 20 more locations, including 15 metro stations and five train depots. These would mostly be at the Magenta Line stations Vasant Vihar, Jamia Millia Islamia, Okhla Vihar, Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Kalkaji Mandir, Dashrath Puri and the Kalindi Kunj train depot. The oldest corridor of the Red Line (Rithala-Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda) will see mobile towers coming up at the busy stations at Kashmere Gate, Tis Hazari, Netaji Subhash Place and Dilshad Garden, apart from the Shastri Park train depot. Other locations where mobile towers are going to be installed are at the Blue Line’s RK Ashram Marg station and Supreme Court (Pragati Maidan) station, apart from the Yamuna Bank train depot I and depot II and the Najafgarh train depot. Two stations on the Violet Line (Kashmere Gate-Ballabhgarh), Raja Nahar Singh and Sant Surdas (Sihi), and the Badli depot of Yellow Line will also get the towers. DMRC will be licensing out a bare plot of approximately 8 square metres at each location to be used to erect the telecom towers. The licensing of these spaces will help DMRC augment its non-operational revenue while providing mobile coverage on the station premises and its periphery for commuters using the urban rail network. The licensed sites and locations, however, will remain with DMRC, without ceding any right, title or interest of any nature in favour of the licensee. The licensee will also have to ensure compliance with permissible radiation limits for mobile towers as laid down by the municipal corporations, Delhi government, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the central government’s Department of Telecommunications from time to time. While DMRC has been carrying out improvement of mobile connectivity at its ‘older’ corridors in the last couple of years, it is now taking the initiative to install mobile towers along the comparatively newer corridors. Sources said that apart from mobile towers at station premises, DMRC also plans more mobile signal booster equipment on various sections of the Magenta and Pink (Shiv Vihar-Majlis Park) Lines that currently suffer poor mobile connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/connected-on-the-go-your-call-may-not-drop-in-metro/articleshow/85440163.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Every year, a large number of tazia processions are conducted in the city on the occasion of Muharram. However, due to the pandemic, no processions are allowed this year in an effort to prevent the further spread of Covid-19. Sajan Sonawane, the senior PI of the Bhadrakali police station, said they have conducted meetings with the Muslim community members and have informed them about the government guidelines against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Muslim community members have been told to offer prayers at their homes and not conduct the processions. Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure, a strict bandobast would be deployed in various parts of the city. Chandrakant Khandvi, the additional SP of Malegaon, also said that meetings have been conducted with the peace committee members who have been informed about the government guidelines. Further, a force of 350 personnel would be deployed across the textile town as a precautionary measure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-police-to-maintain-strict-bandobast-for-muharram-on-friday/articleshow/85436590.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Nashik||Since 2014, 2.5L Nashik patients have taken dial 108 ambulances||Nashik: The ambulances of the ‘dial 108’ service have transported more than 2.5 lakh people with medical emergencies to hospitals in Nashik district in the past seven-and-a-half years. The service was started in January 2014 to provide immediate transportation to people in medical need to hospitals. Under this service, the Bharat Vikas Group (BVG), which operates the ambulances, has stationed 46 ambulances in different parts of the district. On getting calls from the patients or their relatives, these ambulances rush to the residence of the patients to pick them and take them to the nearest government medical facility. Over the past seven-and-a-half years, over 2,700 pregnant women have delivered babies inside the ambulances on their way to hospitals. Dr Ashwin Raghamwar, the zonal manager for Nashik, said, “At the time of joining, all the doctors on the ambulances are given special training in emergency treatment. They are well aware of what needs to be done during emergencies. The deliveries that took place in the ambulances are the cases where the call to the ambulance was made at the last moment.” If the hospital is far, the doctors concerned park the ambulance by the roadside and carry out the delivery. Some parts of the district are extremely remote, therefore, it takes time to reach the hospital. The 46 ambulances, over the past seven-and-a-half years — from January 2014 to June-end 2021 — have ferried 2.48 lakh patients, including 79,324 women in labour or in advanced stages of pregnancy and another 30,687 accident victims. Raghamwar said they had devoted a specific number of ambulances to ferry Covid patients. From March last year to June 2021, as many as 21,836 suspected Covid patients were transferred by the ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/since-2014-2-5l-nashik-patients-have-taken-dial-108-ambulances/articleshow/85436583.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: How Shashi Tharoor’s victory in 2014 silenced his critics||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Sunanda Pushkar death case had cast a shadow on the political life of Shashi Tharoor. This was reflected when there was a campaign against him contesting the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Thiruvananthapuram. Even though he was not favoured by the state leadership then, the party high command stood with Tharoor. However, Tharoor had to sweat it out against BJP’s O Rajagopal in that election. Political pundits had predicted that the women voters would drift away from Tharoor owing to Pushkar’s death. There were also reports that the party machinery was defunct during the campaign. Tharoor’s winning margin also came down from a staggering 99,998 votes in 2009 to a mere 14,501 in 2014. However, this victory helped silence Tharoor’s political critics. Tharoor had started to come out of this negative campaign gradually and the consecutive second victory to the LS polls played a major role in that. But it was the BJP government at the Centre that came to power in 2014 that made things worse for him once again. “BJP was engaged in a personal vendetta against Tharoor. He was haunted by BJP for the last seven years by raising this issue. Even the LDF had raised the death of his wife as a major campaign issue during the elections then. Both BJP and CPM should apologize to Tharoor,” said K Sudhakaran, KPCC president. Despite all campaigns against him, the high command stood by him is reflected in the fact that he was given the charge of preparing the party’s manifesto in the recent assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tharoors-victory-in-2014-silenced-his-critics/articleshow/85440156.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Support staff queue up for Lakshmir Bhandar in villages, leave city homes help-less||Kolkata: Household help have been taking days off to queue up for the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme that has been floated by the state government. Queues are getting long and often, applicants are being asked to return on the next available date, leading many of them to come up with the request for additional days of leave, making it difficult for employers, especially those who are working from home and are dependent on their support staff. Some of these help, who live with the families they work for, have their homes in far-off districts and have to go away for at least three to four days to get themselves enlisted in the state government scheme, under which, they are promised financial assistance of Rs 500-Rs 1,000 a month. Those belonging to SC/ST will be given Rs 1,000 a month and others Rs 500. These women also need to have individual zero-balance bank accounts. Employers have no choice but to grant the leaves, even though they are worried about the chances of them contracting the virus while travelling or waiting in the queues at the camps. But given that refusing a leave would mean depriving the needy women of a monthly amount from the government, most families agreed to let them go, but not without a word of caution to stay safe. Purnima Naskar, who sweeps and swabs at five houses in the Bikramgarh area of Jadavpur, said though she did not have a scheduled caste certificate, which would have earned her Rs 1,000 a month under the scheme, she was not willing to miss the chance of a guaranteed Rs 500 every month in her account. “I took leave because I live in Dabui, far from Canning. I cannot queue up from 4.30am and then go to work the same day. All my employers initially refused but I said if they increased my pay to make up for the loss, I would not go. Finally, they allowed me,” she said. Homemaker Suvra Paul allowed both her cook and help to go on the same day despite her being unwell. “This is being done ward-wise. Though they live in two different wards, both Kanika, who cooks at my place, and Hasina Bibi, who helps out with other chores, took leave the same day. Kanika’s was not done and she has asked for leave on September 6 again,” Pal said. School principal Vijay Lakshmi Kumar found it difficult when her cook, Bharati Biswas, asked for at least three days’ leave since she had to go to Bongaon for the scheme. “There is a humanitarian side to the whole thing and hence, one cannot but relent. But it is difficult to manage without a help, especially when you are overworked running a school on the virtual mode,” she said. “Can I help it? How can I let so much money go? I am happy madam agreed,” Bharati said. Anasuya Banerjee, who runs a dance academy on Harish Mukherjee Road, said that she was a great fan of the chief minister, who was a neighbour. “I will definitely have problems releasing my cook for a day because I have two children at home and I also run an academy. However, as a supporter of all the CM’s social schemes, I will allow her to go,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/support-staff-queue-up-for-lakshmir-bhandar-in-villages-leave-city-homes-help-less/articleshow/85440105.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Mumbai||3 FIRs against organisers of yatra for flouting norms||MUMBAI/KALYAN: The BJP’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra (JAY) has become the latest flashpoint in the conflict between the party and its former ally, the Shiv Sena. On Wednesday, Sena MP Sanjay Raut alleged the yatra would be “an invitation to the third wave of Covid.” The Jan Ashirwad Yatra was launched a week ago by recently inducted ministers of state in the Union cabinet Kapil Patil, Bharti Pawar and Bhagwat Karad from the BJP. Speaking to the media, Sena’s Raut said, “Everyone knows that ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ is nothing but a show of strength and will be an invitation for the third wave of Covid. But it is being done deliberately to trouble the state government.” Responding to Raut, BJP’s Kapil Patil said, “There are always huge crowds at Sena’s programs. So doesn’t Covid spread in Sena rallies? If BJP does something, how does Corona get an invitation immediately?” He claimed around 8,000-10,000 people had gathered at the Sena’s event in Pune recently. Later in the day, Thane police registered three separate FIRs in three different police stations in Kalyan-Dombivli against the organisers for alleged violation of Covid-19 norms. Meanwhile, during the presentation on the Covid situation in the cabinet meeting, Thackeray said that at least ruling parties should follow all Covid protocols while organising any event and should avoid political events. “People are organising social, political, religious and other events without following Covid protocols. Considering the festive season ahead, everyone should take care and not violate Covid norms. If you cannot become a Covid warrior, at least do not be a Covid spreader,” said a statement from CM Thackeray’s office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-firs-against-organisers-of-yatra-for-flouting-norms/articleshow/85442271.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The high court also said the allegation by the accused that the woman was extorting money from him inflicts “more pain to her injury”. “No doubt, the victim is an educated lady, but is an educated person immune to cheating. The answer would be ‘no’,” said Justice Yogesh Khanna while dismissing the anticipatory bail plea of the man. The court said the facts showed the man and the woman did have such relations to kindle a hope in her that he would marry her at all costs, which was not illogical for her to think so. “Can he be allowed to play with her dignity on the pretext that he cohabited with her just for fun and later claim she is extorting money from him. Such allegations if not backed with proof are rather insulting,” the judge said. The court said the investigation so far had revealed that he was trying to influence his subordinates and had destroyed or deleted the evidence against him. According to the woman complainant, the accused established physical relations with her between December 2019 and January 2020 on the promise of marriage. The accused claimed that they both were friends and she was obsessed with him and wanted to extract money from him and also denied having any physical relations with her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-rejects-navy-officers-plea-for-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/85442302.cms||---

---||Madurai||‘Dismiss priests who dont know Sanskrit’||Madurai: The Tamil Nadu government should identify priests working in 32,000 temples, who are not qualified in Sanskrit and conduct an examination for them so that only those who pass are allowed to continue in service, Tamil Desiya Iyakkam leader Pazha Nedumaran has said. He said that this is necessary as many who are opposing the government’s move to make people from all communities as archakars, are doing it on the basis that the priests do not know Sanskrit which is the language of the agamas. In a statement, Nedumaran said that the Tamil Nadu government’s move was a great stride towards social justice. Priests who underwent training in the archakar schools which were run by the Tamil Nadu government were trained in the agamas and Tamil pujas, and they were appointed in 38 temples. This is a laudable achievement of chief mMinister M K Stalin. But, some people like BJP leader Subramanian Swamy were opposing this decision and demanding the government withdraw it, which is baseless. Nedumaran said that according to the 2011 census, the number of people who knew to read and write Sanskrit in the population of 133 crore, was just 24,821. The number of people who were qualified in Sanskrit in Tamil Nadu as per the census was 803. Among them, 402 were males and 401 females. As women are not allowed to serve in temples, only the 402 males who knew could have served in temples in Tamil Nadu. This shows that most of the priests in the 32,000 temples do not know Sanskrit and that they are reciting the agamas, by writing them in Tamil. This is a blatant violation and as they do not do it in Sanskrit there could be pronunciation errors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dismiss-priests-who-dont-know-sanskrit/articleshow/85440223.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Vaccination for kids may be available by September or soon after: Director of Pune’s ICMR-NIV||MUMBAI: Phase II and III trials of Covaxin for paediatric use are now on and the vaccine could be available for this age group by September or soon after, said Dr Priya Abraham, director of Pune’s ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV). She said vaccination for children is much awaited given the fear that a potential third wave could affect children disproportionately. On mixing and matching vaccines, she said studies in NIV didn’t find any safety issue and they would reveal more information shortly. A third wave could be averted if people continue to mask and get vaccinated as studies show that even with reduced efficacy against variants, vaccines work to prevent serious disease, Abraham said. Q: How much has the Covaxin trial on children advanced and when can a vaccine be expected?Abraham: Phase II and III trials of Covaxin are on for children between 2-18 years. Hopefully, the results will be available soon. They will be presented to the regulators. So, by September or just after it, we may have Covid-19 vaccines for children. This apart, Zydus Cadila’s vaccine trial is also going on for children. Q: Apart from these, what other vaccines are in the pipeline?A: Zydus Cadila’s vaccine will be the first DNA vaccine available for use. Besides, there is Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Ltd’s m-RNA vaccine, Biological-E vaccine, Serum Institute’s Novovax and another interesting one–an intranasal vaccine by Bharat Biotech, which does not require a jab and can be delivered through nostrils. Q: Are available vaccines effective on the Delta-Plus variant?A: Firstly, the Delta-plus variant is less likely to spread than Delta, which is present in over 130 countries. In NIV, we have studied antibodies produced in vaccinated people and checked it against this variant. Efficacy of antibodies against Delta reduces two-three folds. Yet, the vaccines are protective against the variants. They may show little less efficacy but are important to prevent serious disease. Q: Will we require a booster dose? Is any study being done?A: Studies have been going on overseas. At least seven different vaccines have been tried out for booster dose. Now, the WHO has put a stop to it till more countries catch up with vaccination. But, in the future, recommendations for boosters will definitely come. Q: Is mixing and matching of vaccines studied?A: There was a situation where inadvertently two different vaccines were given in two doses. We have tested those samples at NIV and found that the patients were safe. No adverse effect was noted, and immunogenicity was a little better. We are studying this phenomenon and will be able to give more details in a few days’ time. Q: Self-testing kits have come to market. Will it pace up testing?A: Self-testing kits are antigen testing kits and so, their sensitivity is inferior to the RT-PCR method. The sensitivity is likely to be more in symptomatic patients. Q: Can people infected by Bird-Flu or Zika Virus become susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection?A: Bird flu and zika virus are unrelated to coronavirus. But one commonality between HINI bird flu or swine flu virus and SARS-CoV-2 is that their spread is prevented by use of masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene and cough etiquette. Zika spreads through mosquito bites. Q: Is it possible that no other wave will come?A: New variants will keep coming. We have two weapons—masking and vaccination.(Excerpts from PIB interview)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-for-kids-may-be-available-by-sept-or-soon-after/articleshow/85440215.cms||---

---||Thane||Maharashtra: 7 of 11 ‘districts of concern’ still a worry, 4 out of basket||MUMBAI: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said seven out of the 11 “districts of concern” continued to register higher weekly positivity rates than the state average of 2.44%. “There should be no districts of concern. When the state has granted relaxations, it is up to the local administration to keep a close watch and ensure the weekly positivity rate (WPR) does not increase,” he said after a cabinet meeting. The seven districts recording higher WPR than the state average are Satara (5.4%), Sangli (4.8%), Ahmednagar (4.4%), Pune (4.4%), Osmanabad (3.9%), Solapur (3.3%) and Sindhudurg (3.2%). Tope said local administrations should strive to reduce WPR in these districts. The other four districts that made up the worrisome 11 --- Raigad, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri and Beed -- have now achieved very low WPR and dropped out of that basket. “There needs to be a close watch on these seven districts. Unless Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed strictly, WPR will rise. These districts will be closely monitored every week. The local administration will decide on curbs if there is a sudden spurt in cases in these places,” said the state health minister. Stressing that there was an overall decrease in Covid cases in the state, Tope said these districts of concern should not remain so. Only then, he said, people of these areas could reap benefits of relaxations adhering to all the protocols. “The only way forward is to increase vaccination and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Tope said. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI that the second wave seemed to have waned in the state with a drastic drop in daily cases from 8,000 to 4,000 and a dip in active cases. “Initially, there were 11 districts of concern. The number has now dropped to seven. There should be no districts of concern remaining.” He said, “It is a good sign that there are more green zones, but one should remember that there is a sprinkling of Delta-plus variant according to the genomic surveillance report, and active Delta virus in circulation. The local administration should take cognisance as they announce relaxations.” Joshi added: “The current focus should be on aggressive vaccination and double-masking for the state. We do expect some degree of herd immunity threshold and hoping that no new variant disrupts the current trend now. We need to be careful and should not allow complacency to seep in.” State task force member and technical adviser Dr Subhash Salunkhe called for intensive surveillance and genome sequencing in the “districts of concern”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/7-of-11-districts-of-concern-still-a-worry-4-out-of-basket/articleshow/85445945.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Six riders from Karnataka, five from Maharashtra, three from Hyderabad, two from Tamil Nadu and one from Kerala travelled an average of 140 km per day (maximum being 240 kms) on Royal Enfield 500, Bajaj Avenger and Royal Enfield Himalayan bikes. They faced multiple challenges, including altitude sickness, emotional and technical breakdowns only to emerge stronger like never before. The youngest rider was 24-years-old and the eldest was 48. Sameera Dahiya, co-founder of The Endless Trail, a Bengaluru-based platform that introduces and trains women on adventure motorcycle riding, said, other than making women feel empowered, the purpose of the ride is to spread awareness about sustainable travelling, no littering and to protect the environment. Being part of several motorcycle expeditions across India during the last five years, Sameera decided to organise this trip after Delhi based K2K Expedition came forward to provide road support. “For every rider, doing the Leh-Ladak trip is a dream. After six months of planning, we hit the roads to create memories at some of the beautiful places like Turtuk, Nubra Valley, crossing the Khardung La, a mountain pass and create new friendship bonds. The support team was catering to an all-women group for the first time and had been a good help for all riders to stay consistent on the road,” said Sameera. The riders used to hit the roads by 6.30am and ride up to 6pm every day. The women received a warm welcome at most places and they shared their experiences with the Ladakh tourism department. The stayed in tents and hotels, and they were also hosted by the Kargil tourism as part of a tourism promotion drive and by a motorcycle group in Srinagar. The team underwent RT-PCR tests twice during the ride.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/17-women-on-15-motorcycles-take-adventure-trip-from-sonmarg-to-manali/articleshow/85436625.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

---||Madurai||Nithyananda says he is now Adheenam pontiff||Madurai: Ahead of the official appointment of junior pontiff Sundaramoorthy Thambiran as the head of Madurai Adheenam, fugitive godman Nithyananda created a stir on Wednesday by declaring himself as the 293rd chief pontiff of the 1,500-year-old mutt. The 292nd pontiff of the Adheenam, Arunagirinatha Gnanasambantha Desika Paramacharya Swamigal, had passed away after an illness on August 13. Junior pontiff Sundaramoorthy Thambiran has been performing the mutt’s duties and rituals after ever since. According to the mutt, he is scheduled to take over as chief pontiff at a formal ceremony on August 23. Nithyananda was appointed junior pontiff of the mutt by Arunagirinathar Swamigal in August 2012 but was removed in October that year as part of disciplinary action. Claiming to have assumed the position of the 293rd pontiff, he said he would bless the people through virtual sessions. The godman who claims to live in an “island nation called Kailaasa” has remained untraced ever since charges of rape and abduction were raised against him. Sundaramoorthy Thambiran who is to take charge as pontiff would be known as Sri la Sri, Harihara Sri Gnanasambantha Desiga Paramacharya Swamigal. Born on March 25, 1954 in Tirunelveli and named Bhagawathy Lakshmanan by his parents, the junior pontiff has served in Kundrakudi Adheenam as junior pontiff in 1975 and in the Dharmapuram Adheenam for five years. Thereafter, he served as senior pontiff in Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam for 35 years before being appointed junior pontiff of Madurai Adheenam on June 6, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nithyananda-says-he-is-now-adheenam-pontiff/articleshow/85440231.cms||---

He also said that the issue with regard to “essential services” at the Secretariat has been conveyed to Jaipur collector Antar Singh Nehra. “A code of conduct is followed during elections (in the state). It has a sanctity of its own. We don’t interfere or issue orders in such matters. Some employees came to me saying that election duties were not assigned (to secretariat employees) earlier. However, this time they have been assigned duties. Some activities/work at the Secretariat come under the category of essential services. Keeping this in mind, the matter was brought to his (collector) notice.” However, district collector Antar Singh Nehra refused to cancel election duties of all employees saying “cancellation of election duties will be done on merit basis” based on essential requirements at the Secretariat. Meghraj Panwar, president of secretariat employees’ association said, “We have raised the issue with the chief secretary. They (the government) may send a letter to the collector. Now, let’s see what action the collector takes. Every work at the Secretariat comes under the category of essential services.” There are about 3,000 employees at the Secretariat.  In all, 5826 candidates were left in the fray after scrutiny and withdrawal of nomination papers for elections to the posts of 200 zila parishad members and 1,564 panchayat samiti members in 6 districts of the state. While 653 candidates were in the fray for zila parishad member polls, 5173 candidates will fight for the posts of panchayat samiti members.

---||Nashik||Minister orders probe into death of PG student at Nashik med college||NASHIK: Maharashtra medical education minister Amit Deshmukh has ordered a probe into the circumstances leading to the death of a 26-year-old second-year postgraduate student of a private medical college here on Tuesday. Deshmukh told TOI that a joint team comprising officials from state medical education department, directorate of medical education and research (DMER) and Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) will conduct the investigation. “The team will submit its report as soon as possible,” he said. The student, Dr Swapnil Shinde, of Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital & Research Centre, died at the hospital’s intensive care unit on Tuesday night. He was from Beed district and the only son of his parents. The institute’s dean, Dr Mrunal Patil, said Shinde was to work at the hospital on Tuesday morning. “When he went to the washroom in the morning, the staff heard a huge noise. They broke open the door and found him lying on the floor in a semi-conscious state. He suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away on Tuesday night,” Patil added. Shinde’s body has been sent to the Nashik civil hospital for an autopsy. Shinde’s uncle, Baliram Rakshe, alleged that he was under stress and blamed two senior female post-graduate students of the same college for giving him too much work. “Swapnil was a bright student and the two women were jealous of him. They used to overload Swapnil with work. If he erred, both would taunt him. They would also now allow him to perform surgeries, an important aspect of the medical profession. He was under severe stress for quite some time,” Rakshe said. However, Patil expressed surprise over the family’s allegations. “If Swapnil was facing such problems, he should have told the college authorities. But neither he nor his family told us about this issue. Moreover, all matters related to surgeries are decided by senior faculty members. Our PG students do not have any say,” Patil said. Patil said that Swapnil was on anti-depression drugs as he used to get panic attacks. “During his PG admission, we had examined him physically as we do for all students and had learnt that he suffers from anxiety problems. In fact, in July this year, we allowed his mother to stay with him in our college hostel for this reason,” Patil added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/minister-orders-probe-into-death-of-pg-student-at-nashik-med-college/articleshow/85436614.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Madurai||Madurai bid to turn model district in protecting child rights||Madurai: Madurai district administration is working with Tamil Nadu state commission for the protection of child rights to make the district a model in protecting child rights. On Wednesday, district collector S Aneesh Sekhar addressed VAOs of 420 panchayats in the district who are secretaries of the village-level monitoring committees that were formed by the state government last year for this purpose. While the panchayat president heads the committee and the VAO is the secretary, it has the headmaster of the government school and even children’s representatives among its 12 members. Aneesh Sekhar said that such committees have been formed in the village and zonal level in rural areas and in municipalities and corporation in urban areas. Apart from the district-level committee, he expressed doubts about the functioning of the micro level committees. It is the effective functioning of such micro committees that will ensure protection of child rights, he said.Pressing for a systematic action plan to put an end to crimes against children such as child marriage, sexual abuse and labour, he added that VAOs should be ahead of the police in gathering intelligence on possible crimes against children. State commission member V Ramaraj, who conducted the training programme, said they aim to train 10,000 government and non-government members of the district on the rights of children and functioning of village-level committees to ensure that rights of the nearly 5 lakh children in the district are protected.“The first task is to train 5,000 officials members starting with the secretaries (VAOs), followed by 5,000 more government and non-government members about the roles and responsibilities of the committees,” he said. They are elaborated on school dropouts and crimes such as child marriage, labour, sexual abuse and female infanticide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-bid-to-turn-model-district-in-protecting-child-rights/articleshow/85440239.cms||---

The meeting was chaired by MCC Commissioner Akshy Sridhar, and discussed concerns of street vendors. Street vendors who have approval by the Town Vending Committee and hold valid identification cards and certificates, are permitted to continue doing business under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2021. To bifurcate street vendors based on their trading activities, MCC will be appointing 10 survey teams. A new round of surveys will be held across the city, based on the guidelines specified in the Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Scheme, 2020. Based on the outcome of the survey, the Town Vending Committee shall issue identification cards and trade licences to deserving street vendors. Street vendors with valid IDs and trade licences will be assigned zones to conduct trading activities. These trading zones have been recognised, and the proposal for them to be declared as trade zones is in its final stages, the commissioner said. Stringent measures will be taken against those violating street vending norms by the Mangaluru City Corporation and police department, he said. The MCC sought the cooperation of the Street Vendors Development Association Dakshina Kannada. MCC deputy commissioner Ajith M and members of the Town Vending Committee were present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/concerns-of-street-vendors-discussed-by-mcc/articleshow/85436618.cms||---

Additional sessions judge Anuj Agrawal also imposed a cost of Rs 30,000 on him, to be deposited with Lawyers’ Welfare Fund at Saket Bar Association, for his “mischievous approach”. The petition is a “direct onslaught upon the fundamental rights of the litigants attempting to seek speedy and effective justice”, the court said, calling the man’s approach “insidious and cavalier”. The petitioner’s estranged wife, who lives in Gurgaon, wanted to send their children to a school there as it would be difficult for the kids to attend their previous school in Delhi. A trial court in 2019 had directed him to supply a copy of the transfer certificates. The court said it was in the best interest of the children to study in Gurugram instead of commuting to Delhi every day, which would take a toll on their physical health and mental wellbeing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-raps-man-for-frivolous-plea-over-school-tc/articleshow/85442336.cms||Usha Das

In a video posted on YouTube the two brothers, Ebin Varghese and Libin Varghese, said that they suspect that some mafia are influencing officials by giving money to trap them. The duo alleged that some authorities are spreading false information and creating fabricated evidence to show that they have links to ganja mafia. The two claimed that they had in fact carried out awareness campaign against ganja use. “Our lack of knowledge and emotional attitude were exploited by some. When we intervened in the Assam bus issue after some drivers got stranded in Assam, some mafias had to suffer huge financial losses. We had pointed out that there was large scale transportation of ganja to the state. Now we are being falsely portrayed as having links with ganja mafia,” the brothers said. They alleged that the officials have made use of the modifications made by them to their van as a cover to trap them. Meanwhile, the police have moved the Thalassery court seeking to cancel the bail granted to the two brothers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vloggers-allege-bid-to-trap-them/articleshow/85440235.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Versova beach wall runs into permissions hurdle||MUMBAI: As far back as March 2020, the Maharashtra Maritime Board had written to the public works department to desist from constructing the anti-erosion wall along the Versova beach as no permissions had been sought or granted. The demand for the anti-erosion wall was made by residents around 2015. Versova MLA Bharati Lavekar said residents had complained of erosion and had asked for an anti-erosion wall. TimesViewThe public works department should have repaired and fortified the existing retaining wall along the beach instead of constructing another wall, which would have split the beach in Versova in the middle. Although the demand for an anti-erosion wall came from residents of the area, it is for the government agencies to ascertain the best environment-friendly method to be implemented to contain erosion.“I was newly elected and this was one of the first issues that was brought to me. I had taken it up with the government. There was a survey carried out by the government and it was found that an anti-erosion wall was necessary. Thereafter, I followed up with the state government and the Centre for funds. Union minister Nitin Gadkari agreed to give the major portion of the funds through the Centre and the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis agreed to provide the remainder,” said Lavekar. Lavekar said as an elected representative she had taken up the people’s issue, arranged funds for the same. “It was for the public works department, the environment department and the Maharashtra Maritime Board to work together and ensure all permissions are in place before starting work. Complaints have come now when the work is nearing completion. I have, therefore, asked for a meeting where all stakeholders are present and the issue is sorted out,” she said. Shiv Sena MP from North West Mumbai Gajanan Kirtikar too claimed he had been following up on the matter for an anti-erosion wall for five years as the beach was getting eroded. “The project was approved by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority and is at an advanced stage. There have been complaints that residents are unable to walk on account of the hindrance and suburban guardian minister Aditya Thackeray has stayed the work temporarily. It is my opinion that the anti-erosion wall must be built as well as residents must be able to walk on the beach without hindrance,” he has said in his letter to the public works department. Kiritikar will now take a walk on the beach on August 25 with the authorities and locals to understand the issue. The letter from the MMB to the the PWD stated they had received a complaint from activist Zoru Bhathena about work being carried out without following environmental norms. “For any work along the coast the NOC from the MMB is mandatory. The work on the anti-erosion wall has been undertaken without obtaining the NOC and it must be stopped immediately,” states the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-versova-beach-wall-runs-into-permissions-hurdle/articleshow/85442351.cms||---

Ward 20||MADURAI: Residents in Madurai Corporation’s ward number 20 in Madurai have complained that this ward has one of the worst roads in the city that is narrow due to encroachments, has dislodged paver blocks and is filled with overflowing sewage. Muthuramalingam Thevar Street near the Arasaradi Road is dotted with several shops. It eventually connects to Vellaikannu Theatre Road and smaller streets. While the Vellaikannu Theatre Road, which was re-laid recently, is in good shape, the same cannot be said of others, residents said. Inner roads like the Naval Nagar 1st street, Ponmeni Pudur 2nd street and Nehru Street are so narrow that only two-wheelers can use them. A resident, S Gurumurthy, 29, said, “The roads in this area used to be wide when I was a child, but, now, even children’s toy cycles cannot be ridden on these streets, because they have become so narrow due to encroachments.” The paver blocks on the smaller roads were also frequently dug up for works. “Not even in one road did the workers manage to re-lay the roads properly after the work and hence these roads are inundated with rain water and sewage now,” said Yogeswari, another resident. R Sakthivel, another resident said that the corporation only removes makeshift shops on the roadside, while bigger concrete structures are ignored. “The community hall, constructed over 10 years ago, which is never used, could be turned into a market complex by the corporation to ease the congestion on the roads,” he said. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said that they do not have immediate plans to re-lay the smaller roads and are now working on bigger roads where the major pipeline and underground drainage (UGD) works were underway. “But, we have sought funds, and road works would be taken up when it is received in a phased manner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/where-do-you-see-the-worst-roads-in-madurai-ward-20/articleshow/85440282.cms||---
---||Nashik||Rain revival brings cheer to farmers in north Maharashtra||NASHIK: The resumption of monsoon activity has brought much relief to the farmers in north Maharashtra as the current spell would prove crucial for the kharif crops. Nashik city reported around 11 mm rainfall during the 24-hour period ending Wednesday morning. The other districts from north Maharashtra such as Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar also received good rains. According to farmers, they were waiting for the resumption of rainfall activity for the past two weeks and there was a possibility that the kharif crops would have been badly affected due to lack of rainfall. But the timely rainfall would now benefit the kharif crops. Deva Patil, a farmer, said that he was worried about his maize crop on two acres due to the 15-day gap in rainfall activity. “The crop would have been affected badly after three-four days if the monsoon activity had not revived. The recent steady light rain will benefit kharif crops,” he said. According to the officiating superintending agricultural officer of Nashik district, Vivek Sonawane, the good rainfall in last 24 hours would definitely benefit kharif crops such as maize and cotton. Sonawane, who also hold the charge of superintendent agricultural officer of Dhule district, said the cultivation of kharif crops would have reduced drastically if the rainfall had been delayed for four-five days more. “There is a major belt of maize and cotton in Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts. The recent rains will benefit these kharif crops. It does not prove very beneficial for the short-term kharif crops such as moong and urad. It may lead to a drop in production of these two crops by around 50%. But the area under cultivation of these two crops is comparatively less,” said Sonawane. Bharat Dighole, president, Maharashtra onion growers’ association, said, “It will definitely help the kharif corps, but there is still need of adequate rainfall in some talukas of Nashik district.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rain-revival-brings-cheer-to-farmers-in-north-maha/articleshow/85436623.cms||Tushar Pawar

The day was marked by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s review of the Covid-19 situation in the state and another appeal to the public to behave responsibly and not organise political, social and religious events. The statement comes days after the BJP's four newly inducted Union ministers from Maharashtra began Jan Aashirwad Yatras in the state. Tope told TOI that rules regarding easing of curbs were formulated after taking into account suggestions by the Covid task force which includes many senior doctors. The state has eased most curbs since August 15 but restaurants, malls, shops, marriage halls were mandated to have only fully vaccinated staff 14 days after the second dose. And in the case of malls, only fully vaccinated customers above 18 years are allowed entry. Mall associations have approached the government seeking relaxations in the rules. Tope told TOI that “I am telling the associations that if they have to ensure staff is fully vaccinated, it is not only for the welfare of customers but for their staff as well. At the moment we are not considering any further relaxation.” He added that the government has urged all businesses to use vaccine stocks available in the private sector to inoculate their staffers. "They can go through the public vaccination centres where the problem of erratic supply continues, we are also urging them to tie up with private players for mass vaccination camps," said Tope. Thackeray has appealed to the public to ensure that they follow all Covid-19 protocols, especially with the festival season coming. There was a discussion on the Jan Aashirwad Yatra being organised by BJP leaders in the state and some ministers were of the opinion that these should not be allowed. "Relaxations have been given to keep the economy afloat. It worries me when I see people gathering crowds by organising social, political and religious events and endangering the lives of others," said Thackeray. "As oxygen production in the state has its limitations, we have made oxygen requirement the criterion for bringing back restrictions," said Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minister-says-2-dose-rule-for-mall-staff-not-open-to-review/articleshow/85440320.cms||Bhavika Jain

Police believe the death was caused by smothering with a pillow and suspect her partner to have done it. The partner meanwhile is missing. Two police teams were sent to Noida on Tuesday to track him down. Police said that the deceased woman’s birthday was on August 14 and she, along with her partner and another couple from a society building in Greater Noida’s Shahberi area, had reached Nainital to celebrate her birthday. The morning after the birthday, on August 15, she was found dead in her room by Shweta Sharma, the other woman in the group. “We had partied till 1 am on August 15 and after that, returned to our rooms to sleep. The next morning, she did not come out of her room. We let her be for some time, thinking she was sleeping but when she didn’t come out for a long time, we contacted the hotel reception, the staff opened the door and we found her lying on the bed, dead. Her partner, whom we knew as Rishabh, was nowhere to be found,” Sharma said. She added that a murder complaint was lodged by them at Mallital police station on Monday. Police and forensic teams reached the hotel. Cops said they suspected murder by asphyxiation, adding post-mortem will reveal the exact cause. While combing the room to collect evidence, police found the ID of one ‘Emraan’ and believe it to be Rishabh’s. While checking-in to the room, the deceased woman’s ID was used, so the discrepancy wasn’t noticed then, police said. Shweta Sharma meanwhile couldn’t confirm if Rishabh’s name was actually Emraan, saying she didn’t know the couple very well. “They had moved into the society barely a month ago. We were introduced to her partner as Rishabh, a scrap dealer from Greater Noida,” she told TOI. The ID of Emraan does correspond to a scrap dealer, police investigating the case said. An FIR was filed under section 302 (murder) of IPC against an unidentified person (Rishabh has not been named as his identity is under investigation). Speaking to TOI, station officer of Mallital, Ashok Kumar Singh said, “We are trying to know more about the matter from the deceased woman’s neighbours. Police teams have been dispatched to Noida and other surrounding places in the NCR region to track down the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/31-yr-old-gr-noida-woman-found-dead-in-nainital-hotel-room-police-teams-in-search-of-missing-partner/articleshow/85427550.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Assistant professor for history, Saraswathy Narayanan College, Madurai, D Muneeswaran and his colleagues Lakshmanamoorthy, Aswathaman Nagapandi, and Palanimurugan found the sluices during a field study in Villoor village on the T Kallupatti- Kallikudi Road. They found stone blocks with inscriptions in the big tank in the village. Muneeswaran said that they dated back to the 9th century AD, 13th century AD and 16th century AD. This was a village where agriculture prospered, and there were three sluices for the tank, which was on the western end of the village. He said that the first sluice measured one foot in length and half a foot in width. There are six lines inscribed on it, and it dates back to the 9th century AD. The second stone, which dates back to the 13th century, is inserted into the second sluice and has three line inscriptions and belongs. Most of the inscriptions have been erased with time, he said. The newest among the stone inscriptions is the one in the third sluice, which is one foot in width and three feet in length. It has 13 lines and dates back to the 16th century. Retired epigraphist of the Tamil Nadu archaeology department Dr S Santhalingam, was deciphered it as saying, that if a person has a poison attack (bitten or stung by an insect or reptile), he can overcome the danger by bowing before his teacher (guru, may have been ‘vaidiyars’) and praying to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/3-ancient-stone-sluices-found/articleshow/85440267.cms||---

The posters owned by the Save Congress forum were found at the DCC office and in various parts in the town. The posters slammed Chandy, questioning whether he is the ‘destroyer’ of Congress. The poster also has references to those on the probable list for the DCC president post and also targets one of the candidates. This is the first time a protest against Chandy has risen from his home turf. He, along with Ramesh Chennithala, had lodged protests with the high over not taking them into confidence while deciding the DCC presidents. Chandy had clarified recently that he had not recommended any names for the DCC president post in Kottayam. Currently, the names of KPCC secretary Nattakom Suresh, DCC general secretary Eugene Thomas and DCC secretary Jomon Aykara are doing the rounds as possible candidates. Suresh has the support of KPCC working president P T Thomas and senior leader Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan. Meanwhile, Chandy Oommen had made a Facebook post recently that talks regarding his name being considered for DCC president post were baseless.

---||Madurai||Panchayat prez hacked to death in Tuticorin||Tuticorin: The president of the Agaram panchayat in Tuticorin district was hacked to death by a four-member gang near Eral on Wednesday. The victim, I Ponseelan, 45, of the AIADMK was murdered to avenge the murder of P Lenin, 43, of the same village in 2017 and rivalry over church elections. Ponseelan took part in the village temple festival and went to the house of the panchayat vice-president Thavasi Kani, on Wednesday. The accused J Jeba Singh, 38, P Rooban, 48, his brother P Jegan, 42, and Jebastin from Agaram entered Kani’s house and attacked Ponseelan with machetes killing him on the spot. As the horrified villagers fled the place the accused left the place in a car. “Four special teams nabbed the accused in less than an hour after the murder took place. The four men with blood stained clothes and weapons were travelling in a car when they were caught red-handed in Savalaperi,” superintendent of police (SP) of Tuticorin district S Jayakumar said. The SP said that the accused also took away the gold chain, bracelet and ring of the victim and they were recovered from them. It is learnt that Ponseelan is the prime accused in the murder of Lenin on October 22, 2017, over rivalry in illegal sand mining. Ponseelan and a few others were booked for murder, criminal conspiracy and rioting in this connection. Trial in the case has come to an end and the verdict is expected soon. Police said that Ponseelan defeated Lenin’s wife in the panchayat president election, adding fuel to the rivalry. Meanwhile, Ponseelan also won the Thoothukudi Nazareth CSI diocesan elections that were held two days ago by defeating Jebastin. Special teams are on the lookout for at least three more people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/panchayat-prez-hacked-to-death-in-tuticorin/articleshow/85440252.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||379 sq km of Ahmedabad is dusty, satellite images show||AHMEDABAD: Recently, a team of urban planners rummaged through a number of aerial satellite images of Ahmedabad city taken since 1991, focusing on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The index quantifies vegetation. They found that Ahmedabad’s dense green cover had increased by just 10% despite the countless tree-plantation drives, and the area covered by dust had decreased by merely 13% to 379.2 sq km between 1991 and 2019. On the other hand, the built area —areas with buildings or construction — increased from a little above 140 sq km in 1991 to more than 350 sq km during the period in question. Back in 1991, about 440 sq km of Ahmedabad district’s surface was covered in dust which rose to 682 sq km in five years in 1996, and then gradually began coming down to 574 sq km by 2001. Since then there has been only a gradual decline in the dusty surface. The study was conducted by the Institute of Architecture and Planning, Nirma University. It clearly pointed out that the increase in the built-up area of the city has resulted in a decrease in the overall vegetation cover. “Such conversions largely impact the ecology of a city. This has a direct impact on environmental degradation and is also observed through the analysis of the air pollution data of the city,” said the study. Its researchers are Vibha Gajjar, Utpal Sharma, and Hetankshi Shah. The study also pointed out that an increase in the number of private vehicles, haphazard dumping of solid waste and its burning, and the release of industrial waste into the air were some of the contributors to air pollution in Ahmedabad. “Such type of activities affect the quality of air, as well as cause the heat island effect resulting in temperature level rise,” said the study. It was published in Elsevier journal’s report called Current Research in Environmental Sustainability. The study observed that the average Air Quality Index (AQI) for Ahmedabad was 163 in 2014,150 in 2015,177 in 2016, and 180 in 2017. The AQI level of 2018 fell to 173 and in the year 2019 it came down to 136. From 2020 till August the AQI average further reduced drastically to 105. According to norms and standards, the AQI range should be 0 to 50 and for the average quality, it can range between 50 and 100.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/379-sq-km-of-city-is-dusty-satellite-images-show/articleshow/85440552.cms||---
---||Nashik||Restart Godavari Express: MP Godse||Nashik: Member of Parliament, Nashik, Hemant Godse and railway passengers’ association from Nashik have demanded the resumption of Godavari Express from Manmad to Lokmanya Tilak Terminus via Nashik Road. The MP has written to the chairman of the railway board, the Indian Railways, and the general manager of Central Railway (CR) requesting them to resume the services of Godavari Express. He said the state government has relaxed the Covid related restrictions further when compared to the earlier times, and hence the markets have also opened up. “At such times when the economy is opening up, it makes no sense in not running the trains as it is only hampering the daily workers travelling by the intercity express,” said Godse. The Masik Pass Dharak And Pravasi Welfare Association, Nashik, has also written to the divisional railways manager of Bhusawal Division along with the general manager of CR and the chairman of the railways requesting to start the train at the earliest. “The number of daily travellers from Nashik to Mumbai is very high. This is the reason, that there were two intercity express, that was helping the travellers to Mumbai. During the recent times, when the restrictions were strict the cancellation of the trains was understandable, but now the things have changed,” said Rajesh Fokane, the president of the association. Already a large numbers of people have lost their jobs as establishments were closed. With the establishments starting to function, the people now are getting jobs and want to travel. Most of the people are now travelling by Panchavati Express that leaves Nashik at 7.05 am while the Godavari Express leaves Nashik for LTT at 9.32 am. The return journey of the train started at 2.55 pm and reached Nashik at 6.18 pm “Our demand is for the convenience of the Nashik residents and we hope the railways consider our request at the earliest,” said Fokane.The railways authorities said the matters raised by the passengers have been forwarded to the railway board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/restart-godavari-express-mp-godse/articleshow/85436688.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The state government has stressed on the fact that they should be removed from the computerised RoRs. Therefore, we have launched a campaign to ensure that these entries are removed at the earliest,” said Game.There are several entries on the RoR of some farmers and they pertain to moneylenders who had given loans to the families years ago — which has been refunded and yet the names are mentioned. The moneylenders themselves are not traceable anymore.At one time, the state government had given loans to the farmers for ‘bunding’ of the farms, and the same were either repaid or even waived by the government. The loans for wells and other purposes were also waived by the government.“These are all outdated entries and the same have to be removed immediately. The talathis — the revenue officers who keep records of the rights — have been ordered to take the responsibility to remove the names without delay. The farmers only have to bring it to the notice of the officials concerned,” said Gorakhnath Gadilkar, the deputy commissioner, administration, Nashik division.There are about 73,431 such cases across the Nashik division. The highest number of cases (29,600) are in the Jalgaon district, followed by Nashik (13,676), Ahmednagar (12,496), Dhule (10,719), and Nandurbar (6,940).The officer said the talathis would be answerable for the non-removal of any such entries from the RoR in the future and the official concerned would face action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/outdated-lender-entries-to-be-removed-from-land-records/articleshow/85436663.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||Height no bar: Delhi buses may soon see more women at wheel||NEW DELHI: The national capital is likely to see more women behind the wheels of public transport vehicles if the Delhi government’s plans to induct more women drivers fructify. “We want more and more women drivers in public transport in Delhi. We have called a meeting of all stakeholders to resolve the issues because we want to encourage women drivers,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. The transport minister, who is also the chairman of the board of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), said that the issues that make it difficult for women to drive buses would be sorted out in the meeting scheduled on Thursday.  DTC has only one woman driver, V Saritha, who hails from Telangana and joined the corporation as a driver in April 2015. One of the major issues that women face while applying for a driver’s position is the minimum height requirement, which most don’t qualify even though it was reduced from 162 centimetres to 159 centimetres. “Some women drivers had given a representation some time ago that due to minimum height restrictions, they were unable to qualify,” Gahlot said. “The rules go back to the time when there were standard floor buses and the driver’s seat would be fixed. Now, we have all low-floor buses and the driver’s seats are adjustable, apart from much larger windscreens giving a clearer view. We have called everyone and all such issues would be discussed and resolved,” he said. Apart from the minimum height requirement, another important requirement that women applicants fail to fulfil is to possess a heavy vehicle driving licence and experience of driving a heavy vehicle for three years. As very few women possess a heavy vehicle driving licence, qualifying the three-year criterion is even more difficult. The issue of the heavy vehicle driving licence will also be discussed in the meeting and sources said that it was likely that the minimum requirement could be reduced to one year of driving experience from the current three years. Sources also said that the transport department had reserved more than 4,000 permits for electric autorickshaws and out of these, 35% permits were expected to be allotted to women. This proposal, too, may get approval in the meeting on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/height-no-bar-delhi-buses-may-soon-see-more-women-at-wheel/articleshow/85442440.cms||Sidharatha Roy

After reporting under-4,500 cases for the last two days, Maharashtra listed 5,132 cases and 158 deaths, including five in Mumbai. The city added 285 patients testing positive for Covid as against 196 on Tuesday. The authorities are keep a watch on the numbers since train travel and other relaxations were granted since Sunday. In KEM Hospital in Parel, the Covid ward has only 10 patients and there is no admission on some days. “The positivity rate in KEM is below 1% and the general observation is that the severity of Covid is lesser now,” said KEM Hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh. The hospital, reserved for severe patients, used to have over 500 Covid patients at any given time during the second wave. Across Mumbai, the daily positivity rate is 0.7%. After two days of conducting fewer than 35,000 tests daily, the BMC ran over 38,703 tests in a single day. The active cases in the city are below 3,000. The total caseload in the state rose to 64.1 lakh and deaths touched 1.4 lakh, of which 7.4 lakh cases and 15,930 deaths were in Mumbai. At the state level, 15 districts have less than 100 active cases. Of them, six — Dhule, Washim, Yavatmal, Bhandara, Wardha, and Gondia — have less than 10. Officials said the positivity rate of Kolhapur and Ratnagiri have dropped below the state’s average weekly positivity rate. Eye on third wave, govt to spend Rs 22.5 crore on 25 lakh RAT test kitsThe public health department is spending Rs 22.5 crore to procure 25 lakh Rapid Antigen Test kits, reports Prafulla Marpakwar. “Rapid Antigen Test will be useful for treatment as well as prevention of Covid-19,” said its order. The funds have been sanctioned by the relief and rehabilitation department. Former medical education director T P Lahane did not rule out a third wave. “If we study the situation across the world, the possibility of a third wave is not ruled out. However, it will be difficult to predict its intensity,” he said. “In certain countries, the third wave hit areas where the number of Covid patients was less than 1%. We do not know if a similar situation will be seen in Maharashtra. Currently, we have 19 districts where the number of patients is less than 1%, while in thhe remaining districts, the percentage ranges between 2-2.5%,” said Lahane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-tests-increase-cases-tick-up-in-city-ity-still-under-1/articleshow/85440355.cms||---
---||Madurai||Schools, students look for a safe ‘back to school’||Madurai: With Covid-19 safety SOPs being released by the state health department on Wednesday for school reopening, schools and parents feel reassured for a safe ‘back to school’ for students. “Students are eager for reopening. We will ensure that the SOPs are strictly followed. The campus will be sanitized regularly and with only Classes IX to XII coming to school, maintaining social distancing in classrooms will not be an issue. Students can also take their classes on school grounds if weather permits,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. With only 50% attendance being allowed, many schools are preparing a schedule suitable for them. “We have to come up with a schedule that is also viable for parents since logistics is a major issue. Ideally, we will be trying to have classes in school only since combining online and offline classes will be a burden for teachers. Schools also have to get buses ready for students, which have not been in use for a long time,” said the principal of a private matriculation school in Madurai. S Shanthi, a Class XII Physics teacher said that teachers have to be on alert to ensure SOPs are followed. “As much as we are happy for students to resume classes at school, it is going to be a challenge for teachers to ensure SOPs are followed. Wearing masks and while teaching will not be easy for teachers too,” she added. Principal of a private school in Trichy said that they will give double protection to the students and staff when the school reopens. “Nowadays, the Covid-19 cases are very less. We ensure that all our staff have been vaccinated. The school campus is already sanitized,” she said. Bhuvana Yogeswaran from Shanmuga Nagar in Trichy city feels that she will be interested to allow her daughter to go to school if the school administration puts all the safety measures in place. “My daughter is studying Class 10 at a private school. They are all exhausted from attending the online class. It seems the standard of education also will drop if the situation continues,” said Bhuvana. Another parent from Madurai, K Kamala said that schools must be held accountable if Covid-19 safety SOPs are not followed. “Last time when schools reopened, after one or two days, schools were not strict in following SOPs. Crowding also happened. Authorities must keep schools in check,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-students-look-for-a-safe-back-to-school/articleshow/85440308.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Guv is biased, PM Modi must intervene, says Saamna||Mumbai: Shiv Sena on Wednesday mounted a bitter attack on Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for sitting on the state government’s nomination of 12 members for the legislative council (MLCs) in its mouthpiece, and urged PM Narendra Modi to intervene. The Uddhav Thackeray government had nominated the dozen on November 6, 2020. The file is yet to be cleared. The editorial in Saamna said Koshyari has so devalued the post of governor that it has become a matter of joke everywhere. “His parent political party, BJP, is more responsible for devaluing the post than Koshyari,” it added. “Bombay high court also made fun of the governor in soft and sophisticated language, saying eight months is a little too much to take a decision on 12 nominated members. It is binding on him to make a decision,” the editorial said. Sena said despite the HC remarks, the governor is not ready to follow his constitutional duty. “The governor seems to be saying, forget the 12 members’ nomination until his ‘favourite government’ comes to the power in Maharashtra,” the piece said. “He (governor) is the political agent of the Centre. By delaying the nomination proposal, he is making fun of himself and behaving in an unconstitutional and biased manner. If he is working under pressure from his parent political party, PM Narendra Modi should intervene and stop further devaluation of the constitution and democracy. Raj Bhavan cannot help change the government in the state. No one would surrender like Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, as has been proved in in West Bengal and Maharashtra,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-guv-is-biased-pm-modi-must-intervene-says-saamna/articleshow/85442424.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

To ascertain to send children to school, Udgam School for Children and Zebar School for Children asked parents of students of Classes 6 to 8 for feedback . About 58% of parents are ready to send their children to school once the state government gives the green signal, the survey found. The schools are fully ready for students with strict health protocols and guidelines in place, they said in a media statement. Both schools approached a total of 1,850 parents of whom1,323 responded. “Some 778 respondents expressed willingness to send their wards to school if the government permits it,” a media statement from the schools said. According to the state government’s rules for re-opening schools and colleges in the state, written consent is to be provided by the parents to the school authorities for sending their child to school. “We have been approached by many parents to start in-person teaching for Classes 6-8. We conducted this survey to gauge willingness of parents and be prepared in advance. We are strictly following health protocols and government guidelines. Moreover, a lot of parents have confirmed that once the government permits it, they will give their consent,” said Manan Choksi, executive director of Udgam School For Children and Zebar School For Children. He said that 98% of teaching and non-teaching staff in the two schools have been fully vaccinated. At present, around 675 students of Classes 9 to 12 at both schools are attending in-person studies.

This despite the fact that there has been a significant increase in the number of those with post-Covid vascular complications and mucormycosis during the second wave. Doctors have called for more alertness among Covid-19 patients about post-Covid complications . Doctors at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) Madurai said those who recovered from Covid-19 are not taking possible post-Covid symptoms seriously. “We are getting only around four patients a day for post-Covid OP,” said GRH dean Dr A Rathinavel. He said many of these patients first go to the general OPs before being referred to the post-Covid clinic on knowing their history. “Fatigue, shortness of breath, insomnia and myalgia are quite common among them. Lung fibrosis is also seen in some cases,” said Dr Prabhakaran, head of the department of thoracic medicine at GRH. Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) in Chennai sees around 10-15 patients on an average at the post-Covid OP clinic now. “Lung fibrosis cases are minimal now. However, we had 120 cases of post-Covid vascular complications and we had also treated over 1,200 mucormycosis cases from across the state and other states. Post-Covid psychological issues are also more noticeable. Use of steroids for treatment is also leading to patients developing new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and fluctuation in blood sugar levels,” said hospital dean Dr E Theranirajan. A senior doctor at Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy said only three to four patients visit the post-Covid clinic which resumed functioning recently. They generally come with complaints of breathing difficulties, fungal infection and fever. Major complications like lung fibrosis were not seen in the recovered patients. The post-Covid OP at Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital receives an average 10-15 people. “We write in the discharge summary asking them to return without delay if they find any health issues as it could lead to many complications. But people have been coming in for follow-ups in very few numbers,” said dean A Nirmala.

While hospitals are citing constraints of space and cost, fact is most are unsure about the future of the pandemic with Covid hospitalisations dropping each day. Only three to four private hospitals have set up plants so far in Mumbai. On August 10, private facilities with more than 50 beds were asked to set up PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) plants that generate medical oxygen by extracting it from atmospheric air. In Mumbai, most hospitals said space was one of the key hurdles. The cost of setting up a tank that ranges from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 1 crore was also prohibitive for many, they claimed. Yet for some, the noise created by the plant was a factor. However, the majority feared that such a plant would be redundant once the pandemic ends. The inadequacy of medical oxygen is feared to be a weak spot in the state’s preparedness for the predicted third wave. The government, in fact, has decided that a lockdown would be imposed as soon as the oxygen requirement hits 700 metric tonnes, the halfway mark of the state’s production capacity of 1,350MT. During the second wave, the state requirement touched nearly 2,000MT. Dr V Ravishankar, COO of Lilavati Hospital, said even big hospitals do not have enough space to install plants. “With two massive liquid medical oxygen tanks already installed on our premises, we just don’t have the space for a PSA plant,” he said. Dr Prince Surana, who runs a 65-bed hospital in Chembur, said he was in no hurry either. “What happens to such a plant once the pandemic is over,” he said, questioning whether it was cost-effective. Another hospital head said that his hospital incurs Rs 50,000 per month for cylinders that are supplied by vendors. “Why should we invest so much in setting up this plant,” the owner said. However, the handful who have installed PSA plants believe it’s worth the investment and can be a potential lifesaver during a crisis. Among major private hospitals Powai’s Hiranandani Hosp-ital is the only one, and among smaller hospitals Goregaon’s Shree Sai Clinic, Zen in Chembur and Heera Munji in Mulund have installed plants. Dr Sunil Chavan of Shree Sai Clinic said he did-n’t want to relive the stress of oxygen sh-ortage he faced during the second wave. In Navi Mumbai, Dr Amit Thadani, who runs a 66-bed hospital, said he has installed a plant that can generate 500 litre of oxygen/minute to become self-sufficient. “We no longer have to rely on vendors,” said Dr Thadani, adding he spent Rs 70 lakh on installation. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, former IMA president, went a step ahead and wondered if the state was shifting its responsibility to the private hospitals. Interestingly, vendors in Maharashtra said they are getting more enquiries from north Indian states for PSA plants. “We have had demands from Delhi, Rajasthan and UP, but not so much from Mumbai or Maharashtra,” said Rajesh Singh of Efficient Services that deals in PSA plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-unsure-about-pandemic-lifespan-most-pvt-hosps-not-keen-on-massive-costly-o2-generation-plants/articleshow/85440463.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The court said the government on the other hand booked and detained people for possessing one or two injections when citizens were desperately looking for the Covid drug during the second wave. The case involved Arbaz Garasiya, Makbul Chauhan, Mubin Chauhan, and Mahammad Sahid Samli from Bharuch district, who were booked for having six remdesivir vials without licence. They were arrested in May and granted bail. But before they could come out of jail, the Bharuch district magistrate ordered their detention in June by invoking the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act. The court noted that in the nearby district of Surat, thousands of injections were distributed by “high positioned functionaries” in the name of charity without any licence. The HC found the Bharuch district magistrate’s order to detain the four persons erroneous and quashed it. Justice Paresh Upadhyay said that while the government sought to endorse the distribution of 5,000 injections by a political party, it targeted people for dealing in a couple of injections. “In the second wave of Covid pandemic — somewhere between March to May, 2021 — the public at large was facing all sorts of difficulties regarding non-availability of beds in hospitals and medicines like remdesivir injections etc,” the court said. “At that time, on the one hand the state authorities were turning their eyes blind qua unauthorized distribution of remdesivir injections, including by high positioned functionaries, in the name of charity.” The court went on to say: “…and at the same time, the police authorities started registering FIRs on their own ... against the persons on road, for allegedly having one/two remdesivir injections with them unauthorizedly.” The court further noted that the detention orders were passed in Bharuch district, “which is adjoining Surat district, where thousands of remdesivir injections were stated to be available for public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/unauthorized-remdesivir-govt-ignored-surat-case-says-hc/articleshow/85440500.cms||---

After special judge Geetanjali Goel pronounced the verdict, Tharoor said, “Grateful your honour. It has been seven and a half years of absolute torture. I really appreciate it.” Later, the Thiruvananthapuram Member of Parliament said in a statement on Twitter that he had “weathered dozens of unfounded accusations and media vilification patiently, sustained by my faith in the Indian judiciary, which today stands vindicated”. “I would like to express my humble thanks to judge Geetanjali Goel for her orders today, discharging me from the charges levied by Delhi Police, which I have consistently described as preposterous. This brings a significant conclusion to the long nightmare that had enveloped me after the tragic passing of my late wife Sunanda,” Tharoor stated. He further said that in our justice system, the process was all too often the punishment. “Nonetheless, the fact that justice has been done, at last, will allow all of us in the family to mourn Sunanda in peace,” he added in the statement. He was grateful to his lawyers, particularly senior advocate Vikas Pahwa and advocate Gaurav Gupta, for all that they had done to bring the case to this conclusion. Pushkar was found dead in a five-star hotel room in Delhi on January 17, 2014. An FIR had been registered by police on January 1, 2015, against unknown persons for murder. Tharoor was later booked under IPC sections 498A (husband or his relative subjecting a woman to cruelty) and 306 (abetment to suicide).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/significant-conclusion-to-a-long-nightmare-tharoor-after-verdict/articleshow/85440418.cms||Usha Das

---||Chennai||Back to school: why lessons ought to be different||Bhavani Raghunandan & Maheshwari NatarajanAs the Israeli writer Yuval Noah Harari said, although more people were killed by influenza before World War I, after about a decade people remembered the war, rather than the pandemic. So too, a decade from now, Covid-19 could be forgotten and the world would have moved on.But, tomorrow we won’t be able to use this pandemic as an excuse for the loss to education. We teachers have lived in an era where the rate of change was slow and the future somewhat predictable. Digitisation changed both information gathering and the speed of communication. Teaching and learning changed as well.The lockdown has widened the students’ exposure. Their awareness is high. In the time that has passed some have tried their hand at businesses, sales, cooking, social service and a host of other things.We also see a change in attitude. Children are no longer as afraid of taking risks as they have witnessed constant job changes, migrations and uncertainty. Gender roles have also changed, women have important jobs and responsibilities and it is high time our boys are taught to share the responsibility of the home as well.Some others have reacted adversely to these changes, they are frightened and have had less emotional support from their friends and peers on which they had relied.We are going to face a changed world which is completely digitised, with an unpredictable set of jobs, fewer jobs or maybe jobs needing different skill set and attitudes, constant shifts in jobs and careers and maybe work that takes them all over the world. With movement will come a change of traditions and value systems and a gradual merging of cultures. Preparing students for this future is of utmost importance. As educators we better plan and prepare for the reopening of ‘schools’ that are now going to be different from what they were before the lockdown.As an immediate measure, schools must have special bridge programmes to address the learning gaps about health and safety. We can have webinars for parents to allay their anxieties. They will also need to be spoken to about how to address the emotional and social needs’ starvation that their wards may have experienced. Many school policies will have to be reexamined, for instance, the use of internet.What will we need to teach?Now that classrooms have lost their boundaries and the internet has brought the world to doorsteps, youngsters need to think of solutions to larger issues. Open dialogues need to be initiated with students on solutions for water shortage, poverty, disadvantages of digital classrooms or the environment. By talking about subjects like pollution and sustainability they will realise that they must start thinking of global problems and what they can do to alleviate them. This will help them with interdisciplinary thinking.Joel Cohen, professor of Rockefeller University says, Today maths is to biology what the microscope was to it yesterday. Maths is giving biologists a tool to study patterns of population migrations and the chances of the evolution of a new variant of a pathogen for example.Debating on the way countries or India dealt with the pandemic will make students aware that decision making needs to not only address the problem, but also the vast diversity of people and opinions and how sometimes going along to get along is equally important.Students will also need other cognitive skills like critical and creative thinking, collaboration and communication with people and researchers all over the world.The National Education Policy 2020 has recommended that vocational skills be a part of the curriculum in the middle schools. Teaching children crafts and trades like carpentry, gardening, vermicomposting, wood crafts, painting, weaving, knitting and crochet is but stimulating their creativity and providing them choices later, whether that is to supplement their income or as a career option. When possible, opportunities for productive labour such as book binding, soap or candle making or recycled products, should be taught.Today, schools need to go beyond academics to teach students life skills such as resilience that will see them through trying times like these. Students need to be taught to make plans but be flexible about it. We need to teach them to think as leaders and resolve small issues by thinking objectively and make decisions with sensitivity and clarity. In these times of conflict, they need to be taught religious and racial tolerance and how to be at peace with themselves. Participating in events like Model UN, will help teaching this skill as also responsible ethics and planning for the way forward.Aspects of Indian values and ethics can easily be imparted by using story-telling and music and theatre. Stories from books such as ‘Panchatantra’ could be an inspiring way to teach communal living, spirituality, the art of giving, and the art of living simple lives.Students can be allowed to try short-term internships. This will give our students real- time experience and may help them to choose their branch of study. Peer teaching can be introduced by allocating a period every day. We write this because some students might want to take teaching as a career. They could spend one period a month on self- awareness, introspect upon their strengths, weaknesses and passions. Students could participate in events so that they realise their interests, potential and skills.Transformation of teachersA change of mindset from ‘What I know is enough’ to ‘I must learn more’ is imperative.There needs to be collaboration among teachers by sharing lectures and question papers and doing away with the competitive attitude that is prevalent in schools.As teachers we too must become interdisciplinary in our thinking, upskilling and learning other subjects. Let us be prepared for the new and transformed school for it is we teachers who are going to be the agents responsible for that transformation.(Bhavani Raghunandan is the director of Vidya Mandir, Maheshwari Natarajan is the founding principal of Vidya Mandir Estancia)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/back-to-school-why-lessons-ought-to-be-different/articleshow/85440413.cms||---

The three-day event Mu Onam that began on Wednesday is expected to witness the participation of 5,000 students. Mu Onam features Mamangam (a competition where colleges are grouped under three regions: Travancore, Kochi and Malabar), Kazhchappadu (unseen frames, a digital art competition on the theme Onam 2021-the smiles and struggles), Thaalam-Malayali Aano? (an Instagram reels competition on the theme how the pandemic has brought a change in your Onam), etc. Apart from the zone which wins the championship, individual winners, colleges and districts which top the competition will win cash prizes. “Mu Onam is a fusion of art, culture and learning. Aswamedham, a competition that challenges participants with puzzles that involve coding and hacking skills, and general awareness, is an example. That the two most vibrant youth communities in the state, Kites foundation and TinkerHub, are driving this adds to the fun and knowledge sharing,” said convener of the academia and technology focus group of GTech Deepu S Nath, also the chief organiser of the event. He said that Covid-19 has shown that we can adapt, be agile and responsive. “It is now time for revival and youth will lead the change. It is normal for the digitally-empowered state to look for alternative ways for celebrations, without losing the charm and emotions that come with our national festival,” he said. Mu Onam will be a different experience for the thousands of students who haven’t yet had the opportunity to see each other or have social interactions as colleges remain closed due to the pandemic, said Angel Rose, a second-year student of Palakkad Government Engineering College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/gtech-gears-for-online-onam-fest/articleshow/85440429.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The first round of allotment of seats is set to happen through picking of lots from Thursday. Under RTE Act, 25% of seats in private schools are reserved for students from underprivileged families earning income less than Rs 2 lakh per annum. Despite the huge number of applications received, there are only 5,370 seats available under RTE Act in 434 eligible private schools in Madurai district. The first round of allotment of seats will be done for seats in 343 private schools. Officials said that there are chances of duplication of applications where the same student applies to different schools, which might get rejected. Last year, 5,953 applications had been received for allotment of 5,753 seats and around 15% of the applications had been rejected for not following RTE norms. As per guidelines, students can only apply to private schools within around 1 km radius of the home address and hence many such applications, which did not comply with this norm, were rejected last year. “There is definitely more awareness now and the Covid-19 pandemic is also a reason. However, this year, in other parts of the state, more parents have preferred government schools and lesser people applied for seats under RTE Act. Even last year, despite there number of applications being high, many RTE seats had not been filled. This year hopefully all seats will get filled,” said the principal of a private matriculation school. Meanwhile, private schools are still upset with the state government at it is yet to pay the dues for RTE seats for the academic year 2020-2021. “With private schools already struggling financially, it is the duty of the state government to at least pay the reimbursement that is due for us without delay,” said M Senthilnathan, president, private schools correspondents’ confederation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/over-18k-apply-for-5370-rte-seats-in-madurai-pvt-schools/articleshow/85440399.cms||---

Police have arrested four individuals – Sharanappa Gundappa Bhimalli, Monappa Durgappa Maneger, Ningappa Chandappa Hattikuni and Devindra Hanamath – under the Arms Act. Yadgir superintendent of police CB Vedmurthy, while confirming the arrest, told TOI, “They fired dummy bullets into the air, primarily for auditory effect, and not to hurt anyone. But since firing in public is an offence, we have arrested them.”Khuba, in Yadgir to participate in the BJP’s ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’, said that the four party workers had opened fire to express their happiness. “There was no intention to disrespect the law of the land,” said Khuba, who earlier claimed that they had not fired shots, but had only burst firecrackers.Khuba, the Bidar MP who was recently appointed Union minister of state for renewable energy, chemicals and fertilisers, was initially welcomed in a traditional ceremony with a garland, shawl and fireworks, before his followers fired shots using country-made rifles. Videos of the event that show guns being flashed throughout the procession have gone viral on social media.Former ministers Baburao Chinchansur and Raju Gouda were among those who had gathered in Yaragol in Yadgir to welcome Khuba. Chinchansur was reportedly carrying a gun too.Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra has taken cognisance of the incident and sought a police report on the same.The ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ is being carried out by newly-appointed Union ministers, who are reaching out to the people to seek their blessings while also detailing to them the accomplishments of the Narendra Modi-led central government. Unfortunately, Covid protocol is being the given the short shrift at most of these rallies and events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/four-held-for-celebratory-firing-at-union-ministers-welcome-ceremony/articleshow/85436824.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Another door closes for DPS East||AHMEDABAD: All hopes for restarting Delhi Public School (DPS) East, Hirapur for 2021-22 academic year seem to have been dashed on Wednesday after the director of primary education (DPE) rejected their application, forcing the school to shut down. The DPE has warned the school management – Calorx Management and Research Foundation of facing a penalty of Rs 1 lakh and a daily fine of Rs 10,000 if the school is run illegally without getting the mandatory clearance from the government authorities. The management of the controversy-ridden school has lost their credibility and it was not appropriate to allow them to run the school for Classes 6-8 students at DPS East, held M I Joshi, director of primary education. He said this in a sevenpage order while turning down a fresh appeal by the school management to start English medium classes for Classes 6-8. The Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) had last year cancelled the school’s affiliation. The board had then set March 31 a deadline to produce the Gujarat government NOC. The school authorities failed to do so. Recently, DPS East was slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh by the Ahmedabad district education officer (DEO) and district primary education office (DPEO) after complaints that the school was illegally admitting students for the academic year 2021-22 without approvals in place. A team of officials visited the school in July to investigate the matter and ordered its immediate shutdown as it did not have a ‘no objection certificate’ (NOC) from the state education department. The operations of the DPS East, situated at Hirapur, were taken over by Gujarat state government in December 2019, after the school landed in a controversy in connection to an ashram, located on the school premises and run by self-styled godman, Nithyananda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/another-door-closes-for-dps-east/articleshow/85440576.cms||---
---||Pune||Rickety bus shelters a big threat to Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited patrons||PUNE: The rickety condition of the 44 of the PMPML’s 74 “Pune pattern” bus shelters is turning out to be a major threat to commuters depending on the public transport system. A day after two persons were injured when one such bus shelter opposite SGS mall in the Camp area crashed, a Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) official said on Wednesday that a survey of all such facilities has been ordered and repair work would follow. The PMPML has four types of bus shelters — the one commonly called the “Pune pattern”, the one made of stainless steel, the BRT compliant variety and the “smart” bus stops. The “Pune pattern” bus shelters are the oldest type with a simple design. The cash-strapped PMPML is finding it difficult to repair these shelters and are looking for private companies and agencies to replace them with new models on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BoT) model. The transport utility has, so far, not found any agency. “The Covid-19 pandemic has further worsened our financial situation in the past one-and-a-half years. Under such circumstances, we seek help from the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies or corporators and MLAs. We tried the BoT model, but it didn’t work out,” the official said. PMPML chairman and managing director Laxminarayan Mishra said, “The bus stops are the responsibility of the local self government. For example, if a bus stop is located in the Pune city area, it is the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) responsibility to maintain the facility. The same regulation applies for the bus stops in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation area or the Cantonment board limits. We have conducted a survey on ways to improve the condition of the bus stops and necessary actions will soon be taken.” Amit Kumar, chief executive officer of Pune Cantonment Board, said the dilapidated PMPML bus stops would be removed from its limits after Tuesday’s mishap. “Our engineers will inspect 20 bus stops in our limit in the next two days. Based on their report, we will remove the bus stops that are in a bad shape. The maintenance of the stops in the cantonment area is the responsibility of the (cantonment board). But we could not do it, as no private agency responded to our tender floated four times in the past two years,” he said. When contacted, PMPML joint managing director Chetna Kerure told TOI, “We had floated an expression of interest (EOI) to restructure all the bus stops as per the BoT model. But we didn’t get much response. The EOI is being re-floated again and 1,500 bus shelters will be redeveloped in the first phase. We can seek help from the corporations. But we want to carry out the work as a ‘no cost project’. We don’t have sufficient funds now to carry out the work ourselves.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rickety-bus-shelters-a-big-threat-to-pmpml-patrons/articleshow/85438365.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Ahmedabad||Down in India, but stray cattle rose in Gujarat by 50,000 in seven years||AHMEDABAD: Despite repeated directions from the Gujarat high court, a policy to shift the stray bovine population out from the city is yet to materialize – supposedly a lack of political will being the primary reason. Despite efforts by the civic body, stray cattle continue to pose a menace to urban life as there’s little serious involvement of elected representatives. Annoyed residents say that the stray cattle menace gets worse during the monsoon season, making it very difficult to travel on city roads which have dozens of cows. Over the past couple of decades, the Gujarat high court has come down heavily on the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) over its inability to keep stray cattle off the city roads. While the AMC has been collecting fines and impounding cattle, close to half of the stray cattle are yet to be tagged with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) chips. It may be said that in February last year, governor Acharya Devvrat had convened a meeting of office bearers of national, state level and local bodies engaged in conservation and welfare of stray cattle. He had suggested formulation of a policy for welfare of stray cows. HC has been scathing over cattle menace:Over the past two decades, the Gujarat high court has been scathing against the AMC over the cattle menace in the city, and has repeatedly issued directions to the civic body. Following HC strictures over cow menace on streets, the AMC has been providing periodic numbers to the HC about the cases against cattle owners, the cattle impounded and the fines collected. However, on the ground, the menace of cattle roaming the streets has not reduced. City CP had issued notification on RFID in July 2019:Back in July 2019, the Ahmedabad CP had issued a notification, directing all cattle owners to get their cattle implanted with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) chips within 60 days or face legal action. The AMC cattle nuisance control department (CNCD) had begun the process of installing RFID tags in May 2019 to keep a database of cattle in the city. What the AMC says…The CNCD is primarily responsible for tackling the menace. “The stray cattle hostels promised by the state government for AMC jurisdiction are yet to materialise. Meanwhile, nearly 55% of the stray cattle are monitored with RFID tags, and more tags are being implanted in the strays to be tracked. Despite three high court directions a steady policy to shift the bovine population out of the city limits is yet to get political push. Until then stray cattle on roads are a reality,” said a senior official in the AMC. “Driving to work from Maninagar to Navrangpura is a nightmare, thanks to the cattle menace. It is not just a hindrance in traffic movement and harmful to drivers. Civic authorities must define timings for cattle movement for grazing and define designated spaces for their movement and settling in different areas of the city.” Purvi Pandya, Maninagar resident. “The cattle menace gets compounded every monsoon season. A couple of days ago, I saw a calf go berserk at Ramdevnagar and it almost got hit by vehicles. Stray cattle on the streets is a danger to pedestrians and those riding vehicles. The AMC should take the blame for the growing cattle menace.” Krishna Kumar, IT professional. “In Ahmedabad, especially during monsoons, the cattle menace intensifies. It is not just the people getting bothered but even the animals getting bothered, who don’t deserve to live this way unsheltered. It is a menace created by humans who should be held accountable for leaving animals in such a state.” Rahul Sehgal, social entrepreneur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hostel-plan-put-to-pasture-cattle-stray-on-roads/articleshow/85440573.cms||Meghdoot Sharon

The success of his first attempt at carving portraits on leaves prompted him to try making the portraits of the nine Indians who have won Nobel Prizes. He was recognized by the India Book of Records 2021 for ‘maximum portraits of Nobel Prize winners of India carved on leaves’. While the medal and certificates for the first recognition were received by Akhil by post two weeks ago, he received another confirmation mail from the Asia Book of Records 2021 a few days later that stated he has been awarded the ‘Grand Master’ title for the same set of works. Akhil, a third-year architecture student at NIT Nagpur, has been studying from his home since the lockdown began last year. His mother’s birthday was in June and he wanted to give something special to her. She was in Thrissur on work. So he made her portrait on a jackfruit leaf and sent it to her office on her birthday. The photo of the leaf-portrait became a hit on social media and many encouraged Akhil to create more. “I have loved painting since childhood but this was something entirely different and challenging. I made a leaf-portrait of actor Vijay on his birthday before starting work on the Nobel laureates. The portraits include that of Rabindranath Tagore, C V Raman, Har Goind Khurana, Mother Teresa, Subramanyan Chandrasekhar, Amartya Sen, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Kailash Satyarthi and Abhijith Banerjee. I applied for the India and Asia Books of Records but never thought I would be recognized,” he said. While it took him nearly seven hours to complete his mother’s portrait, each of the rest was done within three hours. “First I draw the face on raw leaves and then carve it out accordingly. The most challenging one was Tagore’s, thanks to his long beard. Also, as most of them used eyeglasses I had to be very careful while cutting the leaves,” said Akhil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/carving-a-record-on-jackfruit-leaves/articleshow/85440574.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

Unpolished Rajamudi rice is one of the traditional varieties of rice of the Old Mysuru region. It is mainly grown in parts of KR Nagar taluk and Hassan district. Farmers say that the production of this rice variety is less compared to its demand, which is growing. According to the growers and suppliers, the price of a kg of Rajamudi rice was around Rs 37 to Rs 38 per kg last year, which is now sold at between Rs 44 to Rs 50 per kg. “No other rice varieties witnessed such an increase in price,” said C K Ganesh, president of the Mysuru Grain Merchant Association. “Other rice varieties recorded a Rs 2-Rs 3 increase in price per kg, as paddy is procured from the Hyderabad-Karnataka region, due to the increase in price of petrol and diesel for transportation,” he said. According to the regular users of this rice variety, in the beginning of last year, a kg of unpolished Rajamudi rice cost Rs 37. “However it is now selling for Rs 50 per kg in the retail market. A few growers from Hassan are supplying the rice for Rs 44 to Rs 45 per kg,” said Shrimati Kundur, a regular user of the rice variety. “In some e-commerce platforms that sell organic products, it is being sold for above Rs 60 per kg,” she said. Nagaraj D T, a farmer from Dasanakoppal village in Holenarasipur in Hassan district, said that this rice variety is grown only in a few villages in Mysuru and Hassan districts. “Earlier, the demand for this rice was only from Mysuru. However, now it is in demand across the state,” he said. Nagaraj, grows the Rajamudi variety of rice on his paddy field, and supplies it based on its demand. “More people are shifting to consuming Rajamudi rice as it is good for health,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/price-of-rajamudi-rice-soars-as-demand-surges/articleshow/85436736.cms||Shrinivasa M

The police immediately detained him and rushed to his house where they found the woman lying dead along the road. An officer from the Hinjewadi police said the suspect, Rahul Pratape (32) of Punawale, later said he killed his wife, Gauri (21), as he suspected her of having “an extra-marital affair”. “They had got married about five year ago and were staying at a rented room at Vijaynagar in Punawale,” the officer said, adding that Pratape was working as a private security guard, while Gauri was a homemaker.

---||Pune||Khadki resident sets self ablaze on office premises of Pune CP||PUNE: A Khadki resident (42) suffered 75% burns after he slit his wrist and set himself ablaze near gate number 3 of the Pune police commissioner’s office on Wednesday noon over an alleged delay in getting a character verification certificate. He was rushed to a private hospital in Kasba Peth with burns to hands, chest and face. His condition was reported as critical. Preliminary investigation revealed that the man, who stays with his wife and two children, had on July 1 applied for a police character verification certificate to secure an office boy’s job with a private company. He is a school dropout. On Wednesday, he visited the police commissioner’s office premises and inquired with the policemen in the verification section near gate number 3 about the status of his plea. After he was told that the verification would take some time, he took the drastic step, police said. The verification was taking time because his name was identical to that of a criminal on police record, the police said. Pune commissioner of police (CP) Amitabh Gupta said, “It is an unfortunate incident. We shall look into the matter on priority.” Deputy commissioner of police (Special Branch) Mitesh Ghatte said, “Another man with the same full name has serious cases registered with the Kothrud, Samarth and Sahakarnagar police stations. Two police stations verified the Khadki man’s plea and have replied in the negative (no cases against him). The reply of one police station is awaited.” Ghatte said, “The policemen in the verification section told him that his verification was pending owing to the criminal cases registered in the past against a similar name. They told him to wait for a few more days for the completion of the procedure. Yet, he took the drastic step.” He said, “After making inquiries, the man walked out of the police commissioner’s office premises. He stood in front of the gate and slit his wrist before dousing himself with some inflammable liquid and walking back into the premises. Before the security personnel at the gates could realise what he was up to, he set himself ablaze and started walking towards a small temple on the premises. Some policemen acted swiftly and put gunny sacks on him and contained the flames.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/khadki-resident-sets-self-ablaze-on-office-premises-of-pune-cp/articleshow/85438383.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Amid opposition, civic panel clears Rs 205-crore O2 plant contract||MUMBAI: Amid allegations of “match fixing” and irregularities, the BMC standing committee on Wednesday cleared a trimmed-down contract for installing more oxygen plants at jumbo Covid-19 centres in the city. From the earlier plan to award works worth around Rs 320 crore, the BMC will now give out contracts of around Rs 205 crore to install oxygen generation plants. TimesViewDespite several allegations, the BMC allowed work to be given to a tainted company. The company failed to deliver on time. At least now, the BMC should come clean on all allegations of tainted firms taking part in contracts to set up oxygen plants and ensure that the work is awarded to competent firms in a transparent manner. Action must be taken for all delays and irregularities must be investigated.The BMC will install oxygen generation plants at all its jumbo Covid centres, including the centres at NSCI in Worli, Nesco in Goregaon and the centre in BKC, among the 11 locations. With its earlier contractor, Highway Construction Company, facing a penalty over delays in the previous oxygen plant contract, the BMC has decided to give a bulk of the new plants to a new contractor, GSN Associates. Out of the total works, almost two-thirds of the contracts have been given to GSN Associates while Highway Construction Company has been picked for a portion of the job. The BMC had last month issued a notice imposing a penalty on Highway Construction, which was given a Rs 84 crore contract to install 16 oxygen generation plants at civic hospitals, for failing to complete the work on time. The firm, which has faced allegations of shoddy work in the past and has been penalised in the BMC’s penguin enclosure contract, was supposed to complete installation of the plants in one month. Officials said that work on almost all the plants was nearing completion and that all plants will be operational in a couple of days. Officials said that as per the tender conditions, the company will face a penalty of 0.5% of the total amount per week of delay. Officials said while some sites were handed over to the company on June 16, some were handed over later by June 25 and that they would calculate the exact amount of penalty for locations where the oxygen plants are not operational in 30 days. In the past, Mumbai City guardian minister Aslam Shaikh had alleged “match fixing” in the BMC’s oxygen generation plant contracts worth around Rs 320 crore. Additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu did not reply to a queries from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-amid-opposition-civic-panel-clears-rs-205cr-o2-plant-contract/articleshow/85440531.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Diamond sparkle a succour during rain deficit gloom||RAJKOT: Munna Sahira, a diamond polisher, is staring at failure of his groundnut crop on seven bigha land in Badhda village of Amreli, due to deficient rain. But Sahira is not unduly worried. His skill of glittering the diamonds has come handy and he has got a job in a polishing unit in nearby Savarkundla town. Amid uncertainty over rains, there is a gloom in Amreli, one of the major groundnut producing districts. But at the same time there is a silver lining too. As many as 150 new diamond polishing units have come up in Amreli in the last six months. The emery wheels in these units, which get job work from diamond cutting and polishing hub Surat, are working overtime these days as demand for the gems overseas has witnessed an increase. Amreli and Bhavnagar districts have been traditional centres for cutting and polishing small diamonds, which are one carat or less. The units are located in Palitana, Gariyadhar, Gadhada, Amreli and Savarkundla. Ghanshyam Dobariya, president of Amreli Diamond Association said, “There is good demand and we have sizable orders for polishing rough stones from Surat and Mumbai. There are people in Surat supporting their friends and families in the native to start production. As a result, 150 new units have started.” Importantly, the new units have given jobs to nearly 4,500 people. When Covid-induced lockdown was clamped last year, diamond artisans became jobless and had no option but to return to their natives in Saurashtra for farming. According to a rough estimate, around three lakh people had returned to Amreli district alone, most of them from Surat. The diamond polishing houses in Amreli were locked and some of them had to wind up the business as they couldn’t sustain the financial stress in 2020. Bhavnagar diamond units also foresee sunny days ahead. Vitthal Mendapara, president of Bhavnagar Diamond Association said, “We are now back on track and all the units have good job work. The prices of polished diamonds was expected to increase because of Covid situation but we don’t expect that it will hamper the demand during the Diwali festival.” There are 700 diamond units in Bhavnagar employing 1.25 lakh people. According to some reports, there has been a 27% increase in diamond exports from India recently.  Devchand Kapopara, who has a unit in Savarkundla said, “Currently, people have old stock of rough diamonds and they want to book the profit by polishing them early when prices are good.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/diamond-sparkle-a-succour-during-rain-deficit-gloom/articleshow/85438448.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nod for 6km tunnel to rid Mithi river of raw sewage||Mumbai: The BMC standing committee on Wednesday cleared a proposal for the construction of a 6km tunnel that will aid in preventing the discharge of raw sewage in the Mithi river. The project is estimated to cost close to Rs 500 crore. Opposition party corporators said the contractor for the project was blacklisted in the road scam that rocked the BMC in 2015. Rais Shaikh, MLA and standing committee member, said the contractor appointed was a joint venture of J Kumar Infraprojects and Michigan Engineers Pvt Ltd. J Kumar Infraprojects was blacklisted in 2017 after it was found guilty in a road scam. Its blacklisting period of three years has now ended. “The civic body has very easily given an entry to a blacklisted contractor whose tenure of blacklisting was also reduced,” Shaikh said. Opposition leader in BMC Ravi Raja said that anything to improve the state of the Mithi would be beneficial. The 6km tunnel with a shaft diameter of 10 metres will start from two locations: Bapat Nalla and Safed Pool nalla. The work period is 48 months. Sewage will be collected and diverted to Dharavi Sewage Treatment Plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nod-for-6km-tunnel-to-rid-mithi-river-of-raw-sewage/articleshow/85442577.cms||Richa Pinto

Muchhandi was walking towards Somatane Phata at that time. “While crossing the highway, he was knocked down by the dumper and killed on the spot. The driver suffered injuries too, but he fled,” sub-inspector Aniket Hivarkar of the Talegaon Dabhade police said. The dumper carrying crushed sand had turned on its side. The vehicle and the sand, which had spread on the highway, caused traffic congestion for around half-an-hour on the stretch.

---||Pune||Pune: Kothrud professor recalls longest 8km ride in Kabul||PUNE: Eight km stood between life and death in Kabul for Kothrud resident Parag Rabade on Sunday morning. He was among the 151 people who returned to India on Tuesday by a special Indian Air Force flight. Rabade has been working as a professor in technical vocational education and training in Kabul since 2015. He arrived in Pune on Wednesday morning. Recalling his experience in Kabul on Sunday morning, Rabade said he was tense and worried even though he had submitted his passport to the Afghanistan authorities for stamping to exit the country a few days ago. He said he lived just eight km away from the Afghan office in Kabul, but travelling in that situation to get his passport back was putting his life in danger. “A colleague from my workplace, Yusuf Frotan, agreed to take me to the government office in his car. All the main roads in Kabul were chaotic. So, we had to take several detours to reach the office where to my surprise a staff member was waiting with the stamped passport. It was the most harrowing car ride. We took almost eight hours to cover the distance,” Rabade said. During the commute, he passed by the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. “The situation there was totally chaotic. People were climbing over the compound wall of the airport. The Taliban were firing in the air. I will never forget that scene in my life,” he added. He arrived at the Indian Embassy in Kabul safely by car on Monday morning. “We crossed check posts manned by the Taliban without any hassles,” he added. The embassy gave accurate information about the situation and provided all assistance till they reached Jamnagar in Gujarat on Tuesday, he said. Rabade, a chemical engineer with a PhD, said the situation in Afghanistan changed dramatically in one week. “We were under the impression that the situation will be peaceful for three months. I did not hurry with my plan to come back sooner,” he added. He is worried about the fate of his students and friends in Afghanistan. “Their future is unpredictable. They do not know what will happen to their education. I had started several activities in Kabul in the last two years. I hope to complete them,” Rabade added. He has worked in Ghana and Uganda. Though he wants to go back to Kabul, his decision will depend on how the political situation unravels. Rabade’s wife, who did not wish to be named, said, they were worried about his safety. “ We thank the Indian government for arranging a special flight and bringing back all our citizens safely home,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kothrud-professor-recalls-longest-8km-ride-in-kabul/articleshow/85438413.cms||Sandip Dighe

The woman’s liver and both kidneys also gave a new lease of life to three other needy patients at two different hospitals in Pune on the same day. This was the 20th case of multi-organ donation in Pune so far this year. “The woman suffered intracranial bleeding and was admitted at KEM Hospital at Rasta Peth three days ago. Her family members, including her 21-year-old son, consented to donate her vital organs, including lungs, liver, and kidneys, after she was declared brain dead,” said Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator, Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), Pune branch. The ZTCC is an apex organization that oversees the allocation of donated organs. The Chennai hospital’s medical team arrived in Pune early on Wednesday, retrieved both lungs, and flew back to Chennai soon after. “The lung transplant in the 61-year-old Chennai man has been successful. The next 48 hours are crucial to confirm the transplant outcome,” Gokhale said.

Interestingly, the gallery’s first pre-auction exhibition of lab-grown diamonds was held in the city which is globally known as the natural diamond capital. The gallery is an initiative of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) and was inaugurated by its chairman Colin Shah on Monday. The auction house is spread across 2,700 sq ft area and considering the high-value products on display here, it is insured for Rs 30 crore. “Any product falling in the category of gems and jewellery can be put up for auction here including lab-grown diamonds. There is no such common platform available in the country,” said Dinesh Navadiya, regional chairman GJEPC. The auction house will provide a common platform for multiple sellers and buyers. “Foreign sellers can show their product to buyers in Surat at the auction house. Local buyers can examine the products physically and also bid for them without having to visit the foreign country,” Navadiya added. On the first day, the exhibition received an overwhelming response with visits from 53 buyers against the registered number of 48. “Total 175 companies from Bhavnagar, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Surat have registered with us. Representatives of these companies will examine the diamonds and bid for them,” said Salim Punjwani of Vacradima Ventures, the firm that is managing the auction house. “It is a good move by GJEPC as it provides a common platform to sellers and buyers. We are already buying from individual companies and now we have one more option to select our products from,” said Chintan Kubadia, partner in Epoch Diamond. The bids for the diamonds will be opened on August 21. Coloured gemstones, jewellery, multiple qualities of lab-grown diamond along with natural rough diamonds will be put up for auction at the gallery, officials informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/indias-1st-gems-auction-house-opens-in-surat/articleshow/85438496.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Mysuru||Mys-B’luru Expressway will be completed by Sept 2022: Simha||Mysuru: MP Pratap Simha said that the Mysuru-Bengaluru Epressway, which is being upgraded to a 10-lane highway, will be completed by September 2022. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Simha said that the highway connecting the two cities will reduce travel time from three hours to just 90 minutes. Upgrading the 117 km highway is divided into two components. The construction of 56 km of the road from Bengaluru to Nidagatta is the first, and from Nidagatta to Mysuru the second. The construction work started between May-December 2019. “The work is likely be completed by September 2022. The work has been done through funds provided by the central government. Construction of a bypass road of 60 km has been completed. By the end of January 2022, the remaining work will be completed,” he said. Simha said that the highway has been upgraded to ensure better connectivity between Bengaluru and Mysuru. “The project was initiated to connect Mysuru to Bengaluru, which passes through Ramanagar and Mandya. It is a project initiated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, but MPs from Ramanagar and Mandya are trying to claim credit for it,” he said. Reacting to Mandya MP Sumalatha’s recent comment on the construction of the express corridor, Simha said that she has expressed doubt over the work being carried out scientifically. “We are clarifying whether the work is being done in a scientific manner or not. If the Mandya MP has doubts regarding the work, then she can get it inspected by experts,” he said. ‘93km stretch of NH-275 being developed’ Simha said that the NHAI has taken up the development of a 93 km stretch of the Mysuru to Kushalanagar section of NH-275. Three bypasses have been proposed, having a total length of 84 km, which include bypasses at Kushalanagar, Periyapatna, Hunsur city, Bilikere and Mysuru city. “The existing travel time from Bengaluru to Madikeri is 7 hours, which will be minimised to 3.5 hours due to this project. It will cost Rs 3,883 crore, and the work will start from June 2022,” he said. Similarly, the Kerala border to Kollegal section of NH-212, with a total length of 129 km, is being examined by the central government on priority for a project, for the next financial year, to prepare a detailed project report (DPR). “The project is likely to cost around Rs 400 crore,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mys-bluru-expressway-will-be-completed-by-sept-2022-simha/articleshow/85436557.cms||---

It can be recalled that Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) Mysuru launched an EV charging station at its corporate office in Vijayanagar in January 2021. Now with the increase in the number of EVs, at least six such charging units have been set up. EV users said that these days they were carrying the charger along with their vehicles, fearing a breakdown at any time. “Now, the charging facility is available in many places, where the vehicles can be charged in an hour, which is enough for rides in the city,” said Satish Basrur, a marketing executive who uses an e-scooter. “The biggest challenge for e-scooters is keeping the battery charged. More charging points will surely promote EVs,” he said. Madan, a customer support executive of a charging station on MG road, said that EVs are still at an initial stage in terms of business. “Generally, we get around 20-25 cars per day for charging. The number crosses 25 cars during weekends. We are providing recharge facility only for four-wheelers now,” he said. Change in vehicle preference made resorts and hotels set up charging points for EVs. “In our facility, we set up a flow charger for EVs, as many of our customers are arriving in them,” said Shiva Swaroop Urs, who is the managing partner of a resort here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/resorts-hotels-set-up-ev-charging-points-in-mysuru/articleshow/85436159.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Textile sector in Gujarat expects boost to exports||AHMEDABAD: With the Centre announcing the new rates under the Rebate on Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) scheme, textile exporters are expecting a boost in order volumes backed by better cost-competitiveness. According to the new rates, RoDTEP extends incentive of 2.5% to 4.5% on the export of yarn and fabrics of different kinds. Even though ceilings have been imposed on procurement price to be able to avail the benefit, exporters in the textile sector say that the rebate will sure improve their cost-competitiveness. “Price competition from textile makers in Vietnam and Bangladesh is one of the major challenges Indian exporters face. Both these countries enjoy a free trade agreement (FTA) with European and other markets, giving them a clear edge over Indian manufacturers. This is especially true for garments and made-ups, where staying costcompetitive was not sustainable for Indian textile makers after the government withdrew the Merchandise Export Incentive Scheme (MEIS),” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham – Gujarat state council. “However, with new incentives rolled out as part of RoDTEP, exporters will now be able to offer a competitive price to their customers. Better pricing will help manufacturers gain more order volumes and in turn boost their revenue,” Thaker added. In the textile sector, export demand has begun to increase with inquiries pouring in for yarn, fabric as well as garments from various countries. The rate announcement, according to industry players, has come at the right time, when exporters can leverage the demand. Industry estimates suggest that the textile sector and its ancillaries provide employment to an estimated 75 lakh persons across Gujarat. Manufacturers of technical textiles as well as manmade fibre (MMF) will have an edge, said industry players. “As demand rises, our competitiveness will surely go up and bring in greater order volumes. Although the announced rates need to be revised to compensate the actual embedded taxes and levies paid by the exporters in case of the MMF textile lines. Inclusion of the entire MMF textile value chain will encourage inclusive growth in exports of MMF textiles,” said Narain Agrawal, past chairman, Synthetic and Rayon Textile Export Promotion Council (SRTEPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/textile-sector-expects-boost-to-exports/articleshow/85441484.cms||Niyati Parikh

Motorcyclist Khandu Pujari succumbed to injuries on Tuesday while undergoing treatment at a hospital, the police said and identified the injured pillion rider as Mahadev Suryavanshi. Both men were casual workers residing at Gokulnagar in Katraj. The police on Tuesday registered a case of endangering human life and causing grievous hurt against officials of a private construction and infrastructure company hired by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for the road work. “The company did not install any barricades or diversion boards at the site, neglecting safety of road users. Pujari, who was riding the bike, failed to spot the ditch in the dark and the bike fell down,” said sub-inspector Atul Thorat of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station. VG Kulkarni, head of PMC’s road department, said, “We have asked all civic contractors to ensure safety measures at the locations where their work is underway. The contractors are also expected to deploy security persons at such locations where works are underway for a longer period. In the Sukhsagarnagar accident, the city police have initiated action. The PMC will provide necessary assistance.” On Wednesday afternoon, no company official was present at the accident site. Despite several attempts to contact company officials, they remained unavailable for a comment. Thorat said, “Pujari and Suryavanshi were working at a site near Swargate and they were heading towards Gokulnagar in Katraj. They entered the lane and fell into the ditch and then into the adjacent nullah.” Local resident Prem Dhaware said, “At night, we saw the two men on the bike moving into the lane and falling into the ditch. The motorcyclist sustained serious injuries as he collided against iron rods. My friends jumped into the nullah and brought them out. Then we called up their employer and they were taken to the hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biker-suffers-fatal-injuries-after-fall-into-7ft-ditch/articleshow/85438458.cms||---

To create awareness about it among the people, Karnataka State Rural Development and Panchayat Raj University (KSRDPRU), Gadag, has kept an original copy of it for public viewing at its library. For the first time, the original copy of the Constitution of India is on display for the public and students in the varsity.

Former CM and leader of the opposition, Edappadi K Palaniswami, accused the DMK government of attempting to foist cases on him and former ministers. The AIADMK announced it would boycott the assembly for two days. Members of the AIADMK led by O Panneerselvam and Palaniswami, wearing black badges, raised slogans against the government and held up placards with condemnatory messages. “They (the DMK government) are trying to foist a case against former ministers and me with deliberate intent to malign us. The AIADMK is not afraid,” Palaniswami told reporters. The Kodanad case was reaching a finale when the DMK regime summoned the prime accused K S Sayan (on Tuesday) for additional probe and obtained a confessional statement against me and other AIADMK partymen, said Palaniswami, citing reports in sections of the media. The witnesses in the cases had already been interrogated and the district sessions court in Ooty had posted the next hearing on August 27. “But the DMK government has sought to make political gains by foisting a case against the AIADMK leaders and intimidating them,” the former CM said, accusing the DMK of trying to divert attention from his unfulfilled poll promises. Earlier, his attempts to raise the issue in the assembly were rejected by the speaker and he walked out of the hall. Speaker M Appavu ordered the marshals to evict the MLAs raising slogans in the corridor. Later, the AIADMK members held a dharna on the Kalaivanar Arangam complex where the assembly proceedings were being held. Palaniswami said the DMK advocates represented the accused when the case went to the district sessions court in Ooty, and now, that they were government counsels after the change of guard, they were seeking additional probe. “The court has not passed any orders (for further probe). The Supreme Court verdicts in the past was with regard to reinvestigation,” EPS said, vowing to overcome the challenges just like former chief ministers M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa did and continue to work for public welfare. Panneerselvam said the legislature party would boycott the assembly till Thursday as the DMK regime, instead of implementing poll promises and improving the economy, sought to indulge in “anti-democratic activities”. Earlier, Speaker M Appavu condemned the AIADMK members for bringing disrepute to the assembly by holding up placards. He said no permission was sought by Palaniswami to raise the issue on the floor of the house. The former chief minister’s remarks on Kodanad case were expunged and marshals were ordered to remove the members raising slogans against the DMK government in the corridors. “Not only did they behave indecently in the House, but outside too,” Appavu said. When PMK leader G K Mani said the party would walk out, the Speaker said if the leaders were true to their conscience, they would know that the case was not filed by the DMK government but by the previous AIADMK regime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eps-accuses-dmk-of-targeting-him-in-kodanad-murder-case/articleshow/85440600.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Delhi||Why week 2 is crucial in Covid fight||NEW DELHI: A person suffering from Covid-19 needs hospitalisation if the infection progresses to the inflammatory phase. This usually happens in the second week of illness. Medical intervention in this period can prevent a third of the deaths caused by the coronavirus. Doctors at AIIMS came to this conclusion after analysing the factors responsible for critical illness in Covid patients who were admitted in the institute’s Jhajjar centre between April and June. The centre, designated a Covid facility, admitted 2,080 Covid patients in the three months, of whom 406 (20%) died. Dr Sushma Bhatnagar, chairperson of Covid services, AIIMS, who is also the corresponding author of the study, told TOI that hospital admission in the third or fourth week of illness increased the odds of Covid death. Other risk factors included pre-existing comorbidities and old age. She added: “Vaccination and hospitalisation in the second week of illness reduced the odds of death, respectively, by 30% and 36%.” Dr Anant Mohan, professor and head of medicine, AIIMS, said the difference in the outcome between patients admitted in the second week versus the third was probably because the former group was still in active inflammatory stage when the body responds to steroids whereas in the third week, the disease is perhaps too advanced to respond to medication. “The results showed that patients who developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) had very poor outcomes, a pattern also established globally,” Mohan said. Covid progresses in three phases: early infection, pulmonary phase and hyper-inflammation phase. While the early phase appears to be due to the virus itself (5–7 days), the two later phases are thought to be due to the inflammatory response (7–15 days from disease onset). Dr Mohan said early admission to the hospital, especially during the inflammatory phase could make a difference by reducing mortality. In the AIIMS study, there were 1,067 patients who required oxygen and of them 63% survived. The remaining 37% that succumbed needed some form of oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. Doctors said this reflected the severe nature of Covid pneumonia and ARDS. “More than 47% of patients had ARDS due to Covid-caused pneumonia. Respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation had a very poor prognosis with only 14% of those receiving non-invasive ventilation and 2% of those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation being discharged. It was disappointing that almost 86% of patients who had to be ventilated died,” the researchers point out in the study. The presence of renal dysfunction, irrespective of the need for renal replacement therapy, and hypotension were also independently associated with increased mortality. Doctors stressed that vaccination could reduce the odds of deterioration or death in any future upsurge in infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-week-2-is-crucial-in-covid-fight/articleshow/85440608.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The protesters included functionaries and workers of the BJP Yuva and Purwanchal Morcha with Sikh Prakoshth, who gathered in Chanakyapuri around noon to carry out the protest. The nine-foot-tall statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh was vandalised on Tuesday at the Lahore Fort and the act was condemned by India. Addressing the protesters, Gupta said that what had happened in Pakistan on Tuesday showed the mentality and fundamentalism of the people involved. He demanded arrest and severe punishment against those involved in the act of vandalism. He also demanded that the outfit responsible for the act should be banned and the government of Pakistan install the statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh again with complete respect and provide security in the area.  A memorandum was submitted to the commission demanding strict action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-protests-statue-vandalisation-in-pak/articleshow/85440622.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Now more international schools seek BMC permission to reopen||MUMBAI: After three foreign schools in Mumbai were allowed to reopen their campuses this academic year, other international schools offering a Baccalaureate or a Cambridge program have now written to the BMC to seek permission for in-person schooling. The American School of Bombay (ASB) at BKC, Deutsche Schule Bombay (DSB), a German school at Breach Candy and Lower Parel, and Lycée Francais International de Mumbai (LFIM), a French school in Lower Parel, as reported in TOI on Wednesday, have got approvals to conduct offline classes. The Association of International Baccalaureate (IB) schools has cited their example to seek BMC’s permission for offline schooling for all its 20-odd member institutions. They have cited the constraints posed by online teaching and loss of social and developmental learning as reasons for the need to be back in the physical space. Schools in Mumbai have been shut since the March 2020 lockdown. ASB, DSB and LFIM are members of the same Association. Frank Braccia, chairperson, India IB Heads, western division, said IB schools had conducted physical board exams in February-March and had zero Covid cases. International schools have a low student-teacher ratio and all Covid protocols in place to reopen in the physical mode, the representatives told BMC. With another board exam due in November, these schools now want to bring students back to classrooms. The Members of International Schools Association (MISA) that represents 110 Cambridge board schools, including 82 in Mumbai, has also made the same demand. Over 45 of them had written even earlier in January seeking approval to reopen. Dr Kavita Aggarwal, MISA chairperson, said, “The best time to start is when cases are decreasing.” Cambridge schools want the 9-12 grade students to have in-person learning. All international schools are ready with their plans to reopen, said Dr Aggarwal. State board school heads are also keen on bringing older students back to class.“We can easily bring standard 8-10 students to the school. Many parents have shown willingness to send their children, said the principal of an aided school. A government resolution issued on August 10 had signalled reopening of schools both in urban and rural areas, but concerns expressed by the state task force on Covid-19 had led to the decision being put on hold. Francis Joseph, a school development expert, said reopening schools will not result in a Covid surge if precautions are taken. “The BMC should consider approving more schools on a “case-to-case” basis instead of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ directive,” he said. Dr Swati Popat Vats, President, Early Childhood Association and Association for Primary Education and Research, has also written to BMC for reopening pre-schools, primary schools and day care centres. “The prolonged loss of two years in learning is a setback to young children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-more-intl-schools-seek-bmc-permission-to-reopen/articleshow/85440665.cms||Sandhya Nair

However, the police have refuted all allegations of torture. Accused Rakesh Thakor, 27, had apparently failed to appear in all the summons that the court had sent him. A police team then went to his house with a summon on August 12. He was produced in the court, which sent him to judicial custody from August 12 to 15. “All we (police) did on August 12 was to inform Thakor that he was not presenting himself in the court despite the summons and brought him to the police station. It was for just 10 minutes before we proceeded to present him in the court,” Mehsana SP Parthrajsinh Gohil told TOI on Wednesday. “When he was in sub-jail under judicial custody of the court, how can the police have taken the law into their hands and killed him?” Gohil asked. Wife of the deceased, Jassiben, alleged, “Only after custodial torture, did the police take my husband to civil hospital for treatment on Sunday, when it was already too late.” The woman added that she had also submitted a memorandum to district collector Udit Agarwal on Wednesday demanding strict action against the guilty policemen. In the memorandum, father of the deceased, Samtaji Thakor too has threatened to take out a protest rally to Gandhinagar if the authorities failed to take action on their plea. Besides relatives, the memorandum was also signed by some leading members of the Thakor Samaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kin-demand-probe-in-judicial-custody-death/articleshow/85438583.cms||---
---||Delhi||Centre opposes petition in Delhi high court against Rakesh Asthana as police chief||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday opposed a plea challenging the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner, even as the court sought to know if any other plea concerning his appointment was pending before any court. “Is any such matter pending before any other court?” asked Chief Justice D N Patel while hearing a petition by Sadre Alam against Asthana’s appointment and extension of service by a year. Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said, to his knowledge, no such challenge was pending before any other court, but he would find out. The bench, which also comprised Justice Jyoti Singh, asked the counsel to take instructions on the aspect and proceeded to adjourn the hearing to next week. Advocate B S Bagga, representing Alam, urged the court to issue notice on the petition, but the court declined at this stage. “No. We are still going to read everything. We will see,” the court said. The ASG opposed the plea arguing that it had become a business for “so-called-integrity-keepers” to challenge any appointment made by the authorities. He submitted that Alam had no locus standi to challenge Asthana’s appointment. The plea argued that Asthana's appointment was in violation of the existing service law. “Four days before retirement he was appointed to the post,” Bagga stated, as he claimed that the service conditions mandate a minimum residual tenure of six months. The 1984-batch IPS officer, serving as the director general of Border Security Force, was appointed Delhi Police commissioner on July 27— four days before his superannuation on July 31. In his petition, Alam has sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Union home ministry appointing Asthana as the commissioner, and the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him. It also claimed the high-powered committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition, in its meeting on May 24, 2021, had rejected the central government’s attempt to appoint Asthana as the CBI director based on the “six-month rule” as laid down by the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-opposes-petition-in-hc-against-asthana-as-police-chief/articleshow/85440643.cms||---

On Tuesday, the sevikas across the district approached the project officer at panchayat samiti offices to hand over the cell phones. District president of the samiti, Anita Kulkarni, told TOI that the government had given 1,05,592 mobiles to the sevikas in 2019 aiming to collect updated information about beneficiaries. “The sevikas used the phones regularly, but all the devices became defunct one by one after the two-year warranty expired this year,” said Kulkarni. Kulkarni further said that the sevikas were supposed to feed the data in Marathi initially. “Recently, the Central government introduced an app in English on ‘nutritional diet’ which was beyond the understanding of the less-educated sevikas. Besides, the mobile given to them was of 2GB and the new app couldn’t be downloaded. The mobiles would also stop functioning in between,” she said. Maya Bhaurao Pawar, the Darwha taluka president, said that they brought it to the notice of senior officers, they expressed their helplessness “due to financial crunch”. “Later, we took up the issue with women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur but nothing changed,” she said. Secretary Sunita Gawande demanded that the “faulty” devices be replaced with better quality ones. “Secondly, we want the app in Marathi,” she said, adding that despite prior intimation, neither the project officer Rekha Kinake nor the BDO of Darwha Panchayat Samiti was present when they reached the office to return the cell phones. “We left the mobiles on the taluka project officer’s table,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/anganwadi-sevikas-return-faulty-cell-phones-to-govt/articleshow/85440707.cms||---

The bench said that once the probe was ordered by the court, then the agency will look into all aspects which it comes across during the investigation. It said that the state should be agreeable for a comprehensive probe to find out the truth and observed that the state was trying to “stultify” the probe at every stage.It dismissed the plea against the July 22 order of the Bombay high court and said that it cannot dilute the direction of a constitutional court ordering a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe by drawing a line for the agency on which aspect the investigation should be done.The bench thereafter heard the petition filed by Deshmukh against the same HC verdict. Senior advocate Amit Desai made comprehensive arguments on Section 17A of Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 under which sanction was needed to prosecute a public officer. He said that it was mandatory to get consent of the state government, which was not done and sought the court’s interference as the issue had not been dealt with by any court after the amendment was brought in in 2018. The bench, however, said that it was not inclined to interfere and said that it would pass a detailed order on Section 17A if the petitioner wants. Desai said that there was no need for a detailed order in this case but the bench should some day examine and settle the issue relating to interpretation of Section 17A in other cases.On July 22, the HC said the CBI can inquire into the transfer and postings of police personnel and the reinstatement of Sachin Waze “so far as this has a nexus with Maharashtra’s former home minister Anil Deshmukh and his associates”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/not-inclined-to-interfere-with-hc-order-on-deshmukhs-plea-sc/articleshow/85440705.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Data deficit on Dalits’ business role across country, Telangana||HYDERABAD: While chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has exhorted Dalits to utilise the Rs 10 lakh bonanza from Dalit Bandhu scheme to become entrepreneurs, there is very little socio-economic data on the community’s participation in business. Though exact figures are unknown, data from the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation about the social group of enterprise owner or significant partner reveals that only about 75 out of 1,000 businesses in the state are held by members of the SC community. These are enterprises of proprietary and partnership units. The survey included 9,001 samples out of a total of 24,75,010 projected businesses in the state. Among southern states, AP was at top with 106 SC owners from the sample enterprises considered in the state. Karnataka at 75 was comparable to Telangana, while Kerala had only 47 such proprietors. But neither the state nor the Centre has done a survey or study to find out the socio-economic background of people in in the unorganised sector. With the state government planning to link the Rs 10 lakh incentive in the Dalit Bandhu scheme with a small business or any other activity, the number of Dalits holding businesses in Telangana is expected to rise. The state government has identified 30 occupations/small businesses where Dalits might put their benefit money to good use. However, complete instructions on who will be qualified and how the enterprise would be directed are yet to be released. “The push to create small entrepreneurs from Dalit community has been there since the 1980s. In recent years, the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DICCI) has emerged to assist them with medium and large projects as well,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/data-deficit-on-dalits-biz-role-across-country-state/articleshow/85440669.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Body of her two-year-old son was also found from the rented room in which she lived along with her husband.  The boy had died of suffocation and is suspected to have been smothered to death by the woman.

The GOs pertaining to the scheme were not put in public domain, the NGO said. Advocate General BS Prasad refuted these allegations and said that the chief minister himself had announced the programme on the floor of the Assembly and GO MS No 6 was issued on July 18 narrating detailed guidelines for the implementation of the scheme. An initial amount of Rs 1,000 crore was also sanctioned for the purpose, he said. The bench while asking the petitioner to come to court only after a thorough research, however, asked the state to keep all its GOs in public domain within 24 hours of their issuance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-court-junks-petition-against-dalit-bandhu/articleshow/85440679.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Mumbai||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh fails to appear before ED for fifth time, ‘will seek lawful remedies’||MUMBAI: Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, facing a money laundering probe, failed to appear before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday. The ED had issued a fifth summons asking him to appear, but his lawyer Inderpal Singh visited the agency’s office and submitted a letter saying Deshmukh offered to record the statement through electronic medium (video conferencing). Earlier, the ED had rejected a similar request of Deshmukh and asked him to appear in person for questioning. The ED may soon move a court requesting to issue a non-bailable warrant or arrest warrant against Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh for avoiding summons, an ED source said. Deshmukh’s written reply to ED on Wednesday read, “Please take note that in accordance with the leave and liberty granted by the Supreme Court, I am taking recourse to lawful remedies for the protection of my liberty and such other relief relating to the violation of the procedure established by law.” It further added that the recourse will be taken within a day or two. It is believed that Deshmukh, along with his son, may approach the court here for anticipatory bail in the money laundering case. On Monday, the SC refused to grant Deshmukh interim protection from arrest in the money laundering case and said he can avail remedy under CrPC and approach the appropriate forum for relief. The ED is investigating a money laundering case against Deshmukh based on the CBI’s corruption FIR against him where former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh had asked Waze and two other officers to illegally collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month for him. The ED already established a money trail of Rs 4.7 crore hafta that now-dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze had collected from bar owners in Mumbai and handed over to Deshmukh’s private staff Kundan Shinde. Afterwards, Hrishikesh approached a Delhi-based hawala operator who layered the cash through shell companies and from that amount, he transferred Rs 4.18 crore into Deshmukh’s educational trust in Nagpur as a donation, the ED has said. The ED has been searching for Deshmukh and Hrishikesh for the last many days in the case and had raided some locations at different times on specific inputs, but in vain. - V V Singh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-home-min-fails-to-appear-before-ed-for-5th-time-will-seek-lawful-remedies/articleshow/85440720.cms||Vijay V Singh

Shipra Path SHO Mahaveer Singh Rathore said police arrested one Harjesh for abducting Uttam Jain on Tuesday. “The case pertains to payment of money between the two. We have arrested the accused and investigation is underway,” he said. Police said while prima facie the case appears to be a case of the money-related feud, the case is being investigated to see if there were other motives. According to the FIR which was filed by Jain’s son, the businessman was abducted when he was heading to Madhya Marg in his car. Near Patel Marg, at least eight men armed with iron rods, stepped out of a car and began hitting Jain’s car. Jain’s son alleged in his FIR that his father’s car was damaged and the accused took him away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/one-held-for-traders-abduction/articleshow/85442607.cms||---
---||Surat||‘Regular trains only after review’||Surat: During her first visit to the city after becoming Union minister of state for textile and railways, Darshana Jardosh claimed that the pre-Covid train movement will be restored only after thorough review of the pandemic situation at various levels by the government. Due to limited train movement, thousands of travellers including daily commuters are facing major issues while trying to reach their workplaces. Multiple up and down trains between Bhilad to Vadodara used to carry employees daily but these trains were discontinued for Covid. “The government is reviewing various aspects and will take necessary actions to restart the trains,” the three-term Surat MP reassured. Replying to a question about non-availability of concessions for senior citizens, Jardosh said, “Regional offices of railway normally take decisions related to concession for various categories. Necessary decisions will be taken by the officials after the review of the situation.” Blaming the opposition parties for creating disruption in parliament during her formal introduction at time of appointment as minister, Jardosh announced the start of Mumbai Mahuva train which she will be flag off from the city on Wednesday. Stoppage of a Sampark Kranti train has also been allotted at Surat railway station, she said. Ducking questions relating to developing a railway division office in Surat despite it being one of the highest revenue generating stations in the state, Jardosh, however, claimed these to be opposition parties’ voices. “Railway is in process to reduce the division offices so that large scale development can be under taken. There are no plans in current situation for a division office in Surat,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/regular-trains-only-after-review/articleshow/85438715.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra probe panel imposes Rs 25,000 cost on former Mumbai CP after he seeks adjournment||MUMBAI: Justice K U Chandiwal on Wednesday adjourned the recording of evidence of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh to August 25 subject to payment of costs of Rs 25,000 by Singh, to be deposited in the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (Covid-19) within three days. This is the second time the commission has imposed a cost on Singh. Earlier, on June 22, it had asked him to pay Rs 5,000. Following a letter written by Singh to CM Uddhav Thackeray on March 20 which alleged that then home minister Anil Deshmukh had asked (now-dismissed) assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners in Mumbai, the state government set up a commissioner of inquiry led by Justice Chandiwal, a former judge of the Bombay high court, to probe the charges. On July 5, Singh’s lawyer Sanjay Jain raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability and purpose of the commission on the grounds that the scope entrusted to it had already been adjudicated upon by the high court, which had observed that the inquiry should be conducted by an independent agency. Justice Chandiwal on July 30 rejected Singh’s contention, saying the purpose of the commission had not at all been judicially adjudicated by the HC order. Subsequently, on August 6, Parambir Singh filed a fresh application before the commission, saying the ongoing proceedings should be adjourned as he had challenged the proceedings before the high court in the week starting August 9. Deshmukh’s advocate Anita Castellino opposed the adjournment on the grounds that no copy of the writ petition had been served, the commission had a time-bound schedule of six months, and there was no stay from any of the competent forums for the commission. The commission was, during its proceedings on Wednesday, informed by Singh’s advocate Sanjay Jain that the proceedings may be adjourned since the petition filed by Singh is likely to be taken up in the week commencing August 23. Advocates for Deshmukh, Sanjeev Palande and Sachin Waze opposed the adjournment application. “After hearing the advocates, it is obvious the inquiry is to be completed within a schedule time. The earlier order of July 30, though questioned belatedly, for that purpose the inquiry ordinarily should not have been stalled. Ignoring other aspects and development, the fact remains that the parties will have to adhere to the time schedule. As a last chance, keep the matter for evidence of Param Bir Singh on August 25 subject to payment of costs of Rs 25,000 to be deposited by him in the CM Relief Fund - Covid-19,” Justice Chandiwal observed in his brief order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-probe-panel-imposes-rs-25k-cost-on-ex-cp-after-he-seeks-adjournment/articleshow/85440732.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Vijayawada||Oppn to challenge ‘GOs offline’ order||Vijayawada: The state government’s decision to keep all its GOs in offline mode has come in for sharp criticism from the opposition and other quarters. It may be recalled that the government, on Monday, decided to dispense with uploading the GOs on its official portal (goir.ap.gov.in) and a memo to this effect was circulated among heads of all departments by principal secretary Revu Mutyala Raju. The online portal, which saw the posting of 48 GOs on Monday, was blank on Tuesday. The government justified its decision by stating that the same is being practised in several other states, and the central government. Opposition TDP reacted strongly to the decision. “Whatever the government does is for the people. There should be no secret. The decision is unfortunate and reflects the dictatorial attitude of the chief minister. If court cases are the reason behind this move, we will find some other way to get information,” TDP MLC P Ashok Babu said, and challenged the government to also block the FIRs (registered in police stations) on similar lines. He further said that the decision is as against the Right to Information Act and the central government’s National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy of 2012. “In this era of technology and transparency, it is not acceptable to keep GOs in the dark,” Babu said, and added that the TDP would challenge the decision in court. APCC president and former minister Sake Sailajanath said it was the Congress government led by YS Rajasekhar Reddy which introduced the system to keep GOs in public domain. “If chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is claiming his father’s legacy, why is he withdrawing the system? What does it reflect?” Sailajanath asked. AP BJP president and former MLC Somu Veerraju said people gave Jagan’s party 151 MLAs to govern the state in a democratic manner. “Unfortunately, Jagan is behaving like a dictator with each passing day. BJP will fight against the decision. It must be withdrawn,” he demanded. States like Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Kerala, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Tripura post their GOs online, while the Maharashtra government posts its GOs in the respective department portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/oppn-to-challenge-gos-offline-order/articleshow/85410712.cms||Gopi Dara

Police identified the accused as one Sandeep Yadav, a native of Kotputli tehsil in Jaipur. The accused was caught while looking through the ventilation window of the washroom of the room where the official was staying. DCP (South) Harendra Kumar said the investigation into the case was underway. According to Vidhayak Puri police station, the accused had begun working in the circuit house about 20 days ago. “He was employed on a contractual basis where he worked as a cleaner and helper. He was caught after someone at the circuit house raised an alarm about his activities,” an official informed TOI. The accused was booked for harassment and was being interrogated. Police said they were investigating to see if a background check was conducted before he was hired. The sources informed TOI that a small ventilation window of the washroom opens into the corridor of the circuit house. Because it was dark, the accused climbed up to see through the window of the washroom. Meanwhile, a person who was passing through the corridor spotted him. After the accused was caught red-handed, the officials staying at the house raised an alarm. The Vidhayak Puri police station was summoned about the incident and they arrived at the circuit house to arrest Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/21-yr-old-arrested-for-peeping-into-woman-officers-washroom/articleshow/85442608.cms||---

The court passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation filed by I Aseervatham, state coordinator of an NGO People’s Watch in 2019. He had filed the petition seeking probe into an incident where 25 remand prisoners staged a protest against the police check for ganja inside the Madurai Central Prison on April 23, 2019. The district legal services authority had conducted a preliminary inquiry and submitted a report before the HC.  It was stated in the report that non-supply of sufficient water for bathing, cleaning and toilet purposes, ill-treatment by officials searching ganja and cellphone were the reasons for the protest.  It was further stated in the report that no one sustained any serious injuries in the protest. A division bench of ustices N Kirubakaran and S S Sundar observed that ganja or drugs inside prison can not be permitted and hence strict vigilance cannot be dispensed with. If, for any reason, this is permitted, then the prison will never be a place conducive for reformation or rehabilitation which requires a favourable atmosphere. Hence, the judges issued the following directions to the state government in order to prevent such in the future: The judges directed that the adequate drinking water and water facility for other purposes should be provided. The chief judicial magistrate or any judicial officers visiting prisons shall record the adequacy of water supply and management. Number of inmates and water supplied should be furnished to the visiting judicial officer in a prescribed format. The judges further directed that there should not be any excess or human rights violation at the prisons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hold-checks-to-prevent-narcotics-in-prisons-hc/articleshow/85440724.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Using an ID found at the crime site, police tracked Imran’s location to Ghaziabad. On Wednesday, the 34-year-old was arrested from a pharmacy near Sihani Gate in Ghaziabad. SP City Devendra Pincha told TOI that the murder was committed in a fit of rage. “The couple fought frequently over money since the last couple of months. An argument had broken out between the two in the early hours of August 16 which led Imran to strangle her to death. He then headed for their home in Noida, picked up his belongings and left for his home in Ghaziabad,” Pincha said. According to police, Imran had shifted with the woman at a society in Greater Noida’s Shahberi area around a year ago. He had introduced himself to people in the society as ‘Rishabh.’While the woman worked at a real estate firm, Imran was a scrap dealer from Patel Nagar area of Ghaziabad. Both were divorced. The couple had left for Nainital on August 14, with another couple from the same building, to celebrate the woman’s birthday on August 15. During check-in at the hotel, the woman’s ID was used for the room they shared, so the discrepancy regarding Imran’s name wasn’t noticed then. His real identity came to light when police and forensic teams searching the murder site found Imran’s ID, leading to the suspicion that Imran was Rishabh’s real name. “The woman even had a tattoo of the name Imran,” Pincha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/2-days-after-noida-woman-found-murdered-in-naini-hotel-her-live-in-partner-arrested-from-gzb/articleshow/85437002.cms||Kautilya Singh

He said police should work with the spirit that justice be given to the aggrieved. Gehlot was addressing the inauguration ceremony of the new buildings of 15 police stations at a cost of about Rs 34 crore and the foundation stone laying of buildings for 9 new police stations. The CM said Rajasthan was the first to implement the policy of mandatory FIR registration. This had led to a reduction in petition seeking FIRs through courts. In 2017-18, 33 per cent of women had to go to courts to register FIRs in rape cases. Now this figure has come down to 16 per cent. In 2019, 34 per cent cases of women atrocities were pending in the whole country, whereas in Rajasthan, only 9 per cent such cases were pending due to priority in disposal of cases. He said the average time taken in investigation of cases of misconduct of women has also come down from 287 days to 140 days in the state. He said many false cases were being registered in police stations. According to a 2019 report, about 45 per cent of the total cases disposed of in Rajasthan were found to be false, while the national average was 16 per cent. DGP ML Lather said in 454 police stations, reception rooms have been constructed. Principal secretary (Home( Abhay Kumar said in the last two-and-a-half years, one police district, two additional superintendent of police offices, 21 police stations, 2 cyber police stations, 32 outposts, 2 ATS posts, two field units of SOG and one anti-narcotics unit had been formed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-working-hard-to-modernise-police-force-says-gehlot/articleshow/85442624.cms||---
---||Vadodara||In 20 minutes, police dog sniffs out 6 rapists-murderers in Vadodara||Vadodara: An indefatigable 18-month-old female Dobermann, a member of Vadodara rural cops’ dog squad for about a month now, has proved to be the ‘Holmes’ among canines, yet again. Jawa took less than half an hour to end a ghastly murder story by leading cops right up to six criminals who raped and killed a 38-year-old woman. Displaying high athleticism, sharp focus and a tenaciously determined sense of purpose the dog sniffed a dupatta and a bottle on the crime spot and started walking in the northern direction. It walked continuously for around 2 kilometres, through fields and bushes until it crossed the busy Ahmedabad-Mumbai railway line and entered a tent where it started barking agitatedly — making it significantly clear that she arrived at her goal — leading to the arrest of six men on Tuesday. Jawa proved why dogs have an edge in detection — they smell first, see and lastly hear for clues at a crime spot — exactly the opposite of what human investigators do. As for Jawa, this detection has been a hat trick for the 18-month-old canine within 45 days, which had earlier helped in detection of a murder in the neighbouring Chhota Udepur district and more recently, found out a murder weapon in Vadu. In this case, the mother of three children was gang raped by six men in a farm where she was cutting grass as per her daily routine, on the outskirts of Dethan village of Karjan taluka on the evening of August 16. The accused later strangled her to death fearing detection. The body was found around 9 pm by her family who were searching for her as she failed to return home till late. A case was registered at Karjan police station in the wee hours of Tuesday. The next morning, different teams of cops spanned out interrogating the family members, villagers and probing using technical resources. At the same time, the forensic team, armed with Jawa, reached the crime scene and the chapter was brought to a close within less than 30-odd minutes by the dog who brought the net down on first accused, 22-year-old Lal Bahadur Girjaram, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, inside one of the five tents on the rail track. “In the past too, tracker dogs have been used for investigation purposes, but this was an important development as this dog led us to one accused and subsequent investigation and interrogation resulted in other accused’s arrests,” said Dr Sudhir Desai, superintendent of Vadodara rural police. Jawa’s handler, head constable Haresh Mohaniya was all praise for his ‘girl’. “Her (Jawa’s) behaviour was unusual as she was constantly barking and walking around inside the tent. Our suspicion was strengthened when she chose only one among around five tents at the spot. I had trained her for a year before she was inducted into the squad. She is a quick learner and is especially sharp when it comes to investigation.” While Girjaram was taken to Karjan police station for interrogation, another team of police questioned the other labourers at the camp. Five other suspects identified as Dilip Chaudhary, a 45-year-old resident of Jharkhand, Jagguprasad Pandu (21), Pramod Pandu (23), Ramsurat Pandu (19) and Arjun Pandor (19), all natives of Uttar Pradesh too, were picked up for questioning. “They are all hardened criminals. We got a confession from them after we interrogated them separately and then together for over seven hours,” said inspector D B Vala of local crime branch. All six were working on a contract for the last 10 days for maintenance of railway tracks. Police are now investigating if they have been involved in any other crimes in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/in-20-minutes-police-dog-sniffs-out-6-rapists-murderers-in-vadodara/articleshow/85438783.cms||---

The home department on Wednesday issued an order directing the Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to hand over the case. With this development, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed by Mumbai police gets disbanded. The home department has taken the decision as the scope of investigations is becoming wider and secondly due to the multiple FIRs against Singh. The Mumbai SIT had last month arrested two businessmen named in the Marine Drive FIR. The duo, Sanjay Punamia and Sunil Jain, were accused of conniving with Singh for extorting Rs 20 crore from developer Shyam Sunder Agarwal. Punamia and Agarwal were partners before they parted ways. Sources said the home department is also likely to transfer two other FIRs registered with Thane police to the state CID. - Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cid-to-take-over-cases-lodged-against-param-bir-sit-disbanded/articleshow/85440747.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Sweating over clouds that vanished? Relief is in sight||NEW DELHI: After a warm week that has seen mercury touch 38 degrees Celsius — four notches above normal — respite is expected from Thursday with a very light rain forecast for the city. India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts moderate rainfall for Friday, with a good spell on Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday. Met officials said the monsoon trough that shifted to the foothills had moved back south once again, with rains expected next week as well. “Delhi was going through a dry spell as the monsoon trough had touched the foothills. At present, it has moved southwards of Delhi and may move even further down before coming back closer to the city,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD. “Peak rainfall activity is expected on Friday night and on Saturday morning, while light rain and drizzle is expected on Thursday and Friday during the day as well,” he added. The capital recorded a maximum temperature of 38 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, same as Tuesday’s. The Sports complex station in east Delhi was the hottest location in the capital, with a maximum of 39.7 degrees, followed by Pitampura at 39. IMD says mercury is expected to drop to around 36 degrees Celsius on Thursday and to 33 by Friday. On Saturday, the maximum may drop to 32 degrees; however, humidity levels will remain high. Delhi last recorded rainfall on August 9. This has meant Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, has received only 63.2mm of rainfall so far this month as opposed to a normal mark of 157.1mm — putting it into a 60% deficit for the month. The normal mark for August is 247.7mm. Met officials say while a recovery is expected in the last 10 days of August, the capital could still stay in deficit for the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sweating-over-clouds-that-vanished-relief-is-in-sight/articleshow/85440849.cms||---

Earlier, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had fixed August 26 to start the assessment, but after a committee member was replaced, the date has been postponed. A senior forest official said, “Committee member Dr Kaushik Banerjee, research scientist, Tiger Cell, WII, will not be able to come for the assessment. He will be replaced by senior biologist Ayan Sadhu. Now, the committee will visit for an assessment in September. Dates have not been decided yet.” The four member committee comprises two retired IFS officers, RN Mehrotra and NK Vasu, Sadhu and Hemant Kamdi, AIG, NTCA, who has been appointed as member convenor. If declared, Kumbhalgarh sanctuary will be the fifth tiger reserve in the state. The committee will undertake assessment of current status of human habitation, habitat, boundary delineation, landscape connectivity, encroachment, prey base vis-a-vis the site’s potential for a tiger reserve. As per office memorandum, it will submit a report in 30 days. Fateh Singh Rathore, DCF (wildlife) Rajsamand said, “With good prey base and less human interference, Kumbhalgarh is an ideal tiger habitat. Hopefully, we will be able to witness these majestic cats here in coming years.” Kumbhalgarh sanctuary is spread over 1,280sqkm, which is bigger than Sariska, and has recorded presence of tigers since 1970s. Rituraj Singh (advocate and conservationist) said, “Once upon a time, tigers used to be the apex predators of Aravalis. With nod from the expert team, big cats will soon reclaim their old turf as situation is favourable.” The proposed reserve lies in the districts of Pali, Rajsamand, Udaipur and Ajmer and is located in the oldest range of Aravallis spreading over the tract starting from Khulbrahora (Gujarat) and culminating on Delhi ridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kumbhalgarh-survey-for-tiger-reserve-status-in-sept/articleshow/85442636.cms||---

The focus on diilapidated buildings comes a day after the wall of an old house collapsed near Jorawar Singh Gate. Though no one was injured, it could have led to a big mishap. Civil defence and police took two hours to clean the area. Being a centuries old area, many such buildings in Walled City need to be demolished before they become dangerous for the public. A councillor from Kishanpole, Arvind Methi said, “There are many such dilapidated houses in my area and I have complained to the municipal corporation many times. Officers should pro-actively take part in demolishing such buildings. Till now no one has been injured, but there are chances that a mishap may happen in future.” Last year, one house had collapsed in Walled City. Although the building was abandoned, a major mishap was averted. Most of such old structures are there in Hawamahal and Kishanpole areas. JMC-Heritage Hawa Mahal zone deputy commissioner said, “We have identified around 30 such structures in our zone. All house owners have been given notices to demolish the structures or we will do it. We have also asked junior officers to carry out a survey.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/65-old-buildings-in-walled-city-yet-to-be-demolished/articleshow/85442670.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur Development Authority begins work to build Rs 36 crore rail overbridge at Civil Lines||JAIPUR: Long wait to cross the railway line at Civil Lines will become a thing of past as the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has started work for railway overbridge (RoB) project which will connect Jacob Road and Jamunalal Bajaj Marg. After selecting the firm, the digging work has started on ground between Raj Mahal Palace junction and railway crossing gate. An official said, “The awarded firm will complete the work in October 2022. The JDA will spend Rs 36.40 crore to complete the structure.” As per the estimation, total project cost will be approximately Rs 75 crore, while remaining amount will be spent in construction of service lanes and shifting of utilities, including drains, water-pipelines and others. The length of the four-lane elevated road will be 703 metre. Earlier, the JDA has decided to constructed two-lane, RoB at the crossing. However, after witnessing the traffic congestion in the area a revised drawing was prepared and nod to construct four-lane was given in project works committee (PWC) meeting. The JDA had also initially planned to construct three-leg flyover, connecting Parivahan Marg. But plan was shelved due to lack of feasibility. Around 20,000 vehicles cross on the passage. The project demand is long-pending and the JDA first decided to construct a RoB on the crossing in 2012. But proposal was shelved citing security reasons. “The JDA had appointed Rambol Consulting Engineering Limited, a Kolkata-based company, to carry out a feasibility report. The company had submitted six options,” said a source. In the previous report, it was proposed that the RoB over the railway line had to be constructed with a 60-degree curve. However, many opposed the move as giving such a sharp turn could have raised the possibilities of accident on the overbridge. Shifting the police outpost and water tank situated near the track was also challenged at that time. JDA official said, “Out of these six options, the JDA had found that construction of a RoB from Jamunalal Bajaj Marg to Jacob Road was the most feasible option. The proposal had to be sent to the chief minister for final approval as it was proposed to be constructed near the chief minister’s and governor’s residences. However, the UDH department did not move the proposal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-begins-work-to-build-rs-36cr-rail-overbridge-at-civil-lines/articleshow/85442689.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Second shot hurdle for Sharjah family stuck in Kolkata||KOLKATA: An Indian couple residing in Sharjah, who had to come to Kolkata on an urgent family visit this April, is unable to return home because one of them took the first Pfizer shot in Sharjah but cannot get the second shot as Pfizer is yet to be administered in India. The UAE government has allowed people with residency permits to return from India as long as they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to travel. With the August-end deadline for their daughter to join school looming large, the family is getting desperate by the day. “We have to return by this month-end. Or else, my 11-year-old daughter Vaidehi will lose her seat in school and her future will be in jeopardy. My wife Pooja has taken two shots of Sputnik V in India and hopes she will be able to re-enter Sharjah. But I can only get my second shot if I return. Yet, there is a clause that restricts only those who have had two shots to board the flight,” recounted Sameer Rastogi, who has a firm in Sharjah. The three had arrived in Kolkata towards the beginning of April after Pooja’s mother who lives in Jodhpur Park fell ill. They were supposed to return around April-end but the UAE banned entry of passengers from India after the third week of April to prevent the spread of the more infectious Delta variant virus. “Since June, I have been rescheduling flights every week and hoping that we will be able to return to our lives. I will take my second dose as soon as I land in Sharjah but I cannot do anything till I land there and right now, flying there is the biggest hurdle,” he said. Travel agent Anil Punjabi is exploring various options but getting the second Pfizer vaccine elsewhere is proving a challenge. “The family needs to travel but is caught in a chicken-and-egg situation. Unless they return, Rastogi cannot get his second shot. And yet, the current rules permit only those who have had both shots to return,” said Punjabi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-shot-hurdle-for-sharjah-family-stuck-in-kol/articleshow/85438815.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: At 71, IIT-Kharagpur fulfils medical college dream; mass communication next in line||KOLKATA: Medical education will start at IIT-Kharagpur from November 2021. This was declared by higher education secretary Amit Khare at the 71st Foundation Day of this oldest institute of the IIT chain on Wednesday. A team of experts was sent by the central government a week ago to inspect the infrastructure in place. A medical college-cum-super speciality hospital has been set up on the campus for this. The final seal of approval to the medical school is due to arrive shortly, said director V K Tewari. The Foundation Day programme was held virtually, with education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Amit Khare joining online, along with a large number of young alumni from across the globe, some of whom were also awarded for their contributions to their respective professional fields. Pradhan announced that soon instructions in technical education will not be restricted to English but there will be eight regional languages in which students will be able to attend classes. This is being done to remove the obstacle of proficiency in English, which is preventing many students to take up tech studies, he said. A department of mass communications will be the next milestone that the institute will strive to achieve after the medical school since this is the only field that is still beyond the ambit of the institution, said director Tewari. This will be done with the help of alumni and talks are in progress, he added. The institute also announced the Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar full scholarship for the top 100 rank holders of IIT JEE (Advanced) on the occasion. The institute has 70,000 odd alumni and a lot is expected of them to take the institute forward, Tiwari said, adding that he was looking at a future when the institute will become self-sufficiemt and not need government grants any more. It is likely that an alumnus will help the institute start a sports academy too and talks are already on. The fact that the institute has a different approach to life and education with its centres of happiness and folk arts was also lauded. “It is the oldest IIT but the youngest in enthusiasm and that is apparent from its multidisciplinary approach,” Khare said. He appreciated the research work that the faculty and research associates did during the Covid times to bring breakthroughs in treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-71-iit-kharagpur-fulfils-medical-college-dream-mass-communication-next-in-line/articleshow/85438809.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

They have contributed a lot to the economy of the state. However, in the wake of the pandemic, their activities have been adversely hit. That is why, we decided to offer them assistance,” Dhami said. The CM, while interacting with self-help groups belonging to all the 13 districts through a virtual medium, said, “The country is moving fast in the direction of fulfilling the dream of a self-reliant India. Women self-help groups have a significant contribution to this.” Under the Mukhyamantri Swarojgar Yojana, the beneficiaries will be given interest reimbursement at Rs 5,000 per month on the loan taken for six months. The total cost for the same would be Rs 9 crore. Interest reimbursement assistance will also be provided to the loan account holders of Mukhyamantri Saur Swarozgar Yojana for six months leading to an estimated cost of Rs 1 crore to the government, the communique from the CM’s office said.

The case also invoked the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act. Kundra is in judicial custody in connection with another case under the Information Technology Act for alleged publishing and transmission of “pornographic content” registered earlier this year. His counsel submitted that two other co-accused were granted protection earlier. In a similar relief to co-accused Umesh Kamat, the HC continued interim relief of pre-arrest bail to him in the November 2020 case. Kamat’s case, through his lawyer Sudatta Patil, is that his name is not even mentioned in the FIR and he has no role or nexus in the alleged offence. Kamat is out on bail in the case after a three-month stint in custody. Both Kundra and Kamat, in separate petitions, have challenged the sessions court order which had refused them anticipatory bail, but had granted interim protection till rejection of their plea. Kundra’s senior counsel Shirish Gupte and Patil informed Justice S K Shinde that the copy of the sessions court order is not yet available. The prosecutor, PP Shinde, sought time till August 25 in Kundra’s petition, to seek instructions for a response.

---||Delhi||Nine-year-old’s death in Delhi: No signs of short circuit in water cooler||NEW DELHI: Investigations in the alleged rape and murder case of a nine-year-old girl in Delhi Cantonment suggest that the water cooler, with which the accused had claimed that she got electrocuted and died, didn’t show any signs of a short circuit.  Sources in the Crime Branch said none of the four accused, including the priest of the crematorium where the incident occurred, had been given a clean chit so far. The chargesheet would be filed within the stipulated period by the end of August, police said. “An electrician who had repaired the water cooler was also examined and he also stated that he had only changed the condenser and there was no sign of a short circuit,” said an investigating officer. Police sources claimed that the accused would watch porn films and the priest would often ask the girl to give him a head massage for Rs 10. The girl’s mother also mentioned that the priest would ask her for “maalish”. The girl was found dead in mysterious circumstances at the crematorium in southwest Delhi’s Nangal village on August 1. Her parents are ragpickers and live in a rented room opposite the crematorium. She had gone to get cold water from the crematorium’s water cooler around 5.30pm after informing her mother. Around 6pm, the priest and three others, who were known to the mother, called her to the crematorium and showed her the girl’s body. They said she got electrocuted while taking water from the cooler. The girl was then cremated without the consent of her parents. Following this, the family and relatives of the girl alleged that she had been sexually assaulted and murdered and also staged a protest and blocked the roads. Initially, an FIR for death due to negligence and destruction of evidence was lodged and the caretaker-cum-priest of the crematorium, Radheshyam, was arrested along with the other three, Saleem, Kuldeep and Laxmi Narayan. Later, IPC sections of murder, sexual assault and criminal intimidation, apart from provisions of POCSO Act and SC/ST Act, were added to the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nine-year-olds-death-no-signs-of-short-circuit-in-water-cooler/articleshow/85440934.cms||---

The incident took place in the Peepal Padav forest range of Terai East forest division about half a kilometre from Sidcul Halt railway station. Train services were disrupted for over two hours after other elephants of the herd came on the tracks. Two trains running from Kashipur to Bareilly and Kashipur to Kasganj were cancelled. Later in the afternoon, the forest and security personnel drove the herd back into the dense forest. Divisional forest officer of the Terai Central range, Abhilasha Singh, said the bodies of both the pachyderm were taken away and postmortem will be conducted. "The carcasses will be disposed of as per the norms," Singh added. Superintendent of Sidcul Halt station, NS Dongariyal, meanwhile said, "As soon as the train crossed Sidcul Halt, the elephant and its calf suddenly came on the tracks. The loco-pilot stopped the train but by then, the animals had been hit." The train was sent back to Sidcul Halt and passengers went to other railway stations by buses, he added. Locals have been demanding a barricade on either side of the stretch for a while and have urged officials time and again to take up the matter.

---||Kolkata||‘Taliban brought back nightmare of Kabuliwalar-Bangali-bou horror’||KOLKATA: Two friends from the literary world who had helped Sushmita Banerjee re-tell her story about life in Taliban Afghanistan and a filmmaker who had made a film about that life see vivid scenes rush back to them as the world watches Afghanistan in horror. Banerjee was married to an Afghan in the city who lived and worked here as a money-lender. She went to Afghanistan with him and faced terror that was unleashed on her by the Taliban. She went back again but was killed there. After managing to return to the city, Banerjee jotted down her experience and asked her two writer friends — Adhir Biswas and Sailen Sarkar — to help her make a book out of the manuscript. “As we read through it, we thought we were reading a thriller. Sushmita was tortured and kept in confinement for days. After reaching Afghanistan, she was appalled at the way women around her were treated. She started forming a group of women and in doing that, she faced the wrath of the Taliban,” remembers Biswas, who helped her name her book ‘Kabuliwalar Bangali Bou’ and found her a publisher. Both Biswas and Sarkar find strange parallels in what is happening now and what she had related to them. “As a Bengali progressive, she could not adjust to the situation there. There was not a moment’s peace and bullets flew everywhere as people cowered for their lives. She was targeted for being an outsider who was trying to raise a band of women to take on the mighty Taliban,” said Sarkar. The book was filmed by Ujjwal Chatterjee in 2003 as ‘Escape from Taliban’. Before the film was shot, the filmmaker and his team accompanied Sushmita to Sarana, her in-law’s village. “The day we reached, we saw a girl running for life and a few men chasing her with guns. This was repeated with another girl the day after. We were horrified. Soon, we were contacted by the Indian embassy. We were asked us to return to Kabul and leave the country since it was not safe,” Chatterjee recalled. No one was sure why Sushmita went back to Afghanistan once again and was killed there. Her bullet-riddled body was discovered not far from Sarana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/taliban-brought-back-nightmare-of-kabuliwalar-bangali-bou-horror/articleshow/85438824.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Idols get smaller with Puja budget cuts but Kumartuli gets more orders this year||KOLKATA: Idol manufacturers in Kumartuli have started receiving more orders than earlier years. However, the idols ordered are shorter in size than before, courtesy a large number of big ticket Pujas cutting down their budgets. They are also avoiding theme puja plans that involve specialised artisans outside the potters’ colony and going back to smaller community pujas with traditional idols. “Business has suddenly peaked in the last few weeks and now I have over 12 orders from some of the city’s major Puja organisers. Though the idols are shorter in size and are priced almost half than earlier years, the situation is way better than what we had expected even a month and half ago,” said artisan Bholanath Pal. TimesViewIt is a positive sign. Things may not be back to pre-pandemic levels but a gradual return to near-normalcy is welcome. All stakeholders — artisans, customers and government agencies — must adopt the requisite safety measures so that commerce does not become a cause for concern and can go on unhinderedArtisans Mintu Pal and Indrajit Pal said along with traditional idols, they also have a dozen odd orders for thematic idols and have their hands full this year. “Over the last few years, the focus of puja organisers had shifted from the idols to theme based pandals and lighting. Covid has given us an opportunity to bring the focus back on idols, for which Kumartuli is known for. No doubt profits have come down but I am glad the buzz is back at Kumartuli,” said Indrajit Pal. China Pal, the woman artisan at Kumartuli who had kept away from the hype over thematic Durga idols these past years is also much in demand. “I always prefer crafting traditional Durga idols. This year, it's good to see other artisans going back to their roots and sticking to traditional idols which are in vogue this time,” she said. The stress on traditional idols has also brought sellers of chalchitra and daaker saaj and traditional costumes, ornaments and weapons back into business. “Theme pujas had pushed us out of business. It’s good to be back in the fray again,” said Sandip Das, an employee at a Kumartuli shop selling Durga ornaments, weapons and other traditional decorations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/idols-get-smaller-with-puja-budget-cuts-but-kumartuli-gets-more-orders-this-year/articleshow/85438921.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Their only son, an army school teacher is now stuck in Kabul. The couple has had no contact with their son since Monday. Shyamal Bhattacharya, a 66-year-old school headmaster, and his wife Minati, residents of Nimta’s Udaypur in North Dum Dum, are terribly worried after their son Tamal’s flight ticket on Wednesday from Kabul airport was also cancelled. The 30-year-old mechanical engineer got the job as a teacher in Kazan International School, an army school in Kabul, in March. He was staying in the school’s staff quarter and teaching physics and chemistry. For the last couple days, the couple has been desperately trying to contact their son over phone and on social media sites, but in vain. The couple could contact with their son over a chat messenger for the last time on Monday afternoon. “It was around 3pm on Monday while I managed to get in touch with my son online. As he came online, I asked him about the situation. All through, he was trying to tell me that he was fine. I could make out that he was confused and scared. He was just trying to calm me down. He is now in school principal’s house and managed to get in touch with the Indian embassy who assured him to make an arrangement for his safe return to Kolkata,” Bhattacharya said, adding that they urge both the Indian and Bengal government for their son’s rescue. The father gave his son some suggestions to be safe amid the turmoil. But after a few minutes, he left the chat. Since then, Tamal has remained incommunicado. Minati, the mother who is almost having a panic attack after watching the situation on TV news channel throughout the days, is still weeping while talking about his son. “We are really scared of the situation there. We are afraid since he is an army school teacher. My son’s flight ticket on Wednesday got cancelIed. I don’t know what is my son’s condition now and what he is doing. We have been unable to contact him. I just pray for him to be safe,” the elderly mother said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prayer-on-lips-elderly-parents-wait-for-sons-return-from-afghanistan/articleshow/85438826.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Dehradun||41 years on, fired govt employee to get arrears, pension||DEHRADUN: A former employee of the Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan, who was unfairly terminated in 1980, will be paid arrears and pension — 41 years after he first took the legal route. On Tuesday, the single bench of justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari in Uttarakhand high court held that Kan Singh Rana, a resident of Dehradun, was “wrongfully terminated” and, thus, should be given all retirement benefits, including pension, along with arrears. Rana, now 78, had alleged in the labour court in 1980 — the year he was dismissed — that the jal sansthan had terminated his services “without any notice and clear reason”. In 2006, the labour court ruled in Rana’s favour, but his employer challenged the judgment in the high court. Jal sansthan had argued that the judgment was “one-sided and they had not been given a proper chance to present their side of the argument.” The high court had then asked the labour court to hear the employer’s argument in the case. Rana’s employer reasoned in court that he was terminated after he failed to report to work for 240 days at a stretch. The labour court’s second judgment also favoured Rana following which the employer again approached the high court. In the final hearing of the case on Tuesday, the high court upheld the labour court’s judgment and directed the department to pay Rana his dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/41-years-on-fired-govt-employee-to-get-arrears-pension/articleshow/85437244.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Delhi||Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana visits northeast Delhi, says support from society is key to upholding law and order||NEW DELHI: On his first visit to northeast Delhi, where riots took place last year, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Wednesday said although cops were trained to tackle all sorts of law and order problems and other issues, effectiveness couldn’t be achieved without the support of the society. He was there to attend a programme, “Ummeed - A step together, towards a better tomorrow”, the theme of which was communal harmony. At the programme, which was organised by the northeast district police at Shyamlal College, the commissioner felicitated the wife of constable Rattan Lal (42) who died after sustaining critical injuries during the riots. Cops who were injured in the recent encounter at Khajuri Khas, in which two wanted criminals were killed, were also rewarded at the function. Addressing the gathering, Asthana said people who disturb peace and harmony should be identified and punished according to the law. “I was not in Delhi Police when the riots took place. But being a police officer, it was very sad for me to hear about it. It was regrettable that this kind of problem arose in a city like Delhi, where people had almost forgotten riots. No community or religion is bad. People who follow religion are not bad. But in every community, there are some people, whom we call anti-social elements, because of whom the atmosphere gets vitiated,” added the commissioner. Asthana said police should try to identify such people in society and punish them according to the law. “Whatever peace has been established in this area, it is due to such programmes. It was established because of such people who believe that violence has no place in the society,” he added. Highlighting the need for harmony, Asthana said, “We live in an age of technology and economic progress can be attained only in a peaceful environment. We should all strive to live together in harmony.”  He also assured full cooperation from police in establishing such community initiatives and in organising social programmes that strengthen unity and integrity of the nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/top-cop-visits-ne-delhi-says-support-from-society-is-key-to-upholding-law-and-order/articleshow/85441088.cms||---
