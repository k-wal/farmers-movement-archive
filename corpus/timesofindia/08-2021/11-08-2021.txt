The demand, however, seems to be a bit higher for warm food rather than the quintessential crowd favourite, popcorn. Moreover, according to the hall owners, the reason for their satisfaction is not just the turnout; it’s also the fact that movie-goers seem to have evolved into be much more responsible and aware about their own safety and that of others around them. 'WARM FOOD IS A SAFE BET'Bubai Saha, a professional who went with his wife to watch a Hollywood release at the theatre on Sunday, said, "Both of us are vaccinated, so we went to watch a film. I must say the theatre is maintaining all safety protocols and even the audience is pretty disciplined. I usually take popcorn but chose to have a burger and tea this time, as I feel warm food is a safe bet in the current situation. But my wife had to have her favourite, caramel popcorn." Businessman Satadeep Saha, who went to a city theatre last weekend to watch a Hollywood release with a friend, said he was thrilled to see the number of people who had come to watch the film. "Watching a film on the big screen has its own charm, especially with a tub of popcorn in hand. But yes, this time, keeping the pandemic in mind, I resisted the urge to have popcorn. We just had tea and a burger. 'THE AUDIENCE HAS EVOLVED'According to Achintya Singha Roy, the owner of Atindra Cinema, when halls last reopened in the latter half of 2020, people preferred just beverages like tea, coffee or cold drinks. "They were not so keen on having any other food at theatres. But this time, the scenario is different. Most people are opting for hot food instead of the usual popcorn or chips. It's also heartening to see the level of awareness about personal safety among visitors. We haven't had to tell anyone to wear a mask or to maintain social distance. I also feel vaccination has also given people the confidence to venture out. And the icing on the cake is the fact that we have new releases to show people," he said. Joydeep Mukherjee of Star Theatres, which is screening a recent Hollywood release and a Salman Khan-starrer, gave a similar feedback. "We are noticing that the mindset of the audience has evolved, especially post vaccination. But the fact that people still haven't let their guard down is evident from their food choices. Most people consider warm food safe and are having tea or coffee with hot samosas or sandwiches. The popularity of popcorn, of course, will never end," he said. The multiplex chains are also happy with the footfall and the choice of films they had while reopening. "We have two new Hollywood releases to draw in people and a few Hindi and Bengali films are set to hit screens in the coming weeks. It's also nice to see the change in consumer behaviour at the ticket counter or the confectionary area. No one is seen without a mask and people are maintaining a safe distance while queuing up in the confectionary area. So, overall, it's a positive trend till now," said Amitava Guha Thakurta, regional director, INOX (East). A spokesperson from Cinepolis, which is showcasing a mix of Bollywood, Hollywood and Bengali content since reopening, said the occupancy has been quite satisfactory, especially during the weekend. "People are wearing masks, using sanitisers and maintaining social distance inside the hall. When it comes to food, the popcorn-soft drink combo is still a hot favourite among children, but there has been a general shift towards warm food like pizzas or sandwiches along with tea or coffee," the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/masks-always-on-social-distancing-and-hot-food2021-movie-goers-are-putting-safety-first/articleshow/85211641.cms||Ruman Ganguly

The Marburg case, which the WHO said was the first in West Africa, was confirmed in Gueckedou in southeastern Guinea. The region was the origin of the 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, the deadliest in history, and saw a brief resurgence of Ebola this year. Georges Ki-Zerbo, the WHO country head in Guinea, said Marburg had been circulating in animals, particularly bats, in southern Guinea and neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia. Pathogens have tended to cross from animals to humans in the region because of their close interaction, notably in the hunting and eating of "bushmeat" from the wild. "There is no known secondary case. The contacts have been traced, and 155 people are under observation for three weeks," Ki-Zerbo said in an interview. "It is active surveillance. The contacts are kept at home, isolated from other members of the family. They are visited every day to check on potential symptoms." Marburg and Ebola are closely related and transmission between humans is usually through contact with blood or other bodily fluids. Guinea was declared free of Ebola two months ago, following an outbreak that killed 12 people. Marburg fatality rates in past outbreaks have varied from 24% to 88% of those infected. But Ki-Zerbo said Guinea was better prepared to handle an outbreak than it had been when Ebola struck in 2014. The discovery of the Marburg case also indicated improved ability to detect such infections. "Guinea has built a robust health security system since the last Ebola outbreak in 2014 to 2016," he said, pointing to the use of rapid response teams, disease detectives, epidemiologists and social anthropologists, and better coordination with neighbouring countries. "Globally, the approach to combating Marburg would not be different from Ebola," he said. "The only difference is that there is no vaccine or drug specifically directed to the virus. Only supportive care is available."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/who-says-guinea-monitoring-155-contacts-after-confirmed-marburg-case/articleshow/85220917.cms||---

During a press briefing, Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday said, "We continue to be in touch with all the parties, whether in Afghanistan or regional parties in an effort to find a political solution."  The spokesperson also said the facts on the ground in Afghanistan as reported are "extremely worrying" and "extremely concerning", Sputnik reported.  "All this should be a reminder for the parties to actually focus on the political process," Dujarric added.  The new wave of deadly clashes by Taliban terrorists started in Afghanistan last month. With US and NATO forces announcing that they are withdrawing from the country, the Taliban began an assault on major cities and seized control of several cities.  Taliban have also attacked civilians and imposed regressive and barbaric rules in the provinces that fell to them.  In less than a week, the Taliban captured seven out of 34 provincial capitals in the country.  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on Tuesday said that violence against Afghan civilians by Taliban fighters "could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/un-in-touch-with-all-parties-in-afghanistan-to-find-political-solution-spokesperson-dujarric/articleshow/85221405.cms||---

---||Guwahati||Assam: ‘No deserving student can be denied admission’||GUWAHATI: Academicians are at loggerheads over the reservation question of 75% seats for Assam board students in degree courses in government and provincialized colleges in the state. Even as the education department remains firm on the decision taken by a committee to decide on the admission policy, managements of schools expressed utter displeasure at the quota. They said meritorious students from CBSE will be deprived of seats in the best colleges in Assam. The All Assam Private Schools’ Association (AAPSA) president, Pankaj Das, said if regional sentiments are at play then the CBSE and other boards have as many Assamese students as AHSEC in the city. “How can the government differentiate between students based on boards?" he questioned. “As UGC funds the salaries of the staff of colleges and universities, can 75% seats be reserved for AHSEC passouts? Should Delhi colleges stop admitting students passing out of boards from the rest of the country?” asked Das, demanding immediate withdrawal of the directive. On the other hand, Assam College Teachers’ Association (Acta), a leading organization of academicians, is in no mood to criticise the directorate of higher education or the education department citing the interests of ‘their own students’. Acta general secretary Himangshu Maral welcomed the admission quota. “There is nothing wrong in prioritizing students from state boards. Due to this policy, a section of CBSE passouts may not get admission in colleges of their choice but they will definitely get a chance to study somewhere within the state. We hope the government will accommodate all the passouts if they don’t prefer to go outside of the state for higher studies,” said Maral. Assam director of higher education, Dharma Kanta Mili, told TOI that the 75% reservation formula has been passed by the committee set up by the state education department for streamlining the admission process. “We are convinced that no deserving student will be denied admission,” said Mili. He, however, agreed that a certain number of students may not go outside of the state for further studies due to the Covid situation and this may put more pressure on colleges in Assam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/no-deserving-student-can-be-denied-admission/articleshow/85221870.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The six communities, Tai Ahom, Moran, Motok, Chutia, Tea Tribes and Koch-Rajbangshi, were assured ST tag by BJP leaders from the time of the general election in 2014. Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) media department chairperson, Bobbeeta Sharma, came down heavily on the ‘anti-people policies’ of the BJP-led governments at the Centre and the state, while addressing a press conference at the Congress headquarters, Rajiv Bhawan, here on Tuesday. “The BJP government has been misleading the simple people of Assam. A prime example of this is the promise of ST status to six indigenous communities of Assam,” said Sharma. “In every election, BJP leaders make tall promises but in reality nothing is done. In neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh the communities got the status,” she alleged. Speaking on the privatization bid of Guwahati airport, the party criticized the alleged move to change the name of the largest airport in the northeast, named after freedom fighter and first chief minister of Assam, Gopinath Bordoloi. The management of the airport is set to be handed over to the Adani Group. The Congress leader also alleged that the BJP government has not only dealt a heavy financial blow to Assam by suspending the Special Category Status and now the Union government has not refunded the GST that is due to the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cong-slams-modi-govt-for-denying-st-tag-to-6-assam-communities/articleshow/85221881.cms||---

Set up in 1911, the golf course which constitutes a part of Kharjan tea estate is owned by Apeejay Tea, the tea firm of Apeejay Surrendra Group. In October 2019, the Kharjan tea estate management took a decision to convert the 9-hole golf course, spread over 25 hectares, into a tea plantation and started ploughing the field using tractors. Shocked and rattled by the turn of events, several organisations of the state, including the Upper Assam Golf Association (UAGA), launched a campaign to save the heritage golf course. The matter reached the ears of the then chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal who directed the Dibrugarh deputy commissioner to look into the issue. After doing so, deputy commissioner-cum-district magistrate Pallav Gopal Jha issued an order prohibiting construction of any kind, ploughing of any form, or undertaking any activity which might destroy the present status of the 190 bigha, 16 katha and 6 lessa of land of Kanjikhowa golf course. He also clamped prohibitory orders under section 144 CrPC. Finally, after 34 months, the prohibitory orders were lifted from the Kanjikhowa golf course during a meeting at the Dibrugarh deputy commissioner's office on August 9 which was chaired by the deputy commissioner and attended by representatives of Kharjan tea estate, Upper Assam Golf Association, All Assam Tea Tribes Students' Association (AATSA) and Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS). “During the meeting it was unanimously decided that the historic Kanjikhowa golf course will be preserved in its present form. A committee has been formed consisting of representatives of the Upper Assam Golf Association, Kharjan tea estate, ACMS and ATTSA. The committee will demarcate the boundary of the golf course, identify encroachment and take steps for the development of the golf course,” Jha said on Tuesday. Welcoming the development, secretary of the Upper Assam Golf Association (UAGA) Siddhartha Chaliha said, “We are happy with the decision. The Kanjikhowa golf course is one of the oldest golf courses in India and we must keep its heritage alive. Assam is synonymous with its tea gardens and golf courses. There are a lot of sentiments associated with these golf courses. Many tourists visit these golf courses to play and to soak in its rich history.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/110-yr-old-kanjikhowa-golf-course-wins-turf-war/articleshow/85221900.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Escort service racket busted in Guwahati, three arrested||GUWAHATI: The crime branch of Assam police busted an online escort service racket operating in the city and arrested three persons, including the kingpin. The accused are Saneep Kumar alias Mukul Bhardwaj alias Bambam (kingpin of the racket), his wife Diya Sarmah alias Junaki Begum and Nayanmoni Patowary (manager of a city-based hotel). The police on Tuesday said the three were a part of an inter-state prostitution racket. “Over the past few days, the social media cell of police commissionerate, Guwahati, came across a few Twitter handles and websites claiming to provide escort services in Guwahati and other cities of Assam. Preliminary investigation revealed the involvement of a possible inter-state prostitution racket,” the police said in a statement. The crime branch registered a case (No 09/2021) under sections 292 and 371 of the IPC and sections 67 and 67(A) of the Information Technology Act on August 5 and began an investigation in an expeditious manner. “Technical analysis led the crime branch to discover the complicity of Nayanmoni Patowary, manager of a city-based hotel, in running the racket. He was picked up on August 5. Patowary’s confessions led the crime branch to net the kingpin, Saneep Kumar, who was running the racket with his wife Diya Sarmah,” the police said. The police said the accused used to communicate with the potential customers via social media or other online methods to fix the date, girls and the rate. “The sex racket operated in the hotel, where Saneep works as a manager. In this process all the accused got a commission,” the police said. The kingpin, Saneep, who was absconding, was arrested from Lakhisarai district of Bihar on Sunday and is being brought to Guwahati. “His wife Diya Sarmah, who was arrested from Patharquerry area of the city on Friday, claimed that she did not know the whereabouts of Saneep. Meanwhile, technical analysis of the mobile numbers used by Saneep revealed several addresses ranging from Delhi to Bihar to Maharashtra. The team found that the accused had at least 10-15 mobile phone numbers with different addresses,” the police said. Using its technical and human intelligence, the police succeeded in narrowing down Saneep’s location to Lakhisarai district in Bihar. A crime branch team rushed to Lakhisarai and picked him up. The police also suspect Saneep of running similar prostitution rackets in other parts of the country as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/escort-service-racket-busted-in-guwahati-three-arrested/articleshow/85221903.cms||Mukut Das
---||World||Biden seeks to support Florida schools threatened by governor over masks||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration is reviewing how it can get money to Florida school districts if the state's governor, Ron DeSantis, makes good on threats to withhold pay from school leaders who require masks for students. Most of Florida's schools reopen this week at full capacity. DeSantis, a Republican, has warned the state could level financial penalties to districts that mandate masks, the latest in a series of actions aimed at brandishing his laissez-faire credentials. But many school officials and public health experts say masks are needed to protect students and teachers, and President Joe Biden has clashed with DeSantis over the issue. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday that the administration is looking at whether it can use unspent Covid-19 relief funds to combat any pay cuts imposed by DeSantis. "We're continuing to look into what our options are to help protect and help support these teachers and administrators who are taking steps to protect the people in their communities," Psaki said. DeSantis's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Republican rising star is closely tied to former President Donald Trump and has become a national figure for opposing pandemic restrictions, even as Florida has become a hotbed of infections and hospitalizations have hit record levels. He is widely seen as weighing a potential 2024 challenge for the presidency. Last week, Biden asked Republican governors like DeSantis to "get out of the way" of efforts to contain the virus. The willingness to call out Republicans marked a shift in tone from Biden, who has tried to take politics out of the vaccination drive. At the time, DeSantis fired back at Biden, saying that he did not want to "hear a blip about Covid from you, thank you," adding, "Why don’t you do your job?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-seeks-to-support-florida-schools-threatened-by-governor-over-masks/articleshow/85221283.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP may waive penalty on tax demand||BENGALURU: In a damage-control exercise, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is considering waiving penalty and interest component on tax demand it had raised against thousands of property holders, alleging that they had not factored in zonal reclassification while paying the levy. The move comes after the Palike drew flak for serving notices on some 78,000 property owners on charges of paying property tax less than what they were supposed to give for four assessment years from 2016-17 till 2019-20. Claiming that the owners had chosen the wrong zone to pay tax, the civic agency had imposed double the difference amount as penalty and 24% interest per annum. With property owners crying foul that they were never informed about the zonal reclassification, BBMP officials are into course correction now. “There was a communication gap that created the confusion. We’re exploring means to ensure that property owners are not burdened with undue penalty and interest component,” said BBMP administrator Rakesh Singh. As per the self-assessment scheme (SAS) rolled out in 2000, properties are classified under eight value zones, based on published guidance value of the locality or the street and the rate of property tax is fixed accordingly. Zone A attracts the highest tax rate, while zone F is in the lowest slab. In case a property owner chooses a lower zone wrongly, s/he has to pay double the difference amount and 2% interest. According to the rules, BBMP is mandated to reclassify the zones and revise rates once in three years (block period) since the value of properties are subject to fluctuation based on the variation in rental rates and current guidance value. BBMP reclassified the zones in 2008-09 and again in 2016-17. “In the first place, the Palike itself violated norms of the block period by failing to reclassify the zones. It also did not communicate about the latest reclassification of zones to property owners and they promptly paid tax based on the earlier classification,” former mayor and Congress MLC PR Ramesh said. “After receiving complaints and grievances from many property owners, we have referred the matter to the administrator. He is looking into it,” said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-may-waive-penalty-on-tax-demand/articleshow/85221938.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

This time too, monsoon showers resulted in waterlogging, low-lying areas getting inundated, and road surfaces deteriorating. The civic body’s monsoon readiness was reviewed at a meeting conducted by revenue minister R Ashoka late Monday evening. During the meeting, it was disclosed that the civic body has identified 209 vulnerable spots across the city. While 58 of them have been categorised as sensitive, 151 have been termed moderately sensitive. Focus on drains Civic officials said that they are overseeing work to ensure waterlogging caused by clogged drains is addressed and stormwater drains are cleaned. The minister instructed the officials to look into shoulder drains alongside roads to ensure there is no waterlogging on roads. According to BBMP officials, east zone has the highest number of vulnerable spots (38), followed by Dasarahalli (37) and Rajarajeshwari Nagar (32). BBMP ward officers have been asked to check ward-level roads and clogging of shoulder drains, and take necessary steps. “The shoulder and side drains also have to be cleaned to control waterlogging on streets,” BBMP chief Gaurav Gupta told TOI. Monsoon dutyAt the meeting, it was emphasised that the task force teams and officers will have to work round the clock during the rainy season to ensure the city isn’t flooded. All officers at the headquarters and at the constituency level will have to ensure proper information reaches Bengalureans. The officers were also instructed to identify and cut unstable trees so that they don’t cause harm to the public during heavy rains. “A team will be constituted to address the problem of waterlogging on roads during the rainy season. When such things happen, heavy-duty pumps should be used to clear the waterlogged areas. Along with that teams will also look at what needs to be done to prevent tree falls during the rainy season,” Gupta added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-has-209-spots-vulnerable-to-flooding-east-zone-tops-list/articleshow/85221943.cms||---

According to T&CP department joint director SK Mugdal, 22 maps were sanctioned in the last around 10 years but in view of increasing traffic load on the 60-meter wide Indore Bypass and service roads, there is a need to widen the same in future. “Because of the same, some accident points have developed on the bypass and if any further construction comes up on the major road, it will increase such black-spots while availability of land for the widening work will be reduced,” he said. The T&CP senior official said as per the law, activities like petrol pump, ATM, banks, vehicle service centre and parking lots are allowed in a 45-meter buffer zone alongside the service road of the Bypass and all 22 maps, which have been suspended, were of the same nature. The officials concerned are examining, if the land owners were taking any other commercial use of the land than the permissions were issued for and in this condition, their maps can be cancelled. “If the state government approves the plan of widening the bypass, we will examine the use of land, which are carried out on the entire bypass including that on the sanctioned 22 maps and based on the nature of every case, appropriate steps will be taken,” Mugdal said. In case T&CP cancel the sanctioned map for widening of the bypass, the affected land owner is likely to be given compensation or benefits of floor area ratio (FAR) to meet their loss. This apart, Indore bypass is 32 kilometer-long connecting Rau to Manglia and on the same, there are more than 200 medium to large-size commercial establishments, mostly roadside restaurants (dhabaa), and if the state government approves the plan of widening the major road, the affected land owners will also be compensated against acquisition of the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/22-maps-sanctioned-within-45m-of-bypass-suspended/articleshow/85221946.cms||---

Bommai who chaired a meeting of senior police officials refused to accept a bouquet and said the practice should be done away with. Karnataka chief secretary P Ravi Kumar issued a circular directing not to give garlands, shawls, bouquets, fruit baskets and memorabilia at meetings and events organised by the state government and government-run institutions. “This directive should be followed strictly by all government departments and institutions under the government,” the CS stated in the circular. Recently, energy and Kannada & culture minister V Sunil Kumar had appealed to those coming to greet him not to give garlands and gifts and asked for Kannada books instead, which he would donate to a library in his Karkala constituency. Kumar amassed over 1,000 books within five days of being inducted into Bommai’s cabinet.

The sero survey is being carried out for kids below 18 years of age to know about prevalence of antibodies among them. In two days, 566 samples have been collected by 50 survey teams deployed in 25 wards. MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit said, “Around 457 samples are collected on Tuesday in 25 wards by the teams.” On the first day, only 109 samples were collected, said Dr Dixit. However, many people didn’t cooperate in giving samples while teams continued to face trouble in searching the address of the people. At many places, team members approached ASHA and ANM activists to make people aware along with IMC employees and NGO activists to find addresses. “We could take only 10 samples in a day as our most of the time was spent in counselling the people for sampling and informing them about the importance of the survey. Few of them voluntarily gave their samples but some of them had closed doors and were even ready to attack us,” a survey team member said, wishing anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/457-samples-collected-on-day-2-of-survey/articleshow/85221953.cms||---

Designing of Rakhis and orders from wholesalers start at least three months ahead of the festival but pandemic enforced restrictions and fear of infection slowed down the work this season, claimed manufacturers. Sanjay Choudhary, a manufacturer and wholesaler of Rakhi said, “Supply is less this season because we could not start at the right time due to pandemic. Manufacturers were afraid to place import orders due to the severity of the second wave and then everything got delayed.” Rakhi is falling on August 22. Mostly low-income group people design Rakhis at their homes on a per piece basis for manufacturers. Indore, a big trade centre of Madhya Pradesh, supplies Rakhis to major cities and rural areas of the state. Rakhi economy gives employment to over 30,000 people directly and indirectly, claimed traders. Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad are major trading centres to get supplies of Rakhi, said traders but this season advance contracts could not be booked due to pandemic. Limited and high cost of imports of decorative items from China has also impacted the manufacturing of Rakhis this season, said traders. Though, traders expect some rebound in Rakhi business this year if the third wave did not strike by next week. Another seller Tulsiram Rakhyani said, “We expect the business to rebound this year and remain around 50 per cent higher than the previous year. Though there is a lot of uncertainty about the third wave of pandemic.” Ranipura market in Indore is a hub for wholesalers and semi wholesalers of Rakhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/covid-restrictions-limited-imports-of-decorative-items-hit-rakhi-biz/articleshow/85221957.cms||---

While CN Theertha scored 235, her son BR Hemanth got 562. They are from Lakshmipura village, around 10 km from the taluk centre, and appeared for the exams together. Theertha enrolled as a private candidate and prepared for the exam with her son referring to his notes. Theertha had joined a private high school at Ballupet whereas her son Hemanth was studying at Sri Malleshwara (aided) high school at Valalahalli. This is the second consecutive year she decided to take up the exam. Theertha had discontinued her studies after class 8. Her husband Rajendra is a farmer and they have a 4-year-old daughter. Her father-in-law stays with them. “I have always been interested in studies, but the poor economic condition of our family stopped me from pursuing it further. But this time, my husband, father-in-law and villagers — all supported me when they got to know I am appearing for SSLC exams this time,” Theertha said. “My son was taught all subjects in school and he used to teach me the same at home. I referred to his school materials and notes. My son supported me a lot,” she said. “The thought of taking up SSLC exams came when I decided to become an ASHA worker. Earlier, those who had completed higher primary education were eligible for the post, but when SSLC was made mandatory, I decided to clear the exams. Even though I tried to clear them last year, I failed. But this time I succeeded,” said Theertha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mother-son-duo-aces-sslc-examination-together/articleshow/85234668.cms||Darshan B H

On Tuesday, after arts and science colleges closed online applications for admissions for the 2021-22 academic year, the number had come down by around 10% in most institutions. But, colleges expect an increase in the cut-off for courses including B Com. BSc (psychology), BSc (visual communication) and BCA are among the most preferred. Applications for science courses have been fewer this year. B Com admissions are based on scores in four subjects other than language and English. The merit list is based on the marks scored out of 400. “At DG Vaishnav College, the cut-off for OC category for BCom (aided) is expected to be around 395 marks (98.75%) from 392 last year. “For shift-2, the cut-off has increased by 5% for all categories from 340 last year to 363 this year,” said principal S Santhosh Baboo. At MCC, the cut-off for B Com was 97% last year. “It is 98% now,” said principal Paul Wilson. In the second shift, the cut-off for B Com (accounting and finance), the cut-off was 98%, 100% and 97% for the first three lists. The college received applications in a 1:10 ratio for political science, economics and English literature and fewer applications for science. “The reason partly could be the increase in interest in engineering courses and decline in the number of applications from outside Tamil Nadu.” At Guru Nanak college, the cut-off for BCom general was 91.5% last year. “We expect it to be around 96% marks this year,” said principal M G Raghunathan, adding that admission has not been given to those with less than 70%. At Ethiraj College for Women, the cut-off for BCom is not expected to come down in the second and third lists. “The competition will be tough,” said principal S Kothai. At Loyola College, the demand for BSc (visual communication) has also increased. “For 100 seats, we received 2,200 applications, about 22 applications per seat,” said Thomas Amirtham, principal. The demand for BSc (psychology) is high at Women’s Christian College.  “The number of applications increased by three times for psychology courses compared to last year. The cut-off marks is 393 out of 400 marks (98.25%),” said Lilian Jasper, principal. The cut-off for B Com for general cataegory students was 390 marks in the first list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cut-off-for-bcom-admissions-goes-up/articleshow/85221991.cms||A Ragu Raman

It is also available to other aggrieved parties, the high court has said. The observation was made by the high court by exercising its power as a constitutional court to interpret the law, while disposing of a petition filed by a woman. Justice HT Narendra Prasad noted a plain reading of section 16 of the Act provides right of appeal only to senior citizens or a parent against the order passed by the tribunal, but the same is a case of “ accidental omission and not of conscious exclusion”. The judge said if the combined reading of sections 15 and 16 is undertaken, nowhere is it mentioned under section 15 that appealing against the order of the tribunal is confined to a senior citizens.. “The right to file an appeal is not excluded specifically by the provisions of section 16(1) of the Act. Suppose if the right of appeal is confined only to senior citizens or parents, and both parties are aggrieved by an order passed by the tribunal, one would prefer an appeal and the other would take recourse to Article 227 of the Constitution (before HC),” the judge noted. The petitioner can file an appeal before the appellate authority under section 16 of the Act within four weeks. Property issueM Sunitha (Vidyasri) had challenged the March 2, 2020 order passed by the assistant commissioner of Hospet, pursuant to an application filed by M Shashikala Mugadura, her mother-in-law, seeking maintenance.

School education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi told reporters at Tiruchendur in the district on Tuesday that students are depressed without attending schools. “We want children to go to school physically, starting with classes 9 to 12 after elaborate discussions with health experts,” he said. Mahesh said that preliminary discussions on the standard operating procedure (SOP) were held in Chennai on Monday and will be finalised in a couple of days. Stating that SOP was prepared last year when there were discussions to reopen schools, he added they are being reviewed to check if any improvements need to be made. “It will be finalised in a day or two and will be informed through the chief education officers,” he said. He said that there were elaborate discussions on preparedness for the third wave. The draft document on reducing syllabus for this year is ready and will soon be signed and intimated, he added. The department is equipping government schools with adequate teachers and classrooms as there is a surge in students enrolling from private schools. “We had 2,04,379 students enrolling in more than 40,000 government schools till last week as people are economically impacted by the pandemic. Around 20 to 40 students enrolled in many schools, while in some schools which had a strength of 300 last year has more than doubled to 700,” he said. Admitting that very few government school students have access to smart phones and only around 60% students have network connectivity, he added that those in rural and tribal areas face network issues. He said that efforts were being made through the teachers to help them pursue learning and writing. Some teachers are going to a student’s place, gathering a handful of students from the locality and educating them. Those students with mobile phones are asked to share the assessment questions with others in their vicinity and get the answers written. “We are not 100% successful.

Those students with mobile phones are asked to share the assessment questions with others in their vicinity and get the answers written. “We are not 100% successful.

The post of GP president was reserved for a Scheduled Tribe (ST) woman, and Guttevva Duragamuragi (in pic) from the community was elected unanimously on Tuesday. Guttevva was elected from ward number 4 of Kaginele with a 52-vote margin in the GP elections held in March-end. Kaginele GP has only five families from Duragamurugi community, which has been living on the outskirts of the village for the past 25 years. With no permanent shelter, they stay in huts. Recently, the GP supplied them drinking water and power. Guttevva, being the GP chief, wants to provide houses, complete with basic amenities, to the underprivileged. She said: “Our elders had migrated from Vijayapura to Kaginele for begging. Though we don’t usually live at one place, the people of Kaginele were magnanimous and allowed us to stay on. The people of ward no. 4 e elected me, and I feel fortunate to have become the GP chief because of the reservation.” She also said that she will strive to take the facilitires extended by the GP to intended beneficiaries. “Taking other members and the PDO into confidence, I will ty and make Kaginele GP a model local body,” Guttevva added. PDO Vishwanath Kattegoudra said Guttevva, despite being an illiterate, has seen up close the plight of poor people, especially those who don’t have basic amenities. “She has discussed many ideas with me pertaining to the GP’s development.” The Duragamurugi community, one of the nomadic communities in North Karnataka, has been into begging for generations. They carry with them the idol of goddess Durgamma and play drums (or even beat themselves up with a hunter).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/woman-from-nomadic-group-is-gp-chief/articleshow/85222414.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

Plumes of smoke rose from pockets of fire in the forest in Tizi Ouzou region on Tuesday, while residents used tree branches and hurled water from plastic containers in an attempt to put out the flames however they could. Several houses were burnt and families were escaping to hotels, youth hostels and university residences, witnesses said, as the dense smoke hampered the visibility of fire crews. "We had a horror night. My house is completely burnt," said Mohamed Kaci, who had fled from Azazga village to a hotel with his family. Interior minister Kamel Beldjoud said an investigation would be launched to identify those behind the blazes as he put the death toll at six. The defense ministry later said in a statement 18 military men died and seven had been injured as they tried to extinguish fires. "Only criminal hands can be behind the simultaneous outbreak of about 50 fires across several localities of the province," the minister said on state television. Firefighters and the army were still trying to contain the blazes, and Beldjoud said the priority was to avoid more victims. He vowed to compensate those affected. Smaller fires were also ravaging forests in at least 13 provinces since Monday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/algeria-blames-forest-fires-on-arson-death-toll-rises-to-24/articleshow/85222118.cms||---

Three suspects – Asgar and Nasir Sharif, both residents of Vivekanagar and Santosh of Koramangala – have been arrested. Two more are at large. Asgar and Santosh are cab drivers and Sharif was involved in a house burglary case earlier. According to police, Diwakar Reddy and Aravind Kumar Mehta were in a hotel on MG Road around 10pm on August 6, when a gang of five approached them. They introduced themselves as policemen, saying they wanted information about their bullion business. Claiming that they are in possession of documents related to business, they picked up the duo for questioning in connection with an alleged fraud committed by them. They roamed around for more than four hours before detaining them in a hotel room in Koramangala. Meanwhile, Sandeep Parameswaran, a close friend of Reddy, approached Ulsoor police and filed a complaint against the gang on August 7. Cops swung into action and traced the duo to the hotel room in Koramangala. The abductors had downloaded news articles related to Mehta’s arrest in Delhi a few years ago in a criminal case. Based on that, they wanted to extort money, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/5-posing-as-cops-kidnap-2-bullion-traders-3-arrested/articleshow/85222100.cms||---
---||World||Nearly 900 buildings destroyed by massive California fire||GREENVILLE: California's largest single wildfire in recorded history kept pushing through forestlands on Tuesday as fire crews tried to protect rural communities from flames that have destroyed hundreds of homes.  Clear skies over parts of the month-old Dixie Fire have allowed aircraft to rejoin nearly 6,000 firefighters in the attack this week.  "Whether or not we can fly depends very much on where the smoke is. There's still some areas where it's just too smoky," said fire spokesman Edwin Zuniga.  Burning through bone-dry trees, brush and grass, the fire by Tuesday had destroyed nearly 900 homes and other buildings. Much of the small community of Greenville was incinerated during an explosive run of flames last week.  But the reports are "definitely subject to change" because assessment teams still can't get into many areas to count what burned, Zuniga said.  The Dixie Fire, named for the road where it started, also threatened 14,000 buildings in more than a dozen small mountain and rural communities in the northern Sierra Nevada.  Crews have cut thousands of acres of new fire lines aimed at preventing the fire from spreading and officials believe the fire lines created on the blaze's southern side will hold the fire at bay there, but the fire's future is unknown, authorities said.  "We don't know where this fire is going to end and where it's going to land. It continues to challenge us," said Chris Carlton, supervisor for Plumas National Forest.  Temperatures are expected to rise and the humidity is expected to fall over the next few days, with triple-digit high temperatures possible later in the week along with a return of strong afternoon winds, fire meteorologist Rich Thompson warned Monday evening.  The fire that broke out July 14 had grown to an area of 762 square miles (1,973 square kilometers) and was just 25% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.  The Dixie Fire is about half the size of the August Complex, a series of lightning-caused 2020 fires across seven counties that were fought together and that state officials consider California's largest wildfire overall.  Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday declared a state of emergency for northern Shasta, Trinity and Tehama counties. The declaration frees up state resources to help fight fires in those counties and give assistance to residents impacted by the blazes.  California's raging wildfires are among some 100 large blazes burning across 15 states, mostly in the West, where historic drought conditions have left lands parched and ripe for ignition.  The Dixie Fire is the largest single fire in California history and the largest currently burning in the U.S. Nearly a quarter of all firefighters assigned to Western fires are fighting California blazes, said Rocky Oplinger, an incident commander.  Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists have said climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. The fires across the West come as parts of Europe are also fighting large blazes spurred by tinder-dry conditions. Northwest of the Dixie Fire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, hundreds of homes remained threatened by two fires that continued to grow. About a third of the McFarland Fire was contained. New evacuation orders were issued Monday for residents near the Monument Fire, which was only about 3% contained.  South of the Dixie Fire, firefighters prevented further growth of the River Fire, which broke out last Wednesday near the community of Colfax and destroyed 68 homes. It was nearly 80% contained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nearly-900-buildings-destroyed-by-massive-california-fire/articleshow/85222847.cms||---

A letter to this effect was issued on July 28 by R P Joshi, joint director of vigilance in the Railway Board. Another case related to procurement of mechanical items for Train-18 on a single tender basis was also closed in January, documents available with TOI show. “No procedural violations were found on part of any officers,” the document stated. The cases were initiated around two years ago and had brought the Train-18 project to a grinding halt. The charges against ICF officials was of favouring a Hyderabad-based company which was supplying the propulsion system in the first two train-sets. Later two tenders were cancelled. Eventually, now the same company has won the contract for upcoming train-sets. The officials who have been exonerated include Shubhranshu, then principal chief mechanical engineer of ICF and current chief administrative officer (CAO) in Rail Wheel Plant, Bela, DP Dash and SP Vavre, former chief design engineers (electrical) at ICF, KS Asla and Usha Venugopalan, ICF’s current and former finance heads, Amitabh Singhal, former deputy chief electrical engineer at ICF, NK Gupta former chief electrical engineer at ICF and V Vishwanath Reddy, OP Khare and K Venugopal Rao, former and current chief materials managers at ICF. Sudhanshu Mani, who retired in 2019 told TOI that he is relieved, but wasn’t surprised, as he knew there was no wrongdoing. “But I have suffered while the vigilance process was on,” he said. However, the Indian Railways should try to reverse the losses suffered by some of the officials who are still in service. “They should be compensated in some way,” Mani said. Another serving railway official, who lost out on several important positions in Railway Board due to these vigilance cases said around three years of his life had been damaged due to this. As far as the Train-18 project is concerned, three years had been lost in the pathbreaking project, both officials said. “It is similar to the Nambi Narayanan case, where India’s space program was set back by a few years due to false allegations,” the official who did not want to be identified, said. Mani said the new minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had given clear directives to bring the project back on track.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/11-icf-officials-exonerated-in-train-18-case-after-2-yrs/articleshow/85223014.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

---||World||Greeks battle to protect town from ferocious blaze||AVGARIA: Volunteers and firefighters were working relentlessly on Tuesday, often without masks or helmets, in a desperate bid to stop a violent blaze from reaching a key town on Greece's Evia island, one of hundreds of fires that have raged through the country. Nearly 900 firefighters, reinforced with fresh arrivals from abroad, were deployed on the country's second largest island as major towns and resorts remained under threat on from a blaze burning for eight days. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a package of 500 million euros ($586 million) in emergency help to those affected by what he has dubbed a "natural fury without precedent", as well as for reconstruction of devastated areas. Weather disasters bulked up by climate change have swept the globe this summer, with a landmark UN assessment published Monday warning the world is warming even faster than forecast. Hundreds of homes have been lost in Evia, greater Athens, the Peloponnese and other parts of Greece to wildfires since late July, as the region suffers through an intense heatwave. Underscoring the violent swings of fortune tormenting Greece, fires in the Peloponnese flared anew just an hour after officials said the situation was stabilising. Residents in 20 small villages in the region of Gortynia were warned to evacuate on Tuesday, with the mayor saying conditions seemed out of control again. "In the blink of an eye, all control was lost," mayor Efstathios Soulis told state TV ERT, adding that dozens of villages, agricultural units and businesses were at risk. The flames have claimed three lives in Greece, while in neighbouring Turkey eight have been killed eight. Several people have been injured, some critically. Sixteen people have been arrested on suspicion of arson or negligent arson, the police said. Much of the attention was focused on Tuesday towards keeping the fire out of Evia's northern hub of Istiaia, which has 7,000 residents who had yet to evacuate. Firefighters and volunteers had been engaged overnight in "hand-to-hand combat, fighting heart and soul" to erect fire breaks outside villages neighbouring Istiaia, mayor Yiannis Kontzias said. Locals, often in just t-shirts, battled the flames on several fronts, one of which raged out of control. The Evia force includes hundreds of firefighters from Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. They were reinforced on Tuesday with units from Cyprus, Slovakia and Poland, the civil protection authority said. The rugged island is popular with holidaymakers and many Greeks have summer homes on Evia. Some 3,000 people were evacuated by sea this past week as the flames neared. Authorities ordered the evacuation of Asiminio, a coastal village near Istiaia also threatened by flames, on Tuesday. "Where do you want us to go?," a woman in her sixties shouted, refusing to leave as helicopters flew ahead. On the streets, dozens of residents pointed angrily at a Slovakian firefighting truck. "Look, they're doing all the work. Where are ours? We beg them to come and no one comes," said Dimitri. In Avgaria village, many people turned out to help the professionals. "If we don't come, who will?" asked Yiannis, a burly man in his 20s. "My aunt's house burnt down, that of my grandfather almost did too." The fire has also wrought havoc on the island's agricultural economy that included olives, figs and honey, leaving many producers despondent. Istiaia Mayor Kontzias said "mistakes were made and we need to draw lessons from this". "The Greek state must never forget what happened in northern Evia," he added. "Helicopters helped a lot and if we had done that since the beginning, we would have avoided all this destruction." He was echoing a complaint widely heard about the lack of air support not just on Evia but throughout Greece. Many mayors around the country have complained of a serious lack of aerial support in fighting the fires, despite government assurances of having set aside ample resources. "Every lost home is a tragedy, a dagger to the heart," deputy civil protection minister Nikos Hardalias said Tuesday, his voice breaking. In a televised address on Monday, Mitsotakis apologised "for any shortcomings" in the state response. "We may have done what was humanly possible, but in many cases it was not enough." EU states and other countries have so far contributed 21 aircraft, 250 vehicles and more than 1,200 firefighters, some of whom were due to arrive by Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/greeks-battle-to-protect-town-from-ferocious-blaze/articleshow/85222189.cms||---

Though business is slowly picking up for salons now, there is a decided shift in customers’ preferences. Physical contactless services are now in demand, as many now want to be pampered from afar. So, pedicures and foot spas are becoming popular, as opposed to massages. Here’s a look at what beauty services people are most inclined or disinclined towards post the pandemic. Salon owners say that people now prefer getting low-contact treatments and services‘Clients visit salons for services they can’t do themselves at home’Aashmeen Munjal from Star Salons & Academy says, “In the lockdown, many of my clients learnt how to get rid of body hair themselves, so they now visit the salon for services that they can’t do at home, like hair colour or hair treatments. They don’t even enquire about services like body spa anymore.” Moreover, she adds that their customers only want one person to do all the services now. “Earlier, they were comfortable with four girls doing their different services,” shares Aashmeen. We are following all precautions: SalonsPooja Kumar, owner of Fusion Beauty Parlour, shares, “There are people who are concerned and would want us to take all precautions, which we anyway follow. But some people choose to not wear a mask once they enter the salon. Though we can’t force anyone, we always tell clients to wear a mask unless they are getting a treatment done which requires them to remove it.” Seema Nanda, founder of the Nomadic Spalon and Estetico The Facial Bar, says that the staff at her parlours is vaccinated. “They have got their first doses and we have told them that they should not come to work if they feel unwell. All our girls wear double masks while doing services, but people prefer that we offer them services at home rather than the parlour. We are taking such bookings only from our regular clients,” she adds. Clients who earlier came in for a head massage, facial, body wax, pedicure and threading, now come mostly for threading and pedicuresClients choose safety over beauty services Sangeeta Dhawan Puri, a resident of Pitampura, shares, “I have not visited a parlour since the pandemic hit us. I prefer to call someone home for services because I am concerned for my safety. I get all the equipment sanitised, and since I am home for these services, I am not worried about the exposure.” Gunjan Bajaj, a resident of Janakpuri, adds, “I’ve been taking my own towels when I go for a head massage or haircut at salons now. I have seen that people don’t wear masks sometimes when they are getting their services. I keep my distance from them. You can’t force people to wear mask, but you can maintain your distance.” ‘My clients mostly come for threading and pedicure now’Jyoti Sahni, who has been in the business for almost 15 years, says, “As soon as we resumed our services, most of my customers came back. But the major difference now is that the visits are less frequent and only for basic needs. Earlier, if someone would come after a month, they would get a head massage, facial, body wax, manicure, pedicure and threading, but now they come mostly for threading and pedicures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/touchmenot-hands-off-beauty-services-in-demand-at-ncr-salons/articleshow/85208171.cms||Riya Sharma

We are following all precautions: SalonsPooja Kumar, owner of Fusion Beauty Parlour, shares, “There are people who are concerned and would want us to take all precautions, which we anyway follow. But some people choose to not wear a mask once they enter the salon. Though we can’t force anyone, we always tell clients to wear a mask unless they are getting a treatment done which requires them to remove it.” Seema Nanda, founder of the Nomadic Spalon and Estetico The Facial Bar, says that the staff at her parlours is vaccinated. “They have got their first doses and we have told them that they should not come to work if they feel unwell. All our girls wear double masks while doing services, but people prefer that we offer them services at home rather than the parlour. We are taking such bookings only from our regular clients,” she adds. Clients who earlier came in for a head massage, facial, body wax, pedicure and threading, now come mostly for threading and pedicuresClients choose safety over beauty services Sangeeta Dhawan Puri, a resident of Pitampura, shares, “I have not visited a parlour since the pandemic hit us. I prefer to call someone home for services because I am concerned for my safety. I get all the equipment sanitised, and since I am home for these services, I am not worried about the exposure.” Gunjan Bajaj, a resident of Janakpuri, adds, “I’ve been taking my own towels when I go for a head massage or haircut at salons now. I have seen that people don’t wear masks sometimes when they are getting their services. I keep my distance from them. You can’t force people to wear mask, but you can maintain your distance.” ‘My clients mostly come for threading and pedicure now’Jyoti Sahni, who has been in the business for almost 15 years, says, “As soon as we resumed our services, most of my customers came back. But the major difference now is that the visits are less frequent and only for basic needs. Earlier, if someone would come after a month, they would get a head massage, facial, body wax, manicure, pedicure and threading, but now they come mostly for threading and pedicures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/touchmenot-hands-off-beauty-services-in-demand-at-ncr-salons/articleshow/85207630.cms||Riya Sharma
---||Kolkata||City goes al fresco for dining, partying and meetups||From Chowringhee in central Kolkata to the sprawling terraces of south to the high terraces in Rajarhat – open- air dining spaces are capturing the imagination of Kolkata revellers like never before. Last year, when restaurants were allowed to operate after the first lockdown, many places tasted success with their al fresco dining options. To keep up with the growing demand and cash in on the trend, they are now expanding their open-area options and new places are being constantly added to the list. While safety remains the biggest reason for choosing open-air over air-conditioned venues, customers also prefer the outdoors for the natural breeze, better ambience and scenic beauty. Safe and scenic“After being cooped up at home for months, I have finally started catching up with my friends at public places. But we are still cautious about the virus, hence we prefer to meet at restaurants with rooftops or gardens. After the pandemic induced break, we’ve now resumed our kitty parties for which we only book open-air places, said Paromita Guha, a homemaker, adding, “Being outdoors feels safer and I also get to enjoy beautiful sunsets with my friends.” Nobody cares for ACWith the second wave subsiding, Tuhina Das has started stepping out to socialise as well as for work meetings. But the actress is not comfortable going to air-conditioned venues anymore. “Be it a casual outing or a professional meeting, it has to be at an open-air place for me. Despite the vaccines and all other precautions, the virus threat is still looming. But life can’t stop. So, all my friends prefer meeting at open-air places. In fact, now that work is also picking up pace, I’m keeping all my meetings in outdoor venues instead of someone’s office or home,” she said. Party safeEven party hoppers are choosing open spaces for the sake of safety. “Besides the safety angle, what makes open-air seating more attractive is that we can have some fresh air under the open sky after being confined to our homes for so many months,” said Purbani Bose, a school teacher. Tanay Agarwal of La Artisan Bistro in Rajarhat has managed to keep his guests happy by providing them the option to choose between AC and non-AC seating areas. “In COVID, most of our guests are opting for the outdoor area. Open-air spaces are clearly a big hit, thanks to the pandemic,” he said. Food, not ambience, in focusWhile the menu at most of these open-air restaurants is simple – featuring finger foods, kebabs, pizzas and colourful mocktails and cocktails – the focus is on the ambience. Akchata Tamang of Park Street’s Trapeze said, “One can see the skyline from our place and that’s our biggest USP. There has been a surge in footfall in recent weeks because of our open-air space.” For actress-turned-politician Saayoni Ghosh, access to fresh air is a prerequisite while going out these days. “Anything that breaks the confinement of the lockdown experience seems welcoming right now. I’d ideally love to go on a vacation, but even that will need a lot of effort like getting an RT PCR test done. Hence, hanging out amid fresh air seems like the next best option. We are not looking for a lavish dining experience at these places. Some finger food, something to drink, a bit of open sky and a bunch of dear friends are just enough to feel rejuvenated,” the actress said. Many are making a beeline for places that offer a skyline view of the city. Priti Modi of Unplugged Courtyard said, “A lot of people now prefer sitting in our outdoor section, enjoying the spectacular view of Victoria Memorial from there. This comes as a breath of fresh air for people who have been bored to death in the lockdown.” 'Approx 10 places added to city’s al fresco dining options this year'“There are almost 50-60 al fresco eateries in Kolkata, taking into account the star hotels too. This year almost seven to 10 al fresco dining areas have been introduced and it is doing good business, keeping the current pandemic situation in mind where people prefer to sit in open areas. Added to that the youngsters prefer to go to such places to chill out as they get a good ambiance and décor to click pictures for their social media handles.” – Sudesh Poddar, president of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern IndiaOpen-air sundowners take city by stormSundowner parties in open spaces have become a rage in recent times. With the 8 pm deadline, a lot of dinner plans are now shifting to afternoon high teas and eateries are leaving no stone unturned to make those occasions a hit. Director Satrajit Sen, who prefers hosting and attending parties at open-air venues, said, “We are trying to have these get-togethers on a terrace or open air venues so that people feel safer. Closed spaces are a bit intimidating in the current situation. We try to limit the number of people to a maximum of 10. By now there are several outdoor venues in the city, so finding the right place is not difficult,” he told us. Rahul Jaiswal of Sector V’s Club Fenicia, which is popular for its open-air section, has taken notice of this sentiment. “Sundowners in the open has been a hit concept in the pandemic era. We have seen a rising demand for such gatherings, especially in the monsoon,” he said. Seeing the popularity, many places have now started offering private party areas on the terraces and other available open spaces. “After the success of our courtyard, we decided to provide our patrons an open-air space for private parties. That is how The Terrasse came into being, said Rakesh Ranjan of Raajkutir – Boutique Hotel, which is located near the Phoolbagan area.

---||India||Rajouri encounter: Slain terrorist had visited Pakistan on valid papers||JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Substantiating apprehensions of security agencies that many Kashmiri youths visiting Pakistan on valid papers are infiltrating back as terrorists, a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist killed in an encounter in Rajouri’s Thanamandi on August 6 has been identified as a youth from Shopian who had travelled to Pakistan on a valid Indian passport in February 2018. As many as 57 youths from J&K who went to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 2017-18 on valid visas and documents as tourists or students, picked up arms there, J&K DGP Dilbag Singh said at a press conference in Rajouri later in the day. Among those who infiltrated back into India as terrorists, 17 have been killed in encounters while about 13 are still active across the Union Territory. Seventeen are still living in PoK and are under the constant watch of J&K Police, the DGP added. “One of the terrorists (killed in the August 6 encounter in Rajouri) has been identified as Ramees Ahmad Tantray from Shopian’s Ramnagri. He had travelled to Pakistan on a valid Indian passport in February 2018 and was not known to have returned thereafter,” said a police spokesperson. The second slain terrorist is yet to be identified while a search is still on to trace another terrorist who is believed to have escaped the cordon. Security agencies have made a quick estimate of passports issued between 2015-2019 and found that out of the 40 youths who had gone to Bangladesh or Pakistan for studies, 28 had infiltrated back into the country as trained terrorists. This is in addition to over 100 Kashmiri youths who travelled to Pakistan on valid visas for short durations and have either not come back or disappeared after their return in the last three years. Security agencies fear that they could be possible sleeper cells of terror groups operating from across the border. To prevent youths from visiting PoK on the pretext of education and joining militancy, J&K’s visa procedure and security clearance norms have been tightened, DGP Singh said. This year, about three to four terrorist groups — including one in Bandipora and around three in Rajouri-Poonch sector — have infiltrated into this side so far. “Four terrorists who had crossed over to this side through Machil and Gurez sectors were slain in Bandipora. In Rajouri, two ultras were killed on August 6,” the DGP said. Pakistan’s launch pads are full and security forces have strengthened the anti-infiltration grid both at the LoC and hinterland to foil possible infiltration bids, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajouri-encounter-slain-terrorist-had-visited-pakistan-on-valid-papers/articleshow/85223324.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Hours later, police arrested a 26-year-old journalist of a local news agency from Srinagar’s Lal Chowk — just 2km away from the spot of the blast — with two grenades. The arrested journalist was identified as Adil Farooq Bhat from Khrew in Pampore, a “sub-editor at a self-proclaimed news agency called CNS”, IGP (Kashmir Zone) Vijay Kumar said. “Soon after the attack at Hari Singh Street in Amira Kadal, all entry/exit points in and around Lal Chowk area were sealed and all checkpoints across Srinagar activated. During an intensive checking, a joint naka party near Makkah Market apprehended a suspicious person and recovered two live grenades from his bag,” he added. Adil had earlier been arrested in February 2019 — when he was studying journalism at Islamic University of Science & Technology, Awantipora — and detained under the Public Safety Act for his alleged involvement in providing logistic support and other help to active terrorists operating in Khrew area, the IGP said. Top cleric and separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq had then condemned Adil’s arrest, alleging that police were “ruining” his career. Adil has been booked under relevant sections of the law, IGP Kumar said, adding: “We are interrogating him. More arrests are expected.” Eyewitnesses said the attack took place near a Hanuman temple on Hari Singh Street. The injured pedestrians were rushed to SMHS hospital for treatment, said a police officer. Such an attack in Amira Kadal was reported after many years. Security forces have been asked to stay on high alert in view of the upcoming Independence Day, said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/10-civilians-injured-in-srinagar-grenade-attack-local-journo-arrested-with-2-grenades/articleshow/85223493.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||World||Afghans flee horrors as Taliban sweep through the north||KABUL: Thousands of Afghans are fleeing Taliban-captured cities in the north, some telling of brutal treatment by the insurgents: bodies left in the streets, girls being kidnapped to become Taliban brides, and young men press-ganged into fighting. Many have arrived in Kabul just this week, following a five-day Taliban blitz that has seen them seize eight provincial capitals - some with barely a fight. But where there has been resistance, those who fled described harrowing scenes. "We saw bodies lying near the prison... there were dogs next to them," said Friba, 36, a widow who fled Kunduz Sunday with her six children as the Taliban took the city. Like many who spoke to AFP, she asked not to be fully identified for fear of reprisal. The war has gathered pace since early May, when foreign forces began the final stage of a troop withdrawal due to be complete at the end of the month. During their first stint in power - from 1996 until the September 11, 2001 attacks that prompted the US-led invasion - the Taliban earned notoriety for a strict interpretation of Islamic law that punished even petty crime with public floggings and executions. But they have also been accused of war crimes on this campaign, targeting government officials and security personnel - particularly in areas where they have met resistance. "Three days ago the Taliban killed a barber because they thought he was working for the government. But he was just a barber," said Mirwais Khan Amiri, 22, whose car was struck by bullets as he fled Kunduz three days ago. "They killed people who worked in government even if they had quit four to five years ago." Another evacuee from Kunduz, Abdulmanan, told AFP the Taliban beheaded his son. "They took him... as if he was a sheep and cut off his head with a knife and threw it away," he said. AFP had no way of independently verifying these reports. The Taliban routinely deny committing atrocities and last week announced they had set up a WhatsApp hotline to deal with complaints. But several humanitarian organisations, including the UN, say possible war crimes have been carried out that need to be investigated. The UN's International Organization for Migration said Tuesday that more than 359,000 people have been displaced by fighting this year alone. In a public park in central Kabul Tuesday, hundreds of the latest arrivals were camping in the open - sheltering from the sun in the shade of trees, or under sheets stretched between them. Occasionally a volunteer would offer food or snacks, causing chaotic scenes as the evacuees clamoured for handouts. One newcomer, 25-year-old widow Marwa, fled Taloqan on Saturday as fighting raged for the city - terrified she would be ordered to marry a Taliban fighter. "I heard my 16-year-old cousin has been forcibly taken by the Taliban for marriage with one of them," she said. "She was engaged, and her fiance is in France," she added, bursting into tears. "When there are two girls in a family they take one to marry her to a fighter; when there are two boys they take one to make him fight." Widow Bibi Ma told AFP how she found her only son Azizullah, 20, dead on her doorstep - hit by shrapnel from a Taliban rocket. "After my husband died, my son was everything to me ... our guardian, and source of joy," she said. "My heart died that moment, it was horrible to see him dead." Another Azizullah, who worked in the justice department in Kunduz, could find no comfort even in the relative safety of the capital. "The way they are fighting, without care for others, they will be coming to Kabul soon," he said. "Where will we have to run to then?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghans-flee-horrors-as-taliban-sweep-through-the-north/articleshow/85222988.cms||---
---||India||Only 2 J&K properties acquired by 'outsiders' in 2 years since new rules kicked in||NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: Only two people from outside Jammu & Kashmir have purchased a property each there in the two years since the nullification of Article 370 that took away the erstwhile state's special status, the Union home ministry informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. Minister of state for home Nityanand Rai, who made the statement in reply to a question from Lok Sabha MPs, said no instance of legitimate buyers facing any impediment in buying properties in the Union territory had been reported so far. While no details were provided about the location of the properties or the "outsiders" who had acquired them under the new rules applicable to J&K, sources in Srinagar said both were in Jammu division. One of the names doing the rounds apparently runs a company with interests in real estate and liquor. Sources said several four and five-star hotels in J&K Bank's list of loan defaulters could now be potentially auctioned off to outsiders as commercial properties under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act of 2002. Prior to the nullification of Article 370, outsiders weren't allowed to buy land in J&K. The protection clauses were so strict that even women from Kashmir who married outsiders would lose their right to property in their native land. The laws have subsequently been revised, allowing outsiders to purchase non-agricultural land in the UT. But according to a J&K government spokesperson, caveats on transfer of agricultural land would save 90% of them from being sold to outsiders. Agricultural land may be sold to only domiciles, defined as ones who have been residents of J&K for a minimum of 15 years, have studied for a period of seven years and appeared in Class 10 or 12 exams from registered educational institutes, or are children of central government and PSU employee who have served there for a period of 10 years. Not only can women who marry outside J&K now retain their domicile status and rights to property, even their spouses are entitled to claim domicile certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/only-2-jk-properties-acquired-by-outsiders-in-2-years-since-new-rules-kicked-in/articleshow/85223657.cms||Bharti Jain

Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said a search operation was continuing unabated despite bad weather. “Military authorities are leaving no stone unturned to locate the two pilots — Lt-Colonel Abheet Singh Batth and Captain Jayant Joshi. The expanse of the dam is 25km long, 8km wide and more than 500ft deep. Experts and equipment from the Army, Navy, IAF, NDRF, SDRF, NGOs, state police, dam authority and private firms from all over the country have been put into action. Experts and specialised equipment and divers are being continuously flown in and international assistance is also being sought,” Lt Col Anand said. According to information, a special contingent of Navy, comprising two officers, four junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and 24 other ranks, one contingent of Army’s Special Forces divers comprising two officers, one JCO and 24 other ranks, are carrying out the operation. “A small area of 60m by 60m has been localised and special sonar equipment flown in from Kochi is being employed to enable the search operations to enter their final phase,” the officer added. He explained that the deep underwater operation is especially challenging due to near-zero visibility below 50 meters owing to the colloidal nature of water in the rainy season, which adversely impacts the accuracy of sonars and other sensors. Specialised machines, including multi-beam sonars, side scanners, remotely operated vehicles and underwater manipulators, have been flown in from Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi to find the pilots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-chopper-crash-foreign-help-being-sought-to-trace-missing-pilots/articleshow/85223833.cms||---

The "Punjab Independence Referendum", which is illegal in India, has been delayed to October 31, the "Punjab Referendum Commission", a body appointed by the US-based Khalistan separatist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ is banned in India), said at a briefing live-streamed on YouTube and Facebook. It blamed the pandemic for the delays. The "Punjab Referendum Commission" consists of "non-aligned direct democracy experts" who are to organise and hold a referendum on whether Punjab should be independent. The so-called referendum will start in London on October 31 and then take place in other countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, and the region of Punjab, the commission stated. It is not clear how voting will be conducted. "We are a non-aligned group of direct democracy experts who believe the right to self-determination is important for the peaceful resolution of conflict. Our role is to help the SFJ conduct a referendum that is as consistent with international norms as possible," said commission chair M Dane Waters, based at the University of Southern California. "Although a non-governmental and non-binding referendum, the result will be used as the basis for the Sikh community to request an official binding vote from the United Nations on establishing the Indian governed region of Punjab as an independent homeland for the indigenous people of whom Sikhs are the single largest group," the commission said. The date October 31 had been chosen as it marks the day the anti-Sikh riots started in 1984, the commission alleged. Commission member Matt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University in Britain, said the UK was an appropriate place to start the voting as the UK "is somewhat responsible for the situation in India". He claimed the commission were "neutral observers" and did not take any position on whether Punjab should have independence. \||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/punjab-referendum-2020-in-uk-delayed-to-oct-31-organisers-say/articleshow/85223905.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||India||Have a tinge of Kashmiriyat in me: Rahul on first visit to J&K in 2 years||SRINAGAR: Almost two years after being forced to turn back from Srinagar airport amid an unprecedented lockdown in J&K, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday used his first visit to the Union Territory since the nullification of Article 370 to invoke his "Kashmiriyat" and make a strong pitch for restoration of statehood and democracy. Rahul, who arrived here on Monday evening, said J&K was facing "a direct assault from New Delhi", unlike Tamil Nadu, Bengal and other states where the Centre was allegedly settling scores indirectly. "If you show your hatred for the people of Kashmir, nothing can be achieved," the former Congress president said at the J&K Congress headquarters. "Today, my family lives in Delhi. Before that, they were living in Allahabad, and (even) before that, they were living in Kashmir. So I have inherited a tinge of Kashmiriyat that still lies inside of me." Rahul said his fight was primarily against PM Narendra Modi's "policy of dividing India" and would continue on that path till he won. On Congress veteran and ex-CM Ghulam Nabi Azad’s suggestion to press for a bill in Parliament to restore J&K's statehood, Rahul said, "I am not allowed to speak in Parliament. I can’t speak about Rafale, unemployment or corruption. They (BJP) have attacked the judiciary, the Lok Sabha...even the media stands muzzled. Journalists can’t write what they want to." Rahul claimed that when there was a Congress government in J&K, welfare schemes like the Udaan skill development programme were launched and panchayat polls were held. "We brought experts to Kashmir University and sent Kashmiri youth to other states of India. But they (BJP) attacked this process, too." Rahul paid obeisance at the Mata Kheer Bhawani temple in the Tulmulla area of central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district earlier in the day along with a few other Congress functionaries, including Azad. One of his first scheduled engagements during the two-day visit was the wedding of PCC chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir's son. Lt governor Manoj Sinha and Srinagar MP Farooq Abdullah were at the reception around the same time, sources said. Rahul said he would return to J&K soon and pack in a visit to Jammu and Ladakh. The Wayanad MP's previous visit, albeit an aborted one, was as part of an opposition delegation that landed at Srinagar airport on August 24, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-a-tinge-of-kashmiriyat-in-me-rahul-on-first-visit-to-jk-in-2-years/articleshow/85224261.cms||M Saleem Pandit

At a news conference Tuesday at the Manassas Mosque, Imam Abolfazl Nahidian said the custom-made tiles were shipped in June from the Iranian city of Qom, to be used in construction of a new mosque a few miles away. He said the tiles were a gift and he paid no money for them, but a Customs and Border Protection officer at the airport blocked the mosque from claiming the tiles, citing the sanctions. Nahidian said he has received other tile shipments throughout the years without incident, including one shipment that arrived eight months ago. A letter from Customs and Border Protection informed the mosque that the tile must be shipped back to Iran or destroyed. Destroying the tiles, which are adorned with Quranic verses, would be especially disturbing, Nahidian said. "Destroying the tiles is the same as destroying verses of the Quran, or the whole Quran itself,'' he said. Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that whatever one's views are of the Iranian sanctions, it makes no sense to enforce the rules on a benign piece of religious art. "They are not weapons of mass destruction,'' Awad said. "We believe the government should have common sense.'' A spokesperson for customs and border protection confirmed that the tiles were placed on hold June 21 and that on June 30, the treasury department's office of foreign asset control determined that, under the sanctions imposed on Iran, the tiles could not be imported. The spokesperson said no final determination has been made on the tiles' disposition. The treasury department did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Speakers at Tuesday's news conference suggested that anti-Islam sentiment may be responsible for the confiscation. "If this were a statue of the Virgin Mary, would we be here discussing this?'' asked Rafi Uddin Ahmed, president of the Muslim Association of Virginia. Nahidian has led the mosque for nearly three decades, and has occasionally drawn scrutiny from critics who say he is anti-Israel and was a supporter of the ayatollahs in the Iranian Revolution. He has blamed the September 11 attack on Israel; in 1979, he and others chained themselves to the railings of the Statue of Liberty after climbing to the top and unfurling banners criticizing the shah of Iran, who was overthrown. Nahidian said his history is irrelevant to whether the tiles should be imported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/sanctions-on-iran-block-mosque-from-claiming-religious-tiles/articleshow/85224223.cms||---
---||World||Dry California tourist town to guests: 'Please conserve'||MENDOCINO: Tourists flock by the thousands to the coastal town of Mendocino for its Victorian homes and cliff trails, but visitors this summer are also finding public portable toilets and signs on picket fences pleading: "Severe Drought. Please conserve water." Hotels have closed their lobby bathrooms and residents have stopped watering their gardens in the foggy outpost about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of San Francisco after two years of little rain sapped many of the wells Mendocino depends on for potable water.  Mendocino's water woes were compounded in recent weeks when the city of Fort Bragg a few miles to the north - its main backup water supplier - informed officials that it, too, had a significant drop in its drinking water reserves after the Noyo River recorded its lowest flows in decades.  "This is a real emergency," said Ryan Rhoades, superintendent of the Mendocino City Community Services District, which helps manage the water in the town's aquifer.  Eric Hillesland and his wife normally wouldn't need to buy water until late July or August to supply the Alegria Inn, their 10-room oceanfront bed and breakfast.  But the property's well started pumping little water early in the year, and by February they were ordering 3,500 gallons (13,250 liters) a week.  Then the couple stopped watering the gardens and switched from glass to paper plates to serve welcome cookies. They plan to start using microfiber bed linens, which take less water to wash.  "We're also asking our guests to be cognizant of the severity of our water shortage and to not take the extensive showers they might be used to at home," Hillesland said.  Mendocino relies on groundwater accessed through a network of about 400 privately owned wells, many of them dug by hand when the former mill town was established in the 1850s.  Residents and business owners keep their water in storage tanks, including some perched atop historic redwood water towers.  The town has about 1,000 residents, but its economy depends on about 2,000 people who visit each day during the height of the tourist season, from May to October, Rhoades said.  Businesses have traditionally had to haul in water in the fall. But after a second dry winter, many have had to order more, much earlier than before.  Because of the pandemic and stay-at-home orders, there were few visitors last year when town residents began noticing their wells were producing less. Now the weekend getaway destination for people in the Sacramento and San Francisco Bay areas is teeming with guests.  That has forced residents and business owners to find drinking water sources that are farther away, which has doubled the price of water. Some restaurants are cutting back their operating hours to reduce costs.  In February, Hillesland was paying USD300 for a 3,500-gallon (13,250-liter) delivery. Now it costs USD600.  If it gets worse and they have to start closing rooms, "then we are in a situation like at the beginning of the pandemic - no income but still plenty of mortgage and insurance," he said.  Many longer-term solutions are being considered, including bringing water by barge, plane and train and adding community storage tanks that can hold up to 500,000 gallons (1.9 million liters), asking the U.S. National Guard or the Army Corps of Engineers to set up a mobile desalination treatment unit, and even capturing fog.  But all of them are expensive, and the town would need the support of the state and federal governments, Rhoades said.  A company that developed new technology to capture moisture in fog proposed setting up a testing site in Mendocino at no cost and selling the water to the community.  But Rhoades said the infrastructure would affect the town's scenic views, and getting a permit would be a challenge. A desalination plant would face similar permitting and environmental hurdles.  "Transporting water that is treated, and is known from an inland source, might be a faster solution, even though it's expensive," he said.  Robert Pinoli, president of Mendocino Railway, which operates the historic Skunk Train, said he is ready to help. Since 1885, the train has been running from Willits through redwood forests and river canyons to Fort Bragg.  Pinoli said he could find tank cars quickly, attach them to the locomotive and deliver up to 200,000 gallons (757,000 liters) each trip. He identified a source for tank cars in 2015 when Fort Bragg went through a water shortage and considered buying inland water to transport it to the coast. Officials scratched those plans after it rained.  He said if Willits decides it wants to sell its water and Fort Bragg wants to buy it, "we become a logical vehicle for transporting water on a pretty large scale."  Willits officials recently decided against selling their water to the parched town.  For now, Mendocino residents are relying on people like Brian Clark, who has been selling water from his well outside town and trucking it in. Clark said he can't keep up with the demand.  "I'm really hiding from the phone, because I'm getting way more calls than I have water, and I'm hearing from people I've never met, never heard of, and I can't help them," he said.  Clark, a longtime resident, said Mendocino hasn't had such water storage issues since the 1970s when California faced the most severe drought on record.  County officials' short-term solutions include waiving permit requirements for storage tanks that can hold up to 5,000 gallons (18,900 liters) and identifying wells with excess water near Mendocino. Officials are also asking the state to help finance the bigger private tanks, Rhoades said.  "I want residents to be able to store more water now, while their wells are still somewhat productive, to make it through the next four months. And if they have to purchase water, you get the most bang for your buck," he said.

---||India||'Nation is losing patience': SC to govt on urgent need to clean up politics||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday drummed loudly the urgency for weeding out criminals from electoral politics, and scathingly criticised the Centre's lackadaisical approach in enacting suitable laws to decriminalise legislatures and warned that the nation is losing patience as repeated appeals for reforms have fallen in the deaf ears of sleeping political parties. In a 71-page judgment holding most political parties guilty of contempt for breaching a SC laid down rules mandating publicising criminal antecedents of candidates in the fray, a bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai said, "The nation continues to wait, and is losing patience. Cleansing the polluted stream of politics is obviously not one of the immediate pressing concerns of the legislative branch of government." The bench recounted the apex court's continuous efforts for nearly a decade to decriminalise politics and said, "No one can deny that the menace of criminalisation in the Indian political system is growing day by day. Also, no one can deny that for maintaining purity of the political system, persons with criminal antecedents and who are involved in criminalisation of the political system should not be permitted to be the lawmakers." "This court, time and again, has appealed to the lawmakers of the country to rise to the occasion and take steps for bringing out necessary amendments so that the involvement of persons with criminal antecedents in polity is prohibited. All these appeals have fallen on the deaf ears. The political parties refuse to wake up from deep slumber," it added. Justices Nariman and Gavai said though the court wanted to proceed further, its hands are tied because of the boundaries of separation of power between the judiciary and legislature, which alone had the power to enact laws. "In view of the constitutional scheme of separation of powers, though we desire that something urgently requires to be done in the matter, our hands are tied and we cannot transgress into the area reserved for the legislative arm of the State. We can only appeal to the conscience of the lawmakers and hope that they will wake up soon and carry out a major surgery for weeding out the malignancy of criminalisation in politics," it said. The bench, however, refused to bar candidates with criminal antecedents from being fielded by political parties. But it bolstered its February 13, 2020 directions by issuing a set of mandates to the Election Commission and political parties. Political parties will have to publish information regarding the criminal antecedents of candidates on the homepage of their websites, thus making it easier for the voter to get to the information that has to be supplied. It will be necessary now to have on the homepage a caption which states "candidates with criminal antecedents". The EC will have to create a dedicated mobile application containing information published by candidates regarding their criminal antecedents, so that at one stroke, each voter gets such information on his/her mobile phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nation-is-losing-patience-sc-to-govt-on-urgent-need-to-clean-up-politics/articleshow/85224540.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Hawkins County Sheriff Ronnie Lawson said the call came in around 8 a.m., prompting a major response at Volunteer High School in Church Hill from area law enforcement agencies that turned up no suspect and saw no shooting injuries.  Deputies responded immediately and began searching, with at least five agencies involved, authorities said. The school evacuated all the students, marching them in lines with their hands over their heads to school buses, and they were taken to an armory to be reunited with their parents, said the county's director of schools, Matt Hixson. Other schools locked down temporarily as a precaution.  Local authorities, along with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, are now looking into who made the call. Church Hill Police Chief Chad Mosley said the caller didn't give his name and it hasn't been determined if the call was made inside or outside of the school.  "Right here, we're telling you straight up, this was a hoax," Lawson said at a news conference, alongside the police chief. "There was no gunfire. Nobody injured. Thank god everybody is safe."  Lawson said the 911 caller claimed to be in a school bathroom with a handgun, saying he had been bullied by popular students and was going to the gym to shoot the weapon. Lawson said one police officer was in the high school while the person was still on the phone with the 911 dispatcher.  Hixson said he expects classes to resume Wednesday morning.  "We've been through Covid and a lot of closure and our intent is to keep students in school and keep them learning," he said.  Chris Vaughan of the Church Hill Rescue Squad said two people were transported from the scene for injuries unrelated to gunshots.  According to the sheriff, in a "totally unrelated" occurrence a student was sick and having a seizure while the 911 call was occurring.  Video broadcast by media outlets showed a large police presence at the school, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) east of Knoxville in Hawkins County.  Hawkins County Schools initially deemed the incident an "emergency situation," saying, "our major concern at this time is for the safety of our students and staff; please stay clear of the area to allow law enforcement and emergency personnel access to the area."  ___  This version corrects the spelling and affiliation of Chris Vaughan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/sheriff-hoax-call-about-gun-vacated-tennessee-high-school/articleshow/85225903.cms||---

Later, Nagarajan was arrested by the team. According to Shekhar Kumar Niraj, principal chief conservator of forests and the chief wildlife warden, Nagarajan, who is based in Tenkasi, was a suspect in several wildlife cases. Nagarajan has a house in Tenkasi and Kotagiri. However, his main activities were in Kanyakumari. The seizure on Tuesday was a follow-up of a series of joint searches held in Kanyakumari district by the sleuths of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB)-southern region and the forest officials of Kanyakumari forest division on August 8. Niraj said, “The searches were conducted based on intelligence reports gathered by WCCB-southern region. Several ivory products were seized in Kanyakumari. Three suspects were arrested in this connection on August 8.” According to him, further searches revealed information on Nagarajan. His premise in Tenkasi was raided, but the sleuths learned that he had fled to the Nilgiris. “His call records and the tower data established his whereabouts in Kotagiri in the Nilgiris,” Niraj said. He added, “To intensify the investigation, we immediately formed another team in the Nilgiris in consultation with the additional director, WCCB, New Delhi and the regional deputy director, WCCB southern region.” On Tuesday, after five hours of searching at the residence of Nagarajan in Kotagiri, the team led by Dabbala seized a huge number of antiques. On interrogation, the illegal trade of ivory products came to light linking the network across Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Kolkata. “On completion of the interrogation, Nagarajan will be produced before the first-class judicial magistrate under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972,” Niraj said. The WCCB is also working on the forward linkages leading to Kolkata and different parts of India, while the investigating teams from the forest department in the Nilgiris are perusing documents including bank transaction papers, digital data, and several files seized from the house of Nagarajan. “I have instructed officials to move an application at the sessions court in Kanyakumari for permission for further interrogation of the offenders,” Niraj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/huge-ivory-products-haul-in-kotagiri-1-held/articleshow/85226178.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan
---||Chennai||Gene isolation to help raise drought-resistant crops in India||CUDDALORE: Researchers successfully isolated a genome (a sequence of genes) in mangrove species, Avicennia marina, which is highly salt-tolerant. The isolation of the genome will play a key role in developing drought and salt-tolerant food crops along the 7,500km coastline in the country. A team of researchers at the Centre of Advanced Studies in Marine Biology, Annamalai University, Porto Nova, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai and the Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha achieved this feat. The research paper was published in the July issue of the Nature Communications Biology journal. The department of biotechnology funded the research. The study identified 614 genes in Avicennia marina with immense salt-tolerant properties. “We have assembled the complete genome of Avicennia marina using advanced genomics techniques. We have identified 31,477 protein-coding genes and a salinome consisting of 3,246 salinity-responsive genes including 614 experimentally validated salinity tolerance genes. The salinome provides a strong foundation to understand the molecular mechanisms of salinity tolerance in plants and to breed crops suitable for seawater farming,” said SRM University assistant professor Purushothaman Natarajan, who lead the research. The genes isolated from Avicennia marina were like the genes isolated earlier by different researchers from other species that exhibited salt-tolerant properties. “The study acquires significance at a time when the global agriculture productivity is hit due to lack of water and salinization of arable lands. The A marina roots work as a bio-desalination unit that filters out the salt from the seawater. We have decoded the complete genome and identified salinity tolerance genes. These genes will help in the genetic engineering of crop plants to grow in the 900 million hectares of saline soil in the country,” said SRM University professor Parani Madasamy, one of the researchers. Assistant professor, centre of advanced study in marine biology, Annamalai University, Porto Nova and one of the researchers Ayyaru Gopalakrishnan said Avicennia marina constitutes a major part of the mangrove forests. “It is a salt-secreting and extraordinarily salt-tolerant mangrove species that can grow in 75% seawater and tolerates more than 250% seawater. Understanding the mangrove plants at the genome level will be necessary for developing such highly salt-tolerant agricultural crops.," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gene-isolation-to-help-raise-drought-resistant-crops/articleshow/85226186.cms||Bosco Dominique

The central team that visited the state recently has made the observation after it found the district had reported a worrying 14,974 infections after the first dose and 5,042 after two doses. The district is using more Covishield injections. "This is being further reviewed with the state. We need to know when did the person test positive after taking the second dose and if he/she had mild or severe infection and required hospitalisation. We have sought this information from other districts too," said Sujeet Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control. While Kerala has been reporting a large number of cases, the government is also studying the cases through genome sequencing. The state has a higher rate of vaccination coverage with around 54% people having received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines whereas more than 23% are fully immunised. However, cases of re-infection are high in the state inspite of two doses of vaccines. There is also concern that a persistent high rate of infection with a large host of infected and vulnerable persons will lead to greater number of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-as-re-infections-rise-centre-asks-kerala-to-review-vaccine-dose-gap/articleshow/85226204.cms||---
---||World||Pardoned for killing, Kentucky man begins new federal trial||LONDON, KENTUCKY: A convicted killer whose family had political connections to former Kentucky governor Matt Bevin is back on trial for the 2014 killing that Bevin had pardoned him for shortly before leaving office. Patrick Baker was convicted of reckless homicide in Donald Mills' death in state court in 2017. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison, but Bevin pardoned Baker in 2019 as part of a slew of pardons that drew rebuke from both Democrats and Republicans. Baker's pardon was especially controversial, since Baker's family had held a fundraiser for Bevin the year before, raising $21,500 for the Republican's unsuccessful reelection campaign. Baker's brother and sister-in-law also gave $4,000 to Bevin's campaign on the day of the fundraiser, the Courier Journal reported. Baker now faces new federal charges in connection to Mills' death, as authorities pointed to the "dual sovereignty doctrine,'' which allows state and federal officials to prosecute the same defendant for the same actions without infringing on double jeopardy protections. In the trial's opening arguments Tuesday, federal prosecutors said Baker killed Mills, a drug dealer in Knox County, in 2014 while trying to rob him of cash and pain pills, The Lexington Herald-Leader reported. Baker targeted the drug dealer because he thought the man wouldn't be able to report the robbery, assistant US attorney Jenna Reed said. Reed said Baker knew Mills had pills at his house, and bought plastic handcuffs at a store before invading Mills' home. Baker, 43, has said he did not kill Mills and said his family "did not pay for my release'' from prison. One of his attorneys, Steve Romines, argued Tuesday that another man committed the murder and blamed it on Baker. A federal grand jury indicted Baker in May on charges of murder committed during a robbery and kidnapping related to drug trafficking. Bevin wrote in the 2019 pardoning document that Baker's "drug addictions'' led him to fall in with the wrong people and the evidence against Baker was "sketchy at best.'' But the Kentucky court of appeals upheld Baker's conviction in 2018, writing in a unanimous ruling that "there can be no doubt, on review of the proof as a whole, evidence of Baker's guilt was overwhelming.'' His pardon by Bevin won't be an issue in federal court after a judge ruled that evidence about the pardon is not admissible. Baker could face up to life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors decided against seeking the death penalty for him if he is convicted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pardoned-for-killing-kentucky-man-begins-new-federal-trial/articleshow/85224843.cms||---
---||World||South Sudan president urges end to infighting in rival camp||JUBA: South Sudan's President Salva Kiir on Tuesday urged an immediate halt to infighting between rival military factions of his old foe Vice President Riek Machar's movement after weekend violence left dozens dead. Kiir's call came as regional African body IGAD warned that the splintering of Machar's umbrella Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army-In Opposition "is beyond an intra-party crisis and bears significant immediate and long-term implications" for the world's youngest nation. At least 32 people were reported dead in the clashes that broke out on Saturday, just days after Machar's rivals in his SPLA-I0 said they had ousted him as party leader and head of its armed forces. Following a meeting on Tuesday with Machar and other cabinet members, Kiir's office released a statement calling for "the immediate cessation of hostilities" between the two camps. Those talks came on the heels of an emergency meeting Monday of foreign ministers organized by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) which called on the warring factions to open a dialogue. The East African bloc has been a key player in peace talks to end South Sudan's five-year civil war between forces loyal to Machar and Kiir that cost almost 400,000 lives. But the latest fighting within Machar's own movement threatens to put further pressure on the already fragile peace accord signed in 2018 and the power-sharing deal between the two men. Each side blamed the other for launching the early-morning attacks Saturday on rival forces in Upper Nile State which borders Sudan. Machar's forces killed two major generals and more than 27 "enemy" soldiers, and lost three of their own men, a military spokesman for the vice president said. In turn, the forces led by Simon Gatwech Dual, the general named last week as interim SPLA-IO chief, claimed in a statement they had killed 28 and lost four in their ranks. The world's newest nation has struggled with war, famine and chronic political and economic crisis since celebrating its hard-fought independence from Sudan in July 2011. Kiir also urged the government to press ahead with the formation of a unified armed forces command, a key component of the peace deal and one which Machar claims is opposed by his foes. IGAD brings together Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. Eritrea suspended its membership in 2007 and has not been readmitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/south-sudan-president-urges-end-to-infighting-in-rival-camp/articleshow/85225766.cms||---
---||World||Vacation interrupted: Biden's getaway plans shift by the day||WASHINGTON: Wilmington? No, the beach. Make that Camp David, actually. Or maybe just the White House after all?  President Joe Biden's vacation plans, like those of so many Americans during this national summer of uncertainty, keep changing. But while concerns about the resurgence of the coronavirus have caused Biden's plans to shift, the biggest complicating factor was the world's greatest deliberating body's commitment to, well, deliberation.  The president had hoped to begin his two-week summer vacation this week but, at the same time, wanted to be in Washington to tout the Senate's passage of his bipartisan infrastructure bill, a foundational piece of Biden's agenda. As negotiations dragged on last week, Biden decamped for his Wilmington, Delaware, home for the weekend, with officials planning a Sunday night return to mark the bill's passage.  But the talks in the Senate continued. And continued some more. And therefore, Biden's return was delayed until Monday, and then once more until Tuesday, when he did travel back to the White House to take a victory lap on the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill.  The shifting schedule, which changed by the day, upended the plans of aides and reporters alike, many of whom were forced to hurriedly extend hotel stays and purchase an extra set of clothes. But the fate of the bill, and Biden's own penchant to change his mind, have not been the only wrenches in the summer vacation plans.  Mindful of the pandemic, as well as the resulting economic hardship suffered by many Americans, Biden aides have long planned for the president's vacation to be modest. They also stressed that while a president is never truly off duty, most commanders-in-chief tend to change their surroundings when the August heat and humidity rise and Washington empties out.  Earlier this summer, when the virus seemed in remission ahead of the emergence of the highly contagious delta variant, there had been preliminary discussion of the president visiting some U.S. National Parks as an effort to celebrate the nation's heritage and gently encourage Americans to safely travel, according to aides.  But the most obvious and inevitable choice was always Biden's home state of Delaware - and potentially splitting the fortnight between two different locations.  The first was his Wilmington home, a place where he has now spent 14 of his 29 weekends as president. The home is near and dear to his heart due to its proximity to his family, including his grandchildren, and he has told confidants that he feels more comfortable there than at the White House, where he constantly has aides and Secret Service agents underfoot.  He has privately admitted to at times being homesick. There has been some scrutiny on his frequent travel back home, conducted at taxpayer expense, just as there was questions about the - much larger - cost of his predecessor Donald Trump's frequent trips to his golf courses in Florida and New Jersey.  "Because it's his home," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki last week, when questioned why Biden traveled back to Wilmington so often. "You like going home, right? So, does the President. He's human too."  The second location in the First State under consideration was the family home at Rehoboth Beach, a popular seaside destination. First Lady Jill Biden has in particular advocated spending time at the beach house, but it presented two significant challenges, according to aides.  For one, the Secret Service expressed concern about securing the house, which is nestled among other homes and not as easy to fortify as his more remote Wilmington abode. And secondly, a presidential visit requires a huge security footprint that could close roads and snarl traffic in a bustling beach town that does most of its yearly business on summer weekends. One option considered was to confine his time at Rehoboth to mid-week in order to cause less of a disruption.  He's been to the home in Rehoboth Beach just once so far, spending a few weekdays there with first lady Jill Biden in early June to celebrate her 70th birthday. Other aides advocated an extended stay at Camp David, the official presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, a remote and secure forested facility where a photo of Biden playing a Mario Kart arcade game with his granddaughter went viral earlier this year.  Though some Republicans will surely grouse about Biden taking a vacation during a surge in virus cases, the modern president is never completely free from work, tethered by secure telephone lines and other technology with a coterie of top aides and advisers always close by.  Like his predecessors, Biden travels with a large entourage of aides, Secret Service agents and journalists in an unmistakable motorcade of more than a dozen dark vehicles. Even when on a so-called vacation, presidents are still receiving briefings on national security, the economy and other issues, attending to matters of state and mapping future plans.  Presidential vacations are often quite political and, at times, used to reinforce public personas. George W. Bush often spent August clearing brush in the 100-degree heat that baked his central Texas ranch. Barack Obama worked on his golf game on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard. Trump spent time at his home on his private golf club in central New Jersey.  And at times, presidents have had to make legacy-defining decisions while on vacation, including Bush's response to Hurricane Katrina flooding New Orleans in 2005. Bill Clinton ordered airstrikes against al-Qaida terrorists from Martha's Vineyard in response to the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. And Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, planned the U.S. response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 from his family's oceanfront compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.  In total, Biden had aimed to take two weeks away from Washington. But thanks to the Senate, Biden now will not make his return to Wilmington until later this week and then spend the weekend at Camp David, according to officials.  It is not yet clear where he will spend next week. Pack accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/vacation-interrupted-bidens-getaway-plans-shift-by-the-day/articleshow/85226570.cms||---

As the advancing Taliban forces mounted an attack on Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan's largest city in the north, the government on Tuesday evacuated Indian nationals in and around the city, including the consulate staff, by a special IAF flight late evening. As per international media reports, thousands have fled from Mazar-i-Sharif and its adjoining areas. Like in Kandahar, from where too the government had recently evacuated Indian nationals, the Indian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif will continue to function with local staff. In a fresh security advisory, the third since late June, the Indian embassy in Kabul also advised Indian firms operating in Afghanistan to immediately withdraw their Indian employees out of project sites before air travel services are discontinued. It asked Indian nationals working for domestic or foreign companies in Afghanistan to immediately request their employers to facilitate their travel from project sites to India in view of ground situation. It said violence in many parts of Afghanistan had escalated and commercial air travel services to many provinces and cities were being discontinued. About 1,500 Indians are currently living in Afghanistan. The embassy said the advisory was also applicable to Indian journalists working in Afghanistan. "It is very essential that all Indian media persons arriving/staying in Afghanistan to establish contact with public affairs and security wing of the embassy for a personalized briefing, including specific advice for the location they are traveling to," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/come-home-before-flights-stop-govt-tells-indians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/85227554.cms||---

In an online session on the IBC, PwC India partner & leader (deals) Dinesh Arora said that telecom companies needed a different approach. “A pre-IBC solution is the best option for distressed telecom companies. In the case of telecom, there is the issue of the spectrum, which is a time-bound thing. Every day you waste, you lose money,” said Arora. In India, lenders are struggling with the resolution of loans in respect of telecom companies under the insolvency process. According to data shared by PwC in its presentation, the insolvency law has encouraged borrowers to settle. “The share of the insolvency cases that have been closed under Section 12(a) of the IBC is now more than the number of cases closed under a resolution plan,” said Arora. Of the 4,376 insolvency cases, 39% are still pending. Of the 61% that have been addressed, nearly half (29%) have been closed through liquidation and 8% have been closed under a resolution plan. However, in 10% of the cases, there has been a resolution by lenders agreeing to a settlement outside the IBC. Section 12A of the IBC allows an insolvency application to be withdrawn if 90% of lenders agree. According to Arora, a solution outside insolvency is better for services. “The preservation of value is easier when your assets are within the four walls of your premises. In the services sector, if a company is not operational and goes into insolvency, there is a degradation of value,” said Arora. He did not offer any comments on the ideal resolution for Vodafone, which is under stress. Bankers are concerned as insolvency proceedings would destroy value.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/resolve-telco-issue-outside-ibc-says-pwc/articleshow/85224054.cms||---

He was satisfied.”“The hospital has 12 PICU beds, eight HDU beds and 10 oxygen beds for children. In PICU, each bed has a monitor along with ventilator. We have also arranged for HFNC and BiPAP facilities. During the inspection, the arrangements of PICU in the hospital were found to be good.

He added the consignment would be delivered through courier for free. “Any individual can order a statue or pendant of Phoolan Devi on the website. We have also asked the workers to deliver the consignment at doorstep,” he said. Shana said the UP government led by CM Yogi Adityanath didn’t allow him to attend the statue installation ceremony at Varanasi on July 25. “The UP government, however, cannot stop us from spreading the ideology of Phoolan Devi, who fought for women empowerment as well as her pride,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vip-to-receive-online-orders-for-phoolans-idols/articleshow/85221402.cms||Ramashankar

The 25-year-old complainant, a Hindu girl from Vadodara, is the first petitioner in the quashing petition filed in the high court on August 5. While other accused claim their innocence, the complainant-victim has asserted that she was not forced to give up her religion. The lawyer refused to divulge details of the petition, which is likely to come up for the hearing next week. Usual practice of filing petition in the cases of consent quashing in the high court is that the victim is made a party respondent, who tells the court that he or she does not have any issue if the FIR is quashed. But in this case, the victim herself has become a petitioner demanding quashing of the FIR. On June 17, the woman had filed a complaint at Gotri police station against her husband, who is a Muslim but allegedly first identified himself as Sam Martin on social media. He befriended her and then got married in February. She complained that she was forced to convert her religion. The husband, his parents, a qazi who solemnized the marriage and two witnesses to the marriage have been booked under the provisions of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Amendment Act which came into force in the state from June 15 this year. The husband has been booked on charges of domestic violence, rape and sodomy as well. Two weeks later, the woman retracted from her complaint and stated on oath that she was not forced to change her religion. She submitted her affidavit in a sessions court in Vadodara and requested the court to grant bail to her husband. However, looking at the charges levelled in the case, the Vadodara court refused bail to her husband on July 5 by taking into consideration the victim’s statement made before a judicial magistrate under section 164 of the CrPC, in which she reportedly reiterated her allegations. On August 5, the husband’s bail plea was withdrawn from the high court after the judge was not inclined to grant him bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/victim-of-gujs-firstlove-jihad-plaint-files-petition-to-quash-fir/articleshow/85252854.cms||Saeed Khan

There was knee-deep Ganga water flowing in the lanes at Gandhi Ghat and in some low-lying areas along the bank of the river in Patna on Tuesday. The river water flooded Nakta diara and Bind Toli areas. The water level in the past 24 hours has gone up by around 14 to 20cm along its downstream from Buxar to Kahalgaon. The Ganga was flowing 45cm above the danger level at Buxar, 20cm at Bhagalpur and 83cm at Kahalgaon. At Munger, the water level was near the danger mark. At Gandhi Ghat, the water level was 77cm below the highest flood level (HFL) of 50.52 metres. At Hathidah, it was 35cm below the HFL mark of 43.17 metres. The situation worsened in the last 24 hours as the water discharge through Indrapuri barrage across Sone river also increased causing increased amount of water flowing into the Ganga at Maner on the western outskirts of Patna. Punpun river was also flowing 1.26 metres above the danger level at Sripalpur on the eastern outskirts of Patna. Furthermore, moderate rainfall from 15mm to 64mm had been received both in Nepal and along the basins of the rivers in north and south Bihar. The rainfall forecast is the same in both Nepal and Bihar till Thursday which, in turn, will increase the water level in all the major and minor rivers that also fall into the Ganga in the state. Water discharge through the Gandak, Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla, Kosi and Mahananda was not so high, as they were flowing above the danger level only at a few places along their downstream. The situation is unlikely to remain the same, as their levels are expected to go up by Thursday due to uniformly spread moderate rainfall till then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-above-red-mark-in-patna-buxar/articleshow/85218093.cms||Abhay Singh

The central government on Wednesday informed the court that the sacked employee was based in Rajasthan. It did not divulge further details about the sacked personnel. The government said that the Covid jab has been made mandatory for all personnel of the armed forces. Assistant solicitor general Devang Vyas told the court that nine IAF employees were reluctant to take the shot. All of them were given show-cause notices, asking them to explain why their services should not be terminated for disregarding the order to get vaccinated. Vyas said that eight of the employees replied to the notices, and the one who failed to respond was sacked. Vyas was addressing the court in response to the petition filed by corporal Yogender Kumar from Jamnagar. Kumar too got a notice after he refused to get vaccinated. On Kumar’s invocation of his fundamental rights, the Centre submitted that he could have approached the appellate authority or the Armed Forces Tribunal instead of directly approaching the high court. After hearing the case, the bench headed by Justice A J Desai disposed of the corporal’s petition and directed the IAF to consider his case afresh after examining all the material he submits. The court ordered the IAF to give Kumar a hearing and then decide on his case within four weeks. The high court also ordered the IAF not to compel the corporal to take the Covid-19 vaccine nor sack him till his case is decided. The court said any adverse order of the IAF should not be implemented for two weeks from the date on which the order is served to the corporal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iaf-sacks-employee-in-raj-for-vax-dodge/articleshow/85252742.cms||Saeed Khan

Speaking at a health department programme to inaugurate several projects and and laying the foundation stones for many others worth Rs 2705.35 crore, Nitish said without taking anyone’s name, “We give Rs 4 lakh to the family of those who belonged to Bihar and died of Covid-19 anywhere in the country, but we do not waste money on advertisement. On the other hand, those who are giving Rs 50,000 to the family of Covid-19 deceased are spending more on advertisement through various media channels.” The Kejriwal government has announced Rs 50,000 as financial help to the family members of a person from Delhi dying of Covid-19. Nitish assured that the kin of anyone from of Bihar who dies even in other states during the line of Covid-19 treatment will be given paid Rs 4 lakh. The CM, without any name, also took a jibe at the leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, saying a few people had no idea of basic things, but were busy in writing false and useless stuff on the social media. He asked the officials present in the event to keep people updating through social media about the works being done, especially the youngsters who, he said, would be otherwise misguided. Attacking former CMs Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, Nitish said before 2005, there was no arrangement of medicines and doctors at health institutes in Bihar. As per a survey, average 39 people visited a primary health centre in a month earlier. The number has increased to over 10,000 now. “That time, more than food, people had to spend on medical treatment. People are forgetting old things and such things need to be told through social media,” Nitish said. He appreciated the efforts of the health department in tackling two Covid-19 waves and also praised the work being done in strengthening the health infrastructure, keeping in mind the predicted third wave. He said the state government has spent nearly Rs 10,000 crore on people during the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-takes-a-dig-at-kejriwal-tejashwi/articleshow/85221265.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Business||2021: Year of mega fund-raise||MUMBAI: The IPO frenzy on Dalal Street continued with four offers together this week trying to mobilise about Rs 14,600 crore, making it one of the busiest weeks for IPOs in several years. The previous week saw Rs 3,614 crore, while during the week of July 12-16, Rs 9,375 crore was raised from just one IPO — Zomato, data from exchanges and merchant bankers showed. The previous large week for an IPO mobilisation was March 2-6, 2020 when SBI Cards raised Rs 10,355 crore. A combination of easy availability of funds globally, a stock market that is recording a new peak on a regular basis and strong listing gains have combined to prompt promoters, merchant bankers and private equity investors to take companies public, industry players said. During the current week, Nuvoco Vista Corp is raising Rs 5,000 crore through its IPO, which is the first such offer from a cement company in the last one and half decades. Nuvoco Vista is majority owned by Karsanbhai Patel who is also the owner of Nirma detergent. Its aim to raise Rs 5,000 crore would make it the second-biggest IPO this year after Zomato’s. The last IPO of a cement company was launched in 2006 when JK Cement went public. Nuvoco Vista is the fifth largest cement company in India and the biggest in eastern India. The shares are being offered at a price band of Rs 560-570 per share. The IPO will close on August 11. According to a report by IIFL Securities, “given NVCL’s size, strong brand ownership, leadership position in the fast-growing eastern Indian market, availability of limestone mines for future expansion, and scope for improving profitability & deleveraging balance sheet, we believe valuations are reasonable. We recommend subscribing to the IPO.” Along with Nuvoco, three other IPOs are also open now. The IPO for CarTrade is for a tech-enable auto listing company while for Chemplast Sanmar, a speciality chemical company, it’s the second coming to be publicly listed after being delisted about 10 years ago. The IPO for Aptus Value Housing is for a mortgage finance company serving mid- and low-income segments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/2021-year-of-mega-fund-raise/articleshow/85230812.cms||---
---||Business||RIL, Gates to jointly back MIT’s energy storage co||Mumbai: The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) has announced that it is joining American business magnate Bill Gates for investing in Ambri, a Massachusetts-based energy storage company. Apart from the two billionaires, other investors such as New York-based hedge fund manager Paulson too have invested in Ambri. Ambri has received a total funding of $144 million (Rs 1,100 crore), of which RIL contributed 35%, that is, $50 million (Rs 375 crore). India’s most valued company has routed the Ambri investment through its 100% arm Reliance New Energy Solar. Ambri is RIL’s first investment in low-carbon technology after Ambani laid out a road map for a clean-energy play at the company’s annual general meeting in June. The plan includes building a factory in Jamnagar, Gujarat, for the storage of intermittent energy. RIL and Ambri are also exploring to set up a battery manufacturing facility in India, which “would bring down costs” for the former’s green energy initiative, the Indian company said. Ambri, an MIT spin-out, will use the money to build manufacturing infrastructure in the US and in other countries. Ambri makes low-cost, durable battery systems that can last for long hours. This makes it suitable to meet the growing demand from the grid-scale energy storage market and from other customers like data centres. The deal will give RIL access to Ambri’s cost-efficient energy storage technology as the Indian company looks to decarbonise the existing business as well as build a green energy business. RIL said that Ambri’s energy storage systems will break through the cost, longevity and safety barriers associated with lithium-ion batteries used in grid-scale storage applications and will enable a storage solution capable of supporting the increasing amounts of renewable energy being integrated into electric power grids. Separately, Ambri has inked an agreement to source antimony, a key mineral used in battery chemistry, from Perpetua Resources, whose largest shareholder is Paulson. The calcium and antimony electrode-based cells and containerised systems are more economical than lithium-ion batteries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-gates-to-jointly-back-mits-energy-storage-co/articleshow/85223972.cms||---

The deceased has been identified as Yadlapalli Anand Kumar from Chintalapudi village in West Godavari district. Anand Kumar’s wife had filed a missing complaint with Tadepalli police on July 23, stating she last spoke to her husband on the phone on June 19.

The combined investment is around $30 million between these three,” said Dimitrov Krishnan, president ICEMA (Indian Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association). The new names apart, existing manufacturers including JCB and Schwing Stetter are also planning fresh investments. “We are putting up our new factory in Vadodara for Rs 650 crore and this project is going ahead and will be commissioned early next calendar year,” said Deepak Shetty, chief executive officer (CEO) & managing director (MD), JCB India. Schwing Stetter is setting up a new Rs 300 crore factory in Cheyyar in Tamil Nadu and also putting in place an R&D centre in the state with a focus on domestic as well as export business. Companies say the capex is part of the industry’s 10-year action plan to grow this segment even though current capacity utilisation is around 65%. “ICEMA has done a 10-year plan and we want to take the industry turnover from $6.5 billion right now to around $25 billion by 2030,” said Krishnan. The capacity build up is also for exports with companies like JCB, Schwing Stetter, Caterpillar, Volvo, Hitachi and others all exporting out of India though in small numbers. But the fly in the ointment is the rising steel prices. “Between last June and this, both HRC and CRC prices have gone up by 100% and the spot market is very volatile,” said JCB’s Shetty. “This is pushing up the cost of infrastructure because we cannot absorb this kind of cost increase,” he added. JCB for example has taken a 1%-3% price hike on July 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/construction-equipment-sector-sees-top-gear-domestic-sales/articleshow/85220775.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar was hearing a PIL of Bharat Prasad Singh filed in 2016 to direct the authorities concerned to provide road connectivity, which was absent even after trains started plying from Patliputra railway station in 2015. On July 27, the court was apprised that a five-member committee comprising railways, district administration, municipal corporation, BSRDCL and urban development and housing department had been formed to explore the best feasible possibility of connecting the railway station from all directions by roads. Additional advocate general PN Shahi submitted that the work assigned to the committee is technical and may require some more time. The court remained dissatisfied and called advocate general Lalit Kishore, who sought at least a week’s time to convene a meeting at his level with all government authorities and counsels involved in the matter and resolve the issue.

Expressing concern over inimical powers from across the border trying to exploit the ituation, the CM sought an “enduring and expeditious” solution to the farmers’ concerns. Amarinder said protests have been going on in Punjab ever since the Centre issued the ordinances in June 2020. “While these protests have been largely peaceful, one can sense rising tempers, especially as the state moves towards elections in early 2022,” he said. The prolonged agitation is not only impacting economic activities in Punjab, but has the potential to affect its social fabric, especially when political parties and groups take strong positions, he added. Citing reports, the CM said more than 400 farmers and farm workers had laid their lives since the agitation shifted to Delhi borders. He recalled he had even earlier sought appointment from Shah to meet with an all-party delegation from Punjab. Amarinder also flagged the urgent need to compensate farmers for the management of paddy straw at Rs 100 per quintal and to address the growing fear of shortage of DAP. He urged Shah to advise officials of the fertilizers department for enhanced allocation of DAP stocks to Punjab as per the revised demand by the state and to direct suppliers to ensure adequate supplies. Pointing to recent increase in the cost of phosphatic fertilizers subsumed by the Centre into the subsidy only till October 31, 2021, the CM said the firming up of DAP prices in the international market and uncertainty about the extent of subsidy were contributing immensely to an apprehension of a likely shortfall of DAP in the ensuing Rabi season. As a result of difficulties being faced by Markfed to arrange DAP supplies through tendering, the state government has requested the department of fertilizers to make an additional allocation of at least 3.5 lakh MTs of DAP on a priority basis till October, and another 1.5 lakh MTs of DAP up to November 15, 2021, so as to ensure timely availability of DAP for sowing of wheat in the state, he informed Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cant-risk-national-security-amarinder-urges-shah-to-repeal-farm-laws/articleshow/85223289.cms||---

A five-year-old boy orphaned by Covid was caught in a bitter a custody battle waged by his warring grandparents who were not happy with his parents’ love marriage in the first place. Fortunately for the boy, the HC stepped in and intervened to make the maternal and paternal sides of the boy bury their hatchet and end dispute in the interest of the young one's mental and physical well-being. The child currently lives with his maternal grandparents in Dahod. He was orphaned during the second wave after his father, Rajesh Acharya, 35, died at Dhanvantari Hospital on May 12 followed by demise of his mother Rakhi, 40, at SVP Hospital a month later on June 12. The boys paternal grandparents lived in Ahmedabad after his grandfather retired from the Railway Claims Tribunal. Rajesh and Rakhi used to live in Ahmedabad, albeit in a separate house in Vinzol. After the couple’s demise, the child went to his maternal grandparents in Dahod, where he has been admitted in a school. On the other hand, Acharya’s family insisted on the child’s custody. Acharya’s elder brother, who runs a restaurant in Coimbatore, also joined his elderly parents during the bereavement period. They approached the high court by filing a habeas corpus petition and claimed custody of the child. They complained that the maternal grandparents of the child have even blocked their phone numbers. The high court talked to both the families through video conferencing and made the child have a conversation with his paternal grandparents and uncle. About the conversation the court noticed, “The child at this age is absolutely innocent and is unable to comprehend the nature of dispute in the present case. He is perhaps unaware of the death of both of his parents. We have noticed his positive smiles and the behavior towards the grandparents and the elder brother of his father. He also expressed his willingness to come to the grandparents’ family in Ahmedabad.” The court requested the families to forget their acrimonies, keep the custody dispute aside and work towards the best interest of the child so that his mental and physical growth is not tainted by the dispute in court. Following this, the maternal grandparents invited the other family to visit their place in Dahod and live for a couple of days. The court also endorsed this proposal of gathering and then ordered that the child’s custody may be retained by the paternal grandparents for next few days. To end the dispute, the HC also asked the Dahod family to unblock the phone numbers of child’s paternal grandparents. It also requested the secretary of Dahod’s legal service authority to facilitate proper communication between the two families, supervise the family’s visit and report to the court. Further hearing has been posted on August 26, said advocate K I Kazi who represents the maternal grandparents of the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parents-dead-hc-prods-in-laws-to-make-peace/articleshow/85220959.cms||Saeed Khan

If Shahabad-Markanda poured out to garland captain Rani Rampal and team mates Navjot Kaur and Navneet Kaur, Sonipat showered Nisha Warsi, Neha Goyal, and Sharmila with flowers. Garlanded with cash, the skipper and her mates were brought home to drumbeats by their families and the hockey fans from Kurukshetra district. Rani Rampal said: "It will motivate us for the Hockey World Cup." In an open MUV, the trip was taken around Shahabad-Markanda as flower petals rained upon them from the balconies for their hard-fought semi-final against Great Britain. They first reached Rani’s house at New Model Town, where her parents, Rampal and Ram Murti, welcomed them with traditional Indian aarti. The fans made the trio cut a welcome cake. Shahabad legislator Ram Karan Kala and district sports officer Balbir Singh received the players. The next stop was Navjot's house, where her parents, Satnam Singh and Manjeet Kaur, greeted them. At Navneet house, her parents, Buta Singh and Jaswinder Kaur, welcomed them. Rani Rampal said: "This was not the last Olympics and we did not play under pressure. We took every game as just another hockey match that we wanted to win." Asked to give a message to the budding players, Rani said: "I can’t tell the number of future players this win will inspire. If they work hard and believe in themselves, then their dreams will come true." On her future plans, she said: "The next year is very busy, with Asian Games and the Asia Hockey Cup, which is the qualification tournament for the Hockey World Cup. In the next camps, we will analyse our performance in Tokyo." Asked about team support at the Olympics, Rani said: "It was very good, as every player was unique. Unfortunately, the semi-final match was not our day. Its pain will always remain in our hearts but we must look forward." Thanking the countrymen for support, she said, "I have never seen so much love for women's hockey. Wish we could have brought home the medal." Navneet, still carrying that injury above her left eye from that battle of Britain, said: "The warm welcome feels good. We put in a very serious effort to take Indian women’s hockey to that level." In Tokyo, they made history indeed. Sonipat received Nisha Warsi, Neha Goyal, and Sharmila at the gates and gave them an open-jeep victory parade. Budding hockey players from Sonipat formed the motorcade behind Rani Rampal’s girls and flower petals rained on them. The players took blessings of their coach, Arjuna Award winner Preetam Siwach, at her house in Sonipat. She had taught them the basics of the game and made them worthy of national selection. The procession that started from Maharana Pratap Chowk passed through Delhi Road, Mama-Bhanja Chowk, and Geeta Bhawan Chowk before stopping at the old industrial area hockey ground. City magistrate Jitender Joshi described the girls as "fighters who missed a medal but won the hearts and paved way for future success in hockey."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ranis-tigresses-come-home-to-victory-roars/articleshow/85223261.cms||JK Singh

The deceased has been identified as Mantu Kumar Gupta, 40. He owned Maa Vindhyavasini Jewellers in the market area. Bihta police station SHO Atulesh Kumar said Gupta was shot in his head and chest. The criminals fired three to four rounds inside the shop. He said a few empty cartridges were also recovered from the shop. The SHO said the criminals also ransacked the shop and it was yet not clear if the murder was a fallout of any extortion demand or loot bid. However, traders in the market strongly believe that the murder was a fallout of extortion demand, which Mantu might have denied to pay. “This is a pure case of extortion. The incident took place in the heart of the Bihta mandi. There are at least 30 jewellery shops there. He has been murdered in order to terrorise others,” a prominent trader from Bihta said. The criminals also assaulted his staff cum driver, Neeraj Kumar, during the incident.

Neeraj said he saw the criminals fleeing on three different bikes towards Machhli gali. On August 6, unidentified criminals had shot at a druggist, Sonu Kumar, on NH-30 near Anandpur under Bihta police station area. Sonu owns a wholesale drugstore at Maner. He was targeted while returning home. Criminals had not looted anything from Sonu. This incident is also suspected to be linked with extortion.

---||Patna||Bihar: MP Chirag Paswan given four month time to vacate father Ram Vilas Paswan’s 12 Janpath bungalow||PATNA: The Union housing and urban affairs ministry is learnt to have given four months time to Jamui MP Chirag Paswan to vacate the 12 Janpath bungalow, which was earlier allotted to his father late Ram Vilas Paswan. Though Chirag could not be reached for his comments, one of his close confidantes here said that the directorate, which works under the Union housing and urban affairs ministry, has already been asked to spare four months time to Chirag . The confidante added that the Jamui MP had written to the authorities concerned to allow him and his family members to stay in the bunglow till the ‘barkhi’ (a ritual performed after a year of one's death) of his father. Ram Vilas had died at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, on October 8 last year when he was the minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution in the Narendra Modi cabinet. He served the department since 2014. The MP’s confidante, who is also a senior functionary in the LJP faction led by Chirag, said the notice to vacate the bungalow was served in July this year. “The issue is being raised again due to political reasons. Chiragji has been given four months on his request,” he asserted. Chirag is currently engaged in a power battle with his uncle and Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras, who is the minister of food processing industries at the Centre. Chirag, who is on his ‘ashirvad yatra’ in the state, is critical of CM Nitish Kumar. However, he is not so aggressive with the BJP, especially PM Narendra Modi, despite being snuffed by the BJP top leadership when he is at crossroads of his political career.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-given-4-month-time-to-vacate-fathers-12-janpath-bungalow/articleshow/85221170.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||Seven bidders show early interest for Vasan Eye||Chennai: There are seven bidders, including a couple of Asset Reconstruction Companies who have expressed preliminary interest to take over the beleaguered eye care chain Vasan Eye. The last date for submission of early interest ended July 19. The NCLT appointed resolution professional had called for early interest for Vasan Eye Care. India’s largest eye care chain Dr Agarwal’s Eye and MGM Hospital’s promoter MK Rajagopalan, Dr GSK Velu’s MaxiVision are among the list of bidders. Dr Amar Agarwal and MK Rajagopalan did not wish to comment on the bid. Poster boy of aggressive expansion, Vasan Eye went into insolvency process after it failed to repay debts of nearly Rs 1,628 crore and its creditors dragged the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover their dues. Its misery was compounded after regulatory authorities initiated probes into investments made by politicians. It further went down the spiral after its promoter Dr Arun died last November, pulling the company into insolvency courts. Two attempts to find a suitor didn't make any progress and the current one is the third. “Our eye care business MaxiVision has submitted its interest. It is a long shot. Our logic is simple: we are strong in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Vasan has a strong presence in other southern states. Vasan has 94 units operational and earned nearly Rs 140 crore in revenues last year. And since the process is driven by NCLT, legal issues will be dealt with and the asset will come clean to the buyer,” Dr Velu said. Calls and text messages to the Resolution Professional turned futile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/seven-bidders-show-early-interest-for-vasan-eye/articleshow/85220971.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh home to sites worthy of Unesco tag||Andhra Pradesh hosts at least a dozen structures and sites, which if conserved well, could make it to Unesco’s world heritage list. Apart from historic structures each rivalling the other in grandeur, beauty, architecture, cultural value and traditions, the state has natural sites that are unique in terms of geological and biological significance. However, lack of conservation and protection from encroachments over the decades have robbed the heritage sheen out of them. With Ramappa temple in neighbouring Telangana making its way to the Unesco heritage list, the AP government has proposed to conserve some of the structures and sites in a bid to seek the world heritage tag. Top on the priority list are Lepakshi temple, and the Gandikota Grand Canyon and its fort. Heritage experts have listed around a dozen monuments and sites that hold the potential for heritage tag. Apart from Lepakshi and Gandikota, architectural structures like Vontimitta temple and Gurramkonda fort and tombs; Kuchipudi, which is a village of cultural heritage importance; and natural geological and biological sites like Thimmamma Marrimanu, world’s biggest banyan tree, the rock formations of Orvakallu, Erramatti Dibbalu, the Eastern Ghats, particularly its Seshachalam biosphere with its unique flora and fauna, can qualify for the Unesco recognition. While the monuments fulfil the Unesco’s criteria Nos II, III and IV, the natural sites qualify criteria Nos VII, VIII and IX. A site or monument should fulfil at least one of the 10 criteria to qualify for the world heritage tag. According to heritage expert P Anuradha Reddy, some of the monuments in AP are part of the “important interchange of human values on developments in architecture or technology, or monumental arts”. As far as Kuchipudi dance and village are concerned, the site qualifies criterion No. VI, as Kuchipudi is “directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, beliefs, artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance”. S Satyanarayana, managing director of AP Tourism Development Corporation, said the APTDC is identifying sites that have the potential to get Unesco recognition. “We have a lot of monuments and sites that hold potential for heritage tag, which include the Buddhist circuit, temples in Penukonda and Kadiri, the largest banyan tree in the world, and Gandikota. We have plans for the significant ones,” Satyanarayana said. The Lepakshi temple in Anantapur has unparalleled cultural, architectural and heritage value. Built by the Vijayanagar rulers in early 16th century, the temple is famous for its hanging pillar and a rock chain. It has several mural paintings and Telugu inscriptions. Associated with it is the world’s largest Nandi (bull) sculptured in granite. Lepakshi is associated with the Ramayana. The temple at Vontimitta in Kadapa district is an imposing structure with three gopurams. It has an open auditorium or mandapam supported by 32 pillars sculpted in stone. Built during the Vijayanagar empire the temple attracted many poets, including Bommera Pothana who wrote Maha Bhagavatam in Telugu. Gandikota in Kadapa district with its gorge and fort is famous as the Grand Canyon of India. It fulfils the Unesco criteria of a “superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance”. It is formed by the Penna river. Thimmamma Marrimanu, the banyan tree near Kadiri in Anantapur district, is an example of what Unesco criteria IX calls “outstanding examples representing significant ongoing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial...”. The 550-year-old tree with 1,110 props is spread over 4.721 acres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-home-to-sites-worthy-of-unesco-tag/articleshow/85219009.cms||Syed Akbar

Pachrukhi police station SHO Dadan Singh said the minor was kidnapped from her residence at around 8.30pm on Monday and was taken to a secluded place. “There, she was raped and then strangled by the accused, Pradeep Singh (40), who is the maternal cousin of the girl’s father,” he said. The SHO said Pradeep was arrested and on his confession, police recovered the girl’s body from a bush. “In the morning, the villagers tried to lynch Pradeep after freeing him from police custody. The villagers pelted the police team with stones when he was being taken to the police station. A few police personnel protecting him were injured. One of the two police vehicles was also damaged as the irate mob smashed its windscreen and window panes by stones,” he said. Dadan said there was a shraddh in the relation of the girl’s family at the village and her mother had gone there to attend the rituals while leaving her alone at home. “Pradeep had also come to the village two days back to attend the same shraddh. Villagers suspected Pradeep’s involvement when the girl was found missing from her home Monday night,” he said. The SHO said Pradeep, a native of village Sugahi under Siswan police station area of Siwan district, is accused of killing his wife by hanging her and had badly injured her brother with a sharp-edged object. “His nature was known to the villagers and that’s why they first suspected his hand behind the kidnapping of the minor girl,” he said. The SHO said the body was handed over to the family after postmortem. Pradeep’s medical examination has also been conducted. He said further investigations were going on in the case.

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a PIL filed by one Abhay Kumar, took the matter seriously and also issued notice to the Union ministry of environment, forest, climate change, a respondent in the case. The petitioner has urged the high court to quash the amendment made by the department and board notification on grounds that they are contradictory to the ministry’s order where only minor mining activities have been exempted, and not the kilns for large-scale commercial exploitation of top soil. Petitioner’s counsel Raushan submitted that the department and the board notifications are contradicts the provision of ministry’s notification of March 28, 2020 and will degrade the top soil quality. The ministry, in the backdrop of amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, had notified that extraction of ordinary clay or sand by manual mining, by potters to prepare earthen pots, lamp, toys etc as per customs would be exempted from environmental clearance requirement. On September 14 last year, the department amended Rule 38 of Bihar Minerals (Concession, Prevention of Illegal Mining, Transportation and Storage Amendment) Rules, 2019 and exercising powers under Section 15 of MMDR Act, notified that quarrying soil till 1.5 metres depth from ground level for brick kilns shall be deemed non-mining activity and shall not require environment clearance. On the basis of this departmental notification, pollution board notified on October 22 last year that brick kilns in the state won’t require any environmental clearance if quarrying is done up to 1.5 metres. The court has fixed September 7 as the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-issues-notices-over-soil-quarrying-by-kilns/articleshow/85217847.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Ironically, whenever ganja is seized anywhere in the country, the trail leads to Vizag Agency.  The enforcement officials—police, excise and special enforcement bureau (SEB)— have been busting ganja rackets in the region for the past few years. But the ‘big sharks’, that is, interstate players, who are involved in the illegal trade are yet to be nabbed. From January to July this year, over 35,000 kilos of ganja were seized in over 120 cases and over 260 smugglers, including some interstate smugglers, were arrested by enforcement officials in the Vizag region. In most cases, the agents and the middlemen who are caught by the officials are not the ringleaders. After initial arrests, ganja trade and seizure cases generally die down as no proper follow-ups are made to identify and nab key players and local gangs who support cultivation of the weed and transportation. “A few interstate gangs with support from local gangs manufacture hashish oil. It’s a thick liquid made from dissolving marijuana (ganja) in solvents that include acetone and alcohol. Hashish oil gives more of a ‘kick’ than weed and it is consumed by mixing it in cigarettes. Hashish oil will cost more than Rs 1 lakh per litre,” a senior officer said. Speaking to TOI, ASP of SEB, Vizag Rural, S Satish Kumar said there is no data as yet on the most wanted ganja smugglers in the region. It will take some time to identify the smugglers who are involved in the trade,” he added. “Unless the kingpins are tracked down and nabbed, the cultivation and smuggling of ganja and related products would continue in Vizag Agency and Vizianagaram,” said SEB officials. “We will collect intelligence inputs from various sources to identify the interstate gangs. Thus we can curb ganja cultivation and transportation,” they added. It is also alleged that though all ganja consignments are coming from Vizag Agency, no concrete measures are being taken by the enforcement officials to check their movement. “The tribals in Vizag Agency are made scapegoats by the ganja mafias whereas the kingpins in the trade are going scot-free,” said B Lokanatham of the CPI(M). The enforcement agencies are able to seize only 30 per cent of the consignments being trafficked in the region” Lokanatham added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/arrests-galore-but-kingpins-of-ganja-trade-go-scot-free/articleshow/85219110.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Noida||Testing to be intensified in societies, rural areas||Noida/Ghaziabad: In view of a possible third Covid wave, both Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad are planning to increase Covid testing in housing societies, rural areas, railway stations and bus stands across the cities. The government has instructed the Ghaziabad health department to conduct 7,400 tests daily. However, due to the negligible cases in the district, the department is conducting around 4,600 tests with a focus on RT-PCR tests. GB Nagar, meanwhile, is currently testing 4,100 samples daily. In the absence of a significant rise in Covid cases, people are not turning up at booths. Besides reaching out to societies and rural areas, the officials are also keeping a close watch on the spread of infection in neighbouring districts. Ghaziabad’s surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said, “At present, the number of people with seasonal fever has increased in the district. Their symptoms are similar to Covid. All such patients must be tested for Covid as well.” Dr Gupta added, “Random testing is being done in various societies and colonies across the city. Also, efforts are being made to get more children tested.” The department is focusing on three bus stands and the Ghaziabad railway station where passengers from high caseload areas like Kerala and Maharashtra are being tested. Two teams have been deployed at these places where about 600-650 tests on average are being conducted every day. Ghaziabad has conducted 41,718 tests this month (till August 9) and only nine cases have been reported so far. There are 11 permanent booths and 16 mobile teams in the district. Meanwhile, the health department of GB Nagar said random screening camps will be conducted at the Botanical Garden, Sector 16 and Sector 18 metro stations in the coming days. “We have conducted around 37,100 tests this month (till August 9) in Noida, Greater Noida and other parts of the district,” said an official. The majority of tests were being done through rapid antigen kits, the officer added. Meanwhile, 12 individuals have been found positive for Covid 19 in the same duration with no new case being detected on August 2, 5 and 6. Officials said in the coming days, autorickshaw drivers, cab drivers and other working executives who travel back and forth to the neighbouring districts and states will be screened. Dr Amit Kumar, the district public health expert, said that the situation is being reviewed at the chief medical officer’s office daily. Residents’ groups are also trying to create awareness among families. Sanwarjeet Singh from Gaur Sports Wood in Sector 79 said, “Children have been organising street plays on various topics related to Covid. They visit neighbouring areas too. We are planning to hold two more plays in Sorkha and Salarpur within a week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/testing-to-be-intensified-in-societies-rural-areas/articleshow/85223266.cms||Shalabh
---||Business||Flexible work hrs boost output, family bonding||By Sumit Sabharwal As organisations prepared to gradually open up and employees were getting ready to return to the physical workplace after the unprecedented disruption caused by the pandemic last year, its widespread second spell brought in a new wave of uncertainty, leading to renewed work-from-home fatigue. Employees have become prone to experiencing bouts of low morale with no clear indication of when the Covid crisis would abate, thus rendering them vulnerable to stress and anxiety. As many employees are still working from home where the lines between the ‘workspace’ and ‘home space’ are blurred, the need for a considerate approach has further compounded. It is crucial for organisations to develop a culture of understanding and leaders to adopt an empathetic outlook to conversations within and beyond the jurisdiction of the workplace. Bringing people together in spirit to ensure mental resilience is just as important as the physical and social resistance that we are putting up against the virus. In fact, addressing employees’ mental health concerns has emerged as a key imperative for organisations. Enterprises today need to be attuned to the sensitivities of their employees and step up to foster a supportive and conducive environment. While we combat the spread of the virus by remaining isolated and getting vaccinated, it is extremely crucial to build and emphasise on a collective identity that welcomes emotional and mental support for everyone within and around the organisation. There are three key steps that employers can undertake to cultivate a culture of understanding and empathy… * Awareness & access: Any measure that the leadership team adopts in terms of workplace protocol and support should shift from being by-products of a productivity push and move towards a genuine as well as considerate backing of employees and their extended environment. This would mean support that extends beyond physical and monetary resource allocation to help employees deal with the effects of the pandemic. Dedicated support teams can be one such measure, deployed to help employees deal with challenges faced due to the pandemic — be it health- or lockdown-related. A strong belief in the organisation’s ability to support its people during these trying circumstances can help alleviate unwanted stress and burden on employees. This would also reinforce faith in the organisation. * Providing flexibility: Given the kind of challenges employees have been facing, something as simple as flexible working hours can also help immensely as it provides individuals with an opportunity to spend more time with family members. Time spent with family and loved ones has been linked to reduced stress levels, increased focus, and higher productivity levels at work. Extended paid holidays are another form of support that could help employees feel refreshed and prevent them from burning out. Further, offering subscription to online apps or counselling services can go a long way in helping employees cope with stress. * Continuous, clear & secure communication: With physical distancing ruling out personal interactions and the usual in-person townhalls, it is crucial for leaders to ensure that employees do not end up feeling that they are working in silos, and not part of a larger team. By maintaining a constant communication line between the leadership and the workforce, organisations can ensure that any emotional gaps are filled with empathy and support. Maintaining these channels is crucial for the leadership to gain an understanding of the state their employees are in and provide prompt support, where needed. It is vital for these lines of support to remain equitably accessible across the organisation. At the end of the day, it is the little things that can make a huge difference when it comes to looking out for employees. As the second wave of the pandemic rescinds, we must continue to remain dedicated and committed to making remote-working secure, efficient and conducive for our workforce.

---||Business||2021: Year of mega fund-raise||MUMBAI: The IPO frenzy on Dalal Street continued with four offers together this week trying to mobilise about Rs 14,600 crore, making it one of the busiest weeks for IPOs in several years. The previous week saw Rs 3,614 crore, while during the week of July 12-16, Rs 9,375 crore was raised from just one IPO — Zomato, data from exchanges and merchant bankers showed. The previous large week for an IPO mobilisation was March 2-6, 2020 when SBI Cards raised Rs 10,355 crore. A combination of easy availability of funds globally, a stock market that is recording a new peak on a regular basis and strong listing gains have combined to prompt promoters, merchant bankers and private equity investors to take companies public, industry players said. During the current week, Nuvoco Vista Corp is raising Rs 5,000 crore through its IPO, which is the first such offer from a cement company in the last one and half decades. Nuvoco Vista is majority owned by Karsanbhai Patel who is also the owner of Nirma detergent. Its aim to raise Rs 5,000 crore would make it the second-biggest IPO this year after Zomato’s. The last IPO of a cement company was launched in 2006 when JK Cement went public. Nuvoco Vista is the fifth largest cement company in India and the biggest in eastern India. The shares are being offered at a price band of Rs 560-570 per share. The IPO will close on August 11. According to a report by IIFL Securities, “given NVCL’s size, strong brand ownership, leadership position in the fast-growing eastern Indian market, availability of limestone mines for future expansion, and scope for improving profitability & deleveraging balance sheet, we believe valuations are reasonable. We recommend subscribing to the IPO.” Along with Nuvoco, three other IPOs are also open now. The IPO for CarTrade is for a tech-enable auto listing company while for Chemplast Sanmar, a speciality chemical company, it’s the second coming to be publicly listed after being delisted about 10 years ago. The IPO for Aptus Value Housing is for a mortgage finance company serving mid- and low-income segments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/2021-year-of-mega-fund-raise/articleshow/85223898.cms||---

Only Tamil Nadu has conducted a higher number of RT-PCR tests than Andhra Pradesh during the time. According to the Union health ministry’s data, in March, April and May combined, Andhra Pradesh screened nearly 49.1 lakh people for the infection through RT-PCR tests whereas the share of the antigen tests was only around 2.12 lakh. This translates to testing about 97% of the people through RT-PCR tests. In June and July, when the state almost exhausted its RT-PCR testing capacity of about 37 lakh, about 23.6 lakh tests were done using antigen kits. Andhra Pradesh conducted an average of one lakh Covid-19 tests daily at the presumed peak of the second wave during this time. Again in August, the RT-PCR testing coverage in Andhra Pradesh improved to 97%. The national average of RT-PCR testing share in August stands at about 57%. After overcoming difficulties caused by lack of testing facilities in the initial weeks of the outbreak in February-March last year, the state ramped up its testing capacities. Andhra Pradesh currently has 66 RT-PCR testing facilities, including the private ones. There are 62 Truenat labs in the government sector and one in the private sector. The state leveraged various testing modalities and mechanisms to improve its daily testing numbers in the first wave. At one point last year, about 120-state owned Vera and APSRTC buses served as mobile sample collection centres. Aggressive testing continues to remain the mainstay in the fight against the pandemic in Andhra Pradesh. The state is currently testing about 60,000 to 1 lakh Covid-19 samples a day with an average 3% case positivity rate. Andhra Pradesh is in the process of establishing 19 more RT-PCR labs to increase the reach and coverage of Covid-19 testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/no-of-rt-pcr-tests-in-ap-second-only-to-tn/articleshow/85219264.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Mumbai||New IT rules: Bombay HC seeks Centre’s reply on why interim relief shouldn’t be given||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday asked the Centre to file a short affidavit on why interim relief should not be granted, by Thursday, in two PILs which say the new IT rules will have a chilling effect on free speech. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre informed the HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni that its transfer petition was not listed before the Supreme Court and the government mentioned and has sought an early date. The Centre said 14 such challenges have been filed across various high courts, and it has sought that all matters be heard together before the SC. As he began his submissions, he cited a Madras high court order by a bench of its Chief Justice on June 23 that had issued only notice but did not pass any interim order to stay the new rules. The Madras HC had said, “Since no adverse action has been initiated against the petitioners as of now, no omnibus order is made at this stage,” but had granted liberty to the petitioners, an association of leading media companies, to seek relief if the rules are invoked against it. The HC orally suggested that if a stay is granted in the PIL and if it eventually fails, the petitioner cannot plead protection for anything written or published in the interregnum which may be in breach of reasonable restrictions, but a sword would be hanging on their heads then. “Can we think of a workable solution in the meantime,” the bench asked. To a query, Singh said replies before other HCs were under preparation and are likely to be filed soon. He sought time till Monday to file a reply, but as the CJ will be presiding before another bench next week, it was suggested that a short affidavit be filed to deal with the stay plea. The HC was hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) against the new IT rules, notified in February. One is by owner of online portal Leaflet and the other by journalist Nikhil Wagle. The new rules are called the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021. Leaflet counsel Darius Khambata said the rules will have a “draconian effect” on the people who want to put content on the internet, media, editors and publishers too. Counsel for Wagle, Abhay Nevagi, had also said it amounted to “mass censorship” and his concern was that of origin of message — directions to all social media platforms to go for an AI-based mechanism which may be misused to snoop into people’s content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-it-rules-hc-seeks-centres-reply-on-why-interim-relief-shouldnt-be-given-in-mumbai/articleshow/85226455.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Lockdown lessons in management studies||VADODARA: Lessons learnt during the lockdown will now be part of the academic syllabus. A book covering 30 case studies on how human resources professionals responded during the Covid-19 induced nation-wide lockdown is set to become part of management studies. The book — ‘Case studies of HR interventions during lockdown 2020’ — covers 30 case studies of 23 small and big firms. Vice-chancellor of Gujarat Technological University (GTU) Navin Sheth said that the book will act as a reference for all teachers who teach human resources to budding managers at management colleges under it. “We have received queries from IIT Mumbai, Gulf University and GSFC University. They want to teach these case studies to train HR students,” said Sunita Sharma, association professor of HR-Organisation Behaviour at M S University’s Faculty of Management Studies who academically edited all the case studies. “This book is best example of industry-institute partnership as envisaged by National Educational Policy 2020,” she said. The case studies were compiled after a nation-wide competition, an initiative of Vadodara HR Forum. “The case studies throw light on efforts made by HR professionals in restarting their industries/ offices during and post lockdown,” said forum’s president Sudhir Sethi. MG Motor for instance was not manufacturing vehicles during the lockdown. Instead, it had started manufacturing ventilators that were supplied to hospitals. “For this, they gave training to their employees. They empowered 21 women of nearby communities by providing sewing machines to make masks,” said Bharat Sharma, forum’s vice president. “It is now new normal but initially employees had to be trained and motivated to work from home,” said Sharma. Gujarat Gas helped authorities to manage migrant workers that were on the streets and provided them food. “There were firms like BigBasket that collaborated with local shops and rickshaw drivers to deliver goods that were falling under essential items,” said Sethi. “Our HR heroes did their best to check insecurities, hunger, stress, loneliness and created an the environment of hope and resilience in the industries,” he said. A case study of a hotel that closed despite all the efforts has also been included. Ironically, the HR professional who had submitted the study got terminated on the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/lockdown-lessons-in-management-studies/articleshow/85218005.cms||Prashant Rupera

The district administration has constituted three mobile medical teams on boats to be pressed into service from Wednesday. District magistrate (DM) Dr Chandrashekhar Singh on Tuesday said, “One mobile boat in each of the flood-hit Rampur diara in Danapur, Nakta diara in Patna Sadar and Kala diara in Bakhtiyarpur with necessary medicines, test equipment, paramedical staff and also the vaccines against the Covid pandemic would remain available from 10am to 5pm. Medicines against snakebite, dog and other insect bites will also be available in all primary health centres for emergency use.” He said the Dardha river water in Dhanarua area was receding fast. However, 85 families living in low-land in Dhanarua and 319 families in Bind Toli on the bank of the Ganga were still facing problems. The administration has started distributing polythene sheets and other necessary items among them. Process has also been initiated to identify the affected people for providing compensation at the rate of Rs6,000 per family. The DM said while a team of NDRF was stationed at Bakhtiyarpur, another of state disaster response force (SDRF) has been kept on alert mode at Gai Ghat. “All SDOs, SDPOs, circle officers and block development officers have been put on alert and directed to provide help to people in any emergency situation.

---||Madurai||Banyan tree’s aerial roots protected with PVC pipes||Madurai: The residents of Sellur in Madurai, have taken special efforts to protect a 100-year-old banyan tree, which is the only remaining tree of its kind in their region. They have covered the aerial roots of the tree with PVC pipes so that children don’t swing on them and cause damage, Founder of the Neernilaigal Paathukappu Iyakkam, R Abu Bakker, said he remembered huge banyan trees bordering the supply channels of the Sellur tank in his region, when he was a small boy. However, as the area started developing, the trees were also removed as part of developmental activities.“A few years ago, one of the two trees which was about 20 feet tall, started dying because some people poured acid and chemicals on the roots, he said. This tree now stands very precariously and has to be uprooted for the safety of the people. Even a decade ago, there were over 10 banyan trees, and now there is a lone tree standing over 35-feet tall, which Abubakker and his friends are trying to protect. “I celebrate a birthday, on July 27 every year, and that is to ensure that people respect and protect this tree,’’ he said.Abu Bakker said people tend to nip off the roots’ edges which damage it further, he said.These aerial roots emerge from the branches, and get rooted on the ground, this further strengthens the tree and helps it grow bigger. “There are hundreds of birds, bees, insects and even animals which inhabit this tree, which is like a mini forest on its own,’’ he said.Agriculture Engineer, C P Ravi, who is guiding the residents on the protection of their only banyan tree, says that the PVC pipes filled with soil if watered and maintained for just 45 days, with care would guide the roots into the soil and after that the pipes can be cut-off. “The chances of survival of the root is much greater in this method, and we tried it with one root, which was successful. If we manage to do it with the existing seven to eight aerial roots of this tree, it would go a long way in protecting this tree,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/banyan-trees-aerial-roots-protected-with-pvc-pipes/articleshow/85220748.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||AP HC begins final hearing on power purchase agreements||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Tuesday commenced the final hearing in a batch of petitions filed by renewable energy companies having power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the state government. The power companies had moved the high court challenging the single judge order directing them to negotiate the power tariffs with Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulation Commission (APERC). The government, through a GO in 2019, had constituted a price negotiation committee to review power tariffs in the state. It proposed to reduce power tariffs as per prevailing market prices and formed the committee to negotiate the same with power generation companies. The power companies moved the high court challenging the GO, contending that the PPAs cannot be reviewed as they were finalised through a competitive bidding. They also argued that formation of the price negotiation committee was in violation of Electricity Act. Considering the arguments, the high court set aside the GO and directed the companies to negotiate power tariffs with the APERC. The court also directed to pay the tariff derived by the state government subject to outcome of APERC proceedings over fixation of tariffs. The companies again moved appeal petitions challenging the order. Senior counsel P Sriraghu Ram, arguing on behalf of the petitioners, told the bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that the single judge erred in his judgement by not considering the fact that the tariff was derived by taking various parameters into consideration. Once the tariff order is given and PPA is made, prices cannot be changed, he said.He further argued that APERC does not have the authority to review the tariff. . The hearing will continue on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-begins-final-hearing-on-power-purchase-agreements/articleshow/85219456.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Business||Rolta to face insolvency process: NCLT||Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) dismissed last week an application seeking closure of Rolta India’s corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). A consortium of lenders to Rolta, represented by advocates Rohit Gupta and Nausher Kohli, had opposed a plea for closure of the process, saying they have an outstanding of around Rs 5,400 crore. The debt owed to them is substantial, said PSU lenders and financial creditors before the NCLT bench of judicial member Suchitra Kanuparthi and member (technical) Chandra Bhan Singh. They said withdrawal of CIRP would only lead to multiplicity of proceedings against the corporate debtor before the tribunal, which must necessarily be avoided. The NCLT noted that 567 employees of Rolta India also have a claim of Rs 86 crore. In a detailed order, it said, “The substantial claims of financial creditors cannot be disregarded or ignored in view of the purported settlement of certain employees of the corporate debtor.” The tribunal had in May commenced the process on a plea by ex-employees seeking its initiation last year and, on May 25, Vandana Garg took charge as resolution professional (RP, an independent professional to oversee affairs of the company) of Rolta. However, subsequent to a settlement of dues of the ex-employees, an employee filed an application seeking withdrawal of the company petition. The employee said the settlement agreements were signed on May 25 with ex-employees and he had requested the RP to seek withdrawal of the insolvency proceedings. As she did not file such application “immediately”, the employee invoked a provision under the IBC to seek withdrawal of the company petition filed by some ex-employees. The financial creditors can recover their dues via the SARFAESI Act or other provisions, he said. The promoter director Kamal Singh also confirmed execution of settlement deed with 32 ex-employees who had moved NCLT. The tribunal observed that the settlement provides for major part of dues only subsequent to withdrawal of petition, providing the corporate debtor and promoter an “escape route”. Ex-director and promoters of Rolta represented by advocate Prateek Seksaria supported the withdrawal plea. Kohli said enormous public interest and public monies are involved in the matter and therefore the application for withdrawal be rejected. The resolution professional said 177 employees have claimed dues and only some are settled and “sympathy cannot override the law”. The NCLT continued the CIRP against the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rolta-to-face-insolvency-process-nclt/articleshow/85224217.cms||---

Food business operators from different areas of New Town came to attend. “This will be a month long drive. It will be checked whether the food business operators were properly following the sanitary requirements and also they will be trained to generate awareness as to how to serve safe and hygienic food, balanced food,non-adulterated and non-infected food. WE will try to cover as much as roadside and market based food stalls in New Town,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. Residents of the township said that this initiative was very much required as many such food outlets have come up in New Town and it is of utmost need to ensure that street food is served maintaining all safe and hygiene standards. To see that road side food stalls and other hawkers can do their business in a planned manner, NKDA has set up about 900 hawker rehabilitation stalls across New Town and is inviting applications from existing hawkers in the township to get allotment at the stalls at nominal rent only if the existing road side unauthorised structures are removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-food-safety-and-hygiene-drive-in-new-town-10-08-21/articleshow/85220853.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Employees of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) were found working on Sundays replacing the conventional electro-mechanical meters which have a disc that keeps rotating when electricity is consumed. Tangedco Madurai metro superintending engineer S Vennila mentioned that the digital meters would help retain data of usage which would be recorded and could also be retrieved when the need arises to find necessary data. The electricity meters in Madurai will be changed free of cost. Senthil, a worker, said that electricians like him had been given a target of changing about 350-400 meters this month. “Changing an electricity meter at a centre takes about 10 minutes or so, however identifying the people concerned takes some amount of time,” he said. One of the common illegal practices that consumers indulge is tampering with meters to ensure that it shows a lower reading than actual consumption. Some people use magnets to slow down the rotation of the disc. “Tampered data can be monitored accurately with this device. We can even trace the time and date when the meter was tampered, with digital meters,” said the superintending engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tangedco-replacing-conventional-meters/articleshow/85220790.cms||---

Maharashtra is the only state that had decided on a CET-based Class XI admission. There was strong buzz that the CET may be cancelled after non-state boards expressed their inability in contributing towards an inclusive syllabus for it. A petition in high court challenged the CET for its SSC curriculum. Though optional and open to all, CET was to be given priority in Class XI admissions. The decision to hold the CET was initially welcomed by junior colleges in the state. Sources said the state wanted to give SSC students an upper hand in admissions. The CET registration proved that more SSC students (11 lakh) had registered than non-SSC students (one lakh). After the 100-mark paper based on English, Maths, Science and Social Science was challenged in court, the state tried to bring in additional subjects such as General Knowledge (GK) , Logical Reasoning (LR) and Quantitative Reasoning (QR). “We thought of keeping English compulsory and allowing students to choose from the remaining six subjects. But it was too late as the state-appointed committee was clueless about incorporating additional questions,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-to-take-a-call-on-whether-to-contest-cet-order-in-sc/articleshow/85227536.cms||---

The project will be undertaken at a cost of Rs 81.25 crore. Under the project, the JDA will construct two-lane 400-metre-long underpass between Sabzi Mandi and Tond Road to provide swift vehicular movement in West-South direction. Along with this, a dedicated subway will be constructed to provide safe access to pedestrians. The civic body has also proposed a facade development in the area along with freedom fighters sculptures. An official said the project was the need of the hour as Laxmi Mandir is three legged intersection acts as one of the major exchange points for many public transport users. “Due to increase in traffic from the Bais Godam, Gandhi Nagar and Gopalpura, long queues are observed during the signal timings towards all these three approaches,”said an official. The state government had earlier announced to construct seven junction traffic free in the state capital. In phase-1 , the facelift of Laxmi Madir will be done by the agency. Earlier, on Tonk Road, the (JDA) gave approval to construct a six-lane 400-metre long underpass at B2 bypass junction. The construction of the underpass is proposed to be perpendicular to Tonk Road, which will lead to faster and smoother movement of vehicles in East-West direction. The estimated cost of the project will be approximately Rs 155 crore and the civic body had given administrative and financial (A and F) approval for traffic improvement and beautification work at B2 bypass junction in the previous project works committee meeting (PWC). An official said, “After the feasibility report, work of these junctions were approved by the Urban Housing and Development minister Shanti Dhariwal. Following this, detailed project report was prepared and submitted. After few corrections and modifications, administrative and financial approval was provided.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-will-build-two-lane-underpass-worth-rs-81cr-at-laxmi-mandir-junction/articleshow/85223354.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘We need to talk about mental health, normalise it’||Olympic medalist and ace shooter, Gagan Narang, answers queries from TOI readers on strengthening India’s sports infrastructure, role that schools can play in nurturing talent and importance of sports psychologistsQ. I am 35-years-old and work as an associate professor in a medical college. Can I start professional training in shooting at this age? What would be my challenges? -- Yadukul S A. Pistol shooter Abhishek Verma was 29 years old when he made his debut for India. P N Prakash was 40 when he played at the Rio Olympics in 2016. Unlike other sports, age poses relatively less challenges in shooting. So, I would say you are never too old to start shooting. Q. What should be done to improve the performance of Indian athletes in every sport and also improve our medals tally in the Olympics? What changes/measures must be rolled out at the government level? – V Nagendra Kumar A. Our government and national federations are working towards the development of sports in the country and seven medals, including a gold at the Tokyo Games, are proof of the fact that we are heading in the right direction. But we can’t leave everything for the government to do. We, as citizens, should also do our bit to make sports popular. We should take our kids out to sports fields and academies and introduce them to various sports. This will create a sporting culture, which eventually will make us a strong sporting power in the world. Q. Is monetary constraint a primary reason for a lot of talented individuals shying away from pursuing sports as a career? Is there something being done to address this? – Krishank Rathi A. Financial assistance is important for an athlete to grow. But I wouldn’t say this is the only reason that stops a talented player from taking up sports as a career. If you are talented and willing to work hard and walk the extra miles, you can get sponsors to support your sport. Central and state governments are coming forward to help talented sportspersons. Q. Could you please throw some light on the procedures involved for setting up a sports facility? - Manoj Kanjani A. Setting up a sporting facility largely depends on the space available along with various other factors like who is the target audience and if the sporting facility is for grassroots, intermediate or elite level. Whether it is a charitable venture or self-sustaining. Location and proximity to the city are also important factors to consider. Q. There is a lot of focus on the mental health of athletes these days. But are there any facilities available to them, to strengthen their mental health? For instance, I have not seen anything like a meditation room available at any ground in Hyderabad. Can you tell us, how else can we work on this? – Vishwanathan Peri A. This is one area where we need to work a lot. I feel, barring some academies and elite athletes, sportspersons don't have access to sports psychologists. We should also have dedicated centres where sportspeople can go and consult psychologists when they feel the need for it. As sportspersons, we need to acknowledge the fact that pressure can take its toll, and everybody is vulnerable to mental pressure. We need to come out in the open and talk about mental health and the importance of normalising it. I will soon do something in this area. Q. I want to train my 15-year-old son in shooting. Can you please tell me about beginner's courses available in Hyderabad, what are the training schedules like (and duration) and what kind of expenses I'd need to incur? -- Dev PrasadA. We at our academy, Gun for Glory, offer training to beginners. While some years ago, shooting was considered an expensive sport, we have tried to make the sport affordable and offered training to talented young kids. At our academy, we believe in supporting a talented sportsperson by all means. So, I would request you to take your kid to our academy and we will take care of the rest. Q. How important do you think it is to ensure that budding sportspersons are allowed to shift their focus entirely on their game, from academics, at an early stage? But does that happen here? We are still so academics-oriented. -- P V RaoA. Both academics and sports are equally important for a child’s overall development. We need to do an honest assessment of the child’s ability and guide her/him on the career of his/her choice. It was never easy to take up sports as a career choice some years ago, but today, it is becoming one of the most-preferred choices. Q. What measures do you think schools can take to develop sports infrastructure? – Adithya Komatineni A. I feel schools can play the most important role in developing sports in the country. Each school should offer some sport to their students. Not all can have a football or a cricket field, but they can have a shooting range, as it takes only a 10x15meter room to develop a shooting range, where students can be trained, while they study at the same place. Q. Do you think the lack of enough ‘idols’ in Olympic sports (barring a few disciplines) is a reason why a lot of children are not interested in taking them up? Something that works in the case of cricket, for instance. – Sumithra D A. I feel, over the years, we now have enough role models or ‘idols’ who have inspired youngsters for generations. It depends on how you look at success. For me, a Bhawani Devi becoming the first Indian to represent the country in fencing at the Olympics is a huge inspiration. Q. Why do you think only some states are managing to produce ace sportspersons? What are they doing right that the rest aren't? -- Shantanu SenA. Different states have different policies. States like Manipur and Assam are blessed with brilliant boxers and weightlifters, while a state like Haryana has been producing amazing wrestlers. All states have talented youngsters. Those who can identify their strengths and start working on them, get to see the results too. We need to find out our strengths and sport where we can excel. Once we do that, improving facilities for those sports at the grassroots level should be the next step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/we-need-to-talk-about-mental-health-normalise-it/articleshow/85223323.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two foreigners hid cocaine worth Rs 18 crore in tummy||MUMBAI: In two separate cases of drug seizures, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) have arrested two foreign nationals with around 2kg of cocaine worth Rs 18 crore that they brought into the country inside their bodies. In the first case, the DRI on August 5 intercepted a Tanzanian national who arrived in Mumbai on Ethiopian Airways from Dar-es-Salam via Addis Ababa. The DRI officials intercepted the woman passenger, identified as Kitwana Wardah Ramdhani. When she was checked in the presence of a gazetted officer, capsules wrapped in a condom were found hidden in her undergarment. The capsules had a white powder that a field test kit indicated was cocaine. She was produced before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate and permission was sought to conduct a medical examination. X-ray screening confirmed the presence of foreign objects in her stomach. “From August 5 to 8 she purged 65 capsules containing the white colour powder purported to be cocaine and on weighing a total 810 grams of cocaine valued at Rs 8 crore was recovered from her,” said an official. NCB officials on Sunday intercepted a Mozambique national, Fumo Zedequias, at the airport and recovered around 1kg of South American cocaine worth Rs 10 crore. The suspect was interrogated and was found to have swallowed around 70 capsules filled with cocaine. The suspect revealed that he was feeling uncomfortable and requested medical help. At JJ Hospital, he was purged of 70 capsules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-foreigners-hid-cocaine-worth-rs-18cr-in-tummy/articleshow/85223387.cms||Ahmed Ali

The Law Commission chairman Justice AN Mittal would hand over the draft to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for its implementation. Justice Mittal told TOI that he sought time from the CM office a few days back and would hand over the bill draft to the chief minister soon. The commission had received over 8,500 suggestions from the general public, including former civil servants, judges and lawyers. Around 40, or less than 0.5%, of these respondents were against the bill. The remaining came up with suggestions about modification, clarification or addition. The exercise to vet the suggestions has been completed, sources in the law commission said. After sifting through the suggestions, the commission divided them into 53 categories, with each category having all the suggestions of similar nature under it. A majority of suggestions spoke about barring those violating the proposed Population Control Act from contesting even the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections, while the commission has already recommended debarring such violators from contesting local bodies elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/law-panel-to-give-cm-draft-of-population-control-bill/articleshow/85226457.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Party leaders said the backward caste leadership including nine MLAs, office-bearers and members of OBC Welfare Cell of Punjab Congress along with prominent members of the backward caste community from every district of Punjab took part in the interactions. There are 10 Congress MLAs from the OBC category but there is no representation in the cabinet. The state has a backward class population of 31%, said a party leader. The meeting was organised by working president Sangat Singh Gilzian with assistance of Punjab Congress OBC Welfare Cell chairman Gurinder Singh Billa. “During the discussions, the leaders highlighted problems being faced by the community at the ground level, including bottlenecks in welfare schemes for the backward caste community of Punjab. Many leaders voiced lack of representation of backward castes in the government. Issues of reservations and labour welfare were especially stressed upon by many leaders,” said a party leader.

The police said that the first FIR was filed by Kishan Kumar Singh (60), a resident of the Khatipura area. Singh in his FIR alleged that cyber scammers bilked Rs 1,48,000 from his account on the pretext of a refund for travel booking. “The victim had booked a ticket for Udaipur, he had planned to go there on Sunday. But he made a mistake and tickets were booked for Monday. To correct the same error, he searched for a helpline number online. The dubious helpline number connected him to cyber crooks. The accused stole the money by promising to refund the ticket amount,” an official said. The police said that the accused had tricked the elderly into downloading an application on his phone. The application allowed the criminals to remotely access the victim’s mobile phone. They swiftly bilked lakhs of rupees and disconnected the phone. The second incident was reported on Sunday when an official posted at the human rights commission was duped for Rs 55,000. “The accused in the case had used a similar remote access application to bilked the money from a mobile payment app,” an official said. The police said that they have filed an FIR into both cases and an investigation was underway. “The police teams are examining the phone numbers and applications that were used in frauds,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-cyber-fraud-cases-filed-at-vaishali-nagar-police-stn/articleshow/85226456.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Despite 304 Covid deaths of staff, no frontline worker tag for MSRTC workforce||Aurangabad: As many as 304 staffers of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) have died due to Covid-19 during the current pandemic so far, prompting the need for speedy vaccination for the workforce of the state public transport utility. Around 55,516 MSRTC staffers have so far been vaccinated which comes to only around 56% of the total workforce. The lower percentage of vaccination coverage is attributed to no frontline worker tag for the employees and staffers of the state public transport utility to date despite rendering services in the public interest. MSRTC official spokesperson said a total of 8,960 MSRTC staffers have been infected due to Covid-19 so far, of which, 8,515 have cured from the viral infection and 141 are still undergoing treatment. Union leader Shrirang Barge of Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress said the vaccination programme among MSRTC workforce was moving at a slower pace as compared to other public utilities. “It is ironic that MSRTC staffers are still not considered as frontline workers despite delivering crucial duties by risking their lives. The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), among other public utilities, have already crossed the 90% vaccination mark. On the other hand, official apathy has left many drivers and conductors among other staff of MSRTC still away from vaccination,” he said. Barge added that the proactive efforts by division-level authorities in arranging vaccination camps and facilitating a sick leave for one-day post vaccination were also needed to boost immunization drive covering MSRTC workforce. When contacted, MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe said the workforce of the state transport utility was not prioritized anywhere in the official vaccination policy of the state government. “While staffers from other public utilities were considered as frontline workers and started receiving does on a priority basis, such was not the case with our workforce. Only when the vaccination for 18-year and above was started, MSRTC employees and staff have started getting the jabs,” he said, adding that efforts were on to increase the vaccination coverage. When contacted transport minister Anil Parab said the services of the state transportation were disrupted during the pandemic , which caused issue in awarding front line worker tag to MSRTC workforce. "We are engaged in ensuring speedy vaccination," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/despite-304-covid-deaths-of-staff-no-frontline-worker-tag-for-msrtc-workforce/articleshow/85216608.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Goa||PADS ON, STICK IN HAND||Dominic Lobo saved his best for last. Guarding Central Railways’ goal against Air India in the Bombay Hockey Association’s Super League, the city’s highest club-level competition, Lobo didn’t allow anything go past him. The star-studded opponents tried as hard as they could, but the keeper guarded the goal fiercely to help his team stay on top. As Central Railway teammates rushed towards him for a deserving pat on the back, Lobo hurried out of the ground, picked up his kit bag and never returned. “It was a tough decision to quit hockey (at just age 24) and move to Oman,” says Lobo, whose team dropped points and the title once he left in 1982. “Those days there was no money in the game, I was being sidelined (for the national team) and I had to do something. I just decided to take up a job abroad.” Lobo had moved to Mumbai five years earlier for better prospects after winning the Jivbadada Kerkar award – highest recognition for sports in Goa – while still in his teens. He was a prominent footballer in the state, also champion athlete, and, more importantly, the first home-grown player to represent India in hockey. In 1975, when his name was included among India juniors, he was the cynosure of all eyes in Goa. There have been plenty of ‘Goans’ who have played hockey at the highest level, even won gold at the Olympics. But all of them were either born outside the state or migrated to places like Mumbai where they learnt the game and prospered. Lobo, now 63, was different. Born and brought up in Parra, he went to school at St Anthony’s in Guirim, and it was here that he took to sports like fish to water. It helped that his uncle, Visitacao, was among the handful of Goan footballers to have represented the country in the late sixties. He took him to football matches wherever he went. Love blossomed. “Football came naturally and at St Anthony’s (high school) we had some really fine players. It surprised nobody that we won the Subroto Mukherjee Cup for three years in a row (1972-74),” says Lobo, who captained the team in his final year at school. Lobo was a bright footballer, representing the state at the junior level, but not as great as his famous uncle who was among Goa’s greatest strikers. Then, out of the blue, things changed. “I don’t remember exactly if the goalkeeper was missing or he was unwell, but I know that I was asked to guard the goal without ever playing the game,” says Lobo. That was the first time he held a hockey stick. St Anthony’s triumphed in Nehru Cup hockey that year (1974) and earned a trip to Delhi. They were decent in the Capital with Lobo standing tall. Those saves and narrow margins of defeat didn’t go unnoticed. When Lobo did even better at the Junior Nationals in Pune, the selectors could no longer ignore him. Lobo found himself among India’s best young hockey players travelling to Europe in 1975. No home-grown Goan had made it to the national team. Here he was in the company of players who were bristling with talent. The team that toured West Germany, Spain and France had Merwyn Fernandis, Surinder Singh Sodhi and Gurmail Singh, all of whom won gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Syed Jalalludin, Olympian in 1984, and Robert Claudius, who played at the World Cup just three years later, were also prominent names. Son of three-time Olympic gold medallist Leslie Claudius, Robert died in a road accident, aged just 18, following his return from the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. “We had a great team and did very well on the tour, including playing on artificial turf for the first time (in France),” recalls Lobo. With such a great start to his career, everyone expected Lobo to go far. But limited infrastructure and training held him back. Lobo soon packed his bags for Mumbai and played both football and hockey for Central Railway where he was employed. “You know how it works with selections. I had many incidents with selections, there were lot of problems. I wasn’t called for camps and never made it to the national team (again),” says Lobo, who remembers the coaching efforts of Redento de Sousa at the Peddem sports complex in Mapusa. Lobo may not have scaled greater heights in hockey since that memorable tour of 1975 but he did what nobody could at the time: represent India in hockey, learning the game on uneven turfs in football-obsessed Goa.

---||Jaipur||Same stream students to get weightage in PG depts||Jaipur: Rajasthan University has decided to reserve 80% seats in its postgraduate (PG) departments for students who have completed undergraduation (UG) in the same subject. The move is aimed at restricting the trend in which more science students are opting for humanities in PG departments than those who have studied social science subjects. The entrance test in the PG departments, which did not happen last year and this year too, had allowed more non-subject students to enter the subjects. “In sociology department alone, around 60% comes from other streams – science and commerce — due to the entrance system. The criteria were 30% weightage of UG scores and 70% of the entrance exam. Those coming from science and commerce backgrounds have an upper edge as they score high in UG and lead well in entrance exams also,” said Rashmi Jain, head of department, sociology, RU. She added that the rule was fair, but it was realised that those coming from non-subject background doesn’t excel in the subject and very few of them take up research work in the subject concerned. “Primarily, they eye for civil services and pursue humanities subjects, which are popular for competitive exams,” said Jain. The trend is noticeable in subjects like political science, history, geography and psychology. The admission committee realised since the admissions in PG is purely based on UG scores, it would hamper the students of humanities greatly. They have set the cap of 20% of non-subject students to maintain a balance in the classroom. Evaluating the decision, Puneet Sharma, a higher education expert, said the primary objective of a master’s degree in any subject is to churn out students who could take up research work or go beyond the master’s degree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/same-stream-students-to-get-weightage-in-pg-depts/articleshow/85223417.cms||---

While Day-1 saw submission of 450 admission forms, thousands of others failed to submit because of poor server speed. The admission process for 9,000 seats started on August 9 and will continue till August 19. The first cut-off list will be announced on August 25. Barmer resident Sohan Jangid, who is in Jaipur for admission to Maharaja College, is in a fix. He deposited registration fees, but technical glitch failed to generate the admission form. “The speed is so slow that it took almost 2 hours to deposit the fees and by the time it was to generate the admission form, the site became unresponsive,” said Jangid. RU is expecting over 30,000 forms to be filed till the last date. Those coming from remote areas and who are not well versed with the online admission process are facing problems. In most cases, students are finding it difficult to receive NET ID and password on their registered email id. Mohan Meena, a resident of Jaipur, said the university website is not mobile-friendly making it very difficult to follow the instructions. “Ideally, the website should have both the desktop version and mobile version. Majority of the students doesn’t have access to laptops,” said Meena, who after repeated attempts have successfully generated the admission form. TOI called up SL Sharma, admission coordinator of RU, for update on the admission process, but he was not available for comments. Nirmal Choudhary, a self-proclaimed student leader who is running a campaign of helping students in admissions, said this had become a yearly phenomenon. “The RU has its department of Infonet, which is equipped with high-tech machines and tools required to handle the admission process. The failure shows that they don’t have the right people to do the job. I would prefer that they should outsource the admission process to an agency,” said Choudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tech-glitches-put-brakes-on-ru-admission-process/articleshow/85223381.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Captain’s I-Day on Sidhu’s turf||Amritsar: Despite uneasy relations with his cabinet colleagues from Majha, why did CM Amarinder Singh choose this Punjab region to be his Independence Day flag hoisting venue, if not for political reasons? Sources said he will have two programmes in the city, one of those being in the Amritsar East assembly constituency of state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, where the CM was likely to hand over appointment letters to 34 relatives of those who died in the 2018 Dussehera rail accident at Jaura Phatak. He could also make an announcement to assuage the hurt setiment due to the desecration of the Sikh holy book in Punjab. Once his unconditional supporters, strong Jat leaders Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Partap Singh Bajwa, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, and Navjot Singh Sidhu distanced from Amarinder over time, leaving a new lobby of Hindu, Scheduled Caste, and Backward Class Congressmen from Majha to throw their weight behind Captain. These new loyalists include cabinet minister O P Soni, Amritsar Improvement Trust chairman Dinesh Bassi, and Scheduled Caste representative Raj Kumar, besides old supporters Braham Mahindra and Vijay Inder Singla. In the past, Amarinder had appointed former Amritsar South Congress MLA Harjinder Singh Thekedar as chairman of the Backward Classes Land Development and Finance Corporation (BACKFINCO), since he claims to have the backing of Backward Class suniara voters. Under an official programme, the CM will unfurl the national flag in Amritsar on August 15. Amritsar senior deputy mayor Raman Bakshi said Captain’s visit appeared to have political purposes beyond just hoisting the national flag but he couldn’t share those details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/captains-i-day-on-sidhus-turf/articleshow/85223435.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Lucknow||Rivers in Uttar Pradesh cross danger mark at several places||LUCKNOW: The mighty Ganga and the Yamuna are not relenting. At seven monitoring sites in the state the Ganga was flowing above the danger mark on Tuesday. What may add to the dismay, the Ganga continued to rise at six of these sites, including Phaphamau, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Ballia. The seventh monitoring site where it was swelled up, but ebbing was Kachla bridge (Budaun). Another site where the Ganga was recorded below the danger mark on Tuesday, but was threatening because of the rising trend was Garhmukteshwar (Hapur). The level of the Ganga water was monitored at 13 sites in UP on Tuesday by the state irrigation and water resources department. The river was recorded highest at Ballia where it was flowing about two metres above the danger mark. At Ghazipur, it was 1.1 metre above the danger mark. The respite was that the river was stable at Kanpur Dehat, Bulandshahr and Farrukhabad and receding at Rae Bareli, Kanpur Nagar, Budaun and Kannauj. What could be a respite for the people of the state is that the Sharda and the Ghaghra, so far, have not assumed dangerous proportions. The Sharda rises menacingly every year, but till now it has not joined the Ganga and the Yamuna in wreaking havoc. It was flowing 0.1 metre above the danger mark at Palia Kalan (Lakhimpur Kheri) on Tuesday, but the water level was stable. At Shardanagar, another monitoring site for the river’s water level, it was rising, but flowing 0.4 metres below the danger mark. Though the Ghaghra was also maintaining the rising trend, it was flowing 1.5 metres below the danger mark at BK Ghat monitoring station (Bahraich). Elgin bridge at Barabanki, another site that gets submerged every year during floods, had the Ghaghra water receding on Tuesday. The monitoring report of the Yamuna on Tuesday showed it had breached the danger mark more severely than the Ganga at places where its water level was monitored, but at the four of the five sites, where it was flowing above the danger mark, the river had started receding. The Yamuna water level was monitored at12 sites in UP on Tuesday. The sites where it was flowing above the danger mark were Auraiyya, Kalpi (Jalaun), Hamirpur, Chilla Ghat (Banda) and Naini (Prayagraj). It was recorded flowing 4.3 metres above the danger mark at Kalpi, 3.6 metres above the danger mark at Auraiyya, 2.8 metres above the red mark at Hamirpur, 2.3 metres above the threat mark at Chilla ghat and 0.6 metres above the danger mark at Naini. The river was ebbing at all sites except Naini. The Yamuna’s water level was stationary at Agra and Mathura and receding at Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat. Another river, that was assuming dangerous proportions on Tuesday, was Ramganga which was rising at Moradabad and Shahjahanpur though it continued to flow below the danger mark. “The rivers are interlinked. If Ganga reports floods its tributaries would swell too,” said a flood control room staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rivers-cross-danger-mark-at-several-places/articleshow/85226487.cms||Neha Shukla

The police said that the accused could not cut open the ATM completely due to which no money was looted. “Prima facie it appears that the accused used some tools like a rod and axe to break through the ATM’s cash box,” said ACP (Ramganj), Sunil Kumar Sharma.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ministerial panel recommends school reopening from August 16||JAIPUR: The five-member ministerial committee for reopening of schools submitted its report to chief minister Ashok Gehlot stating that schools for higher classes can reopen from August 16. The report was finalised at a meeting held here on Tuesday. One member has recommended reopening of schools from September 1 saying by then one will have a better idea on the chances of the third wave. The figure says 30,000 schools will open in Phase-1 for 45 lakh students. As per the ministry of education data 2019-20, the state has a total of 1.79 crore students studying in 1,06,240 schools. Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra told TOI, “The committee after taking experts view into consideration has submitted the final report to the CM. The report includes the projected dates, standard operation procedures and views of experts.” Sources told TOI that the committee had recommended that schools be opened in phases. “The senior classes either from 10 to 12 or 11 and 12 will reopen in the first phase. A roster system will be in place for schools where the entire class cannot be adjusted because of social distancing norms,” said the source. The committee discussed several aspects related to reopening like a projection of Covid cases, the third wave, preparedness of schools, transport system and contingency plans in case of an outbreak. The technical expertise related to Covid was provided by principal of SMS Hospital Dr Sudhir Bhandari and Dr Virendra Singh. Also, the SOPs of states that have already reopened schools were studied and institutions like AIIMS and ICMR were consulted to frame SOPs by the ministerial committee. “The reopening of schools at one go was ruled out since the ministers were of the view to see response/repercussions of reopening of schools in the first phase,” said the source. Technical education minister Subhash Garg confirmed that the report had been submitted and the announcement will be made by the CM. TOI called health minister Raghu Sharma, who is chairman of the committee, but got no response. The other two members of the five-member committee include – higher education minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati and agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ministerial-panel-recommends-school-reopening-from-aug-16/articleshow/85223441.cms||---
---||Mumbai||ACB court says Maharashtra Sadan FIR filed in haste, raps probe officer||MUMBAI: In a detailed 68-page order discharging five accused, including a PWD engineer and the developer and his family in the Maharashtra Sadan scam case, the special ACB court observed that undue haste was made in lodging the FIR, and the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officer’s assessment of profit made by the developer and implied losses suffered by the state government, without taking assistance of an expert, was improper and illegal. The court said that from the chargesheet and papers, it appeared most calculations have been made by the informant Narendra Talegaonkar, who was working as ACP in ACB, Mumbai division. “Neither, he is an Architect nor, Engineer. He is not an expert,” special judge H S Satbhai said. The case concerns a contract NCP’s Chhagan Bhujbal allegedly gave a firm, K S Chamankar Enterprises, without inviting tenders in 2005 when he was PWD minister. Today, Bhujbal is again cabinet minister in the MVA government. The Enforcement Directorate conducted investigations into money laundering allegations against Bhujbal and others in a connected case. That case is pending before a special PMLA court. Those discharged on July 31 by the special ACB court were developers and architect Pravina Chamankar, Praneeta Chamankar, Prasanna Chamankar and Krushna Chamankar along with former PWD engineer Arun Devdhar. In the reasoned order made available on Monday, the court said, “The investigating officer...(has) not verified the materials collected favouring to the accused. Only the materials favourable to the prosecution has (sic) been sent along with the chargesheet. From the facts revealed in the documents obtained by accused No. 11 (Prasanna Chamankar) under Right to Information Act, it is appearing that the material of sterling quality has been withheld by the investigating officer.” The court said it was the investigating officer’s duty to evaluate two sets of documents and materials collected and, if required, to exonerate the accused at the stage of investigation itself, keeping in mind the right of accused to fair process of investigation. The court said though the investigating officer should have taken assistance of deputy director (building and communication department), a private architect was appointed whose report was neither satisfactory nor reliable. It said the architect, an “expert valuer”, submitted his report on June 9, 2015, but prior to that, on June 4, 2015, relying on his report, permission to register the crime was sought, where points of the report were mentioned. “Prima-facie, it goes to show that a farce was created of making an appointment of the architect on June 30, 2015 and prior to that a favourable and convenient report to suit the allegations was sought from him. When indeed the appointment of architect was on dated June 30, 2015, registering of FIR on June 11, 2015 on the basis of his opinion report, goes to show the ill intention in lodging the FIR by informant Narendra Talegaonkar,” the court said. The court further said that as sought, the opinion of PWD concluding there was no illegality in the contract and that feasibility report was prepared as per prevailing rules and practice followed in PWD was received in December 2015, by which time the FIR was already filed. “It goes to show that undue haste was made in lodging the FIR. The informant and the other officers of ACB did not feel it necessary to wait for the opinion of PWD,” the court said. It said even a chartered accountant was not appointed despite a need expressed by the DCP, ACB, in a report to the additional CP, ACB, in December 2014. The court said until May 2015, there was no grievance or complaint of anyone that any loss has been occasioned to the state due to awarding of contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/acb-court-says-maharashtra-sadan-fir-filed-in-haste-raps-probe-officer/articleshow/85226536.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Malls may reopen, longer hours likely for restaurants in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Restaurants in Mumbai may be allowed to operate for extended hours soon, possibly till 8pm or 10pm. Shopping malls too are likely to see a decision in favour of reopening in coming weeks, though food courts may remain shut for a while. The opening up of more sectors was discussed in detail in a late-evening meeting held by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with members from the state Covid taskforce, paediatric taskforce and public health officials on Monday. Sources said the taskforce has green-signalled more concessions for restaurants and malls with some restrictions on timings that are being worked out. "There was a line of thought to allow malls to open up only when their employees are fully vaccinated, but the shortage of vaccines and the 84-day gap between doses makes it unviable. A thought is being given on whether only fully vaccinated people should be allowed in malls. A final decision will be taken soon," said an official. A decision on reopening places of worship was deferred as it is feared that with festivals approaching, there could be unmanageable crowds on their premises. "There is no way to control the crowds at famous religious places and so it was decided to push back its re-opening by a few months," said a senior official. In the meeting on Monday, a discussion on the potential third wave and requirement of health infrastructure. especially oxygen supply, was held. The issue of reopening cinema halls and theatres was also part of the discussion. They may not be allowed to resume soon but the taskforce will be creating SOPs for safe functioning of closed spaces. Sources said the state will see more sectors unlocking in coming weeks, but in phases. “It won’t happen all at one go since opening everything at the same time could accelerate the third wave. There will be some relaxation every 15 days which will be granted looking at the positivity rate and vaccination numbers,” one of the experts said. The taskforce has emphasised on complete vaccination of restaurant staff in order to make their workplaces safe. Besides full vaccination, the taskforce has in the past said that restaurants must minimise use of air-conditioning, keep doors and windows open for ventilation, install exhausts in washrooms. The occupancy may be kept at 50% but that too continues to be under discussion. “Since masks are down at restaurants, the emphasis is more on complete vaccination,” said another expert. The state taskforce has submitted protocols for reopening to the public health department that will deliberate on them and release the final orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malls-may-reopen-longer-hrs-likely-for-restaurants/articleshow/85223488.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Surat||Two children on way to school run over by SUV||Rajkot: In a tragic incident, two children, aged 14 years and four years, were crushed to death by a recklessly speeding SUV near Porbandar town on Tuesday. Aarti Gohel and her four-year-old cousin brother Mit Gohel were walking to an informal street school run by their community in Degam village, 15 km from Porbandar, at around 8:30am. Barely minutes after they left the house, a speeding SUV rammed them from behind. Such was the impact that Aarti was flung nearly 15 feet in the air and she and Mit died on the spot. The car driver, Sajid Nazir Hussian Kathiri, then lost control over the steering wheel and crashed the vehicle into the wall of a community hall. He, however, managed to escape from the spot. Police arrested Kathiri, 26, a resident of Gandhi Park in Porbandar. The car was registered in his father Nazir's name. They use to rent this car to earn a living. Bagvadar police said another five-year-old girl Khushali Gohel, who was also going with the kids, suffered serious injuries and is under treatment in a Porbandar hospital. Police have also got CCTV footage of the incident which showed he was recklessly speeding. Aarti's mother saw the accident happening and rushed to save the children, but there was hardly anything she could do. After the accident, the car driver tried to escape from the spot but lost control over the steering and crashed into the community hall's wall. He abandoned the car at the spot and escaped from the spot. “We have identified the car's owner and we will soon nab him and the accused. We have booked the accused under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder),'' Hardevsinh Gohil, police sub-inspector, Bagvadar, told TOI. Sources said that Aarti's father Ramesh had died of Covid-19 a few months ago. Mit's father Nilesh is a barber.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-children-on-way-to-school-run-over-by-suv/articleshow/85218179.cms||---

The citizen reporter complained that overflowing sewage had been haunting locals for several weeks before that and as a result, the area also started witnessing a rise in mosquito menace and stench. “Although we were facing the issue for a long time, we did not know if we had to contact the GHMC or the water board. But soon after it was published, the issue was resolved within a short period. Finally, the stretch is now free of stench, mosquitoes and overflowing sewage. I thank TOI and officials for addressing our grievance,” said Krishna Kalluri. According to locals, the problem was affecting not only the residents but also pedestrians and commuters who take the route on a regular basis. “It was not possible to cross the stretch without covering your nose. The pedestrians were forced to wade through the pool of sewage every time they passed through this colony. Now, they have been finally relieved of it,” Rajeshwar Rao, a resident of Alkapuri colony. “However, we were informed by the GHMC staff that the issue is due to pipelines that outlived their lifespan. We have asked the officials to change the pipelines soon so that we don’t have to face this problem again,” said Rao. When contacted, GHMC assistant engineer for RK Puram ward said, “We have repaired the drain for now and sent a proposal to the higher authorities for remodeling the drain works in the area. Since, the sewerage works are being handed over to the water works department, they will take care of it, once they receive an approval.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/respite-from-sewage-overflow-for-rk-puram/articleshow/85223426.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Restaurants raise pitch for extending working hours||Aurangabad: The owners of hotels and restaurants from Aurangabad have reiterated the demand for further easing of Covid-related curbs which currently mandate them to operate till 4 pm with 50% dining capacity and parcel service thereafter. Stating that some other metro cities have allowed such eateries to open till 10 pm, Aurangabad District Hotels and Restaurants Association has pressed for extending working hours by highlighting that the daily positivity rate in Aurangabad is consistently below 1% in the recent past. “The pandemic has already broken our backbone in past one-and-a-half years due to stricter restrictions. Now even if the spread of the pandemic is contained, we are asked to work during regulated working hours. It is objectionable that such curbs are place only for Aurangabad,” association secretary Kishore Shetty said. Shetty said the owners of different hotels and restaurants have already approached public representatives from different parties seeking their help in relaxing working hours. “Owners of around 30% hotels and restaurants from Aurangabad have already decided to switch to other professionals due to mounting financial crisis. Moreover, poor farmers that supply vegetables and milk are also getting badly affected as their income depend on us,” he said, adding that there were less takers for parcel food service. Aurangabad District Hotels and Restaurants Association, which has around 250 registered members, has also accused the district administration and the city police of turning blind eye towards roadside dhabas and eateries operating beyond restricted working hours among other violations of Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/restaurants-raise-pitch-for-extending-working-hours/articleshow/85216646.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Extension work of Metro to SN Junction to be over by March 2022||KOCHI: The Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has set the revised deadlines for completing the extension of Metro service to SN Junction and Tripunithura as March 2022 and December 2022, respectively. According to the KMRL, the actual cost of the first phase of the Metro between Aluva and Pettah is 6,218 crore, which shows an escalation of more than Rs 1,000 crore from the original estimate. Kochi Metro commenced its first phase of operations from Aluva to Maharaja’s College on June 17, 2017. The work on phase I-A extension to SN Junction and phase I-B extension to Tripunithura is progressing at a fast pace, the KMRL officials said.  When phase I-A, and phase I-B is completed the Metro will cover a total area of 28km with 25 stations. The total cost of the project when the phase I-A, and phase I-B also are completed would be Rs 7,377 crore. “Our goal is to deliver an innovative and effective mobility solution for the people of Kochi by integrating different modes of transport. The excellent response from the public has conveyed the acceptance of works carried out by KMRL in the last four years,” said K R Jyothilal, managing director, KMRL. The estimated project cost of phase 1-A and 1-B, including property development is Rs 710.93 crore and Rs 448.33 crore respectively. This includes the cost for land acquisition for property developments work at Vadakkekotta and Tripunithura. The projected cost of the phase II of the Metro connecting JLN stadium and Kakkanad, which covers a distance of 11.2km, is estimated at Rs 1,957.05 crores. The total project cost, including phase I and II will be around Rs 9,334.05 crore. “The construction works in phase I-A and I-B have been progressing as per schedule in full swing to complete before the deadline though there were several hurdles due to the Covid restrictions and lockdown in the past. With strict Covid protocol and guidelines in place, the works are carried out at the site meticulously and will be completed on time,” KMRL officials said. The stare government has already accorded administrative sanction for Rs 263 crore for phase II preparatory works. The land acquisition procedures for the same are in progress. Preparatory works from Kakkanad Junction to Infopark expressway entrance is in progress and is expected to be over by December, 2021. Preparatory works from JLN Stadium to Kunnumpuram , covering a distance of 4.5km, have been conferred and are expected to be completed by December 2021, the officials said. Since July, 2021, when the Metro services resumed after the second lock down, the average ridership has increased to 22,000. “The KMRL is looking at initiating various strategies to increase ridership and non-fare revenue streams by promoting first and last mile connectivity through feeder services, promotional events and tie-ups. Generation of alternate revenue is the major focus whereby monetizing real estate assets like retail and office spaces, leasing of land and semi built-up areas and advertisements at all Metro stations is targeted. Even during this Covid period we had leased out 31,000 sqft office space with a project value amounting to Rs 30 crore,” the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/extension-work-of-metro-to-sn-jn-to-be-over-by-march-22/articleshow/85220888.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Have replaced the handshake with namaste||There are many changes that people have embraced now to adapt to the new normal -- wearing masks all the time, social distancing, eating healthy food etc. One of the changes that not only me but the world has adapted is clasping their hands together as a form of greeting instead of a formal handshake. The clasping of hands, also known as the ‘namaste', is one of the most noticeable new changes. Whenever I go out, instead of makeup I wear a mask, instead of cash I use a card, and instead of a handshake I greet people with a namaste. Little did anyone know that this old, traditional form of greeting people would save us from a deadly disease. In fact, it is said that Louis Pasteur, also known as the father of microbiology, was afraid of germs and always greeted his peers with a namaste. It took time for me to greet people with a namaste since I was used to the handshake or a hug (for those close to me). But when I slowly adopted the habit, it not only saved me time from washing my hands way too often but also my parents were happy with me using this form of greeting, thus sustaining our culture. It makes me happy too since scientifically, joining both hands and touching our fingertips together is linked to pressure points, which activates the eyes, ears and mind, thus helping us remember the person we greet for a long time. So, instead of stopping midway and trying to remember a person, just use a good old namaste! (The writer is a first-year degree student) I’m now my own hairdresser By Arusha BhattSomething that’s new often takes time to echo with what we refer to as normal. While this is very true, one of the many things I changed about my life was getting up an hour late even on weekdays for school -- 8 am instead of 7 am. Ah! What bliss. This new normal is something I have had no difficulty in getting used to. Another activity—I so wrongly thought would be a one-time whim—that has now become something that I do is: be my own coiffeuse (female hairdresser). It’s become almost a habit for me to take the scissors and give myself a new look every few months. Of course, other changes include following the SMS protocol, or in my case the (SMS)2 protocol: Social distancing, wearing a mask, sanitization, steam inhalation, making virtual connections etc. (The writer is a 13-year-old)My new learning: To be more productive By Tanya Paul GuntaganiStarting with the first wave I found myself randomly feeling scared, sad, bored and often having nothing to do. Initially, like many people my age, I watched a lot of TV and got introduced to K- drama and K- pop. At first, I watched it because of the hype but later I started to like it. After watching a lot of K-dramas I picked up a little bit of the Korean language! Then it hit me that I wasn’t being productive and couldn't sit in front of the TV all the time. So, I started to learn new things and explore new skills. I learnt painting, glass painting, fluid art and crafts from my mom. I learned baking and cooking while experimenting with food. I also recycled old waste. I jotted down my thoughts on paper and wrote stories and recited them as bedtime stories to my mom. I learnt the guitar and played happy birthday to my parents on their birthdays which came along during the lockdown days. While I scrolled through Pinterest to find inspiration I found knitting and embroidery and had to add them to my list. Since I had the time, I even solved a 2000-piece puzzle. I started to enjoy studying because I was not pressured to study. Of course, reading newspapers and comics also kept me engaged. I encourage everyone to explore new things. Maybe you just might find what you are looking for or just want to be productive. Don't limit yourself to exploring new horizons. I thank my parents who encouraged me and supported me in all that I did.

Engineers at the dam stated that from the 15% water level at the start of the monsoon season, it has now attained 34% level. Its catchment areas, including Bhilwara and Chittorgarh, are yet to receive heavy rainfall which is the reason why the dam is yet to attain good water level. TOI on Tuesday spoke to the authorities of the Jaipur Met office and Bisalpur dam to know the reasons why the dam catering to the drinking water needs of Tonk, Jaipur and Ajmer is still less than 50% filled to its full capacity. “We have had good rainfall across the state except in Bhilwara, Rajsamand and Chittorgarh where normal rainfall is only witnessed. These two districts are the catchment areas from where Bisalpur dam gets water,” said Manish Bansal, executive engineer at the Bisalpur dam. Bansal added that these three districts are actually responsible for filling up the dam. “Hopefully in the next phase these three districts will get ample rainfall to provide good water level at the Bisalpur dam,” he added. When contacted, a senior officer of Jaipur Met office on the performance of Bhilwara, Chittorgarh and Rajsamand, said, “Chittorgarh and Bhilwara during this year so far are in the normal rainfall category which means they have received minus 19% to plus 19% rainfall compared to what they had received till August 10, 2021.” According to the authorities of Jaipur Met office Chittorgarh has received a rainfall of 415.55mm till August 10, compared to 409mm of rainfall received during the year-ago period. So far Bhilwara is concerned, it has received a rainfall of 314.52mm till August 10, compared to 348.50 in the year-ago period. Likewise, Rajsamand is still in the category of deficit rainfall. “At Rajsamand the rainfall till Tuesday is 235.86 mm compared to 306.10 mm received till August 10, 2020,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bisalpur-dam-34-full-due-to-less-rain-in-catchment-areas/articleshow/85226508.cms||---

The two con men gave a specific instruction to buyer Jagdish Kumar not to remove the towel from the bird because any exposure could land him and the bird in trouble. According to Govindgarh DSP Sandeep Sarswat, Kumar was happily returning after the purchase when he stopped near a salon. “The salon owner requested Kumar to remove the cloth from the owl because he wanted to look at the rare bird. When he removed the cloth, he found that there was no owl, but a pigeon,” Sarswat said, adding that Kumar quickly rushed to the police station and filed a complaint. “The complainant claimed that he had given Rs 5 lakh to a person who promised him an owl that could be sold in the market for Rs 90 lakh. He was elated at the offer and paid the money,” Sarswat said, adding that an FIR was registered and the police teams fanned out to track down the cheaters. Police on Tuesday arrested two persons identified as Sayar Mal (21) and Bhanwar, alias Raju Bawariya (30). “The gang has a simple modus operandi. They trick unsuspecting people into believing that a good owl can be sold into the grey market for as high as Rs 90 lakh. They then hand over a bird covered in a cloth to the victim,” Sarswat told TOI. Police said investigation was underway to check if the gang had other members involved in similar criminal cases. This is the second incident of owl trading in a week in Jaipur. On Friday, Shahpura police station in a similar case had arrested Bishan Lal alias Vishnu (20) and Roshan Kumar (24), the duo had duped one person of Rs 6 lakh by offering to sell an indigenous owl that could be sold to another party for Rs 45 lakh. Jaipur rural police said they had been keeping a close watch on gangs that dupe people by selling tortoises and owls for lakhs of rupees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-pays-rs-5l-for-rare-owl-gets-small-pigeon-in-cage/articleshow/85223501.cms||---

Since May 17, more than 7.6-lakh rapid antigen tests have been conducted. Of these, 3,320 tested positive for the virus with a positivity rate of 0.4%. During the same period, 34 lakh samples tested through RT-PCR gave 1.2 lakh positive reports for the virus with a positivity rate of 3.4%. Officials said the difference was due to a rapid antigen test used for screening purposes. The state government started using rapid antigen tests under a special drive on May 17 to detect cases in every block of the state. “We have used the rapid antigen tests in rural areas for screening purposes for Covid. We started it when the second wave was almost at its peak during mid-May,” said a senior health department official. Since then, the state government has been using it in the areas sharing border with other states such as Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Officials said those entering the state from the south get tested through rapid antigen test. In Jaipur, more than 99,252 persons were tested for Covid through rapid antigen test, which is the highest in any district. Out of those samples, 240 tested positive for Covid with a positivity rate of 0.2%. In Alwar too, the health department conducted testing through rapid antigen test as they tested 50,250 samples and out of those 155 were found infected with the virus. Since, Alwar is close to Delhi and Haryana, it has used the rapid antigen test on frequent travelers crossing the state borders for work. Also, it was used in rural areas for screening purposed for Covid. “Since the test gives immediate report, it helps us in screening people,”said the official. Udaipur, which is one of the worst Covid-hit districts of the state, used the rapid antigen test aggressively. The health department tested 49,708 people and found 144 samples infected with a positivity rate of 0.3%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rapid-antigen-tests-give-positivity-rate-of-0-4-since-mid-may/articleshow/85226503.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

---||Coimbatore||17th century hero stone with two hunters found in Tirupur||TIRUPUR: A 17th century hero stone found at Periya Molarapatti village near Kundadam here stands testimony to the practise of hero stone worship prevalent in the region from the Sangam era. The 195cm wide and 95cm tall stone that depicts two heroes fighting with a tiger and a wild boar was worshipped as Vettaikarasamy (hunting deity). Director of Virarajendran Archaeological and Historical Research Centre S Ravi Kumar, who deciphered the inscriptions on the stone, said it was installed in the 17th century. “According to the inscriptions, the granite pillar was erected in Sukla year on the 18th day of Tamil month Aadi by Andiammal, daughter of Venkatanaicker of Molarapatti, and her children. They made a shelter by using kambu (millet) leaves for the roof and worshipped the stone,” Ravi said. “This stone is testimony to the fact that hero stone worship after erecting shelter was prevalent for over 2,000 years right from the Sangam era.” Purananuru, a collection of Sangam poems, has the reference of how hero stones were erected for those who laid down their lives while protecting cattle and crops from wild animals. A shelter was erected over the stone with upright poles supporting the roof and worshipped with flowers. “This hero stone is unique for the fact that it depicts two heroes. Most of them have only one,” said K Ponnusamy, a member of the centre. The hero on the left side of the stone is seen holding the mouth of the boar with his left hand and attacking it with a spear. He has the bow on his left shoulder and has a quiver on the right shoulder. The hero on the right is attacking a tiger with a spear and holding the right leg of the animal with his left hand. The heroes are wearing ornaments. “A woman is seen between the men, which is again rare in hero stones. She is holding a flower in her right hand. A small pot is also seen. There are two spots to light lamps for worship,” said C M Rameshkumar, a member of the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/17th-century-hero-stone-found-in-tirupur/articleshow/85223471.cms||---

Your brain surgery for tumour removal has started.” Brave retired Army havildar (57) Ridhmal Ram replied, “Ek dam badiya (I am perfectly fine).” The neurosurgeon asked another question, “What is your name.” Ram replied, “Ridhmal Ram.” The doctors were kept giving him commands to see if he is able to correctly listen, understand and execute them. Doctors asked him to read newspapers. Ram continued reciting mantras in four-hour long surgery. City-based hospital’s neurosurgeons removed a brain tumour from Ram, a gram sevak, who is suffering from episodes of epilepsy seizures. He is a resident of Buchawas of Taranagar in Churu district. He remained awake and recited gayatri mantra and read newspaper as the surgery was being performed. The doctors performed the unique neuro-surgical procedure known as awake craniotomy or awake brain surgery. The surgery was performed on May 6. Ram came to Jaipur on Tuesday for medical follow up. “I am fine now. Three months have passed when I had undergone the surgery. When doctors told me that they would keep me awake during the surgery and sought my consent, I did not give it a second thought and gave my consent since I am retired Army personnel, I showed no fear. The day came when surgery took place. I kept reciting vaishno devi mantras while doctors continued performing the surgery. They also asked me to read newspaper and kept talking to me,” Ram told TOI. Dr K K Bansal, senior consultant (neurosurgery) Narayana Multispeciality Hospital, who performed the surgery, said, “The brain tumour was in such an area that there were enormous chances of loss of speech and possible paralysis upon surgery. Since there was risk of loss of speech during surgery, we kept him awake by giving local anaesthesia. We gave him a newspaper to read to ensure that his speech had not affected during the surgery. Speech is a complicated process. In brain, there are representative area of each alphabet such as A, B etc. If a particular area is affected during surgery, the representative area of the alphabet gets affected and patient reads wrongly. Such as if ‘bat’ is written, he will read it as ‘at’ if their representative area of B in the brain gets disturbed. So, during the surgery, we asked him to read, so that his speech will not be lost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/patient-recites-mantra-during-op/articleshow/85226539.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Fishermen steer through rough waters||KOCHI: The trawling ban, which was lifted a week ago, is yet to bring in any large landings for most vessels which had gone for multi-day fishing. While, the first two days saw many boats returning with catches of threadfin breams, shrimps, tunas, the landing prices have dampened the spirit of many fishermen. “Due to Covid, there is no major business at the landing centres. Middlemen are buying in bulk. All small fish are going to fishmeal companies and the rest are going to market. They are buying at low amounts and selling it at high rates in the market,” said Anthony Kurishinkal, a fisherman. He said there were hardly any sardines in the landings. “We got mackerels which were sold at Rs 150-200 in the market, but were brought from fishermen at Rs 40,” he added. Most fishermen say that the auction system which was proposed by the state government last year is not functioning. There must have been less than 20 fishing days till August. With frequent weather warnings and advisories against fishing boats venturing into sea on many days, the community has been seeking a more localized weather system which would give specific warnings instead of generalized ones. “The sector is completely down and since the catch is poor, we are unable to manage the financial burden of the vessels. Also, there is no good catch. Most of the mackerels that were caught were juveniles or equivalent. Normally, by this time, we get full adult fish,” said Joseph Xavier Kalapurackal, president, all Kerala boat operators’ association. Organizations like Kerala Swatantra Matsya Thozhilali Union have put proposals like boats taking turns to go into the sea so that everybody gets an income. The government had earlier proposed an auction system that fixed the rate of the fish based on the existing market price of the day or week. This had worked out well in the fish landing centres in Ernakulam which were monitored by a joint team of Matsyafed officials, fisheries department and harbour management committee. But it has also proved futile with allegations that the middlemen were pushing boats to go into sea and most of this was being directed to fishmeal companies rather than to the markets which are now flooded with fish brought from other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fishermen-steer-through-rough-waters/articleshow/85220963.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||India||SC on Pegasus row: Can’t file PIL and debate online||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday drew the ethical boundaries for eminent citizens seeking court-monitored SIT probe into alleged misuse of military-grade spyware Pegasus by telling the petitioners that it would be improper to file PILs seeking judicial adjudication of the contentious issue and simultaneously engage in a public debate on social media. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant told the 10 petitioners - journalists N Ram, Sashi Kumar and Pranjoy Guha Thakurta, politicians John Brittas and Yashwant Sinha, and the Editors' Guild - that the court is for a detailed debate on the issue but the petitioners could not be seen engaged in parallel public debate on social media. "Whatever you want to say, you say it through affidavits. We have permitted everyone to file affidavits and bring whatever material on record. We will go through the contents of each and every affidavit. But instead of having a debate in the courtroom, there is a parallel proceeding, a parallel debate going on in social media. We are against debate. But, the issues which you have raised, which we are debating, you should not make it a point of public debate in social media," the bench said. Speaking on behalf of Justices Saran and Kant, the CJI said, "We want to say one thing. Any of the people who have come before the court with PILs, this is the message from all three of us - any of the petitioners or any one interested in saying something in the matter before the Supreme Court, we expect that they will answer whatever questions we put to them by way of a proper debate inside the court and not outside." The CJI said, "If they want to say something in social media or twitter or whatever social media platform, it is up to them. Once you (the petitioners) have come to the court, we expect the debate to take place in the courtroom. We expect that you will be answering the questions through the eminent counsel. Have some faith in the system. If they don't have faith (in the court) or don't want to answer through counsel, it is their choice. We want to say at least this much." Turning to senior advocate Kapil Sibal, the CJI said, "Mr Sibal, we respect you a lot. You have been a minister and also a seasoned parliamentarian. You know that in these matters, there has to be some discipline." Sibal said, "When the matter is in court, there should be no public statements of any nature (by the petitioners). I entirely agree with you (the CJI)." Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and all other senior advocates - C U Singh, Rakesh Dwivedi, Meenakshi Arora, Shyam Divan and Manish Tewari - fully agreed with the SC's view and said that all the petitioners would abide by the standards of discipline set by the CJI. Mehta said he would need two days to get instructions from the Union government on the issues raised by the PIL petitioners and requested the court for posting the matter for hearing on Friday. But, the CJI said he had some personal difficulty on Friday and scheduled the hearing for Monday. When Singh said the court could issue notice to the Centre for a formal reply by Monday, the CJI-led bench said it would take a call on issuance of notice to the government on Monday. The bench explained the adjudication process and said the nature of the beast is such that the Judges have to ask questions to both sides - the petitioners and the respondents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-on-pegasus-row-cant-file-pil-and-debate-online/articleshow/85228154.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

As per the complaint lodged by Gireesh Babu G, an RTI activist, the building owner constructed the first floor of the building without permit. “As per the building permit, there is only sanction to construct the ground floor. But the building owner constructed the first floor without permission. There is an unauthorized extension in the ground floor as well,” Babu said. He also alleged that the building owner encroached upon the government land. According to officials with the local body, who inspected the building based on the complaint, the building owner can give an explanation, if any. “During the inspection, we found that the owner constructed the first floor without permit. There is a parking facility on the ground floor, which also lacks authorization. So, we have served notice to the owner to pull down the unauthorized portion. We will proceed with the action only after hearing the building owner,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/order-to-demolish-portion-of-building/articleshow/85221009.cms||---

---||Goa||Before IPCC, Goa report had warned of forest fires, flooding||PANAJI: Even as the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) warned that global temperatures could possibly exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius over the next twenty years, the state action plan for climate change (SAPCC) report prepared for Goa had already rung the alarm bell that the state’s temperatures will rise by over 2 degrees Celsius in less than 15 years. Goa has submitted its report for scrutiny to the Union environment ministry, and once approved, the state will need Rs 465 crore over the next ten years to put mitigation measures in place. Apart from the possibility of sea level rise leading to displacement of coastal communities, the report has also warned of an increase in forest fires in Goa in the coming years. The floods Goa experienced last month appear to be in line with the predictions made in the SAPCC, which said that very heavy and exceptionally heavy rainfall events have gone up dramatically“Forest fire is a phenomenon that can intensify due to climate change,” the SAPCC report said. The implementation of the SAPCC mitigation measures is expected to begin this year. The mitigation strategies are set to be reviewed every three years in view of the dynamic climate change impact scenario. “Although enough documented proof is not available on whether forest fire incidents have increased in Goa due to climate change or human activities, the trend depicts the vulnerability of Goa’s forests to fires, and this can get exasperated due to climate change by 2040.” When the SAPCC was being prepared, 92 forest fires were reported in 2016-17, notes the report, as compared to only two or four fires during the previous years. The report for Goa found that mean temperatures in the state are already much higher (at 26.7 degrees Celsius) than the national average annual temperature, which is about 23.3 degrees Celsius. The floods Goa experienced last month appear to be in line with the predictions made in the SAPCC, which said that very heavy and exceptionally heavy rainfall events in the state have gone up dramatically. “The mean annual rainfall in Goa has increased by 68% over the period 1901-2015. With increasing rainfall, the inter-annual rainfall variability in the state has also increased especially since the 1970s. While mean annual rainfall in the state has increased, moderate to light rainfall days in Goa have declined over the 1901-2015 period, whereas very heavy and exceptionally heavy rainfall events in the state have increased by a dramatic more than 100%,” the SAPCC said. Once the SAPCC is approved by the Union environment ministry, the mitigation measures for Goa against climate change will begin with the setting up of a special cell in the state secretariat to exclusively work in this direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/before-ipcc-goa-report-had-warned-of-forest-fires-flooding/articleshow/85223596.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The common man is not keen to visit a police station without a reference to senior police officials. We need to change such a situation. We should be polite to citizens and hard on criminals,’’ Nagrale told a day-long crime conference, attended by senior inspectors, assistant, deputy and joint commissioners here. Justice Ramana had observed the threat to human rights and bodily integrity were highest in police stations. For Mumbai officers, crime conferences are a regular exercise, but this conference presided over by Nagrale was unique. Senior IPS officers said for the first time Nagrale had opened a dialogue with one and all, from senior PI to joint commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-day-after-cjis-rap-police-chief-tells-force-to-improve-image/articleshow/85223729.cms||---

The survey aims to identify school dropouts aged 6-18 years. The survey will be carried out till August 31.Teams of block resource teacher educators, special educators and anganwadi workers with the support of the local bodies are carrying out the survey. The survey will identify both school dropouts and those who have never got formal education in the 2,256 habitats across the district. This year, due to the pandemic, officials said that it will be a challenge to identify these children as only when textbooks are distributed and schools reopen it can be checked if a particular student is not attending school.“We have an app to help identify and streamline out-of-school students. Amid the pandemic and lockdowns, we can expect more number of school dropouts. Hence, we will be conducting the survey in an intensified manner,” said Thirugnanam N, additional district programme officer, SSA, Madurai. The official also said that this year, children, who have lost their parents to Covid-19, will also be identified. Children with special needs and children of migrants are also usually identified through the survey.This survey is carried out every year in April or May before schools are reopened.

We held elaborate discussions with health experts,” he said.Poyyamozhi said that preliminary discussions on the standard operating procedures (SOPs) were held in Chennai on Monday and will be finalised in a couple of days. Stating that SOPs were prepared last year when there were discussions to reopen schools, he added that they were being reviewed to check if anything should be added to it. “It will be finalised in a day or two and will be informed through the chief education officers,” he said. The draft document on reducing syllabus for this year is ready and would soon be signed and intimated, he added.The department is equipping government schools with adequate teachers and classrooms as there is a surge in enrolment from private schools. “We had 2,04,379 students enrolling in more than 40,000 government schools till last week as people are economically impacted by the pandemic. While around 20 to 40 students enrolled in many schools, in some schools the strength has more than doubled from 300 to 700,” he said. Admitting that very few government school students have access to smartphones and only around 60% students have network connectivity, he added that those in rural and tribal areas faced network issue. Some teachers are going to a student’s place, gathering a handful of students of the locality and educating them. Those students with mobile phones are asked to share the assessment questions to deprived students in their vicinity and get the answers written. “We are not 100% successful. It will take some time,” he added. To allegations of private schools forcing students to pay the entire fees, he said that parents could lodge complaints of fleecing with the CEOs. “We are warning erring schools and will punish them if it continues,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/more-than-2l-students-from-pvt-schools-have-moved-to-govt-schools-edu-minister/articleshow/85221012.cms||---

The state has joined Himachal Pradesh at the top of states with R-value greater than the national average. Showing an increasing trend, both Punjab and the neighbouring hill state now have R value of 1.3. In comparison to Himachal Pradesh, Punjab is reporting a significantly lower number of daily cases. Union ministry of health joint secretary Lav Agarwal, however, maintained that no matter how few the daily cases are, if the R-value was over 1 it was a cause of concern. He urged the state government to follow the basic principles of management which include testing, contract tracing, isolation, treatment and containment zones. As per the data shared by the Centre, there are six districts in Himachal — Hamirpur, Kangra, Bilaspur, Chamba, Mandi and Shimla — which reported an increasing trend in daily new cases during the last two weeks, of which one district recorded a weekly positivity rate of over 10%, double the limit recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Himachal is ranked third amongst states where an increasing trend has been noted in maximum districts. The rate of infection in Haryana has been recorded at 1. However, the situation is stable at the moment. As per the latest data released by the Centre, no fresh cases of Delta Plus (AY.1) variant have been detected in the region. Out of 86, cases of Delta Plus variant that signifies Delta lineage with an additional mutation found in the country, only eight have been traced in the region — four in Chandigarh, two in Punjab and one each in Himachal and Haryana — in samples examined by the National Centre for Disease Control and CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology for whole genome sequencing. National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) director Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh stated the state governments had been asked to constitute rapid response team containing clinician, microbiologist and member from medical college to monitoring the genomic variation in the coronavirus. He shared that in case of new mutation was detected, the team would help in contact tracing, epidemiological investigation, clinical assessment and necessary containment measures. The team would provide daily status to NCDC. Besides that, all states have to identify five laboratories and five tertiary care hospitals as sentinel sites. Each site is required to send 15 samples in two weeks to designated laboratories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/punjab-joins-hp-at-top-of-states-with-high-r-value/articleshow/85229303.cms||Vinod Kumar

The corporation will incorporate the changes suggested by the councillors before bringing out the final version of the bylaw. The council has authorised councillors P S Viju, V K Minimol and Priya Prashanth for preparing the final version of the bylaw by Wednesday. The council also decided to earmark specific street vending zones and provide ID cards to 1989 vendors selected by the street vending committee, which consists of the representatives of the GCDA, trade unions, corporation council and town planning department. The street vending zones will be selected on the basis of the width of footpaths and roads. The corporation council has authorised the centre for socio-economic and environmental studies for conducting a study in this regard. The authorities will also check whether any ineligible person has figured in the list of selected street vendors. The corporation will also consider those who have submitted fresh applications for inclusion in the list. The local body will allow only the genuine street vendors to run their stalls in the selected zones. No stalls which obstruct the pedestrian movement will be allowed, mayor M Anil Kumar said. Meanwhile, the opposition councillors alleged there was no transparency in the list prepared by the corporation authorities. “The decision to give licence to the street vendors is a welcome move. But, there is no clarity and transparency in the guidelines prepared by the corporation authorities in haste,” said Antony Kureethra, opposition leader, Kochi corporation, said.

Justice B Pugalendhi on Tuesday granted bail by directing Ponnaiah to stay in Trichy district and report before the Thillai Nagar police station after taking note of the fact that he was suffering from ailments. During the course of hearing, the additional public prosecutor appearing for the state had strongly opposed the grant of bail to the petitioner contending that if he is released on bail, it would cause distress to the people who are living peacefully in Kanyakumari district. In his petition, the petitioner stated that he was innocent and he had also posted another video expressing regret to the speech made while addressing a meeting organised at Arumanai in Kanyakumari district on July 18. The petitioner had also filed another petition before the HC Madurai bench seeking to quash the FIR registered against him by the Arumanai police.

They have argued that the decision is not appropriate at a time when Covid cases due to new variants are on the rise. In an email to Sisodia, who is also the deputy chief minister, the parents said, “We, the parents of grades X-XII students from various schools in Delhi, are writing to you because we know you truly support education and take balanced decisions.” They continued, “Though we all wish normalcy to resume at the earliest, we feel that the DDMA order... is not time-appropriate. We all are in a state of uncertainty with the expected third wave already initiated, and vaccine for children is yet to come.” Nidhi Gupta, one of the parents, also wondered when Central Board of Secondary Education had decided to hold online pre-boards in November, why schools needed to reopen. “The sudden order has created a sense of insecurity among all of us, especially after having faced the second wave when most of us have lost our loved ones. We are not yet over that traumatic pain, rushing for medical facilities, medicines, hospital beds, gasping for oxygen... So many children have lost either or both parents. Can you really subject them to face this threat, and that too without vaccination?” asked the letter. Parents are also worried that Covid-appropriate behaviour will be maintained only in the initial days. Students may become carriers for senior citizens at home, they said. “We are not ready to expose our children to the upcoming threat of the third wave,” added Gupta. The government has earlier said schools are being opened following requests from parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-letter-to-sisodia-group-of-parents-questions-the-hurry-to-reopen-schools/articleshow/85221157.cms||Shradha Chettri

The Manohar Lal Khattar-led government had purchased the kit from the company on payment of Rs 2.72 crore from state’s Corona Relief Fund during the second wave of Covid-19. The information further disclosed that the kit was purchased by the department of Ayush on the recommendations of the chief minister’s office. However, a departmental committee had opined that the composition and strength of medicines are as per the recommendation for immunity boosting and may be suitable for Corona patients. Information in this regard has been provided by the directorate of Ayush department Haryana to P P Kapoor, a Panipat-based RTI activist. According to the state public information officer (SPIO), the department of Ayush does not have any test report or investigation that confirms that the Coronil kit is affective in treatment of Covid patients. The department has also denied availability of any record or number of patients who have recovered from the virus after the use of kit. The SPIO has denied having copy of any agreement signed with Ramdev’s company regarding purchase of the kits. The department has informed that immediately after receiving directions, it had instantly prepared a report to purchase one lakh Coronil kits from Ramdev’s Divya Pharmacy and paid Rs 2,72,50,000 to buy one lakh kits. The company had also given 50% discount to the state government on the kit, which is available in the market for Rs 545. Kapoor, however, has alleged that the Haryana government has extended undue benefit to Ramdev’s company by purchasing such kit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-giving-away-coronil-but-has-no-basis-to-confirm-its-effectiveness-reveals-rti-reply/articleshow/85223742.cms||Ajay Sura

Ranjan came to know about this alleged cheating after hearing audio recording of Deviben’s conversation on mobile phone with the accused.

It added 17 vaccination centres to the 74 it has. The civic body hopes to facilitate more than 100 centres once sufficient vaccines arrive. NMMC said over 65% of the eligible population who need to be vaccinated as per protocol have been given the first dose, while 22% got the second. “We have a population of 10.8 lakh who are above 18. The population is 15 lakhs. We are set with adequate centres to cover the whole lot within few days provided vaccines are available,” said civic chief Abhijit Bangar. The 18-44 age group formed a major chunk with around 3.7 lakh people getting vaccinated with the first dose, whereas 26,000 were administered the second dose. As of date, over 9.39 lakh doses have been administered to residents in NMMC areas. More emphasis is being given to people aged above 45, who are found to be vulnerable to the infection.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt plans to okay construction in eco-sensitive zone of Mt Abu||JAIPUR: The state government is surreptitiously amending the Zonal Master Plan-2030 to allow construction in the notified eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Mt Abu. The local civic body has started deliberations to change the land use norm from ‘no construction zone’ in the area between Nakki Lake and the famous Dilwara temples to 'permissible construction zone' for the benefit of powerful interests who have large chunks of land in the area. As per documents with TOI, on June 18, the directorate of local bodies (DLB) issued an order to Mt Abu municipality to initiate the process for amending Mt Abu (ESZ) building bylaws, 2019, to carry out construction in the prohibited area. Following this, on July 2, the municipality invited objections and suggestions within 15 days from the public. The matter got highlighted after the proposal to change the land use was tabled at the municipality board meeting on August 4. “The entire process was manipulated and the civic body did not publish the advertisement inviting objections and suggestions in the local newspapers. Moreover, information was not available on the municipality notice board and people did not know about the move,” alleged Saurabh Gangadia, ex-member of the Mt Abu eco-sensitive zone monitoring committee. “The decision to change the status of land use in the Zonal Master Plan-2030 for Mt Abu will be against the directions of Supreme Court and high court,” he said. ‘Construction will destroy ecology’“This will be in clear violation of notifications declaring Mt Abu as an ESZ (Notification dated 25 June 2009, Moef & Cc). The construction in the area will destroy the ecology beyond repair,” he said.Environmentalists and local residents also think that the decision would kill the historic Nakki Lake as construction would be allowed in the catchment areas. Dau Lal Bohra, IUCN member, who is working on Ramsar sites, said, “There are innumerable water channels on this land which brings water to the lake. The state government should take initiatives to protect the water bodies in western Aravali rather than making a policy to destroy it. In the long run, the decision would severely impact vegetation and ecology if this step is taken.” Municipality sources said it would benefit local residents of Mt Abu. However, in the master plan areas, those who are already living in the area are allowed construction. “Existing residential areas do not come under the no construction zone. Only huge pieces of agricultural land in the region were banned for conversion and construction,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-plans-to-okay-construction-in-eco-sensitive-zone-of-mt-abu/articleshow/85223769.cms||Ajay Singh

---||Kochi||Now, onus on dept heads to ensure speedy file movement||Thiruvananthapuram: In a move aimed at streamlining and expediting file movement from zonal offices to the main office of the city corporation, the civic body has decided to hold the department head accountable if any file from the zonal offices gets stuck within a section for more than two days. Corporation secretary Binu Francis has issued a circular to speed up file movement between zonal offices and the main office in the wake of growing complaints about delay in processing of files and putting people through inconvenience. All files which can be processed by superintendent, assistant engineer, assistant revenue officer and health inspector in a zonal office shall not be forwarded to the main office for approval. The secretary noted in the circular that files directed to the main office for approval of council, secretary or mayor usually take time to get processed. It has been directed that all files directed from zonal offices to the main office shall be returned to zonal office within six days, except that require approval by the council. The files requiring approval of the council shall be returned to zonal office within 20 days, failing which the zonal officer will have to track down and ascertain the present status of the file. The circular also lays down instructions for file processing at the zonal office. The files which require site inspection shall be returned to the section concerned within three days. As regarding files requiring council’s approval, the charge officer shall prepare the agenda and submit it to the department head. The file shall then be forwarded to the clerk of the standing committee concerned who shall in turn prepare the agenda to be submitted in the council via secretary. The corporation council has of late witnessed instances where the opposition raised complaints regarding delay in file processing and the manner in which files were dragged on in certain sections, especially those directed from zonal offices. “Employees in the main office shall treat files from zonal offices as their own files and shall process it in a timely manner,” the secretary said in the circular. The files from zonal offices shall be scrutinized and forwarded to the higher level either on the same day or the next day for further processing. Despite clear timelines being issued for service delivery, files from zonal offices are often lost in the maze of files at the main office forcing applicants to shuttle between the offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-onus-on-dept-heads-to-ensure-speedy-file-movement/articleshow/85221133.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Pune||No test for fully vaccinated travellers: Panel||PUNE: National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation chairman Dr N K Arora on Tuesday told TOI that the top panel recently reiterated to the Centre its earlier recommendations about excluding the fully vaccinated travellers from RT-PCR tests for intra-country and inter-state travel. This comes in the wake of some states continuing to impose the mandatory requirement of RT-PCR tests for entry of the fully vaccinated travellers from other parts of the country. “The ministry of health and family welfare will re-circulate the recommendations to the states. We have already laid out a protocol. As per it, somebody who has taken two doses of the vaccines and completed 14 days after the second shot should not face any travel restrictions and require a negative RT-PCR test report before or after reaching the destination. There is also no requirement of quarantine for such travellers,” Dr Arora said. Fully vaccinated travellers have been facing twin troubles before travel, not only because some states insist on RT-PCR tests before entry but also because the CoWIN certificates for many are showing errors such as missing dates for either of the two doses, same date for both doses and wrong vaccine type. Dr Arora told TOI, “As far as the CoWIN certificates are concerned, some mechanism is being devised to rectify the errors in the vaccination certificates. The responsibility is also on the beneficiaries, who should go back to the vaccination centres without delay after they notice such errors in the certificates and get them corrected.” A health and family welfare ministry official confirmed that the Centre was working on a solution to rectify such errors. The official did not specify when the solution would be in place. National Centre for Disease Control director Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh told TOI that uniform guidelines should be formulated to resolve travellers’ inconveniences, particularly with some states still seeking negative RT-PCR reports from the fully vaccinated travellers. He said, “Maharashtra has already issued guidelines on no RT-PCR requirement for those who have completed a 15-day period after the second dose. There is no need for testing before travel if one is fully vaccinated.” Jyoti Mayal, president of the Travel Agents Association Of India, told TOI, “At a recent meeting with senior officials from the Centre, the association had pitched for a uniform protocol for passengers arriving at the airports of various states. But the Centre had said the decision on region- specific protocols had been left to the respective states, though a general guideline has been circulated. It is high time that a uniform policy was formulated for all states.” Nikhil Thakurdas, owner of Odyssey Tours and Travels, told TOI, “Different rules continue to persist. Goa’s protocols currently are very complicated. Karnataka requires a negative test report from those travelling from Maharashtra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-test-for-fully-vaccinated-travellers-panel/articleshow/85223745.cms||Neha Madaan

With an eye on the municipal elections next year, district election authorities will soon embark on an exercise to clean up and update the electoral roll. State chief electoral officer Shrikant Deshpande said there were 15.77 lakh voters with missing photos in the list across Maharashtra. The collectors have been told to ensure these voters update their details online or at the collectorate. “Because of the pandemic, the booth-level officers could not carry out the necessary checks, including door-to-door visits to verify addresses, and update photos,” Deshpande told TOI. “We have asked collectors to make the necessary changes after verifying current addresses. We are continuously working towards a purified electoral roll,” he added. He said voters now have the option of updating their photo directly on the official election commission website. He said names will only be deleted after ensuring that the voter no longer lives in the address on the records. “These names will be deleted only after sending three notices and a visit by the booth-level officer,” an election official said. Maximum duplicate names are from Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Nagpur. The state election office has also identified 66,000 duplicate names on the electoral roll; collectors will have to verify and delete them. Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Nagpur have the most duplicate names. At present, the state has 9.08 crore registered voters. The list will be pruned considering migration from rural to urban areas within the state and to other states. Election officials said unless the list is updated, we would not be able to get an accurate voting percentage. “Duplicate names and ‘Absent, Dead & Shifted’ voters are among the main reasons for low turnout in urban areas,” the official said. The ECI uses software to identify duplicate names and carries out two summary revisions per year, with additions, deletions, and focus on photos.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-voters-list-to-be-pruned-updated-ahead-of-civic-polls/articleshow/85221147.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The plot was auctioned by Assets Reconstruction Company of India Ltd (ARCIL), an agency duly registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the provisions of SARFAESI Act, 2002. The state industries department spokesperson said ARCIL had taken over the possession of the property as per law after JCT Electronics, the allottee of the plot, had been liquidated as per court order after defaulting in making repayment of loans extended by various financial institutions. Subsequently, in the online public auction conducted by ARCIL under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, the plot was auctioned at the price of Rs 90.56 crore in February last year. Thereafter, PSIEC had submitted a claim of unearned increase in pursuance of the provisions of the lease deed executed with JCT Electronics amounting to Rs 45.28 crore i.e. 50% of the sale value. PSIEC had obtained advice from a senior advocate in this matter before submitting the claim with the ARCIL, he added. A tripartite agreement was executed between PSIEC, ARCIL, and GRG Developers and Promoters LLP, in order to safeguard the financial interests of the government, which had bound the auction purchaser to clear the dues of PSIEC in a timely manner. PSIEC has not even issued no objection certificate for effecting transfer of property in favour of auction purchaser, he added. To protect its interests, PSIEC had categorically conveyed to ARCIL and auction purchaser that the no objection certificate for the transfer would be provided only after the matter is decided by the finance department. Neither PSIEC has issued no objection certificate for transfer nor possession of the property has been given to the auction purchaser. The spokesperson said that now an advice of the finance department has been received in this matter and the industries and commerce minister has ordered the termination of the tripartite agreement. The case is still sub judice and is listed for hearing in the Punjab and Haryana high court on August 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-denies-psiec-role-in-industrial-lands-sale/articleshow/85223787.cms||---

The court will hear the matter on Wednesday. The petitioner said Gandhi took a photo with the mother of the 9-year-old rape victim in Delhi recently and violated the secrecy of the identity of the victim. He also sought action against Twitter Communication India Pvt Ltd, which carried the photo. BJP state secretary Jitendra Gothwal in his petition said he had approached the Ashok Nagar police to file an FIR against the Congress leader on August 5 but the police refused to do so. Now he was left with no other option than approaching the court. The petition has been filed under Section 190 (1) CrPC, 228 (a) of the IPC (disclosure of identity) , Section 23 Pocso Act (No person shall make any report or present comments on any child from any form of media or studio or photographic facilities without having complete and authentic information, which may have the effect of lowering his reputation or infringing upon his privacy) and Section 67 (a) of the IT Act (carrying sexually explicit material). The petitioner said Rahul Gandhi, to derive political advantage, posted a photo with the mother of the victim on Twitter on August 4 and thereby violated the non-disclosure of the identity provision. He said under Pocso Act, media or social media could not publish anything that discloses the identity of the rape victim. The petitioner sought a direction form the court under Section 156 (3), directing the Ashok Nagar police, as the BJP office comes under its jurisdiction, to file an FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fir-likely-against-rahul-for-revealing-rape-survivors-identity/articleshow/85226736.cms||---

The estimated cost of the project is over Rs 800 crore. “We are almost done with evaluating the technical bids and financial bids will be opened soon,” a senior government officer said. The state government had received an overwhelming response from companies at the pre-bid meeting with 15 firms evincing interest in the project, but got poor response at the end. On January 14, the public-private partnership (PPP) cell of the state government held a virtual pre-bid meeting with companies and answered their queries related to the project. Over five years after outlining plans to construct the 5,000-seating capacity convention centre, the government in December finally floated a tender inviting firms to set up the facility. The first phasewill cost around Rs 800 crore, and depending on further expansion plans, the cost will increase and it will be borne by the bidder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/conventioncentre-project-gets-two-bids/articleshow/85223773.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Desai said that soon after her election in ward 11, ward members prompted her to take up some long-pending works. “It was surprising that the said works were recorded as completed and bills paid to the contractor,” she said. “In reality I found that no works had been carried out. The three works — construction of a drain at Nirakar temple (Bhikarwada), construction of a drain at Sawantwada, and re-construction of a drain at Colomb-Sawantwada to Tembewada — were very much missing.” Desai alleged that the contractor never executed these three developmental works. Further, she said, information under RTI revealed that tenders were called for these three works in January 2016 and a contractor was issued the work order in November 2017. She has now filed a complaint before CMC chairperson Mario Simon Rebello, which has been confirmed by the chairperson. Desai also said that she and her aides have taken up the matter before various government agencies, including the directorate of municipal administration and other allied departments. “If we do not get justice, we will not hesitate to take the matter to court,” she said. A resident of the ward, Aniket Desai, said that he too has sought disciplinary action against the two CMC staffers and subsequent disqualification of then chairperson, who is a councillor now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/probe-sought-into-ghost-projects-at-canacona/articleshow/85223822.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The report was submitted to the collector with a letter which states that phenoxy compounds are affecting the plants and resulting in growth abnormalities .The committee visited villages of Bharuch and Vagra talukas and studied the impact of pollution on cotton and pigeon pea plantations. A copy of the report is with TOI. “Abnormal shape of cotton plant leaves was seen while it is little less in pigeon peas compared to cotton. It does not seem due to any disease, insect or any other reason. It is abnormal in these plants and seen among plants growing naturally on the borders of farms,” the report states.The report further states that, “Such issues have been noticed in the past eight to 10 years. This abnormality was not seen in sorghum.” In its opinion, the team wrote, “Similar deformities were noticed by diagnosis teams in 2012 and 202. This deformity could be an impact of phenoxy compounds. GPCB should find out about the presence of these compounds in the air in Vagra taluka since this issue has been continuing in this region for the past 10 years.”  “GPCB officers who were members of the team refused to sign the opinion,” the report stated.  Meanwhile, BJP MLA from Vagra, Arunsinh Rana, also raised the issue and complained to chief minister Vijay Rupani. “Due to pollution, the crops are getting damaged. It is a serious issue since farmers in Bharuch take only one crop in the season. The government has started efforts to identify the exact problem and cure it,” said Rana, who is chairman of Agriculture Market Produce Committee, Bharuch. KSG president Jayesh Patel also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding compensation for the farmers. “KSG demands compensation of Rs one lakh per hectare and a detailed investigation by scientists and experts,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/chemical-pollution-affecting-crops-in-bharuch-report/articleshow/85218302.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Going by the crooks’ advice, the elderly man invested money to earn commission. He even took personal loans from a bank and withdrew cash using his credit card. In all, he transferred Rs3.5 lakh to the fraudsters in just four days — from August 2 to 5. On Friday, he approached the cybercrime cell and submitted a complaint application. “On June 2, I received a message on my cellphone asking me if I wanted to make money online. When I responded, a man told that he was representing a prominent e-commerce company. This convinced me to accept his offer,” the man told TOI. He said the suspect told him to complete the orders generated by the system. “He took details of my bank account and told me to transfer Rs 200 online on the promise that I would get Rs68 back. After transferring the money, I found Rs 268 credited to my account. He then told me I would earn Rs200 in commission on a Rs400 investment,” the complainant said. The suspect then explained the company’s different investment plans to the complainant. “He was a glib talker. He told him to complete the task on time so that I can earn timely commission,” he said. He started getting suspicious when the suspect started demanding higher amounts of money. “I nearly exhausted my savings and took an instant loan twice from my bank. I even withdrew money using my credit card,” he said. A cybercrime officer said, “We are seeking more details from the bank.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/senior-citizen-duped-of-rs-3-5-lakh-in-online-fraud/articleshow/85221204.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Manohar Tanwar, the middleman, had allegedly asked for Rs 80,000 for ensuring recruitment. But his cousin was not selected and Bhupender asked Manohar to return the money. Manohar claimed that he cannot give the money as he had already given it to Army officials who were not returning the same. Despite many attempts, Bhupender failed to get his money back and registered a case. Considering the seriousness of the issue, Ajmer SP Jagdish Chandra Sharma constituted a district special team (DST) to investigate the matter.

The residents were livid with the MC officials for not taking action against an “illegal” building in the area that belonged to a Congress councillor while they were demolishing pedestals on which people had kept plants. The drive saw heated arguments and manhandling. The civic officials claimed that on the high court’s directions they had gone to remove the encroachments, but people opposed the drive. Cops could not control the residents, who levelled allegations against the Congress leader for constructing an illegal multi-storey building in the area. They said they raised their voice against him, so he sent the MC officials to remove the pedestals. People alleged that officials of the building branch were corrupt and instead of removing the large-scale encroachments, they were busy razing ramps outside houses. The residents tried to stop the officials by sitting and standing in front of the JCB machine, and the cops had a tough time removing them. The residents alleged that there was no woman cop in the drive and policemen manhandled the women. The situation turned tense and residents and officials exchanged heated arguments. The officials claimed that they had razed about a dozen illegal structures, but at a few locations people tried to interfere. Commotion in the area invited the attention of commuters as well. Assistant town planner Madanjit Bedi said there were around 35 encroachments in the area and they removed all despite public interference. He said they had earlier served notices because they had to file a reply in court in 15 days. He said they removed encroachments on the road, and the building about which people were complaining was regularised long back and MC had collected Rs 20 lakh from the Congress leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tempers-flare-during-mcs-demolition-drive/articleshow/85218274.cms||Nidhi Bhardwaj

Decision on the bail application of one of the main accused Mahipal Maderna, however, could not take place on Tuesday. He is currently out on interim bail for treatment. He had moved the bail plea but the court will take it up for hearing on August 23.The same order of the apex court in the case of Bishnoi became the ground to bail for these 6 accused. These 6 accused include Sahiram, Umesharam, Om Prakash, Ashok, Pukhraj and Dinesh. With this, total 8 accused are out on bail including Parasram and one Reshmaram out of total 17 accused. The arguments in the Supreme Court by Parasram’s counsel Mahesh Jethmalani formed the base of all these bails. It may be noted that Jethmalani had argued in the court that the trial of the case had started after 4 years of filing of the case and Bishnoi had been under judicial custody since 2012.He had further argued that the evidence related to him has already been completed by the court and nothing has been left on his part, which could prevent him from granting bail. On the same ground, the counsels of all these bailed accused argued that they have served over 9 years in judicial custody with no clue about conclusion of trial of the case citing the apex court order of Parasram.Admitting the arguments, justice Dinesh Mehta granted bail to all the 6 accused while listing the similar plea by Maderna for hearing on August 23. Other accused currently under judicial custody include Malkhan Singh Bishnoi and his sister Indra Bishnoi, Bishnaram Bishnoi, Kailash Jakhar, Shahabuddin, Amarchand (husband of Bhanwari Devi) and two others. They also are likely to file bail applications anytime soon considering the order by the apex court followed by the high court in allowing bail applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/6-get-bail-in-bhanwari-devi-kidnap-and-murder-case/articleshow/85226764.cms||---

In case of any violation of traffic rules by the vehicles they should take appropriate action against the violators under the Motor Vehicles Act.

The prosecution alleged that the app is now owned by Kundra’s brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi’s company Kenrin, registered in UK. Police believe Kundra has been involved in production and distribution of pornographic videos. The prosecution submitted that Kundra may help Bakshi evade the probe. The prosecution expressed fears that if granted bail the accused may commit similar crimes again by uploading obscene videos, which will impact culture and send a wrong message to society. Kundra’s plea said if the material that they (investigating agency) speak of is considered, it is clear that it does not depict direct explicit sexual acts but shows material in the form of short movies which are lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest of a person.

Many young adults have not been able to get their second dose of the vaccine yet. The beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group were included in the vaccination programme in June, but there was a delay in the drive due to shortage of doses. “Opening up is just the start, but there are many brands that cater to younger customers. These brands have not yet reopened. Many shops have young adults as staffers, who have to wait till they complete their second dose before returning to work. There is a long way to go to be fully functional. Vaccination is the key to attain it,” said Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer, Amanora Mall, Pune. Vikas Ladhe, centre head, SGS Mall, Camp, said, “We are taking a hit financially. But the regulation will hopefully turn out to be to an advantage if it helps curbing the Covid spread and another lockdown.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said, “While immunity varies from vaccine to vaccine, generally those who have taken both doses have a 92-93% efficacy against the Coronavirus. Those who have taken only the first dose should not take the risk and hurry to visit malls.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-await-young-crowd-for-revival-of-business/articleshow/85223790.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Schools will have to get consent from the parents before their children attend the classes. Sisodia said, “Cases of Covid in Delhi have now been controlled to a great extent. During the special PTM, most of the parents agreed that schools should reopen because in the last 1.5 years, there has been a lot of damage to the education of children. We have to bridge the loss of learning as well as cater to the mental and socio-emotional well-being of children. Our children and teachers have gone through a harrowing phase of Covid, we need to get them out of that phase.” He stressed that there should be no laxity in following the Covid-related standard operating procedure.

On the first night on Monday, there were a very few who turned up to get vaccinated. One vial of the Covid-19 vaccine has dose for 10 beneficiaries. Using a vial for one person only is a wastage, said a health worker in Rashidia HS School, one of the two centres which are offering 24x7 Covid-19 vaccination for free. The other location is the government-run Katju hospital in TT Nagar area. The reconstructed hospital through Bhopal smart city development project, catered to 434 people, who got vaccinated there on Tuesday. However, post 9 pm the turnout was nil. “It is a concept that might take a longer time for people of the state capital to get accustomed with,” said a health worker. At Rashidia school, post 9 pm, one person waited for almost an hour before two others turned up. One vial was opened, doses served three. After four hours, the seven doses were wasted.

---||Pune||Pune airport climbs 94 spots, 60th in world now||PUNE: The city airport has vastly improved its airport service quality ranking (ASQ) for the second quarter of 2021, as per the results released by Airports Council International on Tuesday. The airport, ranked 154th in the world the previous quarter, jumped 94 places to be ranked 60th among airports of this size, catering to passenger traffic of 5-15 million in the Asia Pacific region. Airport officials claimed that they were constantly striving to ensure passengers were not inconvenienced in the civilian enclave. The survey rates airports on 33 parameters; the Pune airport has shown significant improvement in most parameters when compared to the first quarter. The airport lost marks in four categories — availability of ATM/money changers, shopping facilities, internet services and affordable shopping areas. The airport scored better in all other parameters, per the survey. “The Pune airport was recently reported the most profitable of all AAI facilities in the country. Space and land availability are a problem, considering it is mainly a defence airbase, but the upcoming terminal and the multilevel parking facility will change the airport by next year,” an airport official, conceding that there remained issues and that they were working towards rectifying them. In 2019, the airport was ranked 61st. It dropped 36 places in 2020, when the survey was carried out only in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year due to the pandemic. The results have surprised many regular passengers, who feel the facility still needs a lot of improvement. “The security check process is messy and unorganized – there is no social distancing, and the authorities seemed unable to handle so many passengers. A lot more needs to be done about cleanliness and availability of food, among other things, at the airport,” Jatin Sarath, a frequent flyer told TOI. Newly appointed airport director Santosh Dhoke recently told TOI that additional CISF personnel would be placed to ensure order during security screening. He also said there was an effort to complete the multi-level parking facility this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-airport-climbs-94-spots-60th-in-world-now/articleshow/85221270.cms||Joy Sengupta

Kundra moved the plea in June. In November 2020, police had registered an FIR against 14 over-the-top (OTT) platforms and web portals for obscene content based on a complaint by a retired Customs official. Summons were sent to heads of the platforms and portals, besides actors in the videos. Kundra is in custody in a pornography case being probed by crime branch.

Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said search operation was continuing unabated despite bad weather. “Military authorities are leaving no stone unturned to locate the two pilots. The expanse of the dam is 25km long, 8km wide and more than 500 feet deep. Experts and equipment from Army, Navy, IAF, NDRF, SDRF, NGOs, state police, dam authority and private firms from all over the country have been put into action. Experts and specialised equipment and divers are being continuously flown in and international assistance is also being sought,” he said. According to information, a special contingent of Navy, comprising two officers, four junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and 24 other ranks, one contingent of Army’s Special Forces divers comprising two officers, one JCO and 24 other ranks, are carrying out the operation. “A small area of 60m by 60m has been localised and special sonar equipment flown in from Kochi is being employed to enable the search operations to enter their final phase,” the officer added. He explained that the deep underwater operation is especially challenging due to near-zero visibility below 50 meters owing to the colloidal nature of water in the rainy season, which adversely impacts accuracy of sonars and other sensors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/foreign-help-sought-to-trace-2-army-pilots-whose-helicopter-crashed-in-ranjit-sagar-dam/articleshow/85231572.cms||---

A power grid being set up in Sanwta area in Rasla gram panchayat on Tuesday stopped the villagers from doing the ‘darshan’ of 509-year-old statue of former Maharawal Dudhoji Maharaj, that comes within the limit of the unit. The villagers staged a dharna to protest on Tuesday. Villagers say that the place where the statue is situated has been encroached upon. Former MLA Sang Singh Bhati and Congress leader Sunita Bhati, staged a dharna along with a large number of villagers. The protesters demanded registration of two pasture lands of Nagnechi temple in Fatehgarh sub-division in revenue records. The villagers and environment enthusiast Sumer Singh Sanwta said that the work of power grid Fatehgarh 2 is going on in the village and the statue is situated at the same site, which is the centre of religious faith for many. At present, the power grid is encroaching the land where the statue is situated. A year ago, talks were held with the company administration not to carry out any work near the statue, but for the last 3-4 days, the company is working near the said religious place, which is hurting the sentiments of the villagers. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/locals-protest-against-power-projects-encroaching-pastures/articleshow/85226799.cms||---

On July 9, this number was 10,381, which means a 22% drop within a month. Pune city’s active caseload is around 2,000. In Pimpri Chinchwad, the tally is down to three digits. Officials said both regions haven't recorded a spurt in cases for some time now, with daily caseloads staying below 300. It’s the rural areas, however, that continue to have a high number of active cases. Around 63% of PMR’s 8,093 Covid patients in care are in the rural pockets. A month ago, that share was 57%. An official with the Pune Municipal Corporation said the number of daily cases from the city has not gone beyond 500 in a month. “The daily caseload has been between 200 and 350 over the past few days. On some days, it dropped to below 200. This dip has reduced the active caseload to around 2,000,” the official said. He added that cases are now sporadic, with no reports of large clusters coming in. “We are tracing contacts of all positive patients. We also continue to have swab collection centres in every civic ward.” On Tuesday, the PMC had an active caseload of 2,051, with 226 new cases. Some 200 patients are critical; 329 are on oxygen support. Officials with the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) said they have 812 active patients — the lowest in the region. A PCMC official said have urged all residents to get themselves tested if they suspect any symptoms. As for Pune rural, officials from the district health office said containment measures are in place in pockets that have many patients. Pune rural is currently reporting between 400 and 800 new patients daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/22-dip-in-pmrs-active-caseload-most-patients-now-in-rural-pockets/articleshow/85223875.cms||Sarang Dastane

Middle-aged Satish Khandelwal, who frequently travels to Lonavla, said his expenses had increased as he was unable to commute by the inter-city trains. “Why can’t the same relaxations as Mumbai be allowed in Pune?” he asked. Khedgaon resident Hemant Landge, who has taken both shots of the vaccine, said he now travelled by PMPML or MSRTC buses to Pune. “This takes much longer than a train would. What is the point of being vaccinated?” he asked. Lakhs of passengers were suffering, said Harsha Shah, chairperson of the Railway Pravasi Group.

However, police and local BJP workers held Sharma and his supporters aside before Sharma could display the flag. Sharma, however, claimed he managed to show the black flag to Raje as a mark of his protest against the mother–son duo’s ignorance to the their constituency, where they were returning after 2 years. ‘The mother–son duo returned to Jhalawar after two years and we have vowed not to allow the two to enter Jhalawar as Raje and Dushyant have ignored their constituency and have had a rude attitude to local people,” Sharma said, claiming the two local public representatives did not even turn up in Jhalawar during the pandemic and never bothered to take care of people. A large number of Congress workers staged an aggressive demonstration against Raje’s visit with high pitched slogans – ‘Vasundhara go back’ and showed black flag as mark of protest to her visit, Sharma claimed. In a statement, Raje said tussle between Congress ministers and government officers was harming the farmers who are valready suffering because of monsoon flooding. “Even Congress ministers are saying 80-90% crops in Hadauti region have been damaged because of incessant rains over the last week. Officials, however, are claiming damage of just 30%. This tussle is affecting relief work,” said Raje.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-workers-stir-during-raje-sons-jhalawar-trip/articleshow/85226809.cms||---

---||Surat||SMC mulls freight corridor within city||Surat: While the Railways is developing freight networks at small railway stations around the Diamond City, the civic authority is toying with the idea of developing a unique dedicated freight corridor within the city limits. To develop the logistics network across the city and improve freight traffic movement in the city as well, a city logistics co-ordination committee (CLCC) was formed recently, which probably is the first in state to work in this area. Recently, CLCC held its first meeting and various actions were planned to make the city freight friendly as well. The nationwide project aimed at improving ease of freight traffic movement is being executed as an economy booster. Surat city has the country’s longest BRTS network of 110km, spread through 13 corridors. And officials have suggested using the BRTS network for freight movement as well. “The first meeting of CLCC was held and we are working on various possibilities to become a freight friendly city with better infrastructure for freight management. We are exploring possibilities of developing a dedicated freight corridor as well,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner, emphasizing that freight management is a crucial aspect in a business-friendly city.“A freight corridor will utilise the BRTS tracks to its full capacity and reduce traffic congestion on roads. It will also reduce accidents,” said a Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) official.According to traffic management experts, a scientific study can help plan required infrastructure that is viable for the next few decades. “What we plan today is useful for the future and for that improving freight traffic is paramount. The development should be based on findings of scientific study,” said Dr Gaurang Joshi, professor and head of civil engineering department, Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT). “Improving freight traffic movement will help local businesses grow further,” said Narendra Saboo, president, Surat Mercantile Association.“We have been demanding infrastructure to support the transport business for a long time. We have requested to develop a logistic park and hope the local authorities do something for it,” said Yuvraj Desle, president, Surat Textile Goods Transport Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smc-mulls-freight-corridor-within-city/articleshow/85218323.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The cost of the vaccines, which will arrive in two batches of 10 lakh shots each, shall be charged from the hospitals. The government has been promoting partnership with private hospitals and KMSCL MD has been authorised as the aggregator to facilitate vaccine procurement by private hospitals. The agency has been interacting with the hospitals and has assessed the demand of vaccines for the month of August at around 18.18 lakh doses. It then requested the government to grant Rs 126 crore for the advance payment to Serum Institute Life Science Private Limited. Funds from the chief minister’s distress relief fund (CMDRF) will be used for the vaccine procurement. CMDRF has so far received Rs 775.48 crore through donations from the public under Covid-19 head. Health minister Veena George informed that the state has received as many as 5, 11, 080 doses of vaccine on Tuesday. This includes 2, 91, 080 doses of Covishield and 2, 20, 000 doses of Covaxin. The doses have been received at Thiruvananthapuram (98,560 Covishield doses and 74,500 Covaxin doses), Ernakulam (1,14,590 Covishield doses and 86,500 Covaxin doses) and Kozhikode (77,930 Covishield doses and 59,000 Covaxin doses). As many as 95, 308 persons have been administered the vaccine on Tuesday at 411 government centres and 333 private centres. Till date, the state has administered the first dose of vaccine to 44.88% persons and both the doses to 18.35% persons. The government has prepared a detailed three-pronged plan for vaccination drive, under the supervision of the district collectors who would coordinate with other departments and the civil society members. Under the first campaign, all elderly persons 60 years and above who have not yet received the first dose will be covered before August 15. Under the second drive, all bedridden patients above 18 years will be identified and vaccinated, again by August 15. Mobile vaccination units will be deployed. In the campaign’s third part, depending on the availability of vaccines, vaccination for the remaining segments will be planned and conducted. The focus is on reducing the number of vulnerable people ensuring first dose to them, as the rate of fatality is more among the people with comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kmscl-to-buy-20l-vaccine-doses/articleshow/85221351.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Goa||GU submits report to NAAC, awaits assessment plan||Panaji: The Goa University has finally submitted its self-study report to the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and is now waiting to hear from the council on the assessment schedule for the varsity. For nearly two years now, GU has been without a valid accreditation. The five-year validity of the last accreditation ended on September 2019, where Goa University had received an ‘A’ grade. With many permanent faculty positions lying vacant, the university had initially deliberately delayed its re-accreditation process. University officials were worried that the proportion of vacant faculty positions may have an adverse impact on the varsity’s grade. But by early 2020, the pandemic arrived on the scene and further delayed the process. “We have submitted the self-study report and are waiting to hear from them,” said GU registrar Radhika Nayak. Around September 2019, when validity of the accreditation was to end, nearly 50% faculty posts were without full-time teachers and could have brought down the varsity’s grading. This is especially since the altered NAAC accreditation process now lays less stress on the Council’s peer team visit to the campus. The new process gives more importance to quantitative data submitted by the university like number of permanent faculty, etc. When the Covid-19 situation was slightly better around January-February this year, Goa University managed to complete the recruitment process by filling up almost 90% of the 150-odd faculty positions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-submits-report-to-naac-awaits-assessment-plan/articleshow/85223919.cms||---
---||India||SC: States need HC nod to drop case against MP, MLA||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered that no state government can withdraw pending criminal cases against MPs, MLAs and MLCs without prior approval of the high courts concerned and took strong exception to similar decisions by Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttarakhand. The direction was issued by a bench of CJI NV Ramana and Justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant after amicus curiae Vijay Hansaria's report highlighted a disturbing trend of states attempting to misuse section 321 of the criminal procedure code to withdraw even serious cases against ruling party legislators. He said UP has sought to withdraw 76 cases against elected representatives, including the Muzaffarnagar riot cases against MLAs Sangeet Som, Kapil Dev and Suresh Rana. The Uttarakhand government has moved to withdraw a murder case against MLA Rajkumar Thukral. Similarly, the Karnataka government has moved applications for withdrawal of 61 cases against legislators and the Maharashtra government has also taken similar steps. Referring to a recent SC judgment, which laid down guidelines for a public prosecutor for withdrawal of prosecution while setting aside Kerala government's decision to withdraw cases against Left party MLAs for vandalism in the assembly, the CJI-led bench directed that no prosecution against MPs/MLAs/MLCs can be withdrawn without approval of the HC concerned. The bench requested the high courts to examine the efficacy and public interest involved in the applications by public prosecutors for withdrawal of cases against sitting MPs/MLAs and MLCs. It also agreed with Hansaria's suggestion and ordered that barring an emergency, a judge presiding over Special Courts, set up to conduct trial of criminal cases against sitting and former legislators, would not be transferred out till further orders from the apex court. Though the Enforcement Directorate scrambled to file at the eleventh hour a list of cases pending under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against sitting and former legislators, the bench expressed serious reservation about the Centre's intent towards expeditious investigation and trial in these cases. The SC said the Centre has not been able to file detailed status reports of pending cases against legislators for nearly a year, though it had sought just a week to file the details way back in November last year. "If the central agencies are reluctant to file even the status reports of pending cases, what should we presume? We have already expressed our displeasure on a number of occasions. We cannot say anything more."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-states-need-hc-nod-to-drop-case-against-mp-mla/articleshow/85228323.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the state had received 8.26 lakh doses in August. Thirteen centres will administer Covaxin and 11 Covishield. On Tuesday, vaccination doses administered in the city dropped to 43,003, of which 34,725 were administered by private hospitals. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani confirmed there will be a limited drive on Wednesday. This is the third day in August when only a handful of public centres will vaccinate people. Daily vaccinations in the state too dropped drastically. On Tuesday, it administered only 3,15,691 doses against its capacity of 8-10 lakh vaccinations. Maharashtra administered a total of 4,74,78,144 doses, of which Mumbai has given 76,56,487.

In its report submitted on July 29, 2021, the committee said the unlawful construction was carried out without the permission of RTDC and in violation of the contract norms. The heritage hotel on the banks of Jai Samand lakewas was was leased out on a rent of Rs 10,000 per month. Along with the heritage hotel, three other properties including motels, guest houses of Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) were leased out to Epitome Destination by RTDC for a cumulative monthly rental fees of Rs 40,000. The committee headed by Jitendra Joshi, executive engineer of RTDC, and Sunil Mathur, general manager of Hotel Kajri, another RTDC hotel, found that the lessee was constructing a water body inside the premises of the hotel which was not there earlier. Similarly, a wall inside the property was broken for fixing a lintel which is again in violation of the RTDC contract rules. The heritage property was built with specialized materials. But the number of new construction activities carried out by the lessee do not conform to the style of the building or the materials used previously, the report said. “After demolishing certain parts of the building, cement was used for renovation whereas the earlier building materials used were lime and surkhi,” it said.“Most importantly,” the report said, “The licencee never sought permission for these constructions nor RTDC approved any plan.” In a controversial decision, RTDC has given these properties on lease and there is no estimate on the basis of which the meagre monthly rental of Rs 40,000 was fixed. In fact, in an order on March 9, 2021, RTDC has arbitrarily fixed the monthly rental without the approval of the board of the corporation. Strangely, after fixing the monthly rental, RTDC issued another order on March 16, 2021 to form a committee to fix the rental taking into account the market rates and the operation.

---||Pune||Pune: Pandemic hampers other key tasks at over 40 primary health centres||PUNE: The zilla parishad (ZP) has asked over 40 primary health centres (PHCs) to focus on implementing health programmes, such as BCG vaccination, enrolment of pregnant women and other special drives, as per the Niti Aayog’s directives. “More than 40 PHCs in 13 tehsils could not complete their targeted work mainly due to the Covid-19 situation and related work in the last few months. We have asked them to focus on these regular activities,” said district health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar. ZP health department officials admitted that services were hit, particularly in March and April, when Covid-19 cases were high in the district. “We had to divert our resources to address Covid-related issues. In all tehsils, Accredited Social Health Activists (Ashas) were engaged in the Covid survey. As a result, the PHCs couldn’t complete their target. We have directed them to resume all drives on priority and finish the target in the next couple of weeks. The on-ground work has already begun,” added Pawar. Some PHCs in tribal areas in Ambegaon and Junnar tehsils could not complete the survey of newborn children in the area. “We have asked concerned PHCs to complete the task on priority to prevent future complications among the children,” said a health official. A section of PHC heads claimed that some Ashas were unable to undertake both Covid duty and various door-to-door surveys and drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pandemic-hampers-other-key-tasks-at-over-40-phcs/articleshow/85221412.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Now, wards with WIPR above 8 to come under lockdown||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state-level expert committee meeting on Covid-19, chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday, further tightened the Covid-19 restrictions in the state. According to the new norms adopted by the committee, local body wards having weekly infection population ratio (WIPR) above 8 would be clamped under lockdown. The state had been locking down wards with WIPR above 10 ever since it replaced the TPR based restrictions with WIPR. The review meeting resolved to increase by 50% the micro containment zones in districts with WIPR rate above 14. This comes in the wake of the test positivity rate in the state crossing 15% on Tuesday. The committee has also tried to address the criticism against the vaccination-based restrictions it had earlier imposed on movement of non-vaccinated people. However, in this endeavour, the committee appears to have further complicated the already knotty affair. The earlier order wanted people to produce Covid-19 vaccination certificate or RT-PCR negative certificate for entry in shop, banks, markets and even public, private offices, factories, and the like. The revised norm says that non-vaccinated people can move out for purchase of food items, provided there is no vaccinated person in their house, or they are unable to receive vaccine due to drug allergy. It further directed traders to give priority to the non-vaccinated. “Traders and LSGIs concerned shall give special attention to these categories of people and ensure home delivery of essential items,” the government order said. At Sabarimala, 15,000 devotees would be given entry when the temple opens for monthly pooja on August 15. Those have received two shots of vaccine or who produce Covid-19 negative certificate within 72 hours at the time of darsan would be allowed entry once they register their names in the virtual queue. The meeting also decided not to allow programmes that lead to crowding during Onam festival. Meeting of traders would be organized at local-body level and only licensed vendors would be allowed to engage in wayside sales. The meeting has also decided to fix a standard fee for RT-PCR testing at airports. Paediatric facilities would also be improved in hospitals. TPR soars to 15.91% The state on Tuesday recorded 21,119 new Covid-19 cases and 152 deaths. With this, the total death toll has touched 18,004. The TPR rose to 15.91 % when 1,32,769 samples were tested in the last 24 hours. WIPR was higher than 10 in 266 wards. Malappuram district continues to have the highest daily cases 3,603, followed by Ernakulam (2,539), Kozhikode (2,335), Thrissur (2,231), Palakkad (1,841), Kollam (1,637), Kottayam (1,245), Alappuzha (1,230), Kannur (1,091), Thiruvananthapuram (1,040), Wayanad (723), Pathanamthitta (686), Kasaragod (536) and Idukki (382).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/now-wards-with-wipr-above-8-to-come-under-lockdown/articleshow/85221377.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||New norms dispel tribespeople’s jab hesitancy||Idukki: When the government’s order seeking vaccination certificate for entering shops and banks drew flak from all corners, the order has helped the tribal and health officials to overcome the vaccine reluctance among the tribal community in the district. According to tribal department officials, the tribespeople in the Vellakkalkudi and Puthukkudi settlements inside Chinnar wildlife sanctuary refused to take vaccines even after repeated attempts by the officials. But after the government made it mandatory to possess vaccination certificate or RT-PCR negative certificate to enter shops or banks, they are showing willingness to get inoculated, said officials. Marayoor tribal officer V Suresh Kumar said many tribespeople in Vellakkalkudi and Puthukkudi called them and said that they were ready to take the vaccine. “The officials visited the settlements and provided vaccines to them. In the first phase, 76 people from Puthukkudy and 36 from Vellakkalkudy received the first dose,” said the official. Adimali tribal development officer Anil Bhaskar said that the tribal communities have been told that without taking the vaccine they could not enter the shops or banks. “Some banks and shops have already sought vaccination details from some of them and they have realized the need to undergo vaccination,” said Bhaskar. “At present over 46% of tribespeople in the eligible age group in the district have received the first dose. While 20,371 people received the first dose, 2,897 got the second shot,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/new-norms-dispel-tribespeoples-jab-hesitancy/articleshow/85221425.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Senior officers clarified that during the trap exercise, the doctor’s blood pressure had shot up and it was also found that he had suffered a heart attack earlier and had undergone angioplasty. Thus, it was decided not to arrest him now. ACB had laid a trap in which Gupta was detained while he was accepting a bribe of Rs 2,000. However, there were reports thereafter that ACB, after getting a phone call from technical education minister Subash Garg, released Gupta on bail minutes after the arrest. ACB DGP BL Soni said, “Had we been influenced, we would not have organised the trap. Actually, while our team caught him red-handed for accepting the bribe, as a protocol we invited a doctor for his check up. It was found that his blood pressure shot up and he was sweating. He told us that he had undergone angioplasty in the past and is a heart patient. After verifying the medical documents and reports it was decided that we will not arrest him now and continue our investigation.” “In a Prevention of Corruption Act, we can arrest the accused anytime. An additional SP rank officer is probing the matter and if needed the accused doctor would be arrested,” Soni added. Senior officers said it is the sole discretion of investigating officer in the corruption case to arrest an accused while he initiates an investigation. “We had decided not to arrest him during then just for one simple reason that he had been a heart patient and that day his blood pressure was elevated,” Soni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-doc-trapped-for-bribery-not-arrested-for-medical-reasons/articleshow/85226860.cms||---

It's the civic-run sites that have been mainly affected as private hospitals still have good reserves of the shot, the officials added. A fresh batch of doses is now expected to arrive by Wednesday evening. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Supply has been low during the first 10 days of August. But we covered nearly 2.6 lakh people." When asked about the more than 10 lakh beneficiaries who are due for the second jab of Covishield, Deshmukh said the district is expecting a large allocation from the state government. The district, in August so far, has received only about 92,000 doses of Covishield and 46,000 doses of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/not-enough-covishield-over-300-jab-sites-in-pune-stay-shut/articleshow/85223958.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Goa||Tiger Anwar’s murder once again puts focus on proliferation of gangs in state||Margao: The brutal murder of notorious criminal from Margao Anwar Shaikh alias Tiger Anwar at Savanur in Karnataka’s Haveri district on Sunday has once again brought into focus the issue of proliferation of criminal gangs in the state, which invariably leads to violence. Shaikh was hacked to death on a public street in daylight by four axe-wielding assailants on Sunday. Karnataka police sources have attributed the motive to retaliatory action after Shaikh threatened to bump off one the assailants, Imran Chowdhry, for failing to pay him “protection money”. Chowdhry has been arrested and police are on the lookout for three others involved in the assault. Sources said that Shaikh had a country-made revolver in his possession when he was attacked, but was unable to use it to defend himself, reasons for which are a matter of police investigation. Shaikh was known to routinely carry a firearm with him to threaten his targets for extorting protection money. Earlier this year, in February, he had survived a bid on his life at Arlem, Fatorda in South Goa after members of his rival gang shot at him, besides assaulting him with iron rods, ‘koita’ (sickle), and other deadly weapons. Though Shaikh had since shifted residence to his native place in Haveri, he had continued with his criminal activities there, too. He had over 26 cases booked against him at several police stations in Goa, most of which pertained to extortion, police sources said. Shaikh had unleashed a reign of terror, particularly in South Goa, over the last few years, and his death has brought to an end another dark chapter in Goa’s history of gang violence. In February 2019, another notorious criminal, also called Anwar Shaikh alias Chor Anwar was killed in a scuffle between two groups at Moti Dongor, Margao. He was stabbed to death with a sharp weapon outside a bar in Moti Dongor, Margao. Proliferation of gun culture has also led to an increase in incidents of gang violence in the state. TOI in a series of reports in September last year had pointed out how easy availability of firearms through illegal trade had led to proliferation of a gun culture in the state invariably leading to gang violence. When matka king Guru Poojary was shot dead by hired gunmen at Khareband, Margao, on November 23, 1999, it was Goa’s earliest epiphany about arms and the underworld. Nine months later, Poojary’s close friend and the eyewitness of his murder, Mohammed Pandiyal, was gunned down on August 18, 2000. Small-time gangsters and their syndicates have attempted to dominate the underworld in the state since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tiger-anwars-murder-once-again-puts-focus-on-proliferation-of-gangs-in-state/articleshow/85223950.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

State health director Dr Archana Patil told TOI that they would focus on speeding up vaccination in these districts because they also happened to be among the “districts of concern”, where the weekly positivity rate (WPR) was higher than the state average. “We have already distributed over 10,000 doses to Kolhapur, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Satara and Sangli, and 5,000 doses to Sindhudurg, in addition to their allocated supply to increase the vaccination,” she said. The state has been allocated 1.2 crore Covid vaccine doses for the month of August.

---||Mumbai||Classes 8-12 can restart in urban areas from August 17, panel to take a call in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The state government on Tuesday issued a GR, saying classes 8 to 12 in schools in urban areas that have been Covid-free for a month can start from August 17. Now, a four-member committee, including the municipal commissioner/collector, and the ward, health and education officers, in Mumbai, Thane and other civic areas will decide on reopening schools. Parental consent will be mandatory for students to attend physical classes. The higher classes have been allowed in Covid-free rural areas since July 15, but have met with poor response. Around 35% of schools in rural areas had opened, but they have only 10% students attending. Online education began on June 15. The GR also allowed rural schools to reopen classes 5 to 7. There is a growing demand in these areas to open primary schools too. The order comes even as the state Covid task force has advised against rushing with reopening schools in view of fears that a possible third wave could target children. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said schools are starting in a phased manner. “The physical education of class 10 and 12 students should not suffer. Students’ health is a priority and all Covid protocols have to be in place before reopening,” said Gaikwad. The standard operating procedures for schools include one student per bench, alternate days of school, physical classes for important subjects and vaccination of teachers. Schools in Mumbai have remained shut since the March 2020 lockdown. In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Thane, Palghar and Raigad schools had opened in November last year and January 2021. All schools were shut in April after the second wave. In MMR, 24 schools in rural Thane and 108 schools in rural Palghar reopened in July. Only 0.31% students in Thane and 2% in Palghar are attending classes. In the urban pockets of these districts, the four-member committee will take a decision on reopening schools. The state’s decision to further reopen schools is based on the Indian Council of Medical Research’s fourth sero-survey which showed antibodies prevalent in children aged 6 to 9 was 52%. Also, its research shows 81% parents willing to send children to schools. However, most parents TOI spoke to didn’t seem keen on physical classes yet. “Students should be vaccinated with at least one dose before they go to physical classrooms. Online classes have been streamlined and there is no need for an in-person appearance till Covid is around,” said Ameya Gosawi, whose son is a class X student. MLC Kapil Patil, who represents the teacher’s constituency, said the reopening is impractical with the third wave looming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-classes-8-12-can-restart-in-urban-areas-from-aug-17-panel-to-take-a-call-in-city/articleshow/85224087.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The accused later buried his body inside their home to avoid detection. The incident occurred in the Gangoh region of Saharanpur on July 14 but came to light on Monday when locals alerted the area police when they did not see the other brother for weeks. According to police, Rehman, 16, and Farman, 21, were living together in Fatehpur Dhola village under Gangoh police station area after their parents died years ago. The elder brother was taking care of Rehman. During investigation, it came to light that the younger brother had locked his mobile phone and the elder one was unable to access it. This became a reason for a discord between the two. In a fit of anger, the accused killed his elder brother with a spade and later buried his body. Deputy superintendent of police (Gangoh) Rizwan Ahmed said, “His neighbours informed the police after they did not see Farman for weeks. During the police interrogation, the accused broke down and confessed to his crime. Later, police exhumed the body from the house.” The accused will be produced before the magistrate, said police.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Jailer faces murder charge for gangster Ankit Gujjar’s death in Tihar||NEW DELHI: A deputy superintendent of Tihar jail number 3 has been booked for murder for the death of an inmate, 29-year-old gangster Ankit Gujjar. After an FIR was lodged by Delhi Police, Tihar director general Sandeep Goel reportedly suspended the accused jailer, along with two assistant superintendents and a warder. After the incident, which took place in the early hours of August 4, the three accused were transferred out of the sub-jail. The murder charge was invoked in the wake of a court order and the autopsy report, which confirmed the homicide angle. The autopsy report stated the cause of death as “haemorrhage consequent upon only cumulative effect of multiple blunt force injuries sustained to the body”, making it clear that Gujjar was thrashed to death. Earlier, TOI had reported that the FIR had mentioned Gujjar’s mother claiming that her son had asked her to arrange for Rs 50,000 immediately, otherwise the deputy superintendent would kill him. The FIR also mentioned other deputy superintendents telling police that a mobile phone, knife and data cable were found in Gujjar’s cell after which he was ordered to be shifted to ward number 5A. When Gujjar and his two cellmates refused to move, they were assaulted by the jail officials and guards. Gujjar was assaulted more because he hit back, his family had earlier claimed. Police had earlier initiated inquest proceedings to probe the incident, while treating the case as unnatural death saying they were waiting for the autopsy report. Cops had got a call about the death of the inmate around 9.15am on August 4. The police team that reached the spot found Gujjar, a murder accused, dead in the jail hospital. Two brothers, Gurpreet and Gurjeet, who were accused in a murder case lodged in 2018, shared the cell with Gujjar and were taken to DDU Hospital to be treated for their injuries. The dispute between Gujjar and jail officials apparently arose after a phone was found inside his cell a few days ago. His family claimed that jail officials were asking for Rs 1 lakh to suppress the issue. While they had already sent Rs 50,000, a dispute had arisen for the remaining sum. When the money was not paid in time, he was thrashed to death, Gujjar’s brother claimed. Staging a protest outside the jail, the family had demanded that the autopsy be conducted at a different hospital and not the designated DDU Hospital. Gujjar had allegedly killed BJP functionary Vijay Pandit in Greater Noida in 2016 while working for Sundar Bhati. He later joined hands with gangster Rohit Chaudhary and was arrested in a shootout at Saket in 2019. This incident has brought the spotlight again on the Tihar administration as its officials are already facing a CBI inquiry in another case of murder in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jailer-faces-murder-charge-for-gangsters-death-in-tihar/articleshow/85221531.cms||---

Justice Devan Ramachandran said the requirement of receiving at least one Covid-19 vaccine to visit shops while not insisting the same for liquor shops is improper. He was hearing a contempt of court petition alleging non-implementation of a court verdict to avoid nuisance to shops and residences around liquor outlets. The court said a requirement of vaccination for purchasing liquor would prompt more people to take vaccines. It has sought a response from the state government. Another bench of the HC on Tuesday held that the demand for providing Covishield vaccine for those finding it difficult to go abroad after taking Covaxin due to lack of WHO recognition is a serious matter. Justice P B Suresh Kumar asked the central and state governments to inform their views on a petition filed by Giri Kumar of Kannur. The views were sought in writing after counsel representing the governments submitted that allowing the plea will result in similar petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/why-no-vax-curbs-for-liquor-outlets-asks-hc/articleshow/85221456.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||No ayurveda expert in task force||Kochi: Much to the disappointment of ayurveda practioners, the government has decided not to consider including an expert in the field in the state task force on Covid management. This, despite health minister Veena George’s statement in the House a couple of days ago that ayurveda treatment has been found effective among Covid and post-Covid patients. She made the statement based on studies by the state Covid response cell of Ayush department on the impact of the various ayurveda treatment protocols under ‘Amritam’, ‘Bheshajam’ and ‘Punarjani’ on Covid-19. The minister said none of the reports indicating the effectiveness of ayurveda treatment on patients with mild-Covid symptoms or those with post-Covid complications have been made public. However, they have been sent for publication to foreign journals, she said. “We have put forth a proposal to the state government asking for inclusion of an ayurveda expert in the task force. According to first report, only a miniscule number of persons have contracted Covid after taking preventive medicine and adopting a lifestyle proposed by our doctors. Only the condition of a few patients turned serious. Now, we have been permitted to treat category A or mild-Covid patients,” said Dr R Krishnakumar, president, Kerala state government Ayurveda medical officers’ association. He said a second report was submitted on the impact of the treatment, but they have been asked to revise it. “Final year students and resident doctors are contacting patients and collecting 21 days’ data. We will have an evaluation of the second wave also,” he added. A report by the Ayush department stated that of the 1,01,218 persons who took ayurveda preventive medicine from May 21- July 4, 2020, only 0.34% tested positive. However, 1.67% people who did not take the medicines had tested positive during the same period. Even among those who tested positive after having ayurveda medicines, the percentage of people who developed complications is very less. In another study done among 9,895 category “A” patients who had undergone “Bheshajam” treatment from December 1, 2020 to January 15, 2021, 95.8% did not develop complications. Only 44 persons (0.45%) had to be referred to hospitals and 35 persons (0.36%) needed ICU care, the minister said in the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-ayurveda-expert-in-task-force/articleshow/85221476.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The booth as well as Vandana’s house are near theirs. Jaspreet was telling her mother about the incident, when Jaswinder came there and fired two shots at Vandana. One bullet hit her near shoulder and the other grazed against her head. As soon as Jaswinder fled, residents took the mother-daughter duo to a hospital.”“Jaswinder and Jaspreet had a love marriage 15 years ago. As Jaswinder hails from Lohara village, Jalandhar rural, the city police alerted the cops there, suspecting he might escape to the district,” he added.Minutes later, Jalandhar rural police received information that around 6.50am Jaswinder shot dead his friend Rohit in Khatika Mohalla.Jalandhar rural senior superintendent of police Naveen Singla said, “I visited the spot and spoke to the family of Rohit. Jaswinder had close and coordinal relations with Rohit and his family for long. He addressed Rohit’s father as ‘papa’. On Tuesday morning, Jaswinder reached Rohit’s house on his white two-wheeler. As the main door of the house was open, Jaswinder went in and saw Rohit preparing tea in kitchen. Jaswinder fired two shots at Rohit. One bullet missed the target and the second hit Rohit in neck, killing him on the spot. Jaswinder soon escaped.”“Jaswinder’s brother also lives in Nurmahal. He is being questioned about the accused. It seems to be a case of personal enmity,” the SSP added.Police said the accused, who worked at a college in Jalandhar, used a .32 bore revolver.

Civic officials said these centres had been kept ready to prevent a panic situation. Preparations were made in view of the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19. During the second wave, the PMC set up 13 Covid Care Centres, which had a capacity of 4,700 beds. It developed 10 more facilities, with a capacity of 4,200 beds. “Most of these facilities are empty. The manpower for some centres was on contract-basis, while some were run by the civic staff,” a senior PMC official said. Officials said manpower recruitment would be an issue if there was a sudden rise in cases. The civic bodies had given extension to some medical staffers on contract. But, additional manpower would be needed if the centres were to be run at full capacity. “Citizens must follow norms and all eligible people should get fully vaccinated. It will help reduce the spread of Covid-19, which will automatically reduce the need for Covid Care Centres (CCC),” said Vikas Dhakane, PMC’s additional commissioner. The PCMC has kept 1,000 beds ready in hospitals and 1,000 beds at the CCCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-bodies-keep-5000-beds-ready-for-immediate-use/articleshow/85224091.cms||---

---||India||Clean polls: In a 1st, SC fines 9 parties for violating order||NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented step, the Supreme Court on Tuesday fined BJP, Congress, JDU, LJP, CPM, CPI, NCP, RJD and RLSP between Rs 1 to 5 lakh for violating its February 13, 2020 order, which mandated notifying the Election Commission about criminal antecedents of candidates and publicising the information in media to enable voters to make an informed choice. The order was violated by almost all parties during Bihar polls. BSP was an exception as it substantially complied with the SC's mandate and escaped getting penalised at the hands of a bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai. It found CPM and NCP, in particular, to have grossly violated its order and imposed fine of Rs 5 lakh each on them. BJP, JDU, RJD, LJP, INC, CPI and RLSP were directed to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh each. The bench said it is very disturbing that "the percentage of winning candidates having criminal antecedents has jumped to 68% of the total number of candidates who won as MLAs - 163 out of 241. This was a 10% rise from the assembly elections of 2015 where the percentage of winning candidates having criminal antecedents to the total number of winning candidates stood at 58%". "Equally disturbing is the fact that 51% of winning candidates have serious criminal cases against them i.e. cases related to murder, kidnapping, attempt to murder, crime against women including rape, etc," the bench said. The bench said money from the fund, created through deposition of fines by the parties, would be utilised by the EC to "carry out an extensive awareness campaign to make every voter aware about his right to know and the availability of information regarding criminal antecedents of all contesting candidates" In its February 13, 2020, order, the SC made it mandatory for political parties to upload on their website detailed information on individuals with pending criminal cases who have been selected as candidates, along with the reasons for such selection, and also as to why other individuals without criminal antecedents were passed over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/clean-polls-in-a-1st-sc-fines-9-parties-for-violating-order/articleshow/85228401.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The session witnessed the participation of Indian National Army (INA) functionaries for the first time. Here, Maj Gen Ganpat Ram Nagar, the ‘general officer commanding (GOC)’ of the third INA division, was entrusted with “managing the volunteers’ core taking care of arrangements at the event by Nehru. Guru Nagar, wife Anju with the flagAfter the event, Nagar received the flag and his family has preserved it for three generations now. “After hoisting the flag, Pt Nehru had said ‘Humne is jhande ke neeche azaadi ki ladai ladi hai, yehi humaare watan ka jhanda hoga’ (this is the flag under which we fought for freedom, this will be the flag of our nation),” Dev Nagar, the 59-year-old grandson of GR Nagar, told TOI, recounting what his father had told him. Maj Gen Ganpat Ram NagarSeventy-five years later, the flag is still in a perfect shape and is well preserved by the family at their house in Hastinapur. “For us, it is our national pride with immense historical significance. It reflects our freedom struggle and reminds us of the great sacrifices our brethren made to ensure we got rid of foreign rule,” says Dev Nagar, a principal of a local school here. Mag Gen GR Nagar, second from right along with Netaji Subhash Chandra BoseDev's twin brother, Guru, who resides in Hastinapur, said, “When my father, who was in the Army, was alive, political leaders used to visit us for the flag.

So, it has always been with our family but now, we are considering handing it over to Shaheed Smarak Museum because my grandfather was born and brought up in Meerut. If we keep the flag in a Meerut-based museum, at least it will be in front of us. But this decision will be taken only after every member of our family approves of the idea.” The 1946 session was presided over by the then president of Congress, JR Kriplani, and among those present at the session were Sarojini Naidu, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, Shahnawaz Khan of the INA and others.

Seeing his potential, Col TS O' Donnell, principal of the Government Inter College, sent Nagar to Sandhurst Military College in the UK. Two years later, he was inducted into the British Army as King’s Commissioned Officer. In 1939, after the fall of Singapore and seeing the excesses of British army in the conquered land, Nagar revolted and was captured by the Japanese. After his release, Subhash Chandra Bose appointed Nagar as ‘Major General and GOC of the Malaya division’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/entrusted-by-nehru-in-1946-family-stands-guard-to-khadi-tricolour/articleshow/85218429.cms||Sandeep Rai

From a total of 63 lakh people who have been vaccinated in the region so far, 7,636 people went on to contract the infection — a mere 0.12%. The data showed that of 46.85 lakh people given one dose, 5,466 tested positive for Covid later. Out of 16 lakh given both doses, only 2,170 people went on to contract the virus. In Pune rural, 3,219 individuals who had received just one jab got Covid and 896 developed symptoms after both jabs. In the PMC limits, the virus was detected in 2,162 who had received one jab and in 1,251 who had received both. And in the PCMC areas, which have reported the lowest number of infections among those vaccinated, 65 who had received only the first jab fell sick and 23 tested positive after both shots. Officials said these figures may be revised later. Ashish Bharati, chief of the PMC’s health department, said the number of people testing positive after vaccination is currently very low. “But we have been instructed to track the vaccinated population since January (the Covid vaccine drive began on January 16). We are working on getting more precise data. Some figures, including the number of deaths after vaccination, may change later, but they will still not be high enough to impact the vaccination drive,” he said. Bharati added that officials are working on getting the number of people who have died after one or both doses. This data, he said, will be presented at a Covid review meeting, chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, later this week. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil, when asked about the low number of infections among the vaccinated in Pimpri Chinchwad, ruled out underreporting. He said the civic body has deployed all measures to ensure that correct data is presented. Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 and former director-general of health services (Maharashtra), said all districts in Pune division — Pune, Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur and Sangli — have been asked to share data on people who tested positive or died after vaccination. "But data so far shows that the vaccines have protected 99% of recipients from severe symptoms and hospitalisation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/99-88-of-vaccinated-popn-in-district-stay-covid-free/articleshow/85224176.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The state government has ordered a probe in the incident.The bottles were found lying under the staircase leading to the canteen on the ground floor of the Mantralaya. Speaking to the media, Minister of State for General Administration, Dattatray Bharne suspected the role of private contractors and labourers, who visit Mantralaya for construction work, of bringing the liquor bottles inside the premises. The BJP slammed the government and questioned the security of the building. “It is my personal opinion that the bottles could have been brought inside the Mantralaya by the workers of the private contractors who are engaged in different work in the building premise. I will inform state Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil about the incident. We will probe the issue and action will be taken against those found to be guilty,” said Bharne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-after-empty-liquor-bottles-found-in-mantralaya/articleshow/85224228.cms||---

---||Delhi||I-Day advisory on kites in Delhi: Steer clear of power installations||NEW DELHI: The power discoms have appealed to Delhiites not to fly kites near electric installations and overhead lines on Independence Day. Entanglement of metal-coated manjha may interrupt power supply to hospitals and other essential services, they said. A spokesperson of Tata Power-DDL, which supplies electricity to north Delhi, said that being a good conductor of electricity, the metal-coated kite string might pose a great danger. “Use only cotton threads or any natural fibre that is free from metallic or glass components. Do not fly kites close to roads or near moving traffic,” he said. “Flying of kites picks up on Independence Day in Delhi. According to estimates, tripping of one 33/66kv overhead line can disrupt power supply to over 10,000 residents and that of a single 11kv line affects over 2,500 residents. It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours to deal with such a damage,” he said. “As India gears up for the 75th Independence Day celebrations, kite-flying activities may increase on this momentous occasion, which may also lead to more kite flying-related incidents,” said a spokesperson of BSES discoms. “People should enjoy kite flying, but responsibly. We advise residents not to fly kites near electrical installations, including overhead cables, and certainly avoid using metal or metal coated manjha.” The BSES spokesperson said that in 2020, there were 14 instances of kite-flying related trappings in the BSES areas. Both discoms said their operations and maintenance teams were on constant vigil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/i-day-advisory-on-kites-steer-clear-of-power-installations/articleshow/85221646.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Bizmen meet FM, list bogus billing woes||Ludhiana: Miffed over the problems being faced by them at the hands of tax authorities due to bogus billing by organised gangs, a delegation of prominent businessmen met state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Monday evening. Businessmen alleged that as cases of bogus billing were on the rise in the city, the input tax credit (ITC) of the genuine businessmen was getting blocked or reversed by the GST authorities. The meeting was arranged by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu whom businessmen had apprised of the problem. During the meeting, Badal assured the businessmen to take up their concerns with the GST council. Dev Gupta, vice-president of the All India Induction Furnace Association, said, “Genuine businessmen, especially those in the furnace and steel rolling business, are facing problems due to bogus billing by organised syndicates. Often the GST credit or ITC of the genuine companies on the purchase of raw materials, like scrap, is blocked or reversed by the GST authorities due to suspicious or bogus transactions done by fraudsters who are in the supply chain at levels two or three. These fraudsters, who often make firms on fictitious or stolen particulars, manage to dodge the authorities, but the department penalises people like us who are at the end of supply chain and have done genuine transactions.”Gupta added, “To date, dozens of genuine companies have suffered due to the frauds committed by others and our GST refunds worth several crores have either been blocked, rejected or even reversed. We have apprised finance minister Badal of the entire issue and requested him to urge the GST council to communicate it to the higher authorities. Badal has assured us that he would pursue this matter with the GST council and try his best to get it resolved.”KK Garg, president of Induction Furnace Association of North India, said, “One of the main reasons why bogus billing of scrap is done so frequently by fraudsters is the high rate of 18% GST on it. If the rate is slashed on the sale of scrap, it will definitely deter the tax evaders. Therefore, we have requested the finance minister to convince the GST council to reduce the rate of GST on scrap to 5% at the earliest.”Harish Dua, president of Knitwear and Apparel Exporters Organisation, said, “Bogus billing has become a very serious problem and that is why departments are doing their best to plug it. But more steps are needed to bring out a permanent solution as this malpractice hurts genuine businessmen. We are hoping that GST council will respond positively to our suggestions being sent through the Punjab finance minister.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-meet-fm-list-bogus-billing-woes/articleshow/85218313.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra Sadan case: ‘No irregularity by developer, no undue benefit’||MUMBAI: Discharging the developer, architect and two “sleeping partners” of the development firm accused in the Maharashtra Sadan case, the court said the facts and evidence clearly indicate that the developer Ms KS Chamankar Enterprises had not committed any irregularity in the transaction. The court said no undue benefit has been given to the developer in the contract. Four members of the Chamankar family — partner Krushna Chamankar, his brother, architect Prasanna Chamankar and two others who the court concluded were sleeping partners in the firm, Pravina Chamankar and Praneeta Chamankar — were discharged on July 31. The court said that at the outset, there is no evidence that Rs 13.5 crore was paid by the developer itself to cabinet minister Chaggan Bhujbal and the NCP leader’s son, nephew, and staffers and their family members, who are accused in the case. “It also appears that undue advantage of Rs 13.5 crores was reached to accused No 1 (Chaggan Bhujbal) and 12 to 17 (Pankaj Bhujbal, Sameer Bhujbal, Tanveer Shaikh, Iram Shaikh and Sanjay Joshi),” the court said. The court said so far as sending the money is concerned, the developer cannot be held responsible “as there was neither any illegal act nor while doing legal act, illegal means were adopted, which is a basic and essential requirement of the criminal conspiracy.” “Whether the amount of Rs. 13.5 crores received by accused No 1 and 12 to 17 was of corruption or undue advantage or not, is a question of fact, which can be determined on the basis of the relevant materials,” it said. The case concerns a contract the NCP leader allegedly gave K S Chamankar Enterprises in 2005 without inviting tenders when he was PWD minister. The builder got development rights of a slum on RTO land in Andheri, with the condition that Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi, RTO building in Andheri and a guest house on Malabar Hill be constructed in return. The firm is said to have entered into an agreement with another company for the work and afterwards sold development rights of the RTO land to a construction company. Bhujbal is accused of receiving kickbacks and is booked under Prevention of Corruption Act. It was alleged that as a result of the contract, undue advantage was earned by the developer and losses were caused to the state government. The court in its order denied payment of furniture work of Maharashtra Sadan, Delhi was made to a company without any negotiation by the developer and thereby a kickback of around Rs 6.03 core has been given to Chhagan Bhujbal. “There is no document on record showing that without putting the furniture in the Maharashtra Sadan, a payment has been made to the M/a Origin Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and said payment reached to accused No 1 (Bhujbal) as kickback,” the court said. It said mere making of payment to the company for furniture work without any negotiation does not lead to infer that kickback was paid. The court rejected allegations by the prosecution that intentionally, the cost of construction of Maharashtra Sadan and RTO Building and others had been increased to show less profit to the developer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-irregularity-by-developer-no-undue-benefit/articleshow/85227040.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘No entrance, spike in 90% scorers to push up cut-offs’||MUMBAI: With no Common Entrance Test (CET) for first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions and boards recording a jump in their 90%-plus scorers this year, city college principals expect the cut-offs to go north. The registration process for online admissions will start on August 16 and subsequently students will be allowed to fill their choice of colleges too. As the merit list will be largely based on internal evaluation by schools, the fear of high-scoring students not making it to the college of their choice is a concern for many. Asgar Lakdawala, founder and chairperson of Royal College, Mira Road, said, “With all high scorers placed on the same level, what guarantees a genuine student a seat of his or her choice?” In Mumbai, around 15,500 SSC students scored more than 90% as opposed to 14,700 last year. The CBSE board also saw a 40% jump in their 90%-plus scorers from the previous year. “For every one bright student, we will have to be ready for three to four students who have got inflated scores,” said a city college principal, adding all colleges will see a jump in their cut-offs compared with the previous year.  “Merit lists could get chaotic with so many high scoring students across boards,” said Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal of Kelkar-Vaze’s junior college. Colleges now have to wait for the first merit list to get a clear picture of how and where students are seeking admissions, said Neelam Arora, principal, Lala Lajpatrai Commerce College, Mahalaxmi. Another principal said since CET was delaying the academic cycle, it is better to go by board results. Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College and senior dean, HSNC University, said: “Holding a common test for admissions when the syllabus of all boards is not calibrated was unfair to a section of students. Last year, students scoring 90-91% were also seeking admissions under the management quota. This year, it could get worse. Since there are plenty of seats for all, students should secure seats wherever allotted.” In Mumbai division, there were 3.2 lakh seats in 2020-21. A total of 2.6 lakh students applied, of whom 2.2 lakh or 86% students got admitted. Around 30% seats were vacant and admission for Class XI for 2020-21 extended till as late as March 2021. Across the state, 32% FYJC seats were vacant. This year too state education minister Varsha Gaikwad has assured seats to all students. With exams cancelled, all registered students were declared passed. With a delay in admissions and CET, a fair number of students from CBSE and ICSE had decided to pursue junior college in their respective schools. A few may try their luck at a college of choice, said a principal. Colleges in MMR, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nagpur, Nashik, Aurangabad and Amaravati will be part of the online centralized admission process for Class XI. In May, the state had warned colleges against conducting admissions before the CET results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-entrance-spike-in-90-scorers-to-push-up-cut-offs/articleshow/85224377.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Nagpur||‘States should spend to make infrastructure, assets climate proof’, says Abinash Mohanty||NAGPUR: Be it Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra or North India — the country is drowning in floods. The IPCC report, which was released on Monday, warns that there are going to be more as monsoon extremes are likely to increase over India. To dig into the causes and mitigation required, TOI speaks to climate expert Abinash Mohanty, who is also the programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). Excerpts: CEEW analysis says there has been a six-fold increase in frequency of extreme floods in the state in last 50 years. What would you attribute this to? The changing patterns in extreme climate events are triggered by local climate change drivers such as land-use surface change, deforestation, and encroachments upon natural ecosystems. The analysis suggests that 40% of Indian districts are showcasing an extreme event swapping trend — flood-prone areas are becoming drought-prone and vice versa. Geographically, all regions have natural drainage which is either encroached or blocked due to flawed urban planning, resulting in increased frequency of urban flooding. Further, due to climate change, monsoons are delayed, erratic and incessant, resulting in a surge in extreme rainfall events. How has been the government’s response to this extreme climate crisis? India, as a country, has spearheaded the climate action agenda globally. It’s leadership has conceptualised a 21st century multilateral organisation — CDRI (Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure) to climate-proof infrastructure across vulnerable regions. While our national-level model is replicated and acknowledged globally, we need to step up our sub-national and localised disaster risk reduction actions, which are often the missing links. The quantum of lives lost has come down substantially, but the loss of property, livelihood, and infrastructure is at an all-time high. This needs razor-sharp focus on identifying the compounded impacts of climate change at localised levels and strengthening the adaptive capacity to build back, better and stronger. How is the state performing when it comes to mitigation measures and adaptation? There is no straight answer to this. States like Odisha and Kerala have surpassed disaster preparedness compared to their peers. While states are gearing up adaptation actions, financing remains a challenge. Providing dynamism to the national action plan on climate change and its sub-national predecessor — state action plan on climate change is critical since financing climate actions needs a shared vision and responsibility. The mitigation actions at the sub-national level are now both public and private-led, but adaptation actions are primarily borne by public expenditure. All these years, we have been witnessing a climate change denial. Often, a link between these events to climate change and ultimately loss of human life would not be accepted. Your views on this. Climate change is a lived reality, and each one of us is witnessing it. There is more acceptance since we have empirical evidence to show the impact that climate change poses on lives and livelihoods. In recent decades, India has averted the extent of loss of lives due to effective disaster response and rehabilitation. What it lacks is the climate-proofing of its assets and infrastructures, where the maximum extent of loss and damage is witnessed. Enhanced disaster preparedness can avert the extent of loss and damage. Hundreds of people have died in Maharashtra due to floods. Is it OK to state now that the state is reeling under growing threat of climate change? What should be done by the government? States across eastern and western coasts are witnessing compounding impacts of climate risks and ecosystem damage. Restoring natural ecosystems like mangroves, forests and wetlands can mitigate the microclimatic changes leading to increased dry spells and desertification, and act as shock-absorbers against other extreme events like floods and cyclones. Further, climate-vulnerable states like Maharashtra must accelerate the climate-proofing of critical infrastructure, industry and communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/states-should-spend-to-make-infra-assets-climate-proof/articleshow/85221719.cms||Manka Behl

Using an international number, he claimed to be based abroad in phone calls. According to joint commissioner (crime) Alok Kumar, the arrest was the result of a coordinated interstate operation with Bihar Police. “Singh (23) was wanted in two murders and an extortion case in Bihar. Later, he started his criminal operations from here,” Kumar said. On August 9, Bihar Police informed Delhi Police about Singh who was staying in Gopalpur village in Wazirabad. It was found that he had fled to Delhi after a murder in Motihari. He was using an international WhatsApp number and the last extortion call was made on Sunday to a furniture businessman. Singh threatened to eliminate him and his family if Rs 10 lakh was not paid. A joint team of Bihar Police consisting of SIs Arvind Dubey and Manish Kumar and inspectors Sandeep and Satish from Delhi arrested him from a rented room in Gopalpur. Singh, an associate of Bihar-based extortionist Suman Jha since March 2019, has been handed over to Bihar Police. In 2019, Singh had jumped bail and absconded.

---||Ahmedabad||Rs 4.8 lakh drawn with Rs 135 cheque: Bank told to pay||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has ordered ICICI Bank Ltd to refund an account holder as Rs 4.8 lakh was withdrawn from his account after he issued an account payee cheque for Rs 135. The bank claimed the fraud was committed by a third party and it was not liable to pay for it. This case involved a Shahibaug-resident, Uday Pandya, who wanted to go to Canada and issued an account-payee cheque of Rs 135 in the name of VFS Canada in April 2008. Pandya had Rs 5.08 lakh in his savings account with ICICI Bank. He later learned that Rs 4.8 lakh was withdrawn from his account. On inquiry, the bank showed him a bearer cheque of Rs 4.8lakh issued by him to be paid to ‘self’. Pandya disputed the cheque’s veracity and claimed that he had not issued the bearer cheque. He filed a police complaint, but the case was closed. However, the FSL report revealed that the cheque had been rewritten. Pandya insisted on a refund saying that the bank paid the money on the strength of a cheque whose authenticity was not verified by the bank officials. Pandya sued the bank unsuccessfully with the Ahmedabad District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (Rural). This led him to the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, where his lawyer argued that in case of a cheque worth over Rs 50,000, the cheque must be examined under an ultraviolet ray machine before clearing it for payment. The bank officials did not take other precautions laid down in the rules. He alleged negligence on the part of the bank in clearing the cheque. The bank defended itself saying the fraud was committed by a third party and it was not responsible. It also argued that the complainant could not be reached for verification, and an SMS alert was sent. The judicial member of the commission, M J Mehta, did not agree with the bank’s arguments and held that it was the duty of the bank to verify the cheque according to the rules and regulations established by the Reserve Bank of India. The bank did not follow the rules adopted by itself. It lacked in performing its duty and was deficient in service. It said that the Consumer Protection Act is the ultimate remedy in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-4-8l-drawn-with-rs-135-cheque-bank-told-to-pay/articleshow/85221757.cms||---

Businessmen alleged that as cases of bogus billing were on the rise in the city, the input tax credit (ITC) of the genuine businessmen was getting blocked or reversed by the GST authorities. The meeting was arranged by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu whom businessmen had apprised of the problem. During the meeting, Badal assured the businessmen to take up their concerns with the GST council. Dev Gupta, vice-president of the All India Induction Furnace Association, said, “Genuine businessmen, especially those in the furnace and steel rolling business, are facing problems due to bogus billing by organised syndicates. Often the GST credit or ITC of the genuine companies on the purchase of raw materials, like scrap, is blocked or reversed by the GST authorities due to suspicious or bogus transactions done by fraudsters who are in the supply chain at levels two or three. These fraudsters, who often make firms on fictitious or stolen particulars, manage to dodge the authorities, but the department penalises people like us who are at the end of supply chain and have done genuine transactions.”Gupta added, “To date, dozens of genuine companies have suffered due to the frauds committed by others and our GST refunds worth several crores have either been blocked, rejected or even reversed. We have apprised finance minister Badal of the entire issue and requested him to urge the GST council to communicate it to the higher authorities. Badal has assured us that he would pursue this matter with the GST council and try his best to get it resolved.”KK Garg, president of Induction Furnace Association of North India, said, “One of the main reasons why bogus billing of scrap is done so frequently by fraudsters is the high rate of 18% GST on it. If the rate is slashed on the sale of scrap, it will definitely deter the tax evaders. Therefore, we have requested the finance minister to convince the GST council to reduce the rate of GST on scrap to 5% at the earliest.”Harish Dua, president of Knitwear and Apparel Exporters Organisation, said, “Bogus billing has become a very serious problem and that is why departments are doing their best to plug it. But more steps are needed to bring out a permanent solution as this malpractice hurts genuine businessmen. We are hoping that GST council will respond positively to our suggestions being sent through the Punjab finance minister.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bogus-billing-causing-problems-to-genuine-bizmen-they-meet-fm/articleshow/85218594.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Ahmedabad||Prosecution, courts should go for quality evidence, not quantity: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: In an important order, the Gujarat high court has observed that the prosecution should insist on quality evidence and not on quantity and should refrain from unnecessarily examining more witnesses, which causes delay in trial and looks bad on part of the judiciary as well as against the interest of accused and victims too. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati insisted on speedy trial while hearing a bail application by one Shaileshbhai Barvadiya, who is jailed in a fake currency case being prosecuted by the National Investigation Agency before a special court in Ahmedabad. Since Barvadiya is behind bars for nearly four years, the HC sought a report on trial’s status from the special NIA judge, Shubhada Baxi. She informed that prosecution intends to examine 50 more witnesses and the trial would take at lest 1.5 years to complete. Upon hearing about possible delay, the judges said, “We would say that [delays] are bad for the accused and extremely bad for the victims, for Indian society and for the credibility of our justice system, which is valued. Judges are the masters of their courtrooms and the Criminal Procedure Code provides many tools for the judges to use in order to ensure that cases proceed efficiently.” The judges deprecated the prosecution’s practice of examining all witnesses. “We fail to understand why the prosecuting agency has to examine 40 – 50 – 60 witnesses in a trial… It is well settled that it is the quality of the evidence that matters and not the quantity. If the case of the prosecution could be established by examining 10 witnesses, then what is the need to examine 30 witnesses.” The HC further said, “The guilt of an accused may be proved even by the testimony of a single witness, if such witness is found to be wholly reliable. There is another danger in insisting on plurality of witnesses. Irrespective of the quality of the oral evidence of a single witness, if the courts were to insist on plurality of witnesses in proof of any fact, they will be indirectly encouraging subordination of witnesses.” The HC found that the principal sessions judge hears seven NIA cases, the 2002 Naroda Gam case as special judge and other regular judicial work and is overburdened. The bench requested the chief justice to appoint two more special judges considering that most of the accused are waiting for the trials to get over in NIA cases for years together. The HC has sought another report from the NIA judge by November 22, when it would decide on bail plea of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prosecution-courts-should-go-for-quality-evidence-not-quantity-hc/articleshow/85221801.cms||---

While many were holding hockey sticks as a tribute, others were holding selfie-sticks with the hope of taking a snap with the Olympian. Besides displaying banners and posters featuring Sreejesh’s photos, a grand chenda melam was also arranged by the fans. Sports minister V Abdurahiman was present at the airport to officially welcome the Olympian on behalf of the state government. Aluva MLA Anwar Sadath, Kunnathunad MLA P V Sreenijin, district collector Jafar Malik and state sports council president Mercy Kuttan were also present. Sreejesh’s family members father P R Raveendran, mother Ushakumari, wife Aneeshya and children Anusree and Sriansh were present inside the terminal while friends, fans and well-wishers crowded outside the terminal. The minister honoured Sreejesh inside the terminal by garlanding him after the flight landed by 5.15pm. After meeting with his family, Sreejesh handed the bronze medal to his father, Raveendran and dedicated his victory to him and family. Members of DYFI, Youth Congress and the BJP were also among the crowd shouting and cheering for the sportsman. Members of various hockey teams in the state, State Olympics Association, various sport clubs, etc. too were there. However, Sreejesh, accompanied by the minister, MLA and his family could not even halt for a minute outside the terminal as the police struggled to manage the crowd cheering for him. The police immediately escorted him to an open jeep, which later drove along with a convoy to his house in Kizhakambalam. A grand reception was held at his native place by family and friends. The Covid protocols were completely violated at the airport during the reception. Despite the deployment of police and CISF security personnel at the terminal the crowd was hard to control. Social distancing protocols were fully ignored and some were not even wearing face masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sreejesh-returns-home-to-a-rousing-reception/articleshow/85221854.cms||---

The Congress MLA has demanded that the Bill should be completely scrapped. Lourenco also urged civil society, NGOs, political parties and interested stakeholders to come together and launch a movement against the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021. “BJP wants to change the demography of Goa, it has been their plan for the last so many years and it has been proved by the facts of this case,” said Lourenco. “For them to win, this is their masterplan. They have compromised the interests of the state to stay in power.” The Congress MLA said that BJP wants to dilute the definition of ‘Niz Goemkars’ by allowing encroachers who have been residing in Goa to be classified as sons of the soil. “The houses of the real bhumiputras of Goa are either closed or in ruins. The new bhumiputras who have been defined in the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarni Act are now occupying these houses. This shows the masterplan of BJP,” said Lourenco. He also said that senior BJP politicians have been purchasing land across Goa, which the government is facilitating. He described North Goa as a “mini-BJP” where land has been sold to residents of North India. “Few Goan owners are left. The rest are outsiders and this is the evil design of the BJP. There are no sons of the soil who are running hotels, getting employed,” said Lourenco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjps-masterplan-is-to-alter-goas-demography-says-lourenco/articleshow/85224392.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt imposes stiff curbs on interstate deputation of babus||MUMBAI: Stringent restrictions were placed on interstate deputation of IRS as well as IAS, IPS and IFS officers, who are domiciled in Maharashtra but have been allotted to other cadres, on Monday. The general administration department led by CM Uddhav Thackeray said in an order that all-India administrative, police and forest service officers will be considered for deputation in the state for three years, which can be extended by another two years. Such deputation will be considered if the husband or wife of the official is working in Maharashtra or on health grounds of family members. The order issued by GAD joint secretary Ajit Patil clarified that as far as revenue service officers are concerned, interstate deputation will be considered only if the husband or wife is working with the state government or a state-run undertaking. It added that they will not be considered for posts reserved for IAS, IPS and IFS and that the deputation of those IRS officers who have completed five years should be terminated. A former principal secretary felt it was high time deputation rules were made stringent and such officers were denied plum assignments. It was important to keep a level playing field for the Maharashtra cadre officers. During the tenure of Devendra Fadnavis, an Uttarakhand IAS officer was appointed collector of Nagpur, the former CM’s hometown. After completing a two-year tenure, he was appointed Mumbai suburban collector, the most sought after post in the state. He later took up assignment at Raj Bhavan and is now back in Uttarakhand. Similarly, a senior IRS officer was first appointed additional commissioner in the BMC, then made FDA commissioner and, after the change of government, appointed in the home department as joint secretary. Another IRS officer, who was associated with a senior BJP leader, was appointed a municipal commissioner in the MMR. “If they are keen to serve their home state, instead of waiting for plum assignments, they must accept any job,” the former officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-imposes-stiff-curbs-on-interstate-deputation-of-babus/articleshow/85224479.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Nigerian national held for Rs 52 lakh fraud||AHMEDABAD: An Odhav-based trader got reeled in by an offer that was too good to be true. A Nigeria-based company offered $200 for 10ml of ‘Urazi Herbal Oil’, citing its medicinal properties. The callers told the trader that it is difficult to get the oil, and if he could source it from India, they would pay him handsomely. There was only one catch, the trader would have to get the oil checked for quality. The money would be paid only if it matched the required standard. “It was a con from the start, with buyers and inspectors from the same gang. The trader got lured by the astronomical amount offered for 500 litres of the oil, and kept paying till he had lost Rs 52 lakh,” said a cyber cell official. Based on a complaint for cheating and breach of trust, a team reached Delhi and nabbed Essis Esmel Octave, 23, a Nigerian national. The investigators have also traced the bank accounts and phone numbers used by the accused. Cyber cell officials warned traders of this modus operandi where they are approached from an international number and offered a good sum if they can procure oil ‘available only in India.’ “Don’t transact over any such offers or share account details,” said an investigator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nigerian-national-held-for-rs-52l-fraud/articleshow/85221856.cms||---

---||Meerut||UP: Outfit conducts ‘drive to ensure no Muslim applies mehndi to Hindu women on Teej'||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Ahead of Hartalika Teej on August 11, activists of lesser-known Hindu outfit Kranti Sena conducted a “checking drive” in the main markets of Muzaffarnagar on Tuesday and appealed to people to “not allow Muslim men to apply mehndi on the hands of Hindu women as they indulge in love jihad”. They also appealed to shopkeepers to not employ Muslims for giving haircuts. The outfit’s general secretary, Manoj Saini, said, “On the pretext of these odd jobs, Muslim youths entice Hindu girls and trap them in love jihad.” “We have checked several shops and appealed to the owners to not employ Muslim youths as they indulge in love jihad. We got to know about instances of love jihad on the pretext of applying mehndi on Hindu women earlier,” Saini added. A shopkeeper, on the condition of anonymity, said, “They came to our shops but I actually did not understand what they wanted to convey.” Another shopkeeper said, “How can we employ people on the basis of their religion? Besides, the customers that come to us have never asked about the faith of our staff.” Superintendent of police (city) Arpit Vijayvargiya said, “If someone makes a complaint against anyone who is forcing him to not do his work, action will be taken accordingly. So far, no complaint has been made by any shopkeeper or worker.” According to data released by the state police last month, at least 80 people are behind bars and another 21 are on the run in Uttar Pradesh after being booked under the state’s 'love jihad' law. Since the promulgation of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 in November last year, police have filed 63 FIRs and booked 162 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/outfit-conducts-drive-to-ensure-no-muslim-applies-mehndi-to-hindu-women-on-teej/articleshow/85218840.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Today, it has increased to Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh along with quarantine and testing facilities in other countries. With Doha extending quarantine period from three to 10 days, the only other route feasible is through Mexico,” said parent of a city-based youth whose first semester starts from September 7. “Due to high rush, prices are hiked everywhere. We are told that the chartered flights from Maldives is the only option we have despite the obvious risks involved.” How does the route work? Sameer Yadav, a city-based immigration consultant, said that the agents from across the country try to pool in resources and book a flight where up to 150 students can go directly to Toronto. “The students get RT-PCR done at Maldives, stay for two days, and then take the flight. We are not sure when the direct flights would resume, so many parents and students are taking every chance,” he said. The parents meanwhile are scurrying for resources and praying for intervention by any of the two governments. “We brought so many Indians back through Vande Bharat mission. Why can’t we send our students to Canada with due precaution? Till they reach Canada, we can’t sleep. Almost all students are travelling abroad for the first time, and are at mercy of the agents. Is the risk worth taking?” asked a city-based textile unit owner whose son is all set to board a flight to Doha later this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/students-forced-to-take-circuitous-routes-to-canada/articleshow/85222004.cms||Parth Shastri

Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre informed the HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni that its transfer petition was not listed before the Supreme Court and the government mentioned and has sought an early date. The Centre said 14 such challenges have been filed across various high courts, and it has sought that all matters be heard together before the SC. He cited a Madras HC order that had issued only notice but didn't pass any interim order to stay the new rules. The HC orally suggested if a stay is granted in the PIL and if it eventually fails, the petitioner cannot plead protection for anything written or published in the interregnum which may be in breach of reasonable restrictions, but a sword would be hanging on their heads then. "Can we think of a workable solution in the meantime," it asked. To a query, Singh said replies before other HCs were under preparation and are likely to be filed soon. He sought time till Monday to file a reply, but it was suggested that a short affidavit be filed to deal with the stay plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/reply-by-tomorrow-why-interim-relief-not-be-given-on-it-rules-hc/articleshow/85228455.cms||Swati Deshpande

Goencho Avaaz said that that the purpose of the bill is to get “unsuspecting people” to share data of contentious plots which the government will share with real estate developers. “Under the guise of providing land and housing to the new ‘Bhumiputras’, this bill is in reality a massive data collection exercise by the government, to be used against the people for the benefit of the real estate lobby. The authorities intend to share this data with the real estate lobby, which is on the prowl for land that is in increasingly short supply in Goa,” said Viriato Fernandes, state convener of Goencho Avaaz Party. Fernandes said that the data of illegalities will be used to blackmail and extort those living in unauthorised structures. “Corruption will increase manifold. This was clearly seen in 2017 in Zuari Nagar, Sancoale, where people were promised legalisation of their illegal structures on payment of unreceipted money. To date, despite the money having allegedly changed hands, the status quo remains unchanged, and as usual it is the people who continue to suffer,” said Fernandes. President of Goencho Avaaz Party Swapnesh Sherlekar said panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho is the architect of the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill. “His long history of alleged manipulation and deceit has been the hallmark of his political career and has been instrumental in preparing him to pull off this Bill, which is the mother of all scams,” said Sherlekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/realty-lobby-land-sharks-will-gain-from-bhumiputra-bill/articleshow/85224604.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The district administration and police have intensified relief operations to meet the basic requirements of the people stranded in their homes in low- lying areas on the banks of the Ganga and its tributaries, including Varuna. UP ministers Neelkanth Tiwari, Ravindra Jaiswal and Anil Rajbhar toured the marooned people in boats and gave them relief material. According to the bulletin of the Central Water Commission’s Middle Ganga Division office, the water level of the Ganga in Varanasi, which had crossed the danger mark of 71.12-meter on Monday morning, crossed the mark of 71.88-meter and was increasing at the rate of 1cm to 2cm per hour. As the rising trend in upstream at Phaphamu and Prayagraj has stopped, the officials expected that water level in the Ganga will become stable on Wednesday or Thursday before touching the highest flood level of 2016 when the river had gone up to 72.56-meter mark against all time high flood level (HFL) of 73.90-meter recorded in 1978. In 2013, the Ganga level had gone up to 72.63-meter. In Mirzapur, the Ganga was flowing at 77.87-meter after crossing the danger mark of 77.72-meter and the rising trend was maintained. In Ghazipur, the river was flowing at 64.21-meter against the danger mark of 63.10-meter. The river was on a rampage in Ballia, where against the danger mark of 57.61-meter it was flowing at 59.67-meter and inching closer to an all-time high of 60.39-meter recorded on August 25, 2016.The overflowing Ganga has started flo oding villages in Varanasi’s Rohania area upstream and also in the belts of Chiragaon and Chaubeypur downstream. Many more residential colonies in Samneghat area have now been marooned while bodies were being taken to Manikarnika Ghat’s upper platform for cremation on boats. Further spread of flood water through river Varuna has marooned localities in Hukulganj, Raja Bazar of Nadesar. The Ganga s water has not only come on roads leading to the ghats, but problems like chocking of sewage have also been reported from many areas in the city. In view of the worsening flood situation, UP minister of state (independent charge) for tourism and religious affairs Neelkanth Tiwari along with commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh and district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma toured the flood-hit areas along the river Varuna in a boat. Apart from distributing foodgrain and other essential articles among people staying at upper floors of their marooned homes, he also interacted with them to know their other requirements. Tiwari said, “The government and administration are ensuring that nobody in flood-hit areas remains empty stomach. Each ration pack being given to flood-hit people contains food material for 42 days. More relief will be ensured as per the requirement of the people.” Jaiswal and Rajbhar provided relief material to needy people in Dhelvaria and Salarpur Kotwa areas. Regarding the flood menace, the DM said, “By Wednesday afternoon over 30,000 population of more than 6,000 families of urban and rural areas of Varanasi was affected. Of these, 2,838 people of over 600 families are in 21 relief camps. Hundreds of families have shifted to the places of their preference while many affected people are still staying at upper floors of their homes.” “A total of 85 boats have been engaged for relief operations, food and essential article distribution and commuting of people staying in flood affected areas. Besides feeding people through 28 community kitchens, including 21 in relief camps, 1,900 packets of dry ration has been been distributed,” he said. He added, “from Wednesday morning distribution of milk packets and 200-litre water bottles will also be started in the flood-hit areas where people are staying in their homes. All the distribution work is being ensured through corporators and gram pradhans after seeking lists of requirement of flood-hit families.” The DM said, “The district administration is making all arrangements to continue the relief operations for next four-five days even if the level of the Ganga becomes stable on Wednesday or Thursday. It will take time of a few days to recede after which water will start clearing from the villages and urban localities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/rising-ganga-floods-more-localities-in-urban-rural-areas/articleshow/85224527.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

In a letter to mayor Kishori Pednekar, BJP MLA Ameet Satam has alleged that the promotions of 105 assistant engineers and 27 executive engineers have been held up as the civic general body has deferred its meetings thrice. “This is part of a major cash-for-promotion racket in the BMC,” claimed Satam. “Three meetings have been deferred and the promotions’ proposal, which was circulated in the general body as urgent business, has been stuck. I have been informed that only those engineers who pay up will be promoted.” In April, Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh had alleged a cash-for-transfer scam in the BMC. In a letter to BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal, Shaikh alleged that there was massive corruption in the city engineers’ department which regulates the transfers and postings. “All postings and transfers in the BMC are being done on payment of cash. This is the reason why engineers are not doing their work diligently and there are so many incidents and accidents in Mumbai. The fire at Bhandup’s Sunrise Hospital in Dreams Mall is a prime example,” Shaikh alleged. Shaikh had also asked Chahal to initiate a detailed inquiry into the transfers of engineers and asked him to shift those who have completed their tenure in a particular department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-130-engineers-promotions-held-up-by-civic-body-in-mumbai-bjp/articleshow/85227241.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) will distribute marksheets to the district education officer (DEO) offices across the state on August 11, said a source in GSHSEB. “DEO offices will then send them to schools. The majority of schools in the state are expected to hand over marksheets and certificates on August 12 itself,” said an official. After cancelling the Class 12 exams this year due to Covid-19, the state education department worked out the marks tabulation criteria for evaluating the performance of students. Not a single student was to be failed, in line with the government’s decision to give mass promotion to all regular school students this year. The board recently declared results for Class 12 general stream students in which about 4,00,127 regular students passed. Even as the board announced a 100% result due to mass promotion this year, there has been a decline in the number of students who scored more than 90%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-12-marksheets-on-august-12/articleshow/85221969.cms||---

The report talks of sea level rise as already happening across the world and also warns that climate change has set in. The NASA report on sea level rise includes cities like Kochi where the projected rise is about 1-3 ft by the end of the century. Experts said that coastal states will feel the impact not only by sea intrusions but also increasing salinity in groundwater systems. “Kerala should look at equipping itself with more early warning systems so that life and property could be saved. More investment would be needed on increasing the communication channels that too in local language and larger reach,” said Ulka Khelkar, director-climate change, World Resources Institute-India. She suggested that developmental projects will have to adopt more sensible patterns in land use. “Buildings on hillsides which have been eroded or denuded of vegetation could be a strict no-no in the event of extreme rainfall events that are already happening in Kerala.” A one-degree rise in temperature could trigger an increase in average rainfall events by 7%. “Kerala is more urbanized than many cities in the country and hence development should now be keeping in mind that climate change has already set in.” Keeping climate mitigation in mind, more insurance schemes should be introduced for farmers and fishermen who are losing out to sudden changes in climate. “They need a safety net and insurance schemes could be a way,” Khelkar said. Climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll said studies done at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) have shown that trends in heavy rain events are actually larger over central Kerala, compared to other regions. “Hence the chances of landslides and floods are also high here, especially since land use changes, mining, and river encroachment are rampant.” Koll, one of the scientists who contributed to the last IPCC report, said that land use changes in Western Ghats are causing landslides during heavy rains . “The limitation is that we have not quantified it, though we see it happening,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ipcc-report-on-climate-change-a-timely-warning-for-kerala/articleshow/85222033.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

He assured the flood victims that the government is with them all the time. Yogi reached here immediately after attending the inauguration of Ujjwala 2.0 in Mahoba. In Hamirpur, he reviewed the areas affected by flooding of rivers Yamuna and Betwa, after which he straight away went to the collectorate where he held a review meeting with the officials and instructed them to send medical teams in waterlogged areas to stop the outbreak of an epidemic. While talking to reporters, he expressed satisfaction over the relief work being carried out by the administration and public representatives, and said that adequate relief material was being provided. After the survey In Jalaun, Yogi met with the flood victims and administrative officers at Shravan Kumar Degree College in Jagammanpur of Madhogarh tehsil. After distributing relief material, Yogi held a detailed review meeting with the officials and directed them to intensify flood relief efforts. He also appealed to the people to avoid going near rivers and asked the children not to take selfies at such places as it may turn fatal. Yogi said that the flood was caused due to release of water in the Chambal from Kota dam and Haryana, but it is expected that the water will recede in the next two to three days. He expressed condolences to the families of four persons, who lost their lives in the floods and assured all possible help. He also said that community kitchens have been formed to supply cooked food to those families whose houses have been submerged in flood water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-yogi-surveys-flood-affected-areas-in-hamirpur-and-jalaun/articleshow/85224648.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Students ‘relieved of burden’, say will focus on admission||Mumbai: Palash Jain has put away his books finally. After scoring an impressive 99.8% in ICSE Class X, he was preparing for CET to get a commerce college of his choice. Jain is among the lakhs of students who are happy they do not have to take a physical test in the pandemic. The state’s decision to have an optional CET based on SSC syllabus was met with resistance from students across boards. Students said if they were evaluated by a methodology adopted by the boards, their admissions should be based on those scores. The ICSE board too had requested the state to admit students based on Class X results. “We have been honest in awarding marks to students. The methodology used to evaluate students was foolproof,” said the principal of an ICSE school in the city. She added students have been relieved of a burden. Lekh Jain, who secured 90.6% in CBSE Class X exams, said, “No CET is a much-needed relief. We can now fully focus on Class XI admissions.” While students had mixed feelings about the cancellation of Class X exams, they thought of CET as a hurdle. “Studying all subjects for a 100-mark paper seemed a bit of a task. I was fine with appearing for a board exam,” said Radhika Mane, an SSC student who secured 95%. It is now that Sara Fatima is celebrating her 92% in SSC. “I was preparing for the CET but wanted it to be cancelled. Now I am looking forward to my college life,” said Sara. Kirti Barnwal, who was under pressure from family to write the CET, is equally happy. “My 64% was more than my expectations. I did not want to risk it with a CET, she said. Non-state boards realised their students would be at a loss if the CET had subjects of SSC curriculum. Francis Joseph, director of School Leaders Network, which coordinated with the state on behalf of various education boards, said, “This is possibly the first time that all four education boards took a common stand requesting the Maharashtra government to cancel the CET. For the coming years, the boards should collaborate to develop an inclusive CET in advance to avoid such a situation.” Rohan Bhat, chairperson of the Children’s Academy Group of Schools, said the idea itself was flawed. Advocate Anubha Sahai, president of India Wide Parents Association, said no state was conducting CET for Class XI admission. For those like Priyanshi Desai, who has already joined a high school, a CET never mattered. With a high score of 99.8%, the ICSE student has been busy preparing for the NEET medical entrance two years hence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-students-relieved-of-burden-say-will-focus-on-admission/articleshow/85224719.cms||Sandhya Nair

The deadline to pay premiums at 50% discount ends on August 19. BMC officials said that the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (MCHI) and Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) had put in a request with the BMC to keep its offices open on all days till August 19 so that builders could pay the premiums before the deadline. “The state government has issued directions for giving relief to the industry, thereby reducing the percentage of premiums and also waived the development cess till 19.08.2021. During the last 16 months, there were crises due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There were restrictions and hence developers could not process the files. Now since the deadline is 19.08.2021, and now relaxation is given by the state government for movement, CREDAI-MCHI has requested to keep BP and DP offices open on all days till August 19,” the BMC’s note read. The proposal to keep all BP and DP department offices open on all days was approved by municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal. The state government had in January issued a GR slashing construction premiums paid by builders by 50% after the cabinet approved it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-help-builders-pay-slashed-premiums-no-holiday-at-bmc/articleshow/85227327.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

They are M K Biju, 45; C K Jils, 43; and K Reji, 44. While Biju was the manager of the bank, Jils was its accountant and Reji was the accountant at the supermarket supported by the bank. The prosecution alleged that the accused disbursed loans to multiple people using the same land as collateral without the knowledge of its actual owner. The accused had also allegedly tampered with the bank’s software and accounting system for misappropriating over Rs 100 crore. Prosecutor K D Babu told the court that the investigation in the case is at the threshold stage and the accused should not be granted anticipatory bail at this stage. Meanwhile, the judicial first class magistrate of Irinjalakuda remanded former secretary of the bank T R Sunilkumar to 14 days in judicial custody. Sunilkumar, the first accused, was arrested on Monday. In another development, the high court dismissed Sunilkumar’s bail petition after the additional prosecution director informed the court that he has already been arrested. The court posted the bail petition filed by another accused, A K Jejoy, for hearing on September 1. Another accused, Kiran, has filed an anticipatory bail petition at the principal district sessions court. The petition has been posted for hearing on August 13. Only one of the six accused in the case has been arrested so far. The probe team led by the Crime Branch SP, K Sudarshan has expressed the confidence that the others will also be arrested soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/anticipatory-bail-plea-of-3-accused-rejected/articleshow/85222127.cms||---

With an estimated 48 million infertile couples worldwide, reduction in sperm motility (sperm movement) is one of the major causes of male infertility. Motility is essential for sperm to reach the site of fertilization during natural conception. Researchers from IIT-H, Mangalore University and the Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education took up a funded project by the department of science and technology’s science and engineering research board to design the molecule that makes IVF more successful. The research was recently published in peer-reviewed journal Nature Scientific Reports. In IVF technology, pentoxifylline is a widely used pharmacological agent for assistive reproduction. Pentoxifylline treatment increases sperm motility which goes hand in glove with the undesirable chemical reactions before fertilization, which together determines the success of IVF. “The newly designed molecule mPTX, a pentoxifylline derivative, was able to increase sperm motility, prolong in vitro sperm survival, improve sperm fertilization potential, without adversely affecting the development of the embryos at much lower concentration compared to the widely used pharmacological agent - pentoxifylline in IVF technology,” said Rajakumara Eerappa, associate professor, department of biotechnology, IIT-H, adding that undesirable chemical reactions before fertilisation are comparatively lesser by mPTX than other pharmacological agents used in IVF technology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mptx-molecule-designed-by-iit-hyd-could-improve-chances-of-successful-ivf/articleshow/85224310.cms||---

Exodus carries on, 30,000 seats vacant per year||HYDERABAD: Engineering no more seems to be the go-to course as admissions for B-Tech are seeing a downward trend over the past few years. Many students are now opting for other courses and some opting to study outside the state. Every year, about 30,000 seats are going vacant, resulting in hundreds of colleges being shut down over the past five to six years. B-pharmacy, BSc nursing, are some of the courses being opted by students instead of engineering. “Right now, the situation is such that engineering means computer science. All other courses are almost shut and there is absolutely no demand for courses such as mechanical, civil, electrical, among other engineering courses,” said V Balakrishna Reddy, faculty, Electrical & Electronics Engineering (EEE) department and president, Telangana Technical Institutes Employees Association (TTIEA). Balakrishna Reddy said that while there used to be 20,000 seats in electrical engineering around 2014-15, the number has now reduced to 7,000 seats in the state. Same is the case with other core engineering courses — civil, mechanical, among others — as they all put together are 40% of total engineering seats in the state. While there are 1,05,419 seats for 2021-22 in 175 engineering colleges, about 60% of these seats are in computer science engineering, including newly added emerging technology courses. During the last academic year, the number of engineering colleges as per All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is 185. This year it has been reduced by 10. In 2015-16, the number of engineering colleges stood at 266. A year before, there were more than 300 colleges in the state. Students, their parents and faculty said that one of the main reasons why not many are preferring engineering courses is because of the lack of job opportunities. Even figures from AICTE reveals the same. While the total intake in engineering courses was over one lakh in the 2020-21 academic year, hardly 27,240 got selected in placements. “My elder daughter completed her engineering in 2017. She tried to secure a job but is now preparing for government & bank examinations,” said A Srinivas, a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/has-engineering-run-its-course-in-t/articleshow/85222849.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

As a loaded truck got trapped just when the culvert caved in, commercial and private vehicles remained stuck on the highway up to several kilometres. A major portion of 70km stretch of NH-80 between Bhagalpur and Pirpainty/Mirzachowki (up to state borders) via Kahalgaon has been in shambles for long. Barring some patchworks and cosmetic repairs, nothing substantial has been done to widen the NH-80 since it was converted from state highway to NH. Residents of Kahalgaon, including members of Kahalgaon Truck Owners’ Association, have expressed strong resentment on several occasions against the NH officials as well as people’s representatives for “ignoring” the pathetic condition of NH-80, which is widely used for transportation of stone chips, coal and other commercial activities. However, nothing has been done yet. Kahalgaon resident and general secretary of Bhagalpur University Teachers’ Association Dr Pawan Kumar Singh said it was really pathetic that such an important road has remained neglected for several years.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support is the last line of treatment used for critical patients when all other treatments have been exhausted and multiple organs start to develop problems. By substituting the function of vital organs in the body, ECMO allows the organs to rest and recuperate. It is used for managing the respiratory/renal complications/ multi-organ failure. Her remarkable recovery over 90 days from May 11 when she landed at the hospital from being completely unconscious for nearly two months, to going on ventilator support, undergoing tracheotomy, dialysis, physiotherapy and finally on a 1 litre oxygen support is a rare one, doctors said. While initially doctors tried high flow oxygen support, she could not tolerate it and was put on the ventilator. Without any improvement, she had to be put on ECMO for one and half month. “During this period, she had lots of fluctuations in her conditions, and on some occasions, we felt she will not survive. Multiple attempts were made to wean her off ECMO but they failed and over a period of time, her kidneys also got affected requiring dialysis support,” said Dr Ganshyam M Jagathkar, director (critical care) Medicover Hospital, where she was treated. “Considering the condition in which the patient arrived and the long duration of ECMO support, it is really amazing to see the patient recovering to a full cycle. Patients on long ECMO support do not come out so easily,” he added. She had developed severe weakness of her muscles which made it very difficult for her to even stand or sit. Intense physiotherapy was started from an early period which helped her to regain her power to some extent. “The tracheotomy tube was also removed and she was able to speak and eat on her own. Presently she is on 1 litre of oxygen support, awake, cheerful, eating, talking. But still weak and needs rehabilitation through extensive physiotherapy, good nutritive support,” added the doctor.

Justice T Amarnath Goud directed the state health authorities and Apollo Hospitals to go ahead with the already delayed kidney transplantation on Madhuri Ballamudi without insisting that the prospective donor — her elder brother Venkat Naren Karlapalem — should first get his wife's consent. The estranged couple's divorce is pending in a court. Venkat, a resident of Ramakrishnapuram, and his younger sister Madhuri, who lives in Tarnaka, had approached the high court with the plea that they were siblings and mutually agreeable to a kidney transplant. Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, didn't proceed with the originally scheduled transplantation on July 30, citing the consent clause. The petitioners’ counsel, Prabhakar Sripada, informed the court that the hospital authorities examined the donor and found him fit for kidney donation. Citing the Telangana Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1995, he said Venkat also fitted the definition of "near relative", as specified in Section 2 (J) of the law. "We did try to obtain the consent of the donor’s wife, but she blocked our calls after coming to know about the purpose. It is unlikely she will convey her consent," the counsel said. Taking cognisance of the peculiar circumstances of the case, the court decided that Madhuri, who is suffering from last-stage renal failure, should not be denied a kidney from her willing donor brother just because his wife wouldn't give spousal consent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-man-can-donate-kidney-no-need-of-estranged-wifes-consent/articleshow/85227303.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Although internships are made mandatory by the AICTE, it is not being implemented strictly. When it comes to mini and main projects, students are buying instead of doing something on their own. “Not just students, even colleges should be blamed as they are tying up with institutes and are encouraging students to buy projects,” said Praveen K, a faculty in computer science at a private engineering college. “Unless they do projects on their own, students will not have a command on the subject.” He said this is one of the reasons many are opting to study engineering outside the state. In the meanwhile, for B Pharmacy, seats have increased by almost a lakh over past five years. Same is the case with BSc nursing as 2.8 lakh opted for the course in 2019-20 as against 1.9 lakh in 2015-16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/outdated-topics-cant-fetch-jobs/articleshow/85222898.cms||---

The move, he said, will help ramp up availability of the indigenous vaccine for the national vaccination drive. “Govt of India approves vaccine manufacturing facility for production of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in Ankleshwar, Gujarat,” Mandaviya tweeted on Tuesday. “Following PM Narendra Modi’s vision of SabkoVacccineMuftVaccine, this will increase vaccine availability & accelerate the world’s largest vaccine drive,” he said. Bharat Biotech had, in May this year, announced plans to repurpose the Ankleshwar BSL2+ facility, that makes anti-rabies vaccines, for manufacturing 200 million doses per annum of Covaxin. The company recently said it had commenced manufacturing Covaxin at Ankleshwar since early June, prior to which engineering batches were also executed to study equipment functionality and that the products manufactured there would be available for supplies from September this year. According to sources, a part of the existing facilities at Ankleshwar were repurposed to manufacture Covaxin. “The decision to manufacture Covaxin at Ankleshwar, Gujarat, was taken several months ago with planning and preparatory activities. Facility preparations and production activities commenced during June 2021,” said a source. The Ankleshwar facility, set up in the 1980s to manufacture anti-rabies vaccines, was acquired by Bharat Biotech in early 2019 from GSK Asia as part of its acquisition of Chiron Behring Vaccines Pvt Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-bios-guj-plant-gets-centre-nod-to-make-covaxin/articleshow/85224052.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The city has been experiencing dry weather conditions for the past two weeks with only scattered rains in isolated pockets. In the last 10 days, mercury levels and relative humidity (RH) have only soared. On Tuesday, the city experienced maximum temperature of 33Rs Celsius and minimum temperature of 25.4 Celsius with relative humidity rising to 85 percent. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad figures for the last 10 days, the maximum temperature in the city has soared from 29 degree Celsius to 34 degree Celsius. Not just this, the RH has soared from 77% on August 1 to 85% on August 10. Even as parts of city such as Kukatpally, Balanagar, Balaji Nagar, Gachibowli experienced rains of up to 16 mm on Tuesday evening, it brought little relief from the sultry weather conditions. “It’s unbearably hot for monsoon. Until two weeks back, the weather was so pleasant. Now, it has suddenly become so humid that I sweat even while staying indoors,” said Prashanth Bollineni, a resident of Chanda Nagar. Meteorologists informed that southwest monsoon is on a ‘break’ in most parts of India as the monsoon trough has moved towards the foothills of Himalayas. Humid easterly winds are replaced by dry and warm westerly winds over Telangana resulting a rise in mercury levels. “Mainly low-level westerly and south-westerly winds prevail over Telangana. Southwest monsoon is currently weak over Telangana. However, we can expect revival by second week of August following formation of a low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/acs-back-again-as-rise-in-mercury-makes-city-sweat/articleshow/85223870.cms||Preeti Biswas

The deceased was identified as Manav Singh (18) from Thakerwadi in Mangalhat. His father, Veer Singh, is an auto driver. On Tuesday, when Manav’s mother was cooking, the room was engulfed in flames due to the gas leak. “We suspect Veer was trying to fill gas from a big cylinder into a small one and the leaked gas was ignited by the nearby stove. Manav, who was in the room, died on the spot with severe burn injuries.

This is the fourth dead crocodile to be fished out of the river in the last 45 days. The sudden deaths of the reptiles that are protected under schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act has left the forest officials and wildlife activists perplexed. “I noticed the body of the crocodile floating near the Kala Ghoda bridge over Vishwamitri River following which I informed the forest officials. The reptile’s body was pulled out of the river and sent for post mortem by the forest department,” said Sanjay Soni, who stays on the river bank. Forest officials said that the crocodile didn’t have any injury marks on its body so it didn’t die in a territorial fight. “It weighed about 150 kilograms. We are waiting for the postmortem report to ascertain the cause of its death,” said Nidhi Dave, range forest officer, Vadodara. Vishwamitri River that passes through the heart of the city is home to about 270 crocodiles. The 1-km stretch between Kala Ghoda and Bhimnath Bridge has a dense population of crocodiles. On June 26, two crocodiles were found dead in the river near Kala Ghoda and on June 28, a dead 12-feet-long reptile weighing about 300 kilograms was pulled out from the same spot. Forest officials said that while one of the crocodiles died due to natural reasons, a postmortem of the other two bodies wasn’t possible as it was badly decomposed. M M Rajyaguru, assistant conservator of forest, said, “We will be asking the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to test samples of the water from the stretch where the crocodiles were found dead. Also, we have sent viscera samples of the crocodile to Anand veterinary college for conclusive results about the cause of its death.” Vishal Thakur, an animal activist, said, “The authorities should ascertain the reasons behind sudden deaths of the crocodiles in the river and take immediate action. One of the reasons for their death may be the polluted water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fourth-croc-found-dead-in-vishwamitri-in-45-days/articleshow/85218021.cms||---

TRS member Nama Nageswara Rao said awarding states the power to identify OBCs was a good development. The Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed the Constitution (127th) Amendment Bill to restore the states’ power to make their own OBC lists. AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi also supported the OBC amendment Bill, but he charged the Narendra Modi-led BJP government of bringing it with an eye on the OBC vote bank. He accused the Modi-government of supporting only a few OBCs. Telangana provides reservation for backward Muslims, but Centre doesn’t recognise it. When states are being provided with the power to identify its own OBC list, the same groups should be reflected even in the Centre’s OBC quota bill at the national level, he said. “Telangana state provides reservations to economically backward classes Muslims but they are not reflected in Centre’s OBC List. Why this discrimination,” he asked. Owaisi also demanded that the Modi-government take this as a golden opportunity to breach the 50 percent cap on reservations. “The government has reports of the economic status of a large number of castes and to extend reservations to these economically backward classes, the 50 per cent quota limit needs to be crossed,” he said. Owaisi also demanded that the BJP government do away with religion-based reservations. “BJP doesn’t work for OBCs but only for their votes. On this day in 1950, Muslim & Christian Dalits were excluded from SC reservation, govt should end religion-based reservation as soon as possible,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-mim-supports-obc-amendment-bill-in-parliament/articleshow/85224653.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: EPTRI to release mandal-level projections for climate change||HYDERABAD: Telangana State Climate Change Centre at Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPRTI), Hyderabad, is preparing mandal-wise climate change projections for the first time. The climate change projections at the local level have gained significance in the wake of UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which discovered that the global surface temperature was 1.09C higher in 2011-20 over the previous decade. EPTRI said the mandal-wise reports would be released in the next six months. Telangana State Climate Change Action Plan was last prepared in 2015 following which the Haritha Haram and Mission Kakatiya programmes were taken up to decrease carbon emission and restore water bodies. “Being a nodal agency for climate change studies, we are preparing a state action plan. From 2009, we had a national plan with eight missions. In 2012, (united) AP action plan was prepared, and in 2015 we did it for Telangana after state formation. After the (CO-P21) Paris agreement (limit global warming), states were asked for revised action plans. Currently, we are working on a state-level action plan,” said EPTRI climate change division scientist, Dr J Sesha Srinivas. Along with Icrisat, EPTRI is working on district and mandal-level risk and vulnerability assessment of agriculture due to climate change. ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture had in 2019 prepared district-level risk and vulnerability assessments. “Mandal-wise climate change projections and risk studies will help come out with local adaptation strategies,” Sesha Srinivas added. With the assistance of Icrisat and Professor Jayashankar Agricultural University, EPTRI has been carrying on agriculture mitigation projects in Mahabubnagar, Nagarkurnool and Wanaparthy districts. EPTRI has also tied up with the forest department to develop 11 reserve forest blocks in seven districts, where degraded forests were converted into dense forests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eptri-to-release-mandal-level-projections-for-climate-change/articleshow/85223819.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||YS Vivekananda Reddy murder: CBI widens probe angle||HYDERABAD: The CBI, probing former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy murder case, is looking into multiple motives, including a Karnataka land deal and political rivalry within and outside the YSR Congress Party. Days after arresting Yadati Sunil Yadav, a resident of Motunuthalapalli in Kadapa district, the CBI is set to question him as to who ordered the killing of Vivekananda Reddy. “The CBI will verify what was the main motive,” sources in the investigation agency said. Yadav was picked up on the night of August 2 from Goa where he was hiding and brought to Kadapa on a transit warrant. While a 25-member CBI team continued its search for the murder weapon in a stream in Pulivendula by deploying earth movers, sources said the investigation agency will also probe the Karnataka land deal case. A close confidant of Vivekananda Reddy, who did not want to be named, said: “If the motive is land deal indeed, why would the assailants kill him without deriving any benefit. Generally, killings are a no-no in land disputes. Who ordered the killing of Reddy is more important.” Vivekananda Reddy was found murdered in his Pulivendula residence on March 15, 2019. The murder weapon is believed to have been thrown into Rotaripuram stream by the killers. In his petition filed before the Andhra Pradesh high court, Sunil Yadav said he knew Vivekananda Reddy since 2017. “I know YS Vivekananda Reddy of Pulivendula from 2017 through Gajjala Umasankar Reddy and his brother Gajjal Jagadeeshwar Reddy of Sunkesula Village, Simhadripuram Mandal of Kadapa District. The duo used to take care of the properties and other works of Vivekananda Reddy. I used to assist Gajjala Umashankar Reddy and his brother Gajjala Jagadish Reddy. On their instructions, I used to do works of YS Vivekananda Reddy. I am in the good looks of the Vivekanandaa Reddy (sic),” Sunil Yadav said in his plea. He further said: “A.P. State police have arrested P.A. Krishna Reddy, Erra Gangi Reddy, Prakash on the allegation of screening the evidence, by cleaning the blood marks of murder of Vivekananda Reddy. At any point of time, my name or my family members names were mentioned by any of the suspect in connection with the murder of Viveka (sic).” Krishna Reddy was PA to Vivekananda Reddy. Sunil Yadav, who is presently in CBI custody, also said: “I was confronted with other suspects — Dastagiri, who was a former driver of Vivekananda, and his wife Shaik Shabana, Krishna Reddy, computer operator Inaythulla, Pandinti Rajasekhar, watchman Ranganna and Umashankar Reddy.” Gangi Reddy, on the other hand, denied allegations of threatening Ranganna. “The CBI has recorded Ranganna’s statement. He said I had threatened to kill him if he reveals anything which is false,” Gangi Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/viveka-murder-cbi-widens-probe-angle/articleshow/85227343.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Allahabad||Gender gap: Women still far behind in Covid vaccination drive in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: Men have outnumbered women in Covid-19 vaccination drive in the Sangam City. Till August 9, out of 13,65,169 people vaccinated among all age groups, only 40 percent (5,49,772) were women against 59 % (8,14,971) men. This gender slant could be attributed to various reasons, including women’s lack of intervention, inability to reach a vaccination site on their own or lack of independent mobility particularly in rural areas and their own lacklustre approach. This is when there has been a series of awareness camps and promotional drive in rural areas. In urban pockets, educated women can be spotted standing in lone queues to get jabs but the same scene is missing in rural areas. Women population in Prayagraj district stands at around 49 percent of total 40,59,436 recipients to be vaccinated. Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO) Dr Teerath Lal said, “ No doubt, the percentage of women who got vaccinated is quite low compared to men.” He added that there has been a 59:40 ratio (59 men: 40 women) at vaccination sites and men are a step ahead to get the shot. Interestingly, women aged between 18 and 44 and hailing from urban pockets are more enthusiastic to get vaccinated compared to rural pockets and the graph of women above 45 years is also more in city areas who travelled to vaccination sites to get first and second doses. In contrast,women in rural pockets particularly aged above 45 lack interest in vaccination and health workers had to burn extra energy to convince them to take jabs. Statistics of the health department revealed that as many as 426 transgender persons have also taken the jab.  Health authorities have now set a target to immunize 40,59,436 recipients of all age groups. As many as 13,65,169 Covid vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, that is,those aged above 18 years, in the district till August 9. While 11,14,311 beneficiaries have taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 2,50,858 recipients have also received the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/gender-gap-city-women-still-far-behind-in-covid-vax-drive/articleshow/85224767.cms||---

Known as YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s companies, these firms were seeking a simultaneous or joint trial in the CBI and ED cases filed against them. These firms challenged the decision of the trial court which allowed the plea of the ED to commence trial in the money laundering cases first. Justice Shameem Akther, who heard the case, agreed with the ED’s arguments and declared that the arguments made by Jagan’s firms were devoid of any merit and dismissed their pleas. Jagathi and other firms opposed it saying that it would be absurd to talk about money generated or laundered from a crime without determining whether a crime was committed in the first place. “Since the CBI cases talk about crime, it would be better if the trial in them commences first,” the Jagan’s firms argued. “A joint or a simultaneous trial is also permissible,” they said opposing any grant of precedence to the money laundering cases. Opposing the argument of Jagathi Publications and other companies, the counsel for the ED maintained that though they depend on CBI cases for registering money laundering cases, they become independent and standalone after the registration of ED cases. It also cited an amendment to section 44 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in 2019 that made money laundering cases independent. “We do not depend on the scheduled offences and their trial any more,” said the ED counsel in the last hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/money-laundering-trial-in-quid-pro-quo-case-to-begin/articleshow/85224753.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Ahmedabad||Project Lion: Gujarat govt sought Rs 2,000 crore from Centre||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has sought assistance to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore from the Centre for Project Lion. The request is under active consideration for approval, said a senior government official aware of the developments. To be modelled on Project Tiger and Project Elephant, Project Lion was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15, 2020.  Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani participated in an event organized by the state forest department to celebrate the World Lion Day on Tuesday. He mentioned in a video address that the allocation process of Rs 2,000 crore by the Centre was underway. The funding proposal for the project involves Rs 712 crore for habitat and population management and Rs 375 crore for communities as stakeholders under the Sinh Mitra Yojana. Other aspects are Rs 203 crore for lion health management, Rs 120 crore for human-wildlife conflict management, Rs 152 crore for surveillance and monitoring, and Rs 74 crore for research and learning. The details were outlined by sources with knowledge of the project. Information learning and communication will require funds of Rs 54 crore while the development of potential lion habitat and future lion migration or dispersal to other areas will require Rs 117 crore, the sources said. Also, the mitigation of human-wildlife conflict envisages funds of Rs 22.5 crore, the sources added. The outbreak of canine distemper in Gir and nearby areas of Gujarat, the last abode of the Asiatic lions, has been a major challenge for the forest department. Many lions have succumbed to the disease over the past few years. Under Project Lion, the state government aims to establish a National Wildlife Disease Diagnostic Centre for a projected investment of Rs 71 crore. A lion cell at the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change is also envisioned for an investment of Rs 31.65 crore under the proposed plan. CM Rupani in his address said that the state government has taken up the tasks of maintaining the health of the lions and their conservation by developing a new concept of an advanced lion hospital. Other features, he said, are lion ambulance, rescue and rapid action team, trackers, and Vanyaprani Mitras in Sasan Gir with public participation. For breeding of lions, gene pools have been started at three places: Rampara in Saurashtra, and Sakkarbaug and Satveerada in Junagadh. The chief minister said that under Project Lion, in the coming years, the link between lion conservation and breeding will be strengthened. Optimal use will be made of rescue centres, hospitals, laboratories, and breeding centres. Radio collars and other such modern technology will be used as well. The Gujarat forest department had announced in June last year that the Asiatic lion population has increased by 29% over the past five years — from 523 in 2015 to 674 in 2020. The distribution range of lions in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, where Gir is situated, has increased by 36% from 22,000 sq km in 2015 to 30,000 sq km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/project-lion-rs-2k-crore-sought-from-centre/articleshow/85222152.cms||---

The court said from the chargesheet and papers, it appeared most calculations have been made by the informant Narendra Talegaonkar, who was working as ACP in ACB, Mumbai division. "Neither, he is an Architect nor, Engineer. He is not an expert," special judge H S Satbhai said. The case concerns a contract NCP's Chhagan Bhujbal allegedly gave firm K S Chamankar Enterprises without inviting tenders in 2005 when he was PWD minister. Today, Bhujbal is again cabinet minister in the MVA government. The ED conducted investigations against Bhujbal and others in a connected case that is pending before a special PMLA court.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat BJP in Catch-22 situation||GANDHINAGAR: The central government’s approval of a bill to empower states to decide on including or excluding castes in the OBC (other backward castes) list has put the BJP-led Gujarat government in a Catch-22 situation. Having paid a heavy price in the 2017 assembly elections because of the Patidar and other caste-based agitations, the state government is worried about the possible negative impact that the move could have on its electoral prospects in the 2022 elections. The Gujarat Congress has already seized the political opportunity by building pressure on the BJP for a fresh survey of all OBC castes and has demanded that underprivileged castes from the general category should be included in the new OBC list. Major caste groups like Patidars, Brahmins, Rajputs and Vaniks, etc have made representations since 2015 to be included in the OBC list. With the fresh development, they are bound to reiterate their demand. The 2017 assembly elections, held in the backdrop of the reservation stir, saw the BJP’s tally reduce to double digit figure of 99, even as the Congress made impressive gains with a tally of 77 seats. Dinesh Shukla, a veteran political analyst, said the Gujarat BJP faced significant damage due to the Patidar and other caste-based reservations in the 2017 elections. “Now once again, after decision to give power to states to finalize the OBC list, the state BJP government is expected to face 2017-like pressure from different caste groups. If BJP includes new castes from general category into OBC, it may face opposition from existing OBC groups,” he said. Hardik Patel, working president Gujarat Congress, wholeheartedly supported the decision of giving powers to the state to decide the OBC list. “We demand a statewide survey of the demand to include Patidar, Brahmin, Vanik and other general castes in the OBC list of the state in the changed circumstances. We also demand revised study of the present 148 OBC caste groups. Many have moved forward in the last 30 years with OBC reservation benefits and no longer need to be in the OBC beneficiary list. BJP must express their intention clearly,” he said. Patel added that the 10% economically backward classes (EBC) reservation for general castes has also not been implemented properly in the state and Rs 1000 crore allocation for EBC youth is on paper only. The state EBC welfare corporation is also headless, he added. C R Paatil, state BJP president, said, “Everyone has the right to represent and it is up to the government to decide on merit whether to consider any caste’s demand for inclusion in reserved category. At present, the state party unit has no separate view on demands of various castes for inclusion in OBC. It is a decision of the government.” When asked if the BJP will promise inclusion of castes like Patidars in the OBC list ahead of the elections, Paatil said, “They did agitations but failed. Our government has addressed all concerns of all communities and in future also, we will. However so far, the party has no view to express on the subject.’’ Deputy CM Nitin Patel avoided a direct answer, saying, “We are yet to study provisions of the bill.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Women at risk as 2,000 home guards disappear from locals||MUMBAI: About 2,000 home guards who escorted ladies compartments of local trains at night have been withdrawn from duty because the state owes them dues. When trains resume for those fully vaccinated from August 15 and the volume of passengers is expected to swell several folds, activists fear that women’s security would be in peril, as a result. The Government Railway Police (GRP), juggling multiple responsibilities with manpower constraints, have begun a review to find out how many of their personnel are out sick and how duties can be allocated among the rest. Women’s coaches are escorted between 9pm and 6am. Two home guards and a GRP cop are allocated per rake. “After a woman was crushed under a train while chasing a phone robber at Kalwa in May 2021, we had a meeting with railway officials and police. Our demand was to increase the timings of escort duty in ladies coaches. But if home guards have been withdrawn, several women’s coaches will go unescorted. This is serious as women commuters will be vulnerable for muggings,” said activist Subhash Gupta of Rail Yatri Parishad. For a couple of years, home guards were being used as an auxiliary force to support district police. However, payments were not released to them in time and dues started to pile up. Since July 2021, home guards have been withdrawn from service on the railways. TOI reached out to additional director general (home guards) Prashant Burde who said he did not wish to comment. Sources said the state had released some funds, but the dues are still staggering. During the pandemic, serious crimes in ladies compartments were reported in late evenings and early mornings as travellers were few. In February, a 29-year-old woman was headed to meet her friend and boarded an Andheri local from Vasai. A man followed her in at 7.30 am, repeatedly assaulted her on her face with an object, leaving a trail of blood, and escaped with her gold chain. “Women’s security will always be our priority,” said a senior GRP officer. Starting August 15, joint tea-ms of GRP and RPF will man a single entrance point to stations and examine passes of travellers. “We will not open the other entry/exits for now as we don’t have enough personnel to man them,” said an official. The agencies will also enforce Covid protocols, like wearing masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-women-at-risk-as-2000-home-guards-disappear-from-locals/articleshow/85224803.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Mumbai||House help, 2 kin held for Rs 2-crore theft at south Mumbai businessman’s duplex||MUMBAI: The city police recently arrested a domestic help , his cousin and uncle for allegedly stealing diamond and gold jewellery worth nearly Rs 2 crore from a duplex on Bhulabhai Desai Road near Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai in July. Chandan Mukhia (21), who was employed with the businessman dealing in marbles, had been released from Arthur Road jail in March when prisons were being decongested in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Later, he got a job at the complainant’s house. The other arrested accused are Chandan’s cousin Bachchan Mukhia (20) and their uncle Fulo Mukhia (40). All three are from Gotohitola village in Darbhanga district, Bihar. The theft took place in the first week of July when the complainant along with his mother, wife and daughter had gone to Lonavla for a two-day holiday. The complainant lives on the sixth floor of the duplex with his family, while his mother lives on the seventh floor. The family’s cook would sleep in the kitchen on the sixth floor, while Chandan would sleep outside the flat. A police team, led by senior inspector R G Rajbahr, inspector Vijay Dandwate and PSI Dhanesh Satardekar, found that the iron cupboard’s lock on the seventh floor was broken using a hammer and screwdriver. Chandan was also missing. They reached his hometown in Darbhanga, but could not trace him as he had dumped his mobile phone and SIM card and got new ones. “After making enquiries for a few days, we nabbed one accused. He spilled the beans on his accomplices. Later we arrested them too,” said a police officer. The accused had kept the stolen jewellery in two polythene bags and buried them near their homes, said the police. So far, jewellery worth Rs 1.5 crore has been recovered. During interrogation, Chandan told investigators that he had stolen the flat keys and used them on the day of the theft. He opened the door of the sixth floor while the cook was asleep in the kitchen. Then, he went to the window and from there climbed on the seventh floor and stole the jewellery. He met his cousin and they took a cab to Kurla LTT and boarded a train to Bihar. “There are seven previous cases of theft registered against Fulo, while Chandan was earlier arrested for stealing jewellery worth lakhs from his previous employer’s flat in Tardeo. He was sent to Arthur Road jail, but got bail soon after,” added the officer. During the probe, the police found that the accused owned a jeep, two tractors, a sports bike, two bikes, a Royal Enfield, and three houses in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-house-help-2-kin-held-for-rs-2cr-theft-at-sobo-bizmans-duplex/articleshow/85227379.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Taking part in a cabinet sub-committee meeting on agriculture, KTR told the officials to visit the agriculture museum in the US and consult top professors like MS Swaminathan, Jayati Ghosh and Subhash Palekar on how to strengthen the farm sector. “Farmers are now respected and there is a need to strengthen the state’s food processing units,” he said. The minister said agricultural start-ups should be increased and added that more innovations in this sector were needed. “We can look at the possibility of giving tabs to farmers,” he said. He stated that four revolutions, including the agricultural revolution, began after the formation of the state and that farmers have now the knowledge of using smartphones. Agriculture minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy said it was necessary to study the feasibility of establishing units to convert paddy rice into ethanol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-explore-possibility-of-giving-tabs-to-farmers/articleshow/85224820.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Why two tree felling Acts when aim is to save trees?||Nagpur: Taking a cue from large-scale felling of over 50-year-old trees by PWD near Bapu Kuti in Wardha, greens have demanded amendment to the Maharashtra Felling of Trees (Regulation) Act, 1964, on the lines of the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975.On July 6, the state government amended the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975, giving ‘heritage’ status to 50-year-old trees, besides felling of more than 200 trees requiring a state-level committee nod. The 1975 Act is applicable in the municipal corporation and municipal council jurisdictions.“Why should there be two different Acts? Climate change doesn’t discriminate between urban and rural areas. It is expedient to make better provisions for regulating the felling of certain trees in the state making patwaris, gram sevaks, and police patils accountable to report any illegal tree felling,” says green crusader Anusaya Kale-Chhabrani.“The word ‘regulation’ is the most important part of the Maharashtra Felling of Trees (Regulation) Act, 1964. This act is often invoked bypassing regulation, thereby creating a smokescreen to the effect that this act facilitates tree cutting. On the contrary, this act is for conservation purposes,” says Alok Bang, an ecologist spearheading the fight against felling trees in Wardha.The 1964 Act clearly states —“Whereas, it is expedient to make better provision for regulating the felling of certain trees in the state of Maharashtra, for the purpose of the preservation thereof, and for the protection of the soil against erosion…”.“We failed to benefit from the amended 1975 Act as it is not applicable in rural areas. In Maharashtra, most of the trees that are being felled mostly for road widening are outside the urban and municipal limits. In Wardha district too, 80% of the trees that are being felled are in rural limits. Hence, to save such heritage trees and green cover, the 1964 Act needs to be given more teeth,” said Bang.The latest IPCC report paints a gloomy picture for India’s environment-borne human tragedies. Trees are not only effective carbon storage devices, but their cutting also leads to emission of greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere, leading to global warming.Bang informed that as per the MoEFCC report, 1.09 crore trees were cut officially between 2014-2019 (unofficially it could be more than double). With 10.70 lakh trees felled, Maharashtra occupies the second topmost position among Indian states and UTs, only second behind Telangana.Chhabrani says, “In 1964, when this Act came into force, the scenario in rural parts was different. With LPG reaching every village now, not all are dependent on timber for fuelwood. With the boundaries of small towns short, most of the tree cover falls outside the municipal limits and will not benefit from the amended 1975 Act. Hence, the 1964 Act needs a complete revamp.”“Owing to rapid infrastructure projects in urban areas there is fewer than one tree per person in most cities, including Nagpur. Though the Act of 1974 is a welcome step to address this critical situation, tree cover in rural parts continue to be threatened,” said green campaigner Jaydeep Das.“As per the Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act 1959, Section 54A-O & 54B-K village panchayats and gram sabhas have administrative powers to regulate tree felling. Unfortunately, ignorance at the ground level allows authorities to bypass processes or misuse government machinery,” he said.“Trees outside urban areas are like ‘no one’s child’. Huge trees are being felled quite easily that too under the cover of darkness both literally as well as legally. It’s high time the age-old Maharashtra Felling of Trees (Regulation) Act, 1964, is amended,” said the activist.WHY TWO TREE ACTS FOR SAME CAUSE?* Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975, amended on July 6, 2021 * It allows 50-year-old trees as ‘heritage’ trees with an aim to increase forest and tree cover* It will be made mandatory to plant trees equivalent to the age of the tree in case felling of trees allowed for development projects* Planted trees need to be 6-8 feet in height and survival should be ensured by geo-tagging* Permission for felling of more than 200 trees will go to the Maharashtra state tree authority* Now census of trees to be held every five years with use of new technology such as GIS-based application||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/why-two-tree-felling-acts-when-aim-is-to-save-trees/articleshow/85222184.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

It said 45% of its fleet will be electric by the end of 2022. It has also decided to convert all the 250 diesel buses owned by BEST to CNG to reduce air pollution. TimesViewBEST’s decision could not have come at a better time, when both Centre and state are doling out large subsidies for procurement of e-buses. It will benefit commuters, who can enjoy noiseless and comfortable AC rides. It is wise to operate e-buses, as maintenance and running costs are low, as is air and noise pollution. BEST should now focus on improving the frequency of the e-buses.“This is a big decision as we are migrating to cleaner fuel. It will also ensure that commuters get the majority of buses which are noiseless, with zero emission, providing air-conditioned comfort and a good suspension,” said BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra. He said 31 spacious e-buses of 12-metre length were inducted into the fleet recently, taking the BEST e-bus strength to 297. “We are confident of adding more buses to take the e-fleet to 411 buses by December. And in 2022, we will procure a total of 1,800 additional buses, taking our fleet to 2,211 by the end of next year,” he said. BEST expects the overall fleet to grow to 4,900 buses by the end of 2022, and therefore the e-bus strength will be around 45% by that time. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said at a recent event that he had been associated with the induction of e-buses in BEST from the first. “After I introduced the first set of six electric buses in BEST in 2017, there was no looking back,” he said. BEST is controlled by the ruling Shiv Sena and Thackeray has been instrumental in pushing for the growth of the electric fleet over the past four years. In the Electric Vehicle Policy for the state unveiled by Thackeray recently, there is a mention of public transport undertakings maintaining a 15% fleet of electric vehicles by 2025. At present, BEST has charging stations at four bus depots, but it will soon bring the facility to all 27 depots. The four depots where the buses go for charging are Kala Killa (Dharavi), Backbay, Shivaji Nagar and Malvani. “We want electric buses to be the new normal in BEST,” Chandra said. There are 500 other mini diesel buses which are run by private contractors, and sources said the BEST will request them to switch to clean fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-only-e-buses-for-best-in-future-says-gm/articleshow/85224891.cms||Somit Sen

The bank officials will provide smartphones to six more students of the same school. The need for smart phones has surged during the pandemic as schools have switched to the online mode of education. As some of the students of the school were not able to afford these smartphones, the Union Bank stepped in to extend a helping hand. “As our organisation had asked us to pull up our resources and find some donors who can help the students belonging to economically weaker families, we spoke to authorities of Union bank who promised us the needed help,” informed principal of the school, Shalini Dikshit. “We have been monitoring our students and have selected 13 of them who are bright but belong to very poor families. This help would be a game changer for their studies,” she added. Seven students were invited to a hotel located in Civil Lines area of the city on Tuesday. The area manager, in the presence of regional head of the bank, Gyanendra Kumar gifted smartphones to seven students. The bank will gift smartphones to six more students in the next couple of days who missed attending the event on Tuesday. Vice principal of the school, Pradeep Kumar Mishra, was also present on the occasion. Among the students who have been benefited by the bank’s help include Tej Pratap Singh of class II, Shivani Verma of class III, Manjeet Pal of class IV, Utkarsh Sharma of class V, Yogesh of class X, Kajal Kumari of class XII and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/union-bank-gifts-smartphones-to-seven-students-of-kv-manauri/articleshow/85224858.cms||---

Ahmedabad has missed deadlines in its mission to curb air pollution that has been choking the citizens for long. In June 2019, the state government had finalized an air action plan for the city. Now, in August 2021, the municipal corporation has invited proposals from consultants to suggest ways to achieve the targets. The worst pollution episodes are experienced by Ahmedabad city between January and February and November and December. Track the pollution level in your cityThat’s when a meteorological phenomenon called ‘inversion’ occurs — trapping polluted air, such as smog, close to the ground. Action Plan for Control of Air Pollution in Ahmedabad (APCAPA) was prepared with the participation of multiple agencies. They included the district collectorate, the municipal corporation, GPCB, RTO, civil supplies and other government departments. The plan was in draft form since June 2017 and was readied in February 2018. Among the deadlines prescribed in the APCAPA plan, the misses include the one for making Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar kerosene-free. The focus was on increasing the number of public transport buses and ensuring that all buses run on CNG. The transport department is entrusted with the responsibility to cancel the registrations of commercial vehicles older than 15 years and provide financial assistance for the purchase of commercial vehicles that run on electricity or CNG. Another task in the plan was to ‘maintain pothole-free roads for free flow of traffic’; the task was to be completed by December 2019. The bitter reality is that an inquiry ordered by the Gujarat high court to investigate poor road quality in 2017 is yet to be completed. On April 18, the Union environment and forest ministry had released a draft of the National Clean Air Programme. The main goal of NCAP is “to meet the prescribed annual average ambient air quality standards at all locations in the country in a stipulated time frame”. Given the state of air quality in Ahmedabad, any initiative by the Union or state government is an urgent need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/deadlines-missed-smog-chokes-city/articleshow/85222347.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

With vehicles off the road and industries shut, the air was cleaner and the masks filtered out the rest. However, once the government started relaxing lockdown and then the subsequent curfews, Ahmedabad’s air quality began deteriorating. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reported to be ‘poor’ and even ‘very poor’ for several consecutive days. To tackle this, the civic body has finally set up an Air Quality Management Cell (AQMC) and initiated the process of hiring an expert consultant to implement its Action Plan for Control of Air Pollution in Ahmedabad (APCAPA). “The civic body has recently set up a special cell for air quality management. The cell will coordinate between state agencies and see to the implementation of the action plan to improve Ahmedabad’s air quality,” a senior AMC official said. He added that the consultancy will help the civic body in planning and implementation of the air action plan. “We need expert advice of environment engineers in many aspects of the action plan. As soon as we hire the consultancy we will begin implementation of the action plan to control air pollution in the city,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-sets-up-cell-to-boost-air-quality/articleshow/85222317.cms||---

An official said it appeared there was a gap between the number of units actually operating in the industrial areas and the number of units that had taken consent under the water polluting category.According to the data of the environment department, 28,117 industrial units are present in 28 approved industrial areas. Of these, 1,516 are registered with Delhi Pollution Control Committee as water polluting units in the capital. 33,690 industrial units are connected to common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) in 17 approved industrial areas.A senior official of DPCC said, “It appears that some illegal water polluting units are present in the 28 authorised industrial areas. We are conducting a comprehensive survey in all industrial areas to validate the data on the number of units consented by DPCC under different categories and update it through physical verification.”Another official said most of the CETPs were not meeting the prescribed inlet standards. Taking cognisance of this fact, the central monitoring committee headed by the secretary of ministry of Jal Shakti had directed DPCC to take action against defaulter CETPs and member industries. “The correct database of all units will help in better operation of CETPs in the long run. Once these units are identified, we can bring them under the ambit of environmental regulations,” added the official.However, industry owners said that DPCC should also act against illegal units that were functional in non-conforming areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/survey-begins-to-determine-illegal-units-in-industrial-areas/articleshow/85219424.cms||---

About 9,000 teachers have been appointed for various posts in the last one year for primary, secondary and higher secondary level schools. “They would receive salary cut of Rs 5,000 for a period of 40 months. The education department has decided to fine a total of Rs 2 lakh to every teacher who hasn’t turned up to work after recruitment for these posts,” said sources in the education department. “Many teachers who have taken part in the recruitment drive have not got schools of their choice, so they are reluctant to join at their new workplaces,” said a source. “Even the school records would show them as their employees. They would be receiving their monthly salaries but schools will continue to face a shortage of teachers. As a result, the education of students ultimately suffers. To avoid this, the government has decided to take strict action against such teachers,” said a government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/salary-cut-for-new-teachers-gone-awol/articleshow/85222311.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi blows hot and cold: Extreme weather events already rising, new action plan soon||NEW DELHI: Delhi has experienced many instances of unusual weather in the last two decades — and their frequency has only increased in recent years. The United Nations’ Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report predicts a number of extreme weather events to occur around the world in the coming 15-20 years and Delhi’s own State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) forecasts similar climate phenomena. The existing plan considered Delhi’s data till 2011, and a new action plan with data from the last decade is expected to be ready by next month. “Data from 2011 onwards is being considered for the updated action plan to combat climate change,” said an environment department official. “Under the new plan, renewable energy will be given a push.” The official added that a knowledge partner to help prepare a new plan had been identified and a budget of Rs 20 lakh fixed for the exercise. “The plan should be ready by next month,” the official disclosed. The latest IPCC report projects global temperature to reach or exceed 1.5°C of warming in the next decade in all scenarios. The current global average temperature rise is 1.1°C above the pre-industrial level of 1850-1900). A further rise of 0.4°C, as estimated by IPCC, can lead to increasing heat wave events, longer warm and shorter cold seasons and faster sea-level rise across the globe. Since August 2020, every month has recorded an extreme weather event in Delhi, including extreme rainfall, a particular month’s historical coldest or hottest day and the coldest or hottest monthly average temperatures. Last month too, Delhi recorded 2.4 times the normal rainfall, making it the wettest July since 2003. “Extreme minimum and maximum temperature events appear to be increasing in Delhi,” the SAPCC notes. “In December 2006, Delhi had the lowest temperature since 1935 (0.2°C). In June 2007, it had a maximum temperature of 44.9°C. While these extreme temperatures cannot be directly linked to climate change, the challenge facing Delhi is variability in weather patterns and the potential for exacerbated extreme events due to climate change.” It also points out that there were several months when the temperature and precipitation were greater than standard deviation from the mean. “The hottest summer was in 1944, the coldest winter in 1935 and the wettest monsoon in 1958. However, recent years have seen similar extremes in temperature in 1978, 1988 and 1996 and precipitation in 1994, 1995, and 2003,” the action plan report adds. Besides forecasting annual mean temperature to rise between 2.5 degrees Celsius and 5 degrees across the country, the report also estimates a general increase in monsoon precipitation though an overall decrease in the number of rainy days. SAPCC says, “In the near future (2015-2044), the annual maximum temperatures may increase in Delhi but without statistical significance, though the annual minimum temperatures may rise at a significant 5%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/writing-is-on-the-wall-as-delhi-blows-hot-and-cold/articleshow/85219384.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

They jump into moving goods trains to steal cargo, or hit mobile phone users standing at the doorways or leaning against windows so they drop their gadgets as the trains chug into or out of the city limits through slums and crossings. Illegal vendors and eunuchs too use these stretches to enter the trains, and are mostly ignored by escorting railway security personnel. The illegal slums and hutments encroaching on railway land along the tracks have become breeding grounds for criminals targeting railway passengers. The wagon breakers target vegetable consignments, especially onion, besides material like coal, which they hurl on the tracks from moving trains. The stretch of Nagpur outer near Motibagh underpass and Dobi locality are fast earning notoriety for such criminal activities targeting passengers and wagons going towards Raipur and Howrah. On Monday, Railway Protection Force (RPF) seized 17 sacks of onion, cumulatively weighing around 750-800kg, from the tracks which the wagon breakers had dropped from trains between Pahelwan Baba Dargah at Motibagh and Itwari railway station. Though three persons have been identified, the RPF is yet to make any arrests. Senior divisional security commissioner, Central Railway, Ashutosh Pandey said there was a tip off regarding some miscreants dropping onions from wagons, so a drive was undertaken to seize them. “We intend to target illegal activities along the tracks in the outer. Action is being initiated and will continue,” he said. Sources said one Shahrukh and his gang is the most active syndicate in Nagpur outer, targeting long distance trains and passengers. “The gangs have members who are expert in climbing onto running trains. These wagon breakers also break into wagons and hurl sacks and coal from the coaches on the tracks, which are later sold in the market,” said a Motibagh source. It’s learnt the mobile thief gangs wait along the tracks with sticks having hooks at the end. The gang members target passengers who lean out of doors or windows to speak on the mobile phone. “The gang members take the passengers by surprise by striking their hands, so that the mobile phones slip and fall along the track. The mobile phones are picked up by the gang members who flee towards the slums and escape,” said the source. It’s learnt the gang members also enter coaches to pick up mobile phones left unattended while charging or on the seats and flee with them by jumping out of moving trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wagon-breakers-mobile-thieves-targeting-trains-in-nagpur-outer/articleshow/85222235.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Delhi||Footfall remains low at weekly markets in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Although all weekly markets have been allowed to function and guidelines have been issued to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour, the turnout of vendors and customers at these places are still low, the municipal corporations have claimed. In addition to the visits/checks by the district administration, the civic bodies have formed zonal teams to randomly visit these markets for proper implementation of all rules. They have also installed boards at some places specifying the limits of the markets beyond which no vendor can set up stalls. “On Monday, the weekly markets were organised at places, including roadsides, as per the direction of Delhi Disaster Management Authority and the district administration. But limited numbers of vendors and buyers were present probably due to lack of clarity,” said an official of East Delhi Municipal Corporation. A similar situation was reported in north Delhi. An official of North Delhi Municipal Corporation said the turnout was almost nil at places. “We are expecting that operation will pick up from next week.” Rajesh Gupta of North Delhi Weekly Market Association said that after facing an uncertain situation for almost two years due to the pandemic, many vendors had been left with no resources to resume business. “Since October, I have received at least 2,500 applications from vendors in Civil Lines and Keshavpuram for a loan under the PM Street Vendor’s Atma Nirbhar Nidhi.” Gupta said the association had been sending the applications to the corporation and 1,000 cases had been approved so far. “We expect the government to help us resume our operation and earn livelihood in these tough times,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/footfall-remains-low-at-weekly-markets/articleshow/85219443.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man uploads video, abuses woman politician; arrested||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has arrested a 30-year-old man from Uttam Nagar for allegedly abusing and posting an objectionable video about a female politician on social media. The man, police said, was also arrested in a criminal case earlier. The accused has been identified as Vikas Sehrawat, a resident of Matiyala Village in Uttam Nagar. According to the police, a complaint was received by them from a woman politician via email on Monday informing them about a video being shared widely on social media in which a man is talking about her inappropriately and is abusing her. Based on the woman’s complaint, Delhi Police registered a case under sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) and 509 (whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman) of the Indian Penal Code at the Kotla Mubarakpur police station. Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police, South, said “A police team immediately checked the video and managed to zero in on the location of the suspect in Bindapur. Following a manhunt, we managed to arrest the suspect from his house in Matiyala Village, Uttam Nagar. His detailed interrogation is under way,” the officer said. Police said, during preliminary inquiry, it was established that the arrested man was also held in March this year in another case and was booked under sections 505 (whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report) and 504 (whoever intentionally insults, and thereby gives provocation to any person) in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. He had come out of the jail on bail just three months ago, police said, adding that further probe in the case is under way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-uploads-video-abuses-woman-politician-arrested/articleshow/85219467.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nothing like ‘zero Covid’, waiting for that is not scientific, say experts||NAGPUR: While all 11 districts in Vidarbha are experiencing the best ever phase in the Covid-19 pandemic over the last four weeks, the Maharashtra government is still not issuing relaxations from the level 3 restrictions. After Pune and Nagpur municipal corporations issued their notifications, it was expected that district collectors and municipal commissioners in Vidarbha, where the overall positivity is less than 0.3% on average, will issue similar notifications. But, nothing of this kind happened in any of the districts or municipal corporations. The irony is that the conditions are far better than Pune and Nagpur in the rural and tribal districts of Vidarbha – like Bhandara and Gondia. But restrictions are more in these districts than in Pune and Nagpur cities. Bhandara had reported zero ‘under treatment patient’ for three days while Gondia is also on the way to gain Covid-free status. However, experts say bringing all districts at this level is scientifically impossible. “I think our authorities are expecting zero Covid situation, which means no cases, no under-treatment patients in all districts. It’s unwise and unscientific,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. “We have already wasted two months of economic activity in Vidarbha,” he added. Epidemiologist Anand Thatte said that ‘zero Covid’ is a hypothetical situation. “Virus will be there forever. It will keep infecting people. As long as we are not getting serious cases, hospitalizations, oxygen requirements, and ventilators; there is no point in counting the declining number of cases,” he said. “I think Vidarbha already has seen its worst and we will continue to see some number of cases on and off for next one year,” he added. A senior member of the Covid task force said he has been repeatedly raising the issue in every meeting that Vidarbha region deserves more relaxation. “Almost two weeks have passed since schools re-opened in Vidarbha’s rural areas. If the situation had been so grim, we would have started reporting a significant spike in cases. Nothing like that has happened,” he said. There are only 144 patients under treatment in Nagpur district, and 469 in entire Vidarbha region. This means only 613 active cases in Vidarbha region. More than 11.18 lakh people have already got infected on record. As per the official record of the state government, near 91 lakh population of Vidarbha has already been vaccinated with at least one dose of vaccine as on August 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nothing-like-zero-covid-waiting-for-that-is-not-scientific-experts/articleshow/85222275.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Jodhpur water supply being tweaked to cut wastage||AHMEDABAD: Jodhpur was the first ward in the city to get metered and 24x7 water supply. The idea was to curb water wastage. Though the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation installed meters across several societies, it fell short of the political will to charge people based on the water meters. As a result, the ward consumed the highest amount of water. To counter this, AMC has begun tweaking water supply over the past two week to reduce wastage. Till now, 4 million litres a day (MLD) of water has been deducted, said a civic official, adding, “Jodhpur has been consuming 26 to 17 MLD when other wards were allocted around 16 MLD. We plan to bring down supply to 17 MLD in Jodhpur.” The official said, “The 24x7 project involved charging consumers based on their water usage to control wastage. This stands defeated as meters installed are completely irrelevant now in Jodhpur gam. The new rate chart for water usage is ready and is pending approval from standing committee.” “The AMC has committed to introducing water audits prior to taking the Rs 3,000-crore soft loan from the World Bank in December. Water meter is a reality,” says a senior AMC official. Today, while AMC spends Rs 380 crore to pump water to 15.56 lakh households and establishments in the city, Amdavadis pay just Rs 119 crore towards this effort.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jodhpur-water-supply-being-tweaked-to-cut-wastage/articleshow/85222336.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Reopening of Ambazari garden may be delayed by over 2 years||NAGPUR: Allotted by the state government to the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) four years ago and closed for the public over 20 months ago, Ambazari garden, the city’s biggest park, is likely to reopen again after two or more years. The delay is because the MTDC has considered the date of private developer — Garuda Amusements Park (Nagpur) Private Limited, Mumbai — as July 1 instead of the agreement date of November 22, 2019. On July 29, TOI had reported that the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) sought to take over Ambazari garden citing inconvenience to the public as it was closed since a long time. The MTDC and its private developer did not initiate redevelopment work despite getting approval from the government on July 3, 2017. A few days ago, people from adjoining areas led by West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre forcefully opened the gates of the garden for morning walkers. The MTDC had executed an agreement with the developer on November 22, 2019. The developer was expected to develop the project in the sprawling 42.85 acres within two years. If one were to go by the agreement then only three months are left for the completion of all the work. “Work is yet to begin at the site. The developer was supposed to first ensure financial closure of the project. As per the agreement, the fixed date for commencement of the work was supposed to be the date on which the developer was to achieve financial closure. The developer got financial closure of Rs 90 crore on July 1,” an official from MTDC told TOI. He added that the developer was given an extension as the financial closure was delayed due to the Covid pandemic. Meanwhile, MLA Thakre has alleged that MTDC committed a major irregularity by considering the date of financial closure as the appointed date. “The entire agreement is in the interest of the developer and not the public. The appointed date is always considered as the day of the agreement. The developer even handed over the garden in November 2019. MTDC was supposed to provide services to people immediately after the allottment by the government in 2017. The garden was in a running condition as the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) developed and maintained it by spending over Rs 50 crore of public money. The need of the hour is to set aside the agreement and hand over the entire land to NIT due to the inordinate delay. NIT will develop and operate it free of cost for the people,” he said. The MTDC can terminate the agreement if the developer fails to ensure financial closure within 150 days but this did not happen. The MTDC could have earned good revenue by recovering 0.05% of performance security (Rs 5 crore) per day for delay which too was neglected. The amount was supposed to increase to 0.1% in the next stage. Also, the MTDC was supposed to get additional revenue of Rs 1.5 crore followed by an annual concession fee of Rs 1.5 crore per annum from the commercial operation date. This opportunity too has been lost due to consideration of the appointed date as July 1 instead of November 22, 2019. NL Sawarkar from Jan Samasya Nivaran Manch too alleged that there’s an irregularity in considering July 1 as the appointed date despite the garden being in the possession of the developer since November 2019 and allotted by the government to MTDC in July 2017. “People in large numbers used to visit the garden in morning and evening for walking and fitness. Children, families and youngsters used to throng the garden throughout the day. Everybody has been affected after the garden was taken over from the NMC,” said Sawarkar. An MTDC official gave his version of things. “The developer is supposed to give the timeline for execution of the work in the third week of August. We will ensure that the work starts and a part of the garden is opened for walking and fitness in phase I,” he said. IN A NUTSHELL * State government owns Ambazari garden spread across 42.85 acres * NMC developed, operated and maintained the garden * Govt allotted land to MTDC on July 3, 2017 to develo a tourist spot * MTDC executed agreement with private developer in November 2019 * MTDC gave possession to developer in November 2019 who closed garden for public * Developer was to ensure financial closure within 150 days but did so on July 1 * MTDC considered appointed date as July 1 instead of date of agreement * Developer supposed to complete project within two years of appointed date which will now be extended by two more years * MTDC was supposed to recover charges for delay and also get revenue which too was avoided by consideration of appointed date as July 1||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/reopening-of-ambazari-garden-may-be-delayed-by-over-2-years/articleshow/85222355.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

On Tuesday morning, residents of Mangalaparthi found the burnt car in an open area close to the forest and saw the charred remains of a body in the dickey and immediately alerted police. Toopran DSP M Kiran Kumar along with a team of cops rushed to the spot and verified the details of the damaged car. With the help of the engine number, police were able to identify that the car belonged to D Srinivas (45), owner of a cinema hall in Medak town. Family members of Srinivas told police that he left home on Monday at 2 pm in his Honda City and did not return. Srinivas’ phone was switched off at 5 pm on Monday and police suspect that he was killed by unidentified persons after that. The spot where Srinivas’s charred body was found is about 40 km from Medak town. During a preliminary probe, police found that he was in a relationship with a married woman and suspected her family members could be involved in the murder. “The assailants killed Srinivas and then set the car ablaze with his body in the dickey,” the DSP said. A case was registered under IPC sections of murder and causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/theatre-owners-charred-body-found-in-car-in-medak-village/articleshow/85222350.cms||---

In anticipation of a potential third wave, the varsity has made arrangements and transformed one of the sections of the centre to a Covid centre, with beds and oxygen concentrators. DU is also working on getting in more concentrators.Vice-chancellor PC Joshi, who recently reviewed the arrangement, said: “We already have a Covid facility at Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, but as we had the space and facility, we thought of utilising it. The space is big enough and if need be, more beds can be attached. It will be a facility for the varsity staff and the community.”The staff at the university health centre has been looking after this facility. Delhi University also has two oxygen plants, one at the Patel Chest Institute and the other near the science department, which is usually used for academic purposes.The registrar of the university, Vikas Gupta added, “We are also working on getting more oxygen concentrators. In case of a third-wave, we should be well prepared to deal with any sort of crisis.” DU has estimated that the varsity would require 240 oxygen concentrators providing oxygen at a flow of 10 litres/min.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-campus-gets-another-covid-centre/articleshow/85219527.cms||Shradha Chettri

Councillors led by Sudhir Kandolkar and Anvi Korgaonkar, and activists protested at Xim Khorlim. Water accumulates on an arterial road leading to Verla-Canca and Parra, due to the unattended gutter, they said. Last month, when the state witnessed heavy rainfall, motorists were put to inconvenience as the road stretch remained submerged. Opposition councillors used bleaching powder to clean the stretch to prevent vehicles and pedestrians from slipping. Earlier this month, Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza had assured that the gutter would be repaired.“The council should repair the gutter immediately as locals are facing problems since last month,” said Kandolkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ultimatum-to-mapusa-civic-body-over-gutter-upkeep/articleshow/85225165.cms||---

A policy for allotment of CNG station sites through e-auction was also approved in the authority’s meeting chaired by LG Anil Baijal.The norms for parking lots now need the nod of Union ministry of housing & urban affairs. “The norms will bring in more clarity in terms of floor area ratio to be utilised for commercial use, which is a prerequisite considering the viability of the projects. The current modification has adopted a graded approach and commercial FAR will now vary as per the plot size,” a DDA spokesperson said.The construction and commercial FAR of parking lots would be linked to the Traffic Impact Assessment and Traffic Management Plan, apart from ensuring proper utilisation of the space and decongestion of adjoining areas.Under the policy for e-auction of CNG station sites, DDA would allot plots to individuals or gas distribution companies or its letter of intent holders on a licence. This would bring in transparency and increase efficiency in the process. Earlier, land was allotted for five years and increase in the rates was also uncertain as it was related to average auction rates. Under the new policy, the tenure of licence would be 10 years, renewable up to 30, with a fixed increase in the licence fee.“To promote green fuel in the city, DDA has decided to grant a discount of 50% on the value of land in fixing the reserve price. The new policy will encourage private investment by improving the environment of certainty. The policy is futuristic and will improve ease of doing business. It allows CNG and any other non-fossil fuel,” said the spokesperson.It was also informed that the processes of the housing department had been computerised and since June 1, only online applications were being received. “A campaign was initiated to dispose of all offline cases in a time-bound manner so that after transition to the online process, no case would remain pending beyond the time prescribed in the Citizen’s Charter,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-clears-ppp-norms-for-multilevel-car-parking/articleshow/85219491.cms||---

While residents breathed a sigh of relief, concerns loom large over the proliferation of mosquito menace after the heavy spells.

As there were complaints of slackness in fogging measures, corporation said that it is carried out only after dengue cases are reported. However, residents said that periodical fogging and spraying larvicide is necessary without waiting for cases to be reported.

After students of class 9 and 10 were also allowed by the state government to come to school and physically attend the classes, attendance in schools was supposed to increase, but it didn’t happen. Reluctance of parents to send their wards to schools with the fear of third corona wave lurking is a major reason for thin attendance in classes that are taking place in addition to other handicaps like school buses being off the road and classes taking place only once in a week for class11 and12 students and once in a fortnight for class 9 and10 students. “What do we do by opening our school? Parents are not ready to send their children to school. We also don’t want to put children at any risk. Everyday, you have news in the media about the potential third wave lurking around. So, we are also not pressing for attendance of students in classes”, said a teacher of a prominent missionary school of the city. “Some private schools have opened but attendance of students is negligible. You have 6 to 10 students in the class. There are reasons for it. Consent of parents is necessary. School buses are not there, so parents have to drop their children to school and pick them up. So, only students living near their school are attending offline classes”, said Vinny Raj Modi, vice-president, Association MP Private Unaided Schools. The way schools are being allowed to operate is not the proper way, he said. When asked whether the representatives of private schools had any dialogue with the district administration over the issue, he said “Yes. The district collector has asked us to wait till August 15, then some changes can be made in the schedule,” he said. The district administration has ensured that the entire staff of schools is vaccinated before they are allowed on the campus. A vaccination centre was set up in Subhash School of Excellence after schools opened for vaccination of teachers and other staff of the schools, who were not vaccinated till then, and by now the work has almost been completed. District collector Avinash Lavania, when asked whether all teachers have been vaccinated, “Largely yes. There may be a few here and there, who are not vaccinated but otherwise, every school teacher has been vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/3rd-wave-fears-keep-attendance-in-schools-thin/articleshow/85217762.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The state is now contemplating enacting the ‘Maharashtra public security Act’ to be able to firmly tackle the frontal organizations, their networks and activities. After the enactment comes into effect, the state would be able to ban outfits engaging in anti-government activities and spreading ideologies against establishments. “The Central government bans bigger organizations having nationwide activities but ignores smaller outfits operating only in a few districts. The enactment, like the Maharashtra public security Act, would help the state to bring prohibition on organizations which it feels could be a threat to public security and unrest in the society,” said an official. “The organizations too can appeal against the decision to impose a ban,” he said. In the first week of August, senior bureaucrats and police officials had a joint meeting regarding the issue of having a special security enactment like other states for reigning in anti-government activities. Sources said the state has been contemplating a special security act since the last five years. Sources said the death of Stan Swamy, an accused in the Koregaon Bhima case, has triggered a nationwide stir among frontal organizations who are aiming to make inroads into Maharashtra. To counter plans of the frontal organizations from spreading their activities, the state aims to bring in the enactment. DIG, Naxal range and in-charge of the state anti-naxal operations (ANO), Sandip Patil said the draft proposal is being considered by the government. “The proposal is being compiled with data and references for consideration,” he said. It’s learnt that the state is considering references of similar enactments in other states for preparing it’s draft proposal. The intelligence reports of the latest activities of the frontal organizations, their strengths and networks are also being taken into considerations with the latest incidents like Koregaon Bhima where involvement of urban Maoists have come to the fore. Documents seized from Maoists in Gadchiroli had references of urban networks and their future activities penned by senior cadres and think tanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-finding-it-tough-to-tackle-84-frontal-organizations-of-maoist-dens-in-five-districts/articleshow/85222396.cms||Soumitra Bose

The 65-year-old gastroenterologist plans to set up the project, comprising a medical university and hospital — to be called Global HealthTech University & Innovation Hub (GHUIH), with a focus on multidisciplinary research and innovation. The medical university, which would include a 750-1,000 bed hospital, and the health-tech innovation hub would require an infusion of over $100 million over a period of seven years. While Kancherla’s contribution will be able to take care of 50% of the capital requirements of the project, the remaining sum will be contributed by his friends from the medical, pharmaceutical and technology fraternity. “GHUIH is being established in Hyderabad to provide a new model for sustainable development of medical infrastructure...This institution is ﬁrst-of-its-kind in India and among few in the world. I have pledged 70% of my wealth for this cause and appointed executors for my registered will to ensure the project goes on stream despite any eventuality,” said Dr Ravindranath Kancherla. Work on the building is expected to commence by the end of this year, said his younger brother Dr Ramesh Kancherla. Ramesh pointed out that his older sibling has been mulling this project for a couple of years now as part of efforts to create an ecosystem for world class medical research in India and boost innovation in this field that would eventually benefit the common citizen. Dr Ravindranath, who is considered an expert in surgical gastroenterology, was part of the team of Indian and British doctors that tried to revive BJP leader Pramod Mahajan after he was shot in his Mumbai home in April 2006. The Global Hospitals founder also played a key role in establishing multi-organ transplant programmes including liver, heart, lungs, kidney and pancreases in India. He was also instrumental in popularising minimal access surgery in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-doc-pledges-rs-350cr-for-med-field/articleshow/85227419.cms||Swati Rathor

What is worrying health authorities in Ahmedabad and in cities such as Vadodara and Rajkot is the prospect of concurrent infections of two vector-borne diseases in an individual. A study conducted by the department of microbiology of PDU Medical College and Hospital, GMERS Rajkot, and a private hospital in Vadodara has reported such concurrent infections. They are dengue and chikungunya, and dengue and malaria in a single person. In Ahmedabad too the AMC came across two instances of concurrent infections. The study was published as a series of reports between June 2019 and April 2021. The Rajkot study involved 3,810 people who were screened for dengue, 2,122 who were screened for chikungunya, and 1,605 who were screened for both the diseases. The researchers came across 60 cases, almost 3.73%, where individuals were infected by both dengue and chikungunya. “Simultaneous infections of dengue and chikungunya viruses are more severe than a single infection,” the authors said. “The purpose of this research is to emphasize early detection and time-bound treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality rates.” The authors said another aim is to help the health authorities execute effective measures to prevent and control diseases. The authors of the study are professor Hetvi Chawda, associate professor Madhulika Mistry, and resident doctor Tanavi Chaudhari of GMERS Rajkot. In another study conducted by doctors at Dhiraj Hospital in Vadodara, 604 cases were analyzed and 58 patients (9.6%) tested positive for malaria and 80 patients (13.24%) were positive for dengue. Moreover, 21 patients (3.47%) were detected with concomitant infections — both dengue and malaria. The most affected age group was 31-60 years (45.53%). “The study revealed male preponderance (61.59%), hepatomegaly and jaundice were seen in 52.38% of the patients,” the authors said. “…haemorrhagic manifestations [were seen] in 23.80%, kidney failure in 4.76% (1), and thrombocytopenia was noted in 95.23% patients.” The research was carried out by Sangita Vasava, Sucheta Lakhani, and Jitendra Lakhani of Dhiraj Hospital. The doctors emphasized that it should be mandatory to test any patient with fever for both malaria and dengue. “The clinicians who treat fever patients in or from endemic areas must thoroughly examine and diagnose for both malaria and dengue,” the authors said. “Vector control, health education and good hygiene are community-based preventive measures that are needed to control both the diseases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/concurrent-infections-from-vectors-leave-doctors-worried/articleshow/85222398.cms||---

The admission process for diploma engineering colleges is underway and so far, 30,000 students have registered. As per the present criteria, the students who have cleared Class 10 after getting grace marks are eligible to participate in the admission process only after a few rounds of admissions are completed and seats are empty. “This year, number of students who passed with grace marks is very high and hence colleges have requested government to include such students from the first round looking at the large number of vacant seats in diploma courses,” said sources. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/change-rule-for-kids-with-grace-marks/articleshow/85222399.cms||---

According to residents, Ponmalai, which accounts for almost half of the fresh infections in the city in the past week, lacks special attention in contact tracing and enforcing the standard operating procedures to curtail the surge in cases. As per the weekly Covid-19 statistics shared by the district administration, Trichy city has recorded 151 fresh cases between August 1 and 7. The fresh cases in the previous two weeks were 175 (July 25 to 31) and 155 (July 18-24). While the city recorded a fall, Ponmalai zone witnessed a surge in the number of new cases. As many as 70 positive cases were reported in the Ponmalai zone between August 1 and 7. The fresh infections were 59 and 38 in the previous weeks. Compared to mid-July, Ponmalai’s fresh cases almost doubled. In the first week of August, out of the total 65 wards in Trichy, 44 wards have reported at least one fresh case. KK Nagar, Rajaram Road and Olaiyur Road that fall under ward 38 have reported 23 cases in a week. Airport locality and Wireless Road have reported 10 cases in the corresponding period. Even as the fresh cases are rising, health officials are yet to intensify contact tracing. The zone has a fine mix of residential-cum-commercial establishments besides the transport hubs including airport, railway junction and bus stand. “Ponmalai reports isolated cases, but bulk cases have not been reported so far. Since the area is vast, there are more cases,” an official with Trichy Corporation said. However, two wards of Ponmalai have reported bulk cases (10 to 23 cases) as per the weekly Covid-19 data shared by the district administration. Officials claimed that attending events in other districts was one of the major reasons for the fresh infections. Taking note of the weekly cases, residents demand intensified restrictions to prevent any possible clusters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/new-covid-cases-on-rise-in-ponmalai/articleshow/85222374.cms||Deepak Karthik

The survey by Indian School Finance Company (ISFC) with a sample size of 1000 schools revealed that there has been a quick transition to online education since the outbreak of the pandemic. From 40% in October 2020, today more than 70% of schools have shifted to one or other form of online classes. “Schools were one of the worst-hit segments as they largely rely on their physical infrastructure. A major ongoing paradigm shift is the adoption of digital approaches by schools. The online classes are part of the new normal now,” said Sandeep Wirkhare, MD & CEO of ISFC. The survey also revealed that while 80% of schools were collecting less than 20% of fees till November 2020, the fee collection has improved to 70% of schools now collecting more than 70% of the fees in urban and semi-urban centers. In rural centers, the percentage of schools collecting such fees has gone up to 35%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-keen-on-e-classes-finds-survey/articleshow/85222390.cms||---
---||Chennai||HC: How can govt apply state-specific OBC quota to AIQ?||CHENNAI: How could Tamil Nadu’s reservation formula of 50% for OBCs be followed under All India Quota (AIQ) MBBS seats, wondered the Madras high court, adding that the very purpose of AIQ would be defeated if state-specific quota is applied. “The demography of every state is different. Can an OBC in Rajasthan be considered an OBC in Tamil Nadu and will they get reservation under the Tamil Nadu reservation policy,” the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu asked on Tuesday. State reservation can be applied only to the unfilled AIQ seats which are returned to the state pool, the court added. Since AIQ seats are meant for students from other states and those from Tamil Nadu, a separate reservation policy must be followed. Many states like Meghalaya do not have OBC reservation. Can such states insist that they will follow only state reservation in the seats they surrender, the bench wondered. “Let us take the Vanniyar community. Are there Vanniyar communities in UP or in north-eastern states? If you want state reservation, then how does it become AIQ, it becomes your (state) seat. You are reserving it for a Vanniyar community candidate which means immediately it becomes your (state) seat it does not go into AIQ,” the judges said. Senior advocate P Wilson, representing the DMK, said: “We have a common list for the purpose of such AIQ seats issued by the central government and approved by the state. Once it is accepted by the state it becomes the government approved list.” The issue pertains to a contempt plea moved by the DMK against the Centre for failing to provide 50% OBC reservation in AIQ seats surrendered by the state for admission to medical courses as directed by the HC from the current academic year. Earlier, additional solicitor-general of SC K M Nataraj, representing the Centre, said, “All along SC and ST reservation has been provided in AIQ seats only on the basis of the Central Act. Now, if this is allowed, we have to adopt state reservation for OBCs alone which will lead to confusion.” Recording the submissions, the bench adjourned the hearing to August 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-how-can-govt-apply-state-specific-obc-quota-to-aiq/articleshow/85222459.cms||---

Mursalim Khan, currently an undergraduate student at AMU, told TOI on Tuesday that he had cleared the physical exam at the Army recruitment drive held in Kota last month, but was shocked to receive a rejection letter on July 29. The letter, which he shared with TOI, said the reason for rejection was the candidate’s studies from “an unauthorised board of education”. An Army officer involved in the recruitment rally told TOI the letter was issued since the AMU education board was missing from the list of state recognised boards sent by the UP government. “The list was provided by each state to the Army headquarters in January,” the officer said. AMU authorities, however, said the education board is listed with the Council of Boards of School Education in India (COBSE) and was granted its membership in October 2015. COBSE is an autonomous body established with permission from the Indian government which is responsible for verifying genuineness/recognition of school education boards in India. It grants membership to boards set up by an Act of Parliament or state legislature or by the executive order of the central/state government. According to Major (Dr) Syed Mohd Mustafa, principal of Saiyyid Hamid Senior Secondary School, one of the schools under AMU board, AMU schools are established under section 12 (1) and (2) of the AMU Act, 1920, enacted by the Parliament of India. The senior secondary schools were approved and recognised by UGC in May 1984. “The certificate issued by the board is recognised by the National Testing Agency (NTA) and its students take all top competitive exams in the country. How can it be an unauthorised board? This is serious, the government must look into this,” he said. Dinesh Sharma, UP deputy chief minister and minister of secondary and higher education, told TOI that he was unaware of the matter. “I will inquire into this,” he said. At present, there are 10 schools under AMU. About 2,900 students take class 12 examinations every year under the board. This is not the first time an Army aspirant was rejected for this reason. “Earlier as well, we have had complaints from our alumni about this,” said AMU vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor, who is also chairman of the AMU board. Former VC and Lt General Zameeruddin Shah said this indicated a “casual attitude” towards a premiere educational institution. “The issue should be resolved once and for all,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/army-says-amu-board-unauthorised-rejects-candidate/articleshow/85217772.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Hyderabad||Dhanush to be powered by metal from Midhani||HYDERABAD: Dubbed as India’s ‘Desi Bofors’ for its sheer power, the indigenous artillery gun ‘Dhanush’ will be getting its metal from the defence public sector undertaking Midhani in the city. The ministry of defence (MoD) plans to equip the Indian Army with 114 ‘Dhanush’ guns. Each ‘Dhanush’ costs Rs 14.50 crore. After initial field trials in 2016, six of these towed artillery guns were handed to the Army in 2019 at the Gun Carriage Factory in Jabalpur. But subsequently the Army sought modifications which are now being carried out by the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). The guns with a range of 38 km are improvised indigenous versions of the FH-77B 155 mm howitzers, originally produced by Sweden’s AB Bofors, following a technology transfer. Midhani chairman and managing director Sanjay Kumar Jha told TOI that the supply of high-strength special steel for ‘Dhanush’ would begin from Midhani to the Ordnance Factory Board once production begins. “We have a lot of products for the Army. Right now, Dhanush is the latest weapon which has been developed in the country. A lot of components, especially high-strength special steel for the barrel of the gun, has been supplied by Midhani. The material for the components will be rolled out from the factory here,” Jha said. Midhani has a factory within its premises at Kanchanbagh in Hyderabad which has been established with the support of the Ordnance Factory Board to meet its needs. “Naturally, top priority will be given to supplying OFB with the required materials that go into the manufacture of ‘Dhanush’,” Jha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dhanush-to-be-powered-by-metal-from-midhani/articleshow/85222411.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation floats tender to appoint construction debris recycler||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has embarked on an innovative path to ensure safe disposal of construction debris and process the same to be used for other construction activities, manufacturing paver blocks, tiles and ready-mix concrete etc. The civic body has floated tender for appointing a firm for collection and transportation of the construction and demolition (C&D) waste and establishment of 150 tonne per day (TPD) processing plant on public-private-partnership (PPP) for 20 years on design, finance, built, own, operate and transfer (DFBOOT) basis at Bhandewadi dumping yard. The NMC will not make any money from the project. Currently, the city generates around 1,200MT solid waste and 150MT construction and demolition waste per day. With no treatment facility, the C&D waste, which mostly includes bricks, stones and debris, is either dumped into rivers, nullahs, roadsides, open spaces or near trees which consequently impacts natural resources, biodiversity and water bodies. NMC’s public health engineering department stated that the quantity of C&D waste on call service and unclaimed debris shall be in the range of 100 to 150MT per day. It may vary depending upon seasons, festivals etc. It is estimated that the quantity may be at peak during summers and minimum or even zero during monsoon sometimes. The move was initiated after C&D Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 classified demolition and construction waste as a type of municipal solid waste and provided the framework to govern storage, collection, transportation, management and disposal of waste generated from all types of construction and demolition activities in Nagpur. Besides this, many developers in the city hire contractors to segregate the waste generated at construction sites. The waste which can be sold or reused is taken away by the contractors. The debris generated from old structures, building demolitions mostly end up being dumped in open spaces, pointed out a senior official from the NMC’s solid waste management department. “There is need to have a plant to recycle it,” he added. As per the tender conditions, a single C&D waste processing plant should have 75MT capacity in an 8-hour shift. The bidder will have freedom to operate the plant in two shifts for processing 150MT per day of C&D waste. The private firm so appointed will levy some tipping charges for lifting the construction waste from the sites and transporting it to the dumping yard. The official said town planning department will also be roped in for the project. “While sanctioning any new building plan, town planning department will ensure that the construction and demolition waste is handed over to the firm,” the official pointed out. “Once the plant is installed and starts functioning, dumping of waste in the open will certainly reduce. We will also be able to keep track of who is dumping the waste and take action accordingly,” said the official. GROUND REALITY City generates almost 150MT of construction and demolition waste per day No dedicated space for dumping construction waste It is being dumped either by roadside or open space or in river/nullahs * NMC to appoint firm for collection and transportation of construction and demolition waste * The operator will establish 150 tonne per day (TPD) capacity processing plant on PPP basis * A single plant should have 150 MTPD capacity for processing C&D waste in a single shift of 8 hours * The processed material recovered shall be utilized for preparing value added products along with selling rights in open market to successful bidder * Treated effluent to be used for aggregates, dust control and maintenance of green belt. The plant should be designed with zero discharge facility * Transportation & disposal of inert/remnants (if any) into scientific landfill at Bhandewadi (SW waste processing site) shall be the responsibility of the successful bidder||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-floats-tender-to-appoint-construction-debris-recycler/articleshow/85222431.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Pune||Maharashtra: In stiff competition, tie-breaker formula in play for FYJC entry||PUNE: The spectre of the common entrance examination for first Year Junior College admissions across the state has disappeared only to be replaced with unease about the cut-off marks which will now form the basis for entry to Std XI in state board colleges. The Bombay high court on Tuesday quashed the state government’s May 28 resolution on a Common Entrance Test. The relief that parents and students feel could well be short-lived as principals and educators have clearly indicated that cut-off marks will be very high. The internal assessment method used by the boards to calculate SSC results where close to one lakh students scored 90% and above has dictated that the competition to screen students for admission will be very close, they added . The court has directed the state to conduct admissions based on the marks students have obtained in Std X and also that the admission process be completed within six weeks. The court also rejected a plea for a stay of the order. Savita Kelkar, manager at Deccan Education Society that runs many junior colleges and schools like Fergusson College and Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce, said the cut-off marks in well-known colleges will be exceptional.  “In the grantable divisions, we can see the cut-off percentages going as high as 98-99%. In all the education boards, the number of students scoring 90% and above has increased drastically. It means there will be a huge rush to get admission in the top colleges in the cities from students across the state. We have added a non-grant division in the Arts (English) department this time to accommodate a large number of students. However; the fees will be higher than the grantable divisions as we have to appoint out own teachers,” Kelkar said. Each division consists of 120 students. Kelkar said they have seven science divisions in the college of which six are grantable and one is non-grantable. There is one grantable division each in Arts in the Marathi and English mediums along with one non-grantable division added for Arts in the English medium. Vasant Kalpande, educationist and former director of education, said it will be very difficult for colleges and equally hard for even the best of students to get admission in the top colleges in cities. “Some colleges will get many students with 100% marks because the number of these students also increased compared to the last year. It will be tough for colleges to compare marks and then put up the merit list as many students have scored the same marks. While getting into top colleges will be hard, I don’t think students will be left without admissions because even last year, there are many seats in colleges that remain vacant after the end of all the rounds,” he added.. Anubha Sahai, president of India Wide Parents Association, said, “No state except for Maharashtra was conducting a CET for admission to Std XI. There was a lot of uncertainty and confusion among parents and students from other boards because the syllabus of the CET was based on the state board syllabus. Students were not in favour of CET even though it was optional. But still students had applied for it as they had no choice and due to this the academic session in Maharashtra would also have been delayed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-stiff-competition-tie-breaker-formula-in-play-for-fyjc-entry/articleshow/85222417.cms||Ardhra Nair

After completing the inspection at few other sites and returning to New Delhi, the team will make a formal announcement, the minister told the reporters after reviewing the Covid-19 relief work and implementation of Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam scheme in Ariyalur district.“Our chief minister earlier had placed a demand with the Prime Minister to commence students’ intake as construction works in some of the upcoming medical colleges have reached a stage to support the students’ admissions. It was reiterated during my New Delhi visit too. Ramanathapuram, Kallakurichi, Virudhunagar, Nagapattinam and Namakkal medical college sites were inspected by a central team,” the minister said.Two more medical colleges including one in Ariyalur are likely to be inspected by the team on Wednesday for reviewing the possibility of commencing intake of students, he added. As there is a demand to shift the district headquarters government hospital from Ariyalur to Jayankondam, the minister said that the demand will be formally taken to the chief minister.He added that health workers appointed on a contract basis will gradually be made permanent workers. “For Perambalur district, there was a proposal for a separate government medical college hospital made by the previous DMK government. We will revive the proposal,” he said. He also reviewed the vaccination drive under CSR activity in Ariyalur and Perambalur districts. Reacting to the questions on the DVAC raid at former minister S P Velumani properties, Subramanian said that tabling of the white paper report on state’s finances has nothing to do with it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/admissions-to-new-tn-medical-colleges-to-begin-soon-health-min/articleshow/85222403.cms||---

Currently, only schools in rural areas are open with students of Std VIII-XII attending classes. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “We will go through the GR and study the guidelines. Following that, an appropriate decision will be taken after reviewing the situation in city.” Amravati collector Pawaneet Kaur and municipal commissioner Prashant Rode too said they will review the GR in detail and then take a decision. In Chandrapur, zilla parishad CEO Shrikrishna Panchal said, “I shall take a review on August 11 and will take a final decision if at all the collector issues guidelines by tomorrow.” Academics in city are happy with the state government’s decision. Madhu Joseph, principal of Bengali High School, said, “This is a really good decision as we cannot keep on going like this. Already, students are roaming around to friends’ places or restaurants, so I do not see how infection can be caught only on school campus. Studies have taken a back seat for many students and a few have even started taking assessments for granted.” Premlata Tiwari, principal of Bhola High School, said, “Schools must reopen for physical mode because it’s been too long and it’s having a detrimental effect on students. We can restart by keeping all safety precautions in mind. Teachers are already coming to campus and almost everyone has been vaccinated, so that provides a big safety net.” Shilpee Ganguly, principal of Centre Point School (Katol Road), said, “It’s high time that schools start in physical mode as we all have the ability to ensure a safe environment for students. I am confident that both students and schools will follow all SOPs. As it is so many students are travelling to hill stations, beaches and other places. So compared to that, schools are much safer.” Ashok Gavhankar, principal of Raosaheb Thawre Junior College, said, “This is a welcome decision as students from poor socio-economic conditions cannot access online classes. In Nagpur city itself, 40% of the students are not able to attend online lectures due to not having a smartphone. Hence, I welcome the decision to begin physical classes.” The state education department has reiterated that attendance is not mandatory. An education official said, “Some sections of parents got really hyper last time when we opened schools. So if you (parent) are not convinced about the school’s ability to follow SOPs or are worried about your kid’s behaviour on campus, don’t send them. Online classes will continue as per schedule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-reopening-gets-state-nod-local-officials-to-take-final-call-this-week/articleshow/85219748.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Trichy||Demand for Aavin milk soars in Trichy region post lockdown||Trichy: The demand for milk sold by the state-run Aavin Milk Producers’ Federation in the Trichy region has increased post the second wave of Covid-19. The safety factor in buying packed milk has encouraged people to opt for Aavin milk during the lockdown. Apart from that, the slashed milk prices have also played a key role for Aavin to rack up and retain the consumer base. Even after lockdown relaxations, Aavin sustains the demand by selling more than 10,000 litres of milk in July compared to last year.By procuring milk from more than 600 milk producer societies, Aavin dairy unit in Kottapattu in Trichy city is distributing milk and milk products to the customers in Trichy, Ariyalur and Perambalur districts. Often it sends surplus milk to Chennai. Before March 2020, Aavin Trichy was selling 1.12 lakh litres of milk per day. The sales volume marginally increased to 1.16 lakh litres per day after July 2020.During the second wave, when the fresh infections increased forcing the government to implement another lockdown, the difficulty in buying milk from unorganised milk vendors and private firms have pushed people to opt for Aavin, the officials said. While people have to collect milk in containers or vessels from mobile milk vendors, a section of the public have opted for packed milk citing safety. During July, the state-run milk producer sold 1.25 lakh to 1.29 lakh litres of milk per day, well over 10,000 litres per day compared to the previous year.“The reduction of price by around Rs 3 per litre has also boosted our sales by around 10,000 to 13,000 litres per day during the second wave. Apart from the sales through vendors and our kiosks, around 2,000 new consumers became our direct cardholders to avail milk at a subsidised price,” N Rasikala, DRO/general manager, Aavin Trichy, told TOI. The officials added that people can avail themselves of the monthly cards from Aavin in three locations namely Chinthamani near MGMGH, Old milk farm on Thanjavur Main Road and head office on the Pudukkottai NH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/demand-for-aavin-milk-soars-in-trichy-region-post-lockdown/articleshow/85222438.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: What a cat-astrophe! Persian goes missing||AHMEDABAD: When Jitendra Devasi saw that the door to his South Bopal house had been left open, he knew it had trigged a cat-aclysm. A search of the house confirmed the feeling of doom: Bijli, his two-year-old punch face Persian cat had disappeared. Though the door had been accidentally left open, the 35-year-old believes that his “trusting” cat has been stolen. He has offered a reward of Rs 21,000 to anyone who would help him reunite with his pet. Devasi, who is a stock market investor, said the incident occurred on August 4. He and his wife Pooja Gulhare, a 33-year-old who works in a managerial position at a corporate firm, had adopted Bijli and Babban, another Persian cat, from an acquaintance about four months ago. “Bijli must have stepped out of the house when the maid left the door open. There are no CCTV cameras covering the floors but I believe that Bijli has been stolen,” said Devasi, who lives in a flat on the twelfth floor of Binori Solitaire Society. Explaining why, he said, “The cats are extremely loving and anyone can hold them. The only possibility is that grabbed Bijli, put her in a bag and walked away. This could be why there is no footage of the cat on the society’s CCTV cameras,” said Devasi. The Devasis, who had bonded greatly with the cats, feel Bijli’s loss keenly. “The cats liked to eat ‘treats’ twice a day along with their regular cat food,” said Devasi who posted pictures of Bijli and his phone number on social media along with his offer for a reward for anyone who finds her. Devasi has been receiving several calls since then. “Some inquire about the features of the cat, others call to sympathise with me. However, I am just waiting for that one call that will bring Bijli back into our lives,” he said. Macaw lost and found Raag Patel, a businessman residing in Polytechnic area, lost his three-month-old pet macaw about 10 days ago. However, luck favoured him and he found it the next day. "The bird was born in my house. Some days ago, it found an opening in the house and flew away. I posted pictures of it on social media sites and a user replied that he had spotted a similar bird on LD Engineering College campus. We went there, found him and brought him back home," said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/what-a-cat-astrophe-persian-goes-missing/articleshow/85222542.cms||---

---||Pune||Govt officials to soon decide about reopening of schools across Pune||PUNE: A government resolution on Tuesday stated that schools in the municipal corporation area can reopen for classes from Std VIII to XII while classes from Std V to VII can reopen in rural areas from August 17, with appropriate permission. Parental consent to attend school for all students is a must.  The order comes even as the state Covid task force has advised against rushing with reopening schools in view of fears that a possible third wave could target children who have not been vaccinated at all. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said schools are starting in a phased manner. “The physical education of class 10 and 12 students should not suffer. Students’ health is a priority and all Covid protocols have to be in place before reopening,” said Gaikwad. The state’s decision to further reopen schools is based on the Indian Council of Medical Research’s fourth sero-survey which showed antibodies prevalent in children aged 6 to 9 was 52%. Also, its research shows 81% parents willing to send children to schools. A decision for schools in Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation areas will be taken by the respective municipal commissioners and a committee, and for the Pune rural areas by the district collector and his committee. When the decision to allow schools to reopen in Covid-19 free villages in rural areas was taken last month by the state government, about 121 schools had reopened their classes from Stds VIII to XII in Pune rural area which was attended by 7,034 students. The total number of schools in the Pune district which includes Pune rural, PMC and PCMC in the classes from VIII to XII bracket is 947 in which 2,40,394 students are enrolled. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said a decision would follow for the schools under his jurisdiction. Manjushree Khardekar, chairperson of the education committee of PMC, also said that a meeting will soon be held to decide on school reopening in city limits. “We had planned to start in July, but there was no go-ahead from the state. Now there is a green signal and we will try our best,” she said. A senior official from the district collectorate said that a meeting will be held in the next few days that will decide about the reopening of schools in the jurisdiction.

The commission is working on a plan to provide postal ballot facility to divyang (disabled) and old age voters. Local authorities in each district of UP have been directed to compile details of the divyang voters and those above 80 years of age. Meanwhile, the SEC has also directed district magistrates to ensure number of votes on each booth does not exceed over 1,000. Firozabad additional district magistrate Aditya Prakash Srivastava said, “Divyang and old age people had to suffer much inconvenience while going to polling booths. The SEC has sought details of all the divyang and people above 80 years of age. The exercise is aimed to provide them with postal ballot facility during the assembly election 2022. All the sub-divisional magistrates have been directed to collect details of such people. These people would be able to cast their vote from home.” Following Covid-19 precautions, the SEC has directed district administrations to divide polling booths in such a way that the maximum number of voters does not exceed 1,000 voters at any of these booths. Kasganj additional district magistrate Vivek Kumar Mishra said, “Following orders of the SEC, the number of polling booths in the district will be increased. There will not be more than 100 voters at one polling booth. This means that more staffers will be required to conduct the assembly elections. Following the Covid-19 precautions, polling parties will not be assembled at a single centre. Constituency-wise centres will be determined. Besides, additional tables will be established for the vote-counting process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-poll-panel-plans-postal-ballot-facility-for-divyang-old-age-voter/articleshow/85217784.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Chennai||Chennai man walks with 5 kidneys after third transplant||CHENNAI: A 41-year-old man, who underwent a third kidney transplant, walked out of the hospital with five kidneys. On Tuesday, after his first set of post-operation checks, surgeons at Madras Medical Mission said he is recovering well. The transplant team also said they were now confident that a third renal transplantation constitutes a valid therapeutic option for select patients. In 1994, when the patient was 14, his kidneys failed, prompting his first transplant that lasted nine years. The second was in 2005 and was functional for 12 years. But, for the next four years, he had to be strapped to a dialysis machine nearly three times a week. In patients with chronic kidney disorder, kidneys stop filtering out body waste through urine. As the disease progresses, the kidney’s function is taken over by dialysis machines. “His first and second transplant failed due to his uncontrolled hypertension. To complicate things more, he underwent a triple bypass surgery to repair blocks in the heart in March at our hospital,” said transplant surgeon Dr S Saravanan. Though the best option doctors could offer was transplant, the procedure was complex. First, the patient had two native kidneys and two donor kidneys in his body. Now doctors had to find room for a fifth. “Connecting them with the blood vessels was even more challenging. With four dysfunctional kidneys, there was hardly any width left in the arteries or veins,” he said. Transplant surgeons don’t remove the dysfunctional kidneys to make space because of risk of profuse bleeding. “When that happens, the patient will require blood transfusion. This could lead to the production of antibodies which could cause rejection of the new kidney,” Saravanan said. During the surgery on July 10, the team decided to place the kidney close to the intestine and connect the blood vessels closer to the arteries and veins of the heart. The renal artery was connected at the point of bifurcation of aorta and the renal vein was linked to inferior vena cava (largest vein going into the heart). “This transperitoneal approach (through the gut) is rarely performed,” he said. Doctors said that they will continue to closely monitor his condition for a few more months to ensure his immune system does not fight the new organ or his blood pressure does not cause trouble once again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-walks-with-5-kidneys-after-3rd-transplant/articleshow/85222518.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Opposition attacks govt over police action against tribes people||THIRUVANANTHPURAM/PALAKKAD: The opposition attacked the government on Tuesday alleging increasing incidents of police high-handedness citing the recent arrest of tribal community members in Attapadi. But, CM Vijayan threw his weight behind the police justifying the role played by the force in controlling the pandemic and the floods of 2018. Seeking a leave for adjournment motion, Mannarkkad MLA N Shamsudheen said the arrest of a tribal chieftain Choriyamooppan and his son Murugan by the police on Sunday had crossed all limits in the manner in which the community members were treated. He said the police reached their house at 6am, created a terrorizing atmosphere and manhandled Murugan’s son. Vijayan said the matter relates to a conflict between two families and police action was a natural one to uphold the rule of law and ensure the maintenance of law and order. He further listed many instances, including the role played by police during 2018 floods and the ongoing pandemic, to explain how police have become a pro-people force under LDF government. The CM added that those who oppose the police are the ones who wish that the rule of law doesn’t prevail in state. “Anarchists, extremists and communal forces are deliberately becoming a part of this. Coming up with false but colourful stories against the police every day has become a trend now,” he claimed. Opposition leader VD Satheesan said it was unfortunate that the CM was justifying the police, without going into the merit of each incident. He said that whatever the police gave in writing to the CM, regarding the incident, is not true. He said that Murugan, who had been forcefully arrested by a big team on Sunday, had approached the police twice on August 3 and 6 with a complaint of attack on his wife. But, police did nothing. But two days later, in another complaint, a big team of police created havoc to arrest him and his father. “Police slapped on the face of Murugan’s minor son, tore his dress. Is this the way people-friendly police operate in state,” he asked, adding that police were hand-in-glove with the land mafia, against whom Murugan, an activist, was protesting. Satheesan said the state is placed seventh when it comes to atrocities against SC and ST, and is the only state from the south which figures among the top 10 states in that list. Probe begins into assault of tribal chief, sonCrime branch deputy superintendent of police C Sundaran has began probe into the alleged undue use of force by Sholayur police in arresting Choriya mooppan and Murugan in the early hours on Sunday, as per directions from district superintendent of police R Viswanathan. The crime branch DSP collected statements from Rajeev, the 17-year-old differently-abled son of Murugan, and his mother Rami. Rajeev was injured during the police action and is admitted at Kottathara Tribal Specialty Hospital. The DSP visited the incident spot too and took statements from the tribespeople.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-attacks-govt-over-police-action-against-tribespeople/articleshow/85222591.cms||---

Acquitting a woman who was convicted by a trial court, the verdict was upheld by the Bombay HC, of murder charges of her husband's first wife, her step son and daughter, a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and A S Bopanna said it is a natural human conduct to immediately get away from the scene and save oneself when there is any accident and it can't be the sole basis to come to the conclusive findings that she had set the house on fire to kill her relatives. "It takes a person lot of courage or be overdriven with compassion to get back into the house to save somebody else and not doing so may be considered as morally wrong, but it cannot be a circumstance to hold a person guilty of a crime which is as serious as murder unless the other circumstances point to the accused so as to lead to an irresistible conclusion of being guilty," the bench said. In the present case, a house caught fire at midnight but the accused came out of the house without having any injury but three other members lost their lives. The accident took place when her husband was out-of station and the trial court came to the conclusion that she had a strong motive to commit the crime as she wanted to get rid of her husband's first family and was convicted. Quashing the trial court and the HC verdict, the apex court said just because the appellant was not injured, it cannot be the basis to come to the conclusion that she had put the house on fire. "Suspicion, however strong, cannot take the place of proof. Unfortunately, with the nature of observations made by the high court, it has ultimately held that the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that it is the appellant only who has set the deceased and her children on fire with a view to remove them from her marital life," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-murder-charge-for-not-saving-kin-from-house-fire/articleshow/85228485.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||Chennai||Chennai: Remove squatters from Ramapuram lake now, says NGT||CHENNAI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed revenue authorities to remove all encroachments along Ramapuram Lake immediately. In 2015, Greater Chennai Corporation, which maintains the lake, identified 250 families who have encroached on the lake area. About 79% of the water body, originally spread over 7.13 hectares, has been encroached by houses and shops, data revealed. The civic body requested the revenue department in 2015, 2018 and 2019 to clear the encroachments and hand over the remaining lake portion to it so further pollution can be prevented. But six years on, the Maduravoyal tahsildar is yet to earmark the encroached portion, the civic body told the NGT. The corporation added that it was working with Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) and other related agencies to enumerate families living on encroached land and take a bio-survey so they can be resettled at TNSCB tenements. “If civic body authorities enumerate these slum families and evict the 250 slum families, TNSCB can provide tenements for them at Perumbakkam,” the agency’s managing director said. TNSCB is constructing 4,140 tenements at Perumbakkam, slated for completion by this year, as part of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) scheme, the MD told TOI. The corporation has to pay a beneficiary contribution of Rs 5 lakh per tenement (tentative). When hearing the case in July, NGT Southern Zone ordered a water quality test at the lake by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). On August 4, TNPCB told the tribunal that test results were awaited. Criticizing TNPCB for the delay, NGT directed the board to submit the report before the September 3 hearing.

Though only Std VIII-XII are allowed to remain open for physical classes, even the smaller kids are rushing back to campus after seeing ‘bhaiyyas’ and ‘didis’ heading off to the school. The negligible enrolment and less number of higher classes in ZP ecosystem has come as a boon for officials. Chintaman Vanjari, district education officer under whose jurisdiction ZP schools come, said, “We have hardly 10 or so schools for the high level classes. Also with limited enrolment, teachers can ensure proper Covid distancing and conduct classes according to the guidelines.” While in urban schools a single section can have around 40 to 50 students, in ZP schools that could very well be the total enrolment of all classes. With online teaching not an option for most of them, the return of physical classes was a relief for officials too. Sharad Bhandarkar, ZP’s extension officer, said, “The online teaching concept can’t work in rural areas because of connectivity issues, plus also the affordability of smartphones for parents. In such a scenario, the physical reopening is a welcome step.” Kishore Gamey, ZP’s kendra pramukh who supervises around a dozen ZP schools, said the reopening of schools is helping to narrow the learning gap among students. “Students have fallen behind the academic schedule for the last one year and we promoted them based on some basic assessments. Now, there is a clear learning gap which is visible and teachers are focused on taking remedial classes to overcome these issues,” said Gamey. Ranjana Wahane, teacher at ZP Pitesur School, said students too were looking forward to come back to classes. Wahane said, “Students in rural areas are extremely attached to school because of the unique settings. The ZP school is the only institute in a village and students see it as an extension of their home. In the evening, they would come and play on the campus anyway. So during the lockdown, it was like shutting down a part which was close to their heart.” Manisha Uikey, teacher at ZP Bharatwada School said, “Right now, we are doing revision and new curriculum both. We have to partly catch up with the learning backlog and also prepare for the current one.” Even the primary section students are not being deprived of education. Many come and sit under the shade of a large tree or out in the open basking under the soft morning Sun for classes. They are not taken inside classrooms, as technically permission is only for high school. Gamey said, “Education must not stop for those who are willing to learn. Teachers are visiting homes of these students too, so that their academic schedule is not disrupted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/zp-school-students-biggest-beneficiaries-of-reopening/articleshow/85219882.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Allahabad||Flood fury: Situation in Prayagraj grim, brings back 1978 memories||PRAYAGRAJ: With the swollen rivers Ganga and Yamuna marooning several areas, memories of the worst-ever floods of 1978 have come back to haunt the survivors. People in the low-lying areas are having sleepless nights as the water level of both the rivers is rising at an alarming pace of 3cm per hour. Spell of heavy rain in the past 24 hours has added to the woes of the people. Situation could be gauzed by the fact that the level of water of Ganga at Phaphamau (as recorded at 6pm on Tuesday) was over one meter above the danger mark. The water level was 85.78 meters while the danger mark is at 84.74m. Likewise, the water level of Ganga at Chhatnag was 85.03m at 4pm and still rising. The water level of river Yamuna too has increased in the past 24 hours. The water level at 10pm (Monday) was 85.21m, which increased to 85.68m at 6pm on Tuesday. The entire Gaughat, Baradari of Balaughat and parts of Kareli are submerged in flood water. Flood water has fully submerged the ground floor of many localities situated on the banks of Ganga and boats are being used to ply people and necessary items. Areas like Bagraha, Daraganj, Salori, Beli Gaon, Mehenduari Goan, Ganga Nagar, parts of Rajapur and Ashok Nagar are also marooned. On Tuesday too, teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the local administration were busy shifting people to safer places or providing necessary items to those stranded in the flooded localities. “We are providing all the help needed by the flood affected locals and do rounds of the localities every two hours and asking if anyone wants to move to safer places but now as people have shifted to first floors of their houses, they are reluctant to leave”, said team leader of NDRF, Inspector Dinkar Tripathi. One team of NDRF having 25 personnel with two boats have been pressed into service to help flood victims. However, with the flood situation worsening, memories of 1978 flood has started haunting the people. “We still remember that localities, including Mumforganj, Kyganj, Muttuganj, Alopibag, Khatghar, Bairana and Kareli were flooded. Had it not been the efforts of then district magistrate Bhure Lal and the SSP Ajay Raj Sharma along with the strong force of students of Allahabad University and several colleges and social organization, the damage would have been multi fold,” said Anand Prasad, a local. “The flood of 1978 was so intense that waves of river Yamuna were colliding with the road of the bridge and we still remember Ganga and Yamuna had inundated almost every locality of the city. Barring the inside high land, people of Allahapur used to sit in the boats from the first floor of their houses,” said veteran politician of the city Shyam Krishna Pandey. The then DM had not slept for four days and four night continuously and assured that the relief items reaches everyone affected by the floods. Sharing his experience, Congress MLA from city North, Anugrah Narayan Singh said, “The flood water from Ganga had crossed the present pump house of the Stanley road of Mumfordganj because of which the entire locality was inundated and boats were pressed into service”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/flood-fury-situation-in-prayagraj-grim-brings-back-1978-memories/articleshow/85225458.cms||---

The spaces will be given on rent for a period of 30 years. A proposal regarding the same has been tabled before the standing committee. The BJP-led municipal corporation has claimed that the proposal is aimed at revenue generation. However, the idea has not gone down well with the opposition parties and activists who have pressed for recovery of pending civic taxes, rather than giving public places to private parties. “The civic administration has many revenue sources, which have not been used to their full capacity and the officials should focus on them,” said Vivek Velankar of the Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizen group. “These places are for public and they should not be viewed as revenue generation sources,” said Vaishali Patekar of the Aundh Vikas Mandal, another citizen group. “Our party is not in favour of this move. The spaces should be used for civic amenities,” said Aba Bagul, leader of the Congress in the PMC. “We want to build an all-party consensus on this policy, so the final call has been kept on hold. The decision will be taken in the next meeting,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-opposition-parties-against-amenity-space-lease/articleshow/85221387.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The highway remained blocked for several hours, leaving tourists and local passengers stranded, informed the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC). A video of the incident that shows a large part of a hill collapsing and boulders rolling down and falling into the valley below, creating a thick cloud of dust and debris, as people scurry away to save themselves, has been widely circulated on social media. However, people on both sides were stopped well in advance, so there has been no injury or death in the incident, according to the officials of the disaster management department. Incessant rains over the last 48 hours resulted in multiple landslides, quickly blocking all Char Dham highways and nearly 100 roads, most of them village link roads. Efforts are on to clear the debris and open the roads, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chunk-of-hill-collapses-boulders-roll-down-as-badrinath-highway-gets-blocked-at-totaghati-video-goes-viral/articleshow/85217816.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Dehradun||Experts warn of water scarcity in Himalayan states||DEHRADUN: A day after the United Nations’ intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) in its sixth assessment highlighted depleting snow cover and glacial melt in Himalayas, experts have called for urgent intervention and warned that both factors could lead to water scarcity in Himalayan states. D P Dhobhal, former senior glaciologist at Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan geology, said that hills already have low groundwater table and depleting snow and retreating glaciers would only compound the problem, leading to water scarcity in Himalayan states. “Water remains in the atmosphere but because of run-off in slopes, hills may face shortage. Hilly areas are largely dependent on glacial rivers to meet their needs and groundwater is not easily accessible, so they are likely to face water shortage,” he said. The IPCC report, which was released on Tuesday, said that snow-covered areas and snow volumes will decrease in most regions of the Hindu Kush Himalaya during the 21st century and snowline elevations will rise and glacier volumes are likely to decline with greater mass loss in higher carbon dioxide emission scenarios. Experts said the glaciers in the Himalayas feed ten of the world’s most important river systems and are critical water sources for nearly two billion people. Experts TOI spoke to said the time to act was now. MPS Bisht, director of Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, said it was time to develop concrete plans to enable development of communities resilient to climate change. “Look at Japan, they had frequent tremors so they thought of measures to mitigate damage. Singapore fought off water scarcity with new technology, we need similar interventions to battle climate change because climatological cycles are inevitable,” he said. Subrat Sharma, centre head of Ladakh Regional Centre, GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, said the first IPCC report came out in 1990 and three decades later, we are still grappling with the same issues. “There is much focus on figures and data, but little thrust on mitigation measures. Water scarcity is a global issue, but how far have we really come to conserving it since 1990?” Sharma added that water conservation measures were required to be implemented across the globe, and not just in the Himalayas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-ipcc-flags-off-depleting-snow-experts-warn-of-water-scarcity-in-himalayan-states/articleshow/85217807.cms||Shivani Azad

However, the government has once again failed to fill top posts of regional transport officers in both Nagpur city and rural. Deputy RTO from Gondia Vijay Chavhan has been transferred to Gadchiroli, while from East office deputy RTO Vinod Jadhav, who was also holding additional charge of city RTO, has been shifted to Malegaon. Sources said the post of rural RTO has been vacant for the last two years and that the city office has been headless since March this year. Deputy RTO from Gadchiroli Ravindra Bhuyar has been transferred to Nagpur East office. Earlier too, he was posted there. Deputy RTO from Wardha Bajrang Kharmate has been given the additional charge of RTO rural, Kamptee Road. Additional responsibilities on officials have already hit the smooth functioning of both city and rural offices. Despite this, the transport commissioner office in Mumbai has failed to fill the vacant posts of RTOs in Nagpur city and rural. Additional secretary D Kadam issued the transfer orders and directed the 12 deputy RTOs to join their new postings without delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-deputy-rtos-in-division-transferred/articleshow/85217834.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dubai couple set to fly out three months after scheduled departure||KOLKATA: Khusboo and Vicky Kriplani are finally hoping to fly back to Dubai from Kolkata on Friday, ending more than three months of anxiety and life on tenterhooks. Months of uncertainty—Vicky’s parents are in Dubai alone and his work visa is slated for expiry in mid-September—came to an end as the authorities there on Monday agreed to recognise vaccination in India and permitted travel from here. The couple had flown down to the city on March 15 for medical treatment and were due to return to Dubai in April-end, when the UAE, along with several other countries, announced a ban on travel from India to prevent the spread of a more virulent strain of the novel coronavirus. With India figuring among the red list countries, the Kriplanis and thousands of others, who lived and worked elsewhere but were visiting India, were stranded. “Initially, we thought the embargo on travel was perhaps for a week or a fortnight. But when it continued, we started to get worried. My parents, both senior citizens, are in Dubai. Though they have been managing on their own till now, it is a constant worry. In addition, my work visa is due to expire in mid-September. If I didn’t return before that, the situation would get even more complicated,” said Vicky, who works in the finance department of a multinational tobacco firm based in Dubai. Vicky is an Australian passport holder with an Overseas Citizen of India card and a work permit from UAE authorities. Khushboo is an Indian citizen but is eligible for an Australian residency permit. At present, her Dubai visa is sponsored by Vicky. The first signs of hope appeared on August 4, when the UAE National Emergency & Crisis Management Authority (NECMA) announced that it would allow those with residency permits to take flights back from India. However, it was opening the doors only to those who had taken Covid vaccine shots in the UAE. That made the Kriplanis ineligible as they had both taken the vaccine in India. “Since we were stranded here and needed protection, we decided to take the Covishield vaccine, hoping it would be recognised by all countries as it is the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine licensed for manufacture in India. So, when the authorities there said only those who were fully vaccinated in the UAE would be allowed, it was disappointing,” Vicky said. On Monday evening, he received a call from travel agent Anil Punjabi, informing him that UAE authorities had allowed even those vaccinated in India to travel so long as they had a valid residency permit. Though he is yet to see the notification from the UAE authorities, he quickly booked their tickets on Friday’s flight, applied for the nod from NECMA and is set to undergo RT-PCR tests within 48 hours before travel. “I will also apply for being allowed to travel under humanitarian grounds since my parents are alone there. We are both praying things work out smoothly and we are able to travel back,” Vicky added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dubai-couple-set-to-fly-out-three-months-after-scheduled-departure/articleshow/85222687.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Chennai||Velumani has to battle pending corruption complaints as well||Chennai: While Tuesday’s DVAC raid against former minister S P Velumani and his associates was founded primarily on corruption complaints made by Arappor Iyakkam and the DMK, the former minister faces two more complaints. One was made by DMK MLA and Tamil Nadu assembly Speaker M Appavu with the DVAC alleging multi-crore corruption by Velumani in replacing 23.72 lakh street lights in village panchayats across the state with LED lights. The other is a recent complaint made by contractor R Thiruvengadam with the Chennai police commissioner alleging that Velumani had cheated him of Rs 1.25 crore on the promise of assigning civil contracts. According to Appavu’s complaint, LED lights worth Rs 450 in the open market were purchased for Rs 3,737 and lights worth Rs 1,550 were purchased for Rs 14,919 each. Claiming that from 2015 to 2018 a total of Rs 969 crore had been allotted for the purpose in three phases, the complainant said: “Of Rs 969 crore, about Rs 400 crore was apportioned from the funds received from 14th Finance Commission, Rs 300 crore from State Finance Commission and Rs 200 crore the capital grant fund intended for rural local bodies fund.” In addition to this, Rs 69.3 was appropriated from the district and panchayat union funds concerned, Appavu added. As per panchayat raj system, funds allotted from the union Finance Commission could be utilised only by the elected village panchayat presidents concerned. Neither the state government nor any second party authority can interfere in the administration of financial power of village panchayats, Appavu said. And yet, the then minister, by constituting the committee, usurped the powers of village panchayats and managed to allot tenders to his ‘benamis and shell companies’, Appavu alleged. Since the DVAC had not acted upon his July 15, 2020, complaint, Appavu moved the Madras high court for a direction to register an FIR. However, since he became Assembly speaker after the April 2021 assembly polls, Appavu withdrew his HC petition. In his complaint, Thiruvengadam said he had known Velumani since 2002. In 2016, Velumani promised to assign him civil contracts of the corporation and obtained Rs 1.25 crore ‘advance commission’. In the complaint, Thiruvengadam said he paid Rs 1 crore to the former minister at his official residence on Greenways Road, Chennai, in March 2016 and another Rs 20 lakh in July 2016, apart from Rs 5 lakh paid to Velumani’s personal assistant. Since he was not allotted any contract as promised, he had demanded his money back. In July, when he met Velumani in this regard, he alleged that Velumani had threatened to eliminate him if he demanded the money again. The complaint has been forwarded to the CCB for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/velumani-has-to-battle-pending-corruption-complaints-as-well/articleshow/85222628.cms||Sureshkumar

The daily’s editorial on Tuesday said a set of lawyers who try to keep the court premises impervious to the media should be taken to task. It also criticized the police for remaining mute spectators amid the unjustifiable act. The editorial was published in the backdrop of the latest attack on the media by a group of lawyers on Monday. A senior photographer of Siraj daily was ambushed by a group of lawyers after a policeman heckled him and sought the help of lawyers to ascertain his identity. “A criminal mafia is thriving in the court complex waylaying judges, engaging in altercation with magistrates and insulting new magistrates. These are all plain violations of the oath taken while enrolling as lawyers. Such barbarism doesn’t qualify for legal protection,” the editorial said. The daily said it was a small section of lawyers who take the law into their hands and a large section of lawyers were sorry about it. The editorial said the latest attack has proved that none of the interventions by higher courts to settle the issues have worked out. The editorial called for effective intervention by higher courts to put an end to the ‘criminalism’ by advocates in court premises. Legislature too should intervene to establish a lasting solution to the undeclared ban slapped by a section of lawyers on media at court premises, it said. A media room in court complex remains inaccessible to media persons. The editorial asked lawyers to behave in a proper way that would help uphold the public trust in the judiciary and legal system..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpi-mouthpiece-slams-lawyers-cops-for-attack-on-journalists/articleshow/85222655.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why RTO under lock and key is good news for you||NEW DELHI: On Wednesday morning, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal put a lock on the large gates of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) at IP Depot to open a “faceless services” for Delhiites, thus becoming the first state in the country to provide online facilities on such a large scale. Starting with three services on a trial basis in February, 33 major transport-related facilities have now become online covering almost 95% of all applications that Delhi government’s transport department receives. Through these services, including an e-sign facility, applicants would be able to save time and money spent on visiting the RTOs. Delhi has also become the first state to provide online learner’s licence through an AI-based facial recognition software for ensuring maximum security supported by an Aadhaar-based authentication system. After putting a lock on the New Delhi zone RTO, Kejriwal said there used to be a time when getting a driving licence meant intense discussion on whom to approach for reference or which agent to hire. “People would stand in lines and objections would be made in their application repeatedly. Eventually, they would get tired and get an agent to do it,” he added. “Today, what we are doing signifies the India of the 21st century. It is a massive step along the direction of technological revolution. Offices and files are now completely digitised. Even the 1076 agent won’t come to your doorstep for any papers. Now, you just have to login to your computer and get all your work done. All services of the transport department are now digital. There is no need to collect documents and stand in lines, no need to take a holiday from work and no need to hire a middleman or agent,” said the CM. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said, “Faceless means that now no applicant needs to come to the MLO or officer in any zonal office of the transport department. Whether you are at home, office or cyber cafe, you can do all the things that you used to by going to the office at your convenience.” Gahlot added that four RTOs — IP Depot, Vasant Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and Janakpuri — were closed on Wednesday, but helpdesks would be available to ensure a smooth transition. He said 3.5 lakh faceless service requests were received since February 19 and the success rate of approval so far was more than 80% and rejection rate less than 1%. Meanwhile, the transport department has partnered with ICICI Bank to provide automatic termination of hypothecation on full repayment of loan. At present, vehicle owners have to get a NOC from the bank to get their hypothecation terminated. More banks are expected to come on-board and provide the service soon. Nearly 32.6 lakh vehicles would benefit from this initiative. The transport department said it had developed a software through NIC for API-based integration of hypothecation data with the Centre’s Vahan software for issuance of automatic online NOC by banks. “We’re happy to partner with ICICI on this ambitious project. HP addition and termination are one of our most availed of services and its automation, under the leadership of CM Arvind Kejriwal, will set a benchmark in simplifying service delivery. I urge more banks to join hands with us,” Gahlot tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-rto-under-lock-and-key-is-good-news-for-you/articleshow/85255141.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Girl poisons food to kill family members in Prayagraj's Holagarh||PRAYAGRAJ: A minor girl has been accused of mixing weedicide (a chemical weedkiller) and offering poisonous food to her family members in Bhagautipur Khathana village under the limits of Holagarh police station last week. The food mixed with weedicide claimed the lives of three of her family members including the father, younger sister and elder brother last week. The police on Monday night detained the minor girl for quizzing. The startling revelations came to the fore during police investigations into the Holagarh food poisoning incident where cops found that a 15-year-old girl had mixed weedicides into food to ‘punish’ her brother and mother who used to rebuke and scold her over household chores. The mother of the accused girl had on Monday night lodged an FIR against her daughter under section 302 of the IPC with Holagarh police accusing her of killing her family members and six others for stealing household items when they were admitted to hospital. Deputy SP (Soraon) Amita Singh told TOI, "Investigations into the food poisoning incident where three family members died between August 4 and 8 revealed stunning facts and it has now come to the fore that a minor girl of the house had plotted the killing of family members." She had mixed pesticides into food on July 28 and as a result, five of the family members became seriously ill. The accused girl had not consumed the vegetable laced with weedicide and ate pickle and rice instead. The accused minor girl had forced her six-year-old sister to consume the vegetable laced with weedicide on the day, even though she was in no mood to consume the meal. Soon after the consumption of the vegetable laced with weedicide, all the four members of the family including the father, mother, elder brother and younger sister became ill and were admitted to separate hospitals for treatment. The police came to know about the incident only after the Pradhan of the village informed police about the suspected death of the father on August 4 and police launched investigations into the incident. Moreover, two more family members including the girl's brother Rachit (16) and sister Ankita (6) died on August 8 during the treatment. Police, meanwhile, became suspicious over the girl’s attitude and started probing the case thoroughly. Police said that the minor girl had taken the extreme step to plot the killing of her family members after being irked over her mother and brother’s routine rebuking and thrashing episode. After the death of three family members, only two members including the accused minor girl and her mother (Geeta) survived. The mother in her complaint lodged with Holagarh police claimed that her daughter had mixed weedicides with food (vegetable). Police have lodged a case under section 228 of the IPC against six other persons for stealing household items when the family members were admitted to separate hospitals for treatment. During interrogation, the minor girl admitted to having mixed weedicide with food (vegetable) as she wanted to 'punish' her brother and mother for scolding her. Two of the domestic goats also died after they too were served the vegetable laced with weedicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/girl-poisons-food-to-kill-family-members/articleshow/85225585.cms||Kapil Dixit

This can happen by adding value to their products by presenting them on a global platform by getting GI (geographical indication) tags for their produces. Chairperson of the consortium, Sashi Singh, who spearheaded the Intellectual Property Rights conference held on Tuesday in Dehradun, said that women of Uttarakhand have various high-end products, arts and culture forms that can get international recognition. “Women of hills are hard working and dedicated. We know the traditional clothes, painting, culture and food of this state are most sought-after but are not marketed properly. So, there is a need to give these products a global platform. There is a need to make these women understand the value and essence of geographical indication and trademark so that they get multiple advantages from their works,” said Sashi Singh. The conference was jointly conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTCO) and CWEI. USPTCO counsellor of South Asia region, John Cabeca, said that it is high time the Himalayan states conserve their legacy by acquiring GI tags before it is too late, as the world is proactively running towards getting everything registered and recognized. “People are becoming highly sensitive towards the GI tag lately, and here in the hills, we have observed that women are still comfortable with whatever they get. But they should be educated about their GI rights too," Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/need-to-push-ukhand-women-to-get-gi-tags-for-their-products/articleshow/85217836.cms||---

While granting relief to the politicians, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna questioned the UP government whether it was at all needed to keep them in custody when the probe had been completed and chargesheet filed in the case. The bench said trial proceedings would take a long time and it may not be reasonable to keep them in jail till completion of trial. The Khans had moved the SC after the Allahabad HC rejected the bail application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-gives-bail-to-azam-says-up-may-club-together-cases/articleshow/85228517.cms||---

The couple got married in 2017 and have a three-year-old daughter. They run individual clinics at Dhanori and Vishrantwadi.Senior inspector Ajay Chandkhede of the Vishrantwadi police said, “The relationship between the two doctors had turned sour over domestic issues. The couple’s daughter was sleeping when the incident occurred.”Citing the FIR, sub-inspector Shubhangi Magdum said, “The doctor and her daughter finished dinner around 11pm on Sunday. Her husband consumed liquor till late in the night and started a dispute with her around 1am on Monday. He abused and blamed her for his father’s death.”Magdum said, “When the doctor later told her husband that she had to visit Nashik for her sister’s marriage, he again started an argument and attacked her. When she resisted him, the homeopath picked up a knife and forcibly cut her hair. He also assaulted her on back and hands, causing serious injuries. He also told her that he would not allow her to attend the marriage ceremony.”The sub-inspector said, “The woman doctor dialled the city police control room and shared information related to the incident. A police patrol team went to the spot and admitted her to a private hospital. She visited the police station to lodge a complaint after the hospital discharged her.

The tremors, lasting a few seconds, occurred at 1:42pm and were felt in the adjoining districts as well. No casualties have been reported so far, according to the disaster management department. According to the NCS, the epicentre of the earthquake was near Dehradun at 30.63 degrees North latitude and 77.97 degree East longitude with a focal depth of 10km. It is to be noted that an earthquake of magnitude 4.3 had hit Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district on May 24 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mild-tremors-felt-in-dehradun-no-casualties/articleshow/85217845.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro work, rain pain for Majerhat bridge||KOLKATA: When the new-look Majerhat Bridge was thrown open to public last year, it brought a huge relief to those living in New Alipore, Behala and beyond as it provided an easy alternative to travel to the city centre. The two dedicated lanes in each flank were able to soak the pressure that otherwise was a major challenge on this bridge. But the Metro construction on the very important Joka-Esplanade corridor has slowed down the traffic speed significantly after the easing of Covid restrictions. This is especially true after the rains when there is an explosion of two-wheelers and four-wheelers and traffic jams find their tails going back to the Mint on one side and Mominpore on the other. To tackle the rush, the southwest traffic guard has hit upon an unique plan that has already started paying dividends. Police are now prioritizing vehicle movement. While vehicles headed to Mominpore get preference during morning rush hours, those headed to Behala get priority in the evening. “In simple words, we are stopping vehicles on the less chaotic non-office traffic flank at a particular point in between Mominpore and the Remount Road crossing-Burdwan Road crossing. We are then allowing morning office time vehicles headed to the city centre to use both the up and down flanks for a specific time. This helps us reduce the tail of the Mominpore-bound flank after which traffic on the other flank is restored,” explained an officer. A TOI team found the experiment being carried both on Monday and Tuesday. TOI found sergeants stopping Behala-bound traffic at Remount Road crossing and allowing vehicles from Behala to use both flanks on either side of the Metro construction area. Bus passengers TOI spoke to said that sometimes these blockades are taken at Mominpore itself. In those instances, both flanks of Majerhat Bridge are used to clear traffic rush and stop the tail from reaching the Taratala Bridge. Sources at Lalbazar said a lot of traffic study had gone into this preparation. “The Metro helped us a lot. We asked them to reduce the pavement size on the Ordnance Factory side and extend the road. They obliged. We wanted Metro to ensure the road opening towards Mominpore (once vehicles got off Majerhat Bridge) remained bigger than the width of the two flanks on the bridge. They gave us the measurements well in time and helped us. As a result, even if vehicles are slowing down, traffic is not getting stagnant,” said an officer. Police sources though said they dreaded three situations — the time right after the rain holds up, the resultant waterlogging near Bodyguard Lines after rain and the scheduled opening of the Bascule bridge. “All three situations lead to traffic accumulating at the crossing, upsetting all our calculations. The huge jump in two-wheelers in the city is another concern,” explained an officer. Lalbazar hinted that it planned to ask all vehicles from Mominpore and Ekbalpore to take the Alipore Road-Burdwan Road so that only one-way movement is allowed once the Metro construction reaches closer to Mominpore from Remount Road crossing. “As for now, we will continue with our fouls to control traffic,” chuckled an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-work-rain-pain-for-majerhat-bridge/articleshow/85220022.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

According to the police, the accused Sanjay Kumar Prajapati convinced his friend and complainant Praveen Kumar to invest Rs 51 lakh which he promised to return after a year with 25% profit. Later, the accused refused to return the money as the stone crusher work never started. Cops are now investigating the payment records of the victim. The accused told the victim that he ran a partnership firm with another friend and that he had been awarded the work by Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam, cops at Doiwala police station said. An FIR under IPC section 406 (criminal breach of trust) has been registered against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-dupes-friend-of-rs-51l-booked/articleshow/85217843.cms||---

Started by city-born Archana Pandey, the petition has gathered hundreds of comments and signatures within a month after Pandey shared her own personal experience while visiting a Lucknow-based slum. The petition assumes importance in the wake of over 30 kids falling sick in the slums at Ballu Adda after consuming dirty water. "It was while working in different slums of Lucknow I found out that most of them do not have access to safe drinking water. That’s when I came across this ordeal of ‘Blue Tea’. I was shocked since the water was fetched from a nearby handpump and it was consumed on daily basis. Later, I found the same situation at other slums,” said said Archana in the statement in the petition. The petition has been addressed to Mahendra Singh, minister of jal Shakti and Baldev Singh Aulakh, minister of state, jal shakti. Continuous appeals are also being made by young climate activists via social media to save the Gomti. With placards and pictures highlighting the polluted river and hashtag #istandforgomti, the activists appeal to the masses not to litter in the river and spread awareness to save the river. "Our holy river Gomti is ill and is being trampled under the pressure of pollution in the form of industrial, residential and plastic waste by us humans. It's time to realise our careless actions and walk the talk. We demand justice for the Gomti," shared Sarah (18), climate activist via her social media page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/6k-sign-petition-for-potable-water-in-slums/articleshow/85225699.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Nagpur||Teachers’ body happy as Std XI CET scrapped||Nagpur: The association representing junior college teachers is happy with court’s decision to scrap the proposed Std XI CET (Common Entrance Test) as they feel it was an ‘unnecessary’ hurdle which students were being made to cross. Vidarbha Junior College Teachers’ Association (VJUCTA) has been a vocal critic of the CET and sent multiple letters to school education minister Varsha Gaikwad about it. Recently, a delegation led by its general secretary Ashok Gavhankar met Nagpur’s deputy director of education Vaishali Jamdar and discussed the issue. Gavhankar said, “This has to be one of the best news this week. We have been always saying CET is not needed when you have around 25,000 seats going vacant just last year. It is illogical to hold a CET when every single student is guaranteed to get admission. So why add all this red-tapism when simply your Std X marks are enough.” While education officials do not say it on record, their idea was that CET will ‘moderate’ scores for other boards. “These boards are giving marks leniently and it will deprive our students of college seats,” said an education official, while trying to defend the need for CET. VJUCTA says the argument itself is faulty. “How come admission be deprived if we have over 20,000 seats vacant?” asked Gavhankar. “I have repeatedly seen these types of statements coming out and it’s false. Yes, for a very select few, it could be that the choice of course in a specific college might not be available, but everybody will get admission somewhere,” he said. He added that nowadays almost all science stream admissions are dictated by coaching institutes. “They spread their admissions over multiple colleges and many have in fact shifted to rural colleges. Of course, students do not attend physically. So, this entire hype of students losing out on admission is false,”said Gavhankar. Std XI admissions through CAP only Nagpur: The focus has shifted back to the Centralized Admission Process (CAP) for Std XI admissions in the city, after the Bombay high court ordered the state government to do away with the proposed CET. In Nagpur city, admissions for around 215 junior colleges will now happen through CAP with only Std X marks as the base. In the earlier proposed format, students who appeared for the optional CET would get preference in admissions in CAP. As per the CAP schedule, which was last updated on August 8, students would be able to start registering online from the coming Monday (August 16). This particular phase is called Part-1 because the student fills up personal details and SSC scores. After online submission, the Part-1 form is verified by authorities and only after that the student is eligible for Part-2, where college selection begins. For verification, SSC students’ forms are okayed by their respective principals while other board students have to approach designated guidance centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/teachers-body-happy-as-std-xi-cet-scrapped/articleshow/85219993.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Kolkata||Pond-filling zones become Kolkata’s chronic waterlogging spots||KOLKATA: When Mumbai went under water after a torrential downpour this July, many in Kolkata wondered if the city was headed the same way. After all, it had been flooded several times this monsoon. Just like creeks and marshlands had disappeared in Mumbai, so had ponds and waterbodies in Kolkata. The city has lost almost half the water bodies in the past three decades. While Kolkata had around 8,700 water bodies around the late 80s, there are only around 3,500 now. Ponds that were in abundance in parts of Behala till the mid-1990s have disappeared. The vanishing water bodies have led to waterlogging with the very areas that did not witness any inundation now submerged for days during the monsoon. According to Bimal Roychowdhury, a retired government officer and a resident of Sarsuna who had initiated against filling of ponds, the amount of pressure that an activist has to withstand in protecting ponds, it is getting increasingly difficult for him/her to continue with the movement. “Often we get exposed after lodging complaints with police or civic administration. In absence of a stringent action, land mafias threaten us with dire consequences. How many of us can still carry on with the save the pond movement amid such a threat and lack of action from the administration?” he wondered. Environmentalist Mohit Ray who did a research on the vanishing ponds said the actual number of water bodies in Kolkata was unclear but a detailed map book of the city containing 284 plates by the National Atlas & Thematic Mapping Organisation showed it to be 8,731 around 15-20 years ago. Google’s satellite imagery of Kolkata showed it was 4,889 in 2006. That number has further whittled down to around 3,500 now. Golf Garden is another locality that is plagued with waterlogging after ponds were filled up around two decades ago. A member of NGO Public was thrashed in Golf Garden for protesting against the filling up of a pond. Though he had filed an FIR, he withdrew it after two rival political parties held separate rallies in the neighbourhood denouncing him. According to Nirmal Ghosh, a resident of Golf Garden and an IT official, residents of the area on several occasions have lodged complaints of filling of a large number of ponds in Azadgarh, Golf Garden, Bijoygarh, Baghajatin and Jadavpur areas. “Despite pointing out the vulnerable ponds that a section of land sharks had targeted to local police stations or KMC offices, we couldn’t save these ponds from being filled up. The results have been obvious. Besides an increase in the air pollution level, we are also bearing the brunt of waterlogging woes,” Ghosh said. Areas along the EM Bypass, too, are witnessing waterlogging following the disappearance of sewage farms and agricultural land in the East Kolkata Wetlands. The change seen between the 2002 satellite map of EKW and the 2016 map was "dramatic" and clearly demonstrated the massive extent of encroachment and conversion, which threatened the very existence of the Ramsar site. Some of the 37 moujas have witnessed encroachment on such a massive scale that barely look like wetlands now. Different shades of grey and brown dominate Pashchim Chowbhaga, Nonadanga, Chowbhaga, Jagatipota, Mukundapur, Atghara, Kulberia, Beonta, Thakdari, Dhapa Manpur and Garai, indicating rampant construction after filling up and conversion of sewage-fed fish farms. A KMC environment department official conceded that ponds in 44 KMC wards in areas that were added later have disappeared with alarming regularity despite the civic body’s attempts to protect them. “It is a matter of regret that we have failed to protect ponds in added areas like Garden Reach, Behala, Tollygunge Jadavpur and large areas located off EM Bypass,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pond-filling-zones-become-citys-chronic-waterlogging-spots/articleshow/85220092.cms||Saikat Ray

Replying to a submission by opposition leader V D Satheesan demanding redesigning the ongoing Punargeham project to relocate such families from the coastline, the minister said that according to a survey, there are 11,685 families within 50m of shoreline. Of them, 3,367 families are residing within 10m, 3,921 within 10-20m, 4,577 within 20-30m and 6,820 within 30-50m. He said that of these families, 7,192 have agreed to relocate under the scheme. He said that the project aims at providing Rs 10 lakh for such families, of which Rs 6 lakh will be for purchasing land (two cents if in municipal or corporation limits and three cents if in rural areas) and the rest is for construction of a house. As much as Rs 2,450 crore has been earmarked for the project, of which Rs 1,398 crore is from the chief minister’s distress relief fund, while Rs 1,052 crore is from the budget of the fisheries department. He said that land has been located for 2,275 families while 1,630 families have got their land registered and 428 houses have been completed. Meanwhile, the opposition leader said that the figures being cited by the minister were not true to the facts. He said that the project needs a complete overhauling as the conditions laid out in the scheme are completely impractical. He said that the condition that they have to surrender their existing land and house to get relocated is unjustified. “Why would someone who has, for example, 15 cents and a house surrender it to the government to get three cents of land, that too which they may not be able to purchase with the money offered by the government?” he asked. Also, he slammed another clause that they should complete the construction work of the new house within 12 months, failing which they will have to repay an interest of 18%. “Even the government will not be able to construct it within this period and they are asked to pay this huge interest. Is the government playing the role of a private moneylender?” Satheesan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/11685-families-reside-within-50m-of-shoreline/articleshow/85222734.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Supreme Court confirms Rs 100 crore arbitration award against Nagpur businessman Arun Upadhyaya||NAGPUR: The Supreme Court on Tuesday confirmed a $12.5 million arbitration award, roughly Rs100 crore, passed by an arbitrator in the USA against city businessman Arun Upadhyaya and his firm Gemini Bay Transcription Limited. The ruling confirmed his liability to pay the amount to a Hong Kong-based company. The Sole Arbitrator, International Arbitration Tribunal, Kansas, Missouri (US), upheld a roughly $8 million award in an arbitral dispute against Upadhyaya and his firm on March 28, 2010, in relation to their medical transcription (MT) business. Hong Kong-based Integrated Sales Services (ISS) Limited, through counsel Deven Chauhan, had filed a case in the district and sessions court here, under the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, for execution of US tribunal’s orders in April 2010. Its application was allowed by former principal district judge KK Sonawane on September 4, 2010, which was reported in detail by TOI. When the order was challenged in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, the single-judge bench ruled in Upadhyaya’s favour, ruling that he was a non-signatory to the original agreement. However, this was overturned by the HC division bench of former Chief Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and justice Atul Chandurkar, holding that even non-signatories could be made accountable. Upadhyaya and his firm Gemini Bay Transcription then challenged the verdict in the apex court through senior counsel Harish Salve, KV Vishwanathan and others in appeal. ISS appeared through senior counsel Arif Bookwala, Chauhan and others. “There can be no doubt whatsoever that because of the machinations of Upadhyaya and others, as found by the US tribunal, ISS was deprived of commission legitimately due to it under the representation agreement. This being so, there can be no doubt that, on facts as proved before the arbitral tribunal, actual loss can be said to have been occasioned to ISS,” the SC division bench comprising justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Bhushan Gavai held. While dismissing Upadhayay and his firm’s appeals, the top court clarified that in any case, the damages so awarded in the facts of this case cannot even remotely be said to “shock its conscience” to clutch at “the basic notion of justice” ground. While quoting the US Federal Court ruling, ISS in its original case in city-based court had contended that Upadhyaya and his four companies — DMC Management and Gemini Bay Transcription, both based in Nagpur, Gemini Bay Consulting in the British Virgin Islands, and DMC Global in Mauritius — had wrongfully breached their representation contract with them. Besides Upadhyaya, the applicant also accused managing director Rattan Pathak of creating Gemini Bay Corporation to get out of the deal that has been in place since 2000. ISS used to earn between 10-20% of sales from prospective customers it secured for DMC’s medical transcription business. The ISS pointed out that India is signatory to the ‘United Nations Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (UNCITRAL)’, which commits courts of contracting states to recognize and enforce arbitration awards made in foreign jurisdictions of member states. Moreover, Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act recognized this convention, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sc-confirms-rs100-cr-arbitration-award-against-city-bizman-upadhyaya/articleshow/85222487.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Canada’s air travel exemption brings little relief to students||MUMBAI: Though Canada has granted an exemption to fully vaccinated passengers who no longer have to undergo a three-night hotel stay in a stopover country, the change was of little solace to travellers, especially students, from India. The Canadian government hasn’t yet done away with the requirement under which passengers from India have to undergo an RT-PCR test in a third country, await a negative report before they can board the onward flight to Canada. All this meant that students spend close to Rs 2 lakh on airfare and hotel accomodation. To add to it, on Tuesday, Canada said it will extend the ban on flights from India till September 21. The ban was imposed on April 22. India alone contributes 34.5% of Canada’s total international students. According to official statistics from the Canadian High Commission in Delhi, for the first two quarters of 2021, nearly 45,840 study permits were issued to international students. The number for 2020 stood at 81,005. Maria Mathais, a counsellor who works with Canadian universities, said most students are entering Canada via Mexico. “But getting a ticket with just one stopover is very difficult. Students are paying three to four times the normal fare,” she said. Despite all this, anxiety among students is a lot less as varsities have clarified that they can take online classes and join the campus as and when they can travel. Travel companies have ada-pted to the changes. Akbar Travels, for instance, booked Span-ish airline Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas to operate two A340 charter flights next week from Delhi to Mexico City. “The seats are sold out. At Mexico City, students will undergo a 3-night hotel stay and RT-PCR test before they fly to Toronto. The entire package is priced at about Rs 2 lakh,” said Bhushan Kamble, regional sales head, Akbar Travels. Another travel agent said: “Fully vaccinated passengers don’t need to go for packages that include a three-day hotel stay. But the big question is how can they book stopover flights without knowing how long it would take for the transit destination to issue the test report.” Another hurdle is that passengers from India cannot currently stay over in Dubai to undergo the test and flights to London are expensive. On Tuesday, the cheapest one-way ticket on the Delhi-Toronto route for travel on August 12 began at Rs 1.51 lakh (offered by United Airlines). But it was not a viable option as the transit time was a mere two hours, not enough to undergo a test and get a report. Early birds too have no relief. Jasmeet Kaur, due to join the University of Guelph, was to fly out on Wednesday, but the flight, booked two months ago for over a lakh, was cancelled. “My classes start in September. But neither do I have a refund from the airline, nor do I have any information on the flight,” said Kaur. Meanwhile, on behalf of students, the Indo Canada Education Council has petitioned against the “unjust” travel restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-canadas-air-travel-exemption-brings-little-relief-to-students/articleshow/85227455.cms||Manju V

A division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj took serious note of the petition and directed the KMC authorities to submit city maps for the last three decades before the bench took up the matter for hearing on September 7.  The bench also wanted to know from the civic body how many water bodies were there in the city.  KMC was directed to file a comprehensive affidavit in reply by September 7 to ascertain how many illegal constructions have been there in the city in the last three decades. The Ward 108 resident stated in her petition that local developers had been filling up water bodies illegally in the ward with the help of some “influential people”.  The petitioner sought the court’s intervention to prevent the filling-up work and restore the water bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-asks-for-3-decades-of-city-maps/articleshow/85220060.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

It is a part of mayor Dayashankar Tiwari’s initiative of developing 75 Vande Mataram PHCs in the city. In a memorandum to Tiwari, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and assistant municipal commissioner Prakash Warade, the residents said, “The local population is extremely dense and parking of four-wheelers in front of houses makes the already narrowed-down 15ft-wide street very congested. Opening the NMC PHC at the 500 sqft Dhoble auditorium will create more trouble for us.” To oppose the move, residents also organized a signature campaign in which over 200 of them submitted their objection to the move. The residents also expressed discontent against NMC for not taking them into confidence while taking such a decision. In the memorandum, it was proposed to shift this health centre to NMC-owned, closed Marathi Kanya Shala on a large plot with ample parking facility in front of Lendra Park. One room of the closed NMC school has been occupied by a Nagrik Mandal and one by a physiotherapy clinic, while the remaining huge portion of the building on the premises is vacant. Activist Akshay Samarth, who led the agitated residents’ delegation, demanded that the closed school should be utilized for the PHC. In future, NMC could convert it into a big hospital too, he pointed out. According to residents, the community centre is already in huge demand for organizing small get-togethers like birthday parties, haldi-kumkum events etc. The residents also pointed out that another NMC-run school Mor Hindi Medium School is also a good option for the PHC. Additional commissioner Ram Joshi assured to look into the matter. Ramprasad Chowdhari, Mulchand Baisware, Sohan Kakde, Ravindra Bhave, Pramod Narad, Dyaneshwar Bhave, Rajat Navare and Aditya Puranik, among other residents were part of the delegation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ramdaspeth-residents-oppose-vande-mataram-phc/articleshow/85220115.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Lucknow||Covid-19: Over 5 lakh fully immunised, more mega camps soon in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Nearly 8,000 more people completed their two-dose vaccine course against Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking the number of fully immunised populace to over 5 lakh. Overall, 24,236 people, including 10,116 women, were jabbed at 83 government and 27 private vaccination booths. While 33% (7,978) people took the second dose, 67% (16,258) received their first shot. However, the number of inoculations was less than Monday’s 29,129. Overall, 63.9% of the total beneficiaries were in 18-45 years age group, 22.7% went to those in the 45-59 years category and 10.3% to elderly. The rest of the beneficiaries were healthcare and frontline workers. When asked about the reason for the dip in vaccinations on Tuesday, district immunization officer Dr MK Singh said it all depends on the supply of the vaccine and the daily target fixed by the state government. “The target for Tuesday was 23,000 vaccinations,” he added. “As of now, Lucknow is number one in terms of total doses administered due to the proactive approach adopted by the administration. We will soon organise more mega vaccination camps to speed up inoculations in the rural areas,” he said. Total 21.8 lakh doses have been administered in the Lucknow district so far in six months since the start of the campaign. The beneficiaries include over 11.5 lakh people who have taken the first dose and 5.1 lakh who have received both the doses. Lucknow’s adult population is around 36 lakh. Meanwhile, only one Covid-19 case was recorded in the city for the third consecutive day, while three patients recovered, bringing down the active cases to 59. The transmission level now is among the lowest since the outbreak of the pandemic in Lucknow in March last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/over-5-lakh-fully-immunised-more-mega-camps-soon/articleshow/85225824.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: All district courts set to fast-track long-pending cases||KOLKATA: Courts in all Bengal districts, including Kolkata, will attempt to dispose of all cases filed since 2014 by the end of this year. According to the National Judicial Data Grid, Bengal has a case pendency of around 25 lakh, which is around 6.3% of the 3.9 crore pending cases across India. Eight districts — Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia, Murshidabad and West Midnapore – that have the highest case pendency in the state will take a lead in this effort, says an action plan released by Calcutta high court. Impacted by the digital divide in a Covid year, courts across Bengal have been unable to function normally. However, case pendencies have not galloped due to the lesser cases filed owing to restricted mobility and lack of access to online modes. The eight districts with the highest case pendency (the highest being in Kolkata with 6 lakh pending cases) will also target to clear cases related to child abuse and crime against women that are two-year old. Moreover, it will try to dispose of corruption cases and drug offences that are three-year old. Also, the judges have been asked to take up cases urgently in which undertrials have spent two years or more in custody. A similar case disposal roster has been set for districts with less case pendencies. The district courts, after identifying the cases under the action plan, will put them up on their websites, mentioning the stage of hearing. This will be updated by the 10th of every month. Only the chief judge or the district and sessions judge can change or prioritise cases from the list. Addressing the issue of vacancies in some courts due to transfers, leave or resignations, the case backlog in that court must be distributed equally among other judges, the plan proposes. The action plan also proposes a reasonable time-frame for the parties to be heard before the cases are closed. The high court will also have to be updated on the case disposal rates every month. How a judicial officer disposes the cases will also feature in their annual confidential report. The plan says cases in which interim orders have been passed need to be disposed of within a month and bail applications are to be heard within a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/all-district-courts-set-to-fast-track-long-pending-cases/articleshow/85220125.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

But this year’s growth rate is less than the country’s overall growth rate of 32% in July this year against the same period last year. According to data on GST collection from the Union government, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh reported a 28% increase, higher than Telangana in July this year. Tamil Nadu had the highest growth rate among southern states in GST collection, with a 36% increase in July this year. While Kerala’s GST collection growth stood at 27% in July 2021, Karnataka had the lowest growth at 12% in the same period. During the second Covid-19 pandemic, the Telangana government’s goods and services tax (GST) collection has improved with a 17 percent increase this March when compared to March 2020. According to the Union government’s GST collection figures, the state government collected Rs 3,562 crore in March 2020 and it has gone up to Rs 4,166 crore in March this year. Except a few months, GST collection in Telangana has been steadily increasing since July last year. The state had a negative growth rate in November 2020, with a 5 % decrease in GST collection compared to November 2019. GST collection figures for October 2020 and 2019 were Rs 3,175 crore and Rs 3,349 crore respectively. “If the Covid-19 scenario remains steady, we expect a significant rise in GST collection in the next months,” a top official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-gst-collection-rose-26-in-july-lower-than-national-rate/articleshow/85222748.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: DVAC unravels elaborate web of collusion and misconduct in SP Velumani case||CHENNAI: In the 19-page FIR filed by DVAC’s Special Investigation Cell (SIC) on Monday against former Local Administration minister SP Velumani and persons and companies linked to him, the agency has laid thread bare various facets of tender fixing in Greater Chennai Corporation and Coimbatore Corporation. Tenders worth Rs 464.02 crore of Greater Chennai Corporation were won by companies linked to Velumani, while in Coimbatore Corporation, the value of the tenders was Rs 346.81 crore. This was seen with regard to bus route roads, storm water drain and outsourcing of staff for health department, DVAC said. Besides violations in tender transparency and vigilance rules, the FIR also details blatant misconduct. For instance, the DVAC said, R Chandrasekar, a close associate of Velumani, used to sit in the minister's official residence in RA Puram in Chennai and decide which tender would go to which company. Chandrasekar was the AIADMK's Coimbatore rural district youth wing secretary and a managing director in KCP Engineers Pvt Ltd, one of the companies accused. All these firms reported huge financial growth co-terminus with Velumnai’s role as minister. For instance, from 2012-13 to 2018-19, turnover of Vardhan infrastructure grew by 3,202 per cent, while that of CR constructions by 11,363 per cent. KCP grew by 967 per cent, while Aalayam grew by 2,636 per cent. Violations were found at the stage of tender bidding, negotiation and execution of work, DVAC said. At tender bidding stage, companies colluded and submitted online bids using the same standard internet protocol (IP-IV) on the same date and one after the other, which implies that all persons operated from the same computer. Velumani’s brother’s company Senthil and Co and Rajan Rathinasamy, a contractor, bid for 47 tenders between 2014 and 2017. Both were registered under the same mobile number and bids were submitted from the same IP. Similarly, in 131 tenders from January to October 2015, SP Builders was the only competition to KCP Engineers, Vardhan Infra, Constronics, Senthil and Co or J Robert Raja. Only one tender was won by SP builders, with the DVAC stating that it was a shell bidder. The agency also relied on reports of the CAG, which identified a scam in relaying of bitumen roads which benefited the contractor at the cost of GCC. The DVAC said that colluding firms bid abnormally high or abnormally low prices for some components in bus route road tenders of the GCC, which resulted in gain for KCP Engineers and loss to the state’s exchequer. In another tender, for hiring 302 nurses to GCC’s urban primary health centres, Vardhan Infrastructure was favoured despite being ineligible, the DVAC said. GCC pushed the tendering date to January 2018 from December 2017 to ensure the contractor became eligible, violated other eligibility criteria and awarded it to them, the agency said. The DVAC has also provided evidence for links between Velumani’s family and K Chandraprakash, managing director of KCP engineers, which is traced to a land deal from 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dvac-unravels-elaborate-web-of-collusion-and-misconduct-in-sp-velumani-case/articleshow/85222746.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar
---||Chandigarh||Staff, infrastructure crunch mar Panchkula’s attempt to stave off third Covid wave||PANCHKULA: Even though Panchkula health department’s efforts to stave off a possible third Covid wave are better than other districts of Haryana, it is facing challenges like staff and infrastructure shortage. Almost 50% of sanctioned posts of doctors in the district are lying vacant. The health department of Panchkula did not disclose the exact number of sanctioned posts but 224 doctors, including 29 contractual and consultant doctors, are working in the district at present. According to WHO guidelines, one doctor is required per 1,000 population. The population of Panchkula, according to the 2011 Census is 5.61 lakh, which means that 561 doctors are required. Over the last 10 years, the population has reached almost eight lakh, which necessitates an update in the number of sanctioned posts in line with WHO guidelines. A senior health officials said hiring doctors is not in their hands as it was up to the health department, Haryana. They said they had sent the proposal of requirement of doctors as per requirement time and again. Officials also said that they have 584 nurses, ASHA and ANM workers, besides, AYUSH department officials worked together with the health department during the Covid pandemic, giving additional manpower to the health department. During the peak of Covid, Panchkula district received maximum of 720 Covid patients in a day (largest number in the history of the district) but officials claimed that they took care of all patients with the existing staff without any problem. The health department took help of MBBS and nursing students to assist doctors during peak Covid time after giving them basic training required. On the infrastructure needed to tackle the third Covid wave, chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Mukta Kumar said that one oxygen plant of 300 LPM (litre per minute) capacity had been set up at the civil hospital in Sector 6 and ICU beds had been given direct oxygen connection. One Oxygen plant of 1,000 LPM from HSIIDC has been approved and work on this will start soon. Oxygen plants in sub-civil hospital, Kalka and Raipur CHC (Community Health Centre) are under installation. The district has 45 ventilators, including 205 oxygen concentrators at the 300-bedded civil hospital. Besides, there are 30 to 50 beds in each of the other health centres. The district has one sub-civil hospital in Kalka, one community health centre (CHCs), nine primary health centres (PHCs) and seven urban dispensaries to cater to patients. Private hospitals have also been asked and trained to cater to Covid patients during times of need. Health department officials are giving training of ICU, anesthesia and paediatrics to each doctor in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/staff-infra-shortage-mar-pkl-health-depts-efforts-to-stem-pandemic/articleshow/85220108.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: All eyes on TRS’ troubleshooter T Harish Rao in Huzurabad bypoll||HYDERABAD: Finance minister T Harish Rao who has been heading the campaign in Huzurabad Assembly constituency, will not be contesting, but winning the bypoll is being considered as crucial for him in the TRS. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has pitted his finance minister and nephew Harish Rao against a formidable candidate in BJP’s Eatala Rajender. Eatala, a four-term MLA from Huzurabad, was ousted from the KCR-led state cabinet on allegations of grabbing assigned lands of Dalits. Eatala joined BJP and has been campaigning in the constituency. Having lost the Dubbak by-election after being given a free hand by the party leadership to spearhead the campaign, Harish Rao—known as the troubleshooter in TRS circles—is faced with the challenge of ensuring the defeat of his old friend Eatala Rajender. The talk in political circles is that if Harish succeeds, then Eatala would be weakened politically. If Eatala wins, Harish would not only be blamed for the defeat of the ruling party, but even his troubleshooter’s image would be at stake. Eatala too has gone to the extent of stating that sooner or later even Harish Rao would meet the same fate as him (Eatala). On his part, Harish Rao has reiterated his loyalty to KCR, terming him as his guru and a father-like figure, and said that he would continue in TRS. While TRS leaders are not sure whether TRS working president KT Rama Rao will hit the hustings in Huzurabad, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s direct entry into the constituency with a public meeting on August 16 is all set to further heat up the political turf in the poll-bound constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/all-eyes-on-trs-troubleshooter-harish-rao-in-huzurabad-bypoll/articleshow/85222730.cms||Roushan Ali

Reason: illegal use of booster (Tullu) water pumps in the city. Earlier, people used Tullu pumps only during summers to draw more drinking water from the pipelines. But now people illegally use such pumps almost throughout the year. Following complaints of low pressure water supply, the flying squad of NMC’s water works department along with Orange City Water visited Pacham Galli, Bangre plot and adjacent areas. The team seized 4 pumps and issued notices to 8 consumers. Now, NMC-OCW has decided to initiate legal action as well as disconnection of tap connection, especially against those who are illegally using booster pumps. Special zonal teams have also been constituted to conduct raids, seize the pump and initiate legal action and disconnection process in this regard. The NMC has also appealed to citizens to inform OCW’s 24x7 Toll Free Helpline at 1800-266-9899 or similar information can be passed on to zonal managers/NMC delegates at NMC-OCW Zonal offices if they find use of booster pumps in their locality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-seizes-4-booster-water-pumps/articleshow/85220169.cms||---

She criticised chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for not filling up the vacant jobs. “Unemployment in the state has risen in the last seven years. The unemployed youth should fight for jobs’ notification and not die by suicide,” she said. She said her party will support 7,000 field assistants of MGNREGS who had been dismissed from service. “Some of them are contesting the Huzurbad by-election. We will support them.

---||Kozhikode||Kannur: Cops, MVD intensify action on vloggers||KOZHIKODE: Police and motor vehicles department intensified action against ‘E Bull Jet’ vlogger brothers, who were arrested on Monday for allegedly creating a ruckus at Kannur RTO office and destroying public property there, even as Kannur JFCM court granted them bail on Tuesday. MVD served Ebin and Libin Varghese a notice under Section 53 of the MVD Act to suspend the registration of their van for allegedly violating road safety rules and putting other motorists at risk by making illegal modifications. Kannur police launched a preliminary probe into their old videos after they came across a video which showed them speeding, purportedly in Bihar, blaring an ambulance siren. Kannur police chief R Ilango said police are monitoring the provocative social media comments of the fans including the ones which gave calls for rioting. He said that already cases were registered against 17 supporters for gathering before the RTO office in Kannur in violation of Covid guidelines and making provocative comments on social media. Ilango said two similar cases were registered in Kollam and Alappuzha in connection with alleged comments on social media under charges of making provocations for rioting. “We are seeing many teenagers making emotionally-charged comments on social media against the arrest and saying they would attack the police station. We are monitoring the comments and if minors are found violating the law by making such comments, then we will submit a social background report. Also such violations can invite action under JJ Act,” he said. Ilango said that all previous videos uploaded by the vloggers will be scrutinized to see if there are law violations or calls for law violations. “We have to verify the exact location of the video in which they are trying to impersonate an ambulance by using a siren and then we will take it up with authorities concerned,” he said, adding that steps were taken to prevent past videos from being deleted to safeguard evidence. The brothers were released from Kannur sub-jail on bail in the evening on furnishing a surety of Rs 25,000 each and payment of Rs 3,500 each towards the damage to public property during the ruckus at the RTO office. The court asked the duo to appear before the investigating officer every Wednesday. Police had arrested them on Monday under charges of obstructing official duty of RTO and destroying public property after they were asked to pay a fine of Rs 42,000 for making illegal modifications in their van. They refused to pay the fine and went live on social media from the office on Monday alleging that false charges were being foisted on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cops-mvd-intensify-action-on-vloggers/articleshow/85222900.cms||---

The Malad police have registered an FIR and are looking for the fraudster. The complainant told the police that an unknown woman sent him a message on Facebook Messenger, telling him that if he became an agent with the e-commerce portal, he could earn 10% commission for every order he processed. Later, he received a link on WhatsApp, asking him to provide personal details and become an agent. On doing so, the fraudster offered him an order to process for which he gave commission, thereby gaining the victim’s trust. Late July 14, the complainant received several messages asking him to send money to various UPI accounts if he wanted to access VIP benefits. He ended up parting with Rs 88,000. When he realised he had been duped, he stopped paying and approached the Malad police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-scammer-dupes-victim-into-paying-rs-88k-online/articleshow/85227469.cms||---

The commission has given a week’s time to the secretary of the state’s social welfare department to give full details on the total number of rehab centres operational in Uttarakhand (both private and government), the rules and regulations regarding the opening of these centres, the guidelines according to which these centres are run, details of permissions granted and details of those who oversee the centres. The directions of the UHRC, signed by member RS Meena, a copy of which is with TOI, reads, “Which department conducts the inspection of these rehabilitation centres? When were these rehabilitation centres last inspected? If any were found flouting norms, what actions had been initiated against them?” Also, Dehradun district magistrate Rajesh Kumar, SSP Yogender Singh Rawat and social welfare officer Hemlata Pandey have been given four weeks to present a report to the Commission of what action they have taken against illegal activities at rehab centres and those responsible. Meanwhile, the medical tests of the inmates of the private rehab centre were done on Tuesday. The results are not ready yet, according to hospital authorities. According to allegations of the survivors, inmates at the rehab were given drugs in return for sexual favours to the manager, Vidyadutt Raturi, who was arrested on Monday for rape and assault. Those refusing the advances were beaten up with sticks and made to sit on sharp-edged stools and bricks for hours as “punishment”. After the crime came to light, police started investigating other de-addiction centres where Raturi and the director, Vibha Singh, earlier worked at, to see if they were fronts for similar set-ups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-human-rights-commission-orders-probe-into-all-rehab-centres-in-the-state-both-govt-pvt/articleshow/85217853.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: STM awaits medical council green light to start course in infectious diseases||KOLKATA: If all goes well and the National Medical Council (NMC), formerly MCI (Medical Council of India), gives the green signal, Bengal will soon be churning out infectious diseases (ID) specialists. School of Tropical Medicine (STM) would then be rubbing shoulders with elite institutes like AIIMS-New Delhi and CMC-Vellore to train ID specialists in the country. An NMC team had physically visited STM Kolkata in July to inspect the infrastructure and manpower for starting a DM course in ID. “Earlier, the state government had created the ID department, paving the way for us to apply for running a DM course in infectious diseases. The NMC team has visited our institute and we are keeping fingers crossed so that we get the green signal,” said STM director Subhashish Kamal Guha. The dearth for ID specialists have never been felt so much till the Covid-19 came lashing in. Even as STM had applied to the state government around January last year for creating the ID department, the nod from the government was not coming forward initially. But during the thick of the pandemic, CM Mamata Banerjee in July last year announced the government’s approval and allowed STM to set up a separate department that would deal with infectious diseases. The institute later applied to the NMC to start the three year post-doctoral programme on ID. “We are hopeful of getting the NMC approval. In such a case, we should be able to start running the course from the next academic session,” said assistant professor Yogiraj Ray, one of the handful trained ID specialists in the state. Even as Ray is attached with STM, the state government had roped him in Beliaghata ID hospital last year when the state’s nodal Covid-19 hospital was the only health facility treating infected patients. The scarcity of ID specialists, however, is not particular to Bengal along. The shortage was felt across the country during the pandemic. Only two institutes in the country — AIIMS New Delhi and Christian Medical College (CMC) Bangalore — were running DM courses in infectious diseases. Apart from STM, a couple of institutes from other states, too, have applied to start the same course. West Bengal currently has only three/four ID specialists, including Ray, Ayan Basu and Sayantan Banerjee – all trained at AIIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stm-awaits-medical-council-green-light-to-start-course-in-infectious-diseases/articleshow/85220149.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The government's response came after justice Rekha Palli asked it to reply to an affidavit filed by Twitter confirming these appointments. The high court is hearing a petition alleging non-compliance with IT Rules by the microblogging site. Appearing for the Centre, additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma submitted the government would "file a short affidavit" in respect of the compliance. The high court then granted the Centre two weeks to file the affidavit and posted the matter for October, saying now "there is no urgency in this". Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, re-iterated that the company has appointed permanent officials for the posts of CCO, RGO and NCP. He assured the court that these appointees work on a full-time basis and are fully capable of performing their functions in terms of the law.

Most of them had been inoculated,” said the public health expert. The UT health department has also been asking the union ministry of health and family welfare to correct the discrepancy in the number of total beneficiaries in the city. “We have sounded the Union health secretary on this recently. The same shall be pursued as we are inching near the 100% coverage,” claimed UT director, health services Dr Amandeep Kang. Though the vaccination drive has been massively covering the entire population in the city, public health workers feel the safeguard has been the natural exposure to the virus. “Children have not been jabbed and yet we have seen more than 65% have attained antibodies against the virus. This shows that despite not being vaccinated, natural antibodies have been a safeguard,” said the public health worker. With vaccination and exposure to the virus, most city residents have developed antibodies against the virus. Weekly positivity rate in the city has been recorded at 0.21% while tests per million per day stand at 1,170, which is more than the national average of 1102.7. According to Dr Rijo John, adjunct professor, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kochi, the weekly average daily growth of cases in the city is 0.01% while the national average is 0.12%.

Of these patients, 16 are children aged 12 and below. Residents of the area, majorly children, suffered from acute diarrhoea and gastroenteritis due to the intake of dirty water on Sunday. At present, 31 patients are being treated at the hospital. Residents had told a team from the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office that several complaints had been made to the district water department, but to no respite. On Tuesday, residents also complained to mayor Sanyukta Bhatia that the water and sewage pipeline had broken due to the work by the municipal corporation contractor causing mixing up of drinking and sewage water. “All the patients are responding to treatment and recovering well. They are most probably affected by dirty water. Since these people are not all from one family, consumption of a particular food can be termed as culprit of the infection,” said civil hospital director Dr Subhash Sundriyal. CMO Dr Manoj Agarwal said regular check for chlorine in the water was being done in the area. “We were conducting our regular sample testing of water for chlorine. All these samples from the area have enough chlorine presence in our tests. We will do the testing more vigorously now, on a weekly basis. The major sample testing for water is a task of the water department,” he said. 500 houses to get chlorine tablets:District magistrate Abhishek Prakash directed Jal Sansthan to distribute chlorine tablets in 500 houses in Balu Adda area for purifying water before use. The DM also directed Jal Sansthan to conduct a technical audit of the sewage system and water pipelines in the area to find out possibility of mixup of water with sewage due to leakages.

A total of 16 individuals and business firms have been named as co-accused in the FIR for offences and irregularities committed in awarding contracts between 2014 and 2018. While tenders worth Rs 464 crore were won by the accused in Chennai Corporation, contracts worth Rs 346.8 crore were bagged by them in Coimbatore Corporation. The DVAC said that while floating and awarding these tenders, authorities violated the Tamil Nadu Transparency Act, Transparency in Tenders Rules, guidelines of Central Vigilance Commission and engineering manual of Tamil Nadu. Violations were also found at the stage of bidding, negotiation and execution of work, the DVAC said. While Velumani stayed put at the MLAs hostel all day through the raid, his associate Chandraprakash got admitted to a hospital in Coimbatore for ‘chest pain.’ Chief minster Stalin seems to be keeping his poll promise of cracking down on alleged corruption by former ministers as the raid against SP Velumani comes three week after searches were carried out against former transport minister M R Vijayabaskar in graft cases. According to DVAC, competing companies had submitted their online bids for tenders in multiple projects from the same IP address on the same date and time for contracts in civic bodies. Among the accused are Velumani’s brother P Anabarasan, his close associate R Chandrasekar, a youth wing secretary of AIADMK, and companies like KCP Engineers (see graphics for detailed list). The FIR details the modus operandi of how a cartel was formed by these companies to bag tenders floated by local bodies. No former or serving bureaucrat has been named in the FIR, though some of their premises were raided too. The searches were carried out at Velumani’s elder brother SP Anbarasan’s residence in RA Puram, Chennai and Kovaipudur in Coimbatore, his younger brother Senthilkumar’s house at OM Sakthi Nagar at Kovaipudur, his close associate Chandrasekar’s house at PN Pudur, premises of KCP Engineers Private Limited at Peelamedu, Meena Estate and at Velumani’s relatives’ residence at Madukkarai, Pollachi, Vadavalli, Anaimalai and Thondamuthur areas. DVAC conducted marathon 13-hour searches at MLAs hostel in Chennai, farmhouses linked to Velumani, former and current officials of Greater Chennai Corporation like former principal chief engineer M Pugazhendi, current chief engineer L Nandakumar and former officials of Coimbatore Corporation Mathuranthangi, Gandhimathi, Lakshmanan, Saravanakumar and Ravi. Searches ended late on Tuesday evening. An official statement by DVAC said Rs 13.08 lakh in cash, documents related to land registrations, transaction documents of business firms, fixed deposits of Rs 2 crore, official records of corporation, electronic hard discs and other incriminating documents were seized. The raid-hours saw a sizeable number of AIADMK cadres turning up and shouting slogans against the state government. AIADMK party functionaries provided the cadres morning tiffin of idli, upma, tea and biscuits. During the afternoon, the cadres were given vegetable briyani, tomato rice and rose milk. Tea and snacks were distributed in the evening. Velumani’s close associate and KCP engineering firm’s managing director K Chandraprakash complained of chest pain and was admitted to a private hospital on Avinashi road in Coimbatore for treatment. When Velumani’s associate Chandrasekar was taken to another place from his residence by DVAC sleuths, the party cadres thought that he had been arrested and started raising slogans. Later, he was dropped back at his house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dvac-raids-ex-min-velumani-in-rs-811-crore-tender-fraud-case/articleshow/85222790.cms||A Subburaj

There are over 2.20 lakh voters in the constituency. After the BC communities, Dalits are the next big influenctial block with 50,000 voters in the poll-bound constituency. The ruling TRS, which has already started implementing Dalita Bandhu scheme for the welfare of Scheduled Castes (SCs), is now focussing on winning the hearts of BC community. Eatala Rajender is a Mudiraj and the ticket aspirants in the ruling party are of the opinion that KCR might opt for a candidate from the BC community to take on a formidable BC candidate like Eatala in Huzurabad. However, they did not rule out the possibility of KCR pulling out a surprise in the last minute as he did it by announcing the name of S Vani Devi for the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar graduates MLC seat. With over 22,000 votes from the Reddy community, E Peddi Reddy, who quit BJP recently and joined TRS, is also a strong contender to get a ticket unless KCR decides to send him to the legislative council. A senior TRS leader said that KCR might announce the party candidate on the occasion of launching Dalita Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad constituency on August 16. The CM would also address a public meeting in the constituency on that day. P Kaushik Reddy, who recently quit Congress and joined TRS, had secured over 61,000 votes in the 2018 assembly elections in Huzurabad constituency as a Congress nominee||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bcs-dalits-may-tilt-scales-in-huzurabad-bypoll/articleshow/85222800.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Goa||Four bullfighting events in three days at Goa's Cansaulim||PANAJI/COLVA: In an alarming situation, a total of four cases of bullfights, locally known as ‘dhirio’, were reported in three days at Cansaulim. Animal activists in Goa have taken the matter to the Verna and Colva police stations and demanded an investigation of the cases and the prevention of such acts of animal cruelty in their jurisdictions. “Fighting with other bulls is not a natural behaviour for the animal. Bulls are compelled to fight with each other by goading crowds, by applying irritants in their eyes and pulling and pushing their tails to get them agitated and frightened. The process of training and fighting for the bull is extremely cruel and always leads to one bull being fatally injured or killed,” Norma Alvares, People for Animals, Goa wrote in a letter to Verna police. She further urged the Verna police to “put an end to this menace,” and said that it is critical that cases of bullfights are investigated on a war-footing. Bull fights that lead to killing or maiming of animals is a criminal offence both under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA), 1960 and the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint, dhirio events took place in Dabashree Ground, Cansaulim at 5.30pm on August 7 and at 3pm on August 8. On Monday, between 3pm and 4pm, two separate dhirio bullfights took place between bulls Foreigner and Mavali, and another fight took place between bulls Rickshakar and Hareaband. On Tuesday, bullfights were held at Fatrade in Varca, while three were held at Benaulim on Monday. The practice of dhirio is illegal as per the PCA. Moreover, the practice of dhirio was banned by the high court of Bombay at Goa in the People for Animals versus State of Goa case in 1997, as against the provisions of PCA. This decision has also been upheld by the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-bullfighting-events-in-three-days-at-cansaulim/articleshow/85223164.cms||---

Professor Mohan Kashikar, former head of department of political science, approached the judiciary after the VC replaced him with history department professor Shyam Koretti on July 31, while levying vague allegations of professional misconduct and constituting a departmental enquiry (DE) against him. Staying the probe, a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor issued notices for final disposal to chancellor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, NU registrar Raju Hiwase, Koretti and the VC. “The charges are so vague that they do not point out any particular misconduct. Additionally, the respondents do not keep the petitioner adequately informed to enable him to prepare his defence. We find that at least the DE, which is being proceeded based on vague charge-sheet, cannot be permitted to go ahead until further orders,” said the judges. While directing Koretti not to take part in any proceedings related to his new post, the judges said since the July 31 order only gives temporary charge to him, the issue in this regard can be kept open and considered only after detailed reply of the respondents. After adjourning the hearing till next week, the bench directed HC registry to club Kashikar’s petition with his earlier case (WP No. 1974/2000) opposing the registrar’s action of imposing two penalties on him based on the same charges and removal from the HoD’s post. The petitioner, though counsel Firdos Mirza, contended that the charges against him do not make out any case of misconduct and he is not informed properly about the material to be placed against him in the DE. “No professor from any other discipline or those from history department could be appointed as HoD to replace Kashikar. Koretti’s appointment is in violation of the HC’s view in the petitioner’s first petition,” Mirza argued. The petitioner was twice appointed as HoD in 2007 and 2016 and was shortlisted for the VC’s post in Dr Homi Bhabha State University in Mumbai last year. NU had even issued him a no-objection certificate (NOC) certifying that his integrity was beyond doubt. Prior to that, he was appointed as officer in-charge of the postgraduate teaching department (PGTD) of humanities on September 9, 2020, by the VC. Since he was already engaged in academic and teaching responsibilities, Kashikar declined the post. Irked over his refusal, Chaudhari issued him a notice on September 23 seeking explanation as to why disciplinary action shouldn’t be initiated. As Kashikar sought more details from the registrar, he received another notice stating that he intentionally didn’t reply and thus committed a misconduct. Kashikar then filed a detailed reply explaining that the new post is an internal arrangement for building’s maintenance, and it didn’t fall under the duties of a teacher. However, he was imposed with two penalties and removed from the post forcing him to file first case in HC. While staying the NU’s order of June 16, the HC had asked Kashikar to submit a representation to the VC for reconsideration. However, his restoration order was issued on July 25, five days prior to completion of his five-year tenure as HoD. The VC issued another notice to Kashikar claiming that he was found to be absent from the department during multiple visits and also failed to conduct lectures. Despite filing a detailed reply to the notice, Koretti was appointed in his post on July 31 in violation of Statute 55, said Kashikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/remove-vc-for-misusing-powers-nu-prof-urges-hc/articleshow/85220268.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Among the roads that are likely to get a fresh paving are Hazra Road, Alipore Road, Asutosh Mukherjee Road and Chittaranjan Avenue. Besides, large portions of EM Bypass would undergo thorough repairs, the civic official said. But the repair or relaying might not begin before the monsoon got over, a civic official said. According to him, the record amount of rain that the city received in June, July and August has wreaked havoc on the thoroughfares. “We have started identifying stretches that have been badly damaged. Once that is done, we will take up a thorough repair process. Some roads may need fresh paving,” a roads department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-set-to-relay-roads-damaged-by-downpour/articleshow/85222855.cms||---

In response to the Covid pandemic, teachers shifted gears immediately, taking to the virtual platform. However, around 100 teachers from various government schools in the city have been diverted from this task as they are deputed at Covid care centres in the city. They were stationed here by the deputy commissioner (DC) during the second Covid wave when cases were on a steady rise. Now that cases are at a low, these teachers are still on duty in Covid care centres and hospitals. Talking to TOI, a teacher deputed at the government hospital in Sector 16 said, “I have been here since May 3. At present, there is not much work left to do. The education department has opened schools from classes VII to XII but still, they have not relieved teachers from hospitals. We are around 10 teachers here in the centre working on shifts. With shortage of teachers in school, who will teach children? At the hospital, teachers are on duty at the call centre. We are happy to come forward and help but this time the government should think about the children’s future.” Teachers’ union president Swarn Singh Kamboj said, “We have raised the issue with the administration but they said these teachers could not be relieved in view of the possibility of a third wave.” Another teacher on duty said, “We are here to maintain a record of answers about questions asked by people on the helpline number to doctors. In the middle of the day, when we are done with our five-hour shift, we must take our online classes, but we cannot even take online classes at times. Now that cases are ebbing, we are not even required here.” Director, education, UT Rubinderjit Singh Brar said things were being sorted out. “The department is collecting data from schools about how many teachers are currently doing duty at Covid care centres. In between, duty of some teachers was removed, but later some teachers were put on duty again by the DC office. We are trying to get the duty of teachers removed after holding discussions with the DC office. We have sent official letters to them and are awaiting their reply,” he said. DC, Chandigarh, Mandip Singh Brar was unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/second-wave-ebbs-but-teachers-posted-in-covid-care-centres-stay-put/articleshow/85220247.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Teachers thrashed as they stage protest near CM house||PATIALA: Demanding job-letters, ETT-TET qualified teachers held a protest march towards the CM house in Patiala. However, they were stopped by police personnel, who resorted to mild cane-charge. The teachers alleged that police harassed women protesters and also tore their clothes besides cane-charging them. Members of the ETT-TET qualified 2364 teacher union have been sitting on protest near gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib in Patiala for over a month. For around 29 days, they have been sitting on rotational hunger strike with three members each day. “For over the last eight months, we have been waiting for job letters from the state government, which failed to give us jobs despite all procedures being completed for recruitment of 2,364 ETT posts. On Tuesday, we staged a protest march towards the CM residence, following which the police cane-charged us and injured several protesters. They also tore clothes of female protesters and molested them. Now, the administration has fixed a meeting with the CM’s OSD for August 17,” claimed union leader Jagjit Singh. YPS Chowk in Patiala was in the eye of the storm as police and protesters confronted each other. The protesters were not allowed to cross the roundabout, which is only a few metres away from the CM’s residence. In the past few weeks, members of several unions held a protest march, which finally culminated at this roundabout. The protesters were either dispersed after a mild cane charge or detained to be released later, following which some of the protesting unions got a meeting fixed with higher authorities at state level. DSP Patiala, Hemant Kumar, said, “We have boosted security at this roundabout but we try to act as a good mediator between the protesters and government. The protesters got a meeting fixed. We have to maintain law and order also. We have booked 150 to 200 protesters of ETT union on Tuesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/protesting-ett-teachers-thrashed-as-they-try-to-march-towards-cm-house/articleshow/85220291.cms||---

Addressing a press conference in Mumbai on Tuesday after the Lok Sabha cleared the bill granting powers to state governments to decide on OBC and SEBC reservation, Chavan said it was a constitutional amendment and the Centre could have easily relaxed the reservation limit but lost a golden opportunity to help the Maratha community. “It raises the question why the Centre let go of such an opportunity. Despite pleas from MPs from across the country and across party lines all that the central minister said was he would need to think over it. He could have immediately asked for an opinion from his department, but did not dos o. How long should the Maratha community wait for reservation?” he said. He said the Centre has empowered the states on granting reservation but did not take cognizance of the plea repeatedly made by Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena MPs for the reservation to be relaxed. “Except Pritam Munde, BJP MPs from the Maratha community from the state who were present in the house did not speak at all. All of them have been vocal outside but stayed silent in the house,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cong-centres-lost-golden-opportunity-to-help-marathas-in-mumbai/articleshow/85227480.cms||---

The state government has asked the universities, including those run by private managements, to adopt it as general elective credit course (GECC) under the choice-based credit system (CBCS) from the upcoming session (2021-22). The move is in consonance with National Education Policy 2020 where students can select their subjects rather than being confined to those being offered by institutions. “The move will make the learning holistic and skill-oriented. On the successful completion of the course, students will be awarded 12 credit points which will enable them to qualify for their respective degrees,” said Monika S Garg, additional chief secretary, higher education, UP. The order stated that while initially the NCC elective course will be offered to NCC cadets only over a period of time it will be opened for students who wish to study it as a subject. “The pride students take in being Indian should not be confined to thoughts but should be visible in their actions, knowledge and moral values. NCC not only imparts discipline, but it also inculcates feeling of patriotism and opens job avenues,” the order reads. The move will benefit around 1.50 lakh cadets enrolled in universities and colleges in UP, said Colonel AK Singh, coordinating officer, NCC, UP directorate. “The syllabus is in the final stage. All students who enroll as NCC cadets will benefit from obtaining academic credit for NCC training in addition to acquiring NCC certificates,” Col Singh said. A committee headed by higher education director with representatives from NCC directorate and Associate NCC Officer (ANO) has been constituted to finalise the syllabi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-varsities-to-adopt-ncc-as-general-elective-credit-course/articleshow/85226079.cms||Isha Jain

He also said the Delta variant of coronavirus was not a cause of concern any more as the entire second wave in Delhi was due to that variant. The last serological survey, carried out in April this year, had to be cut short as the capital started witnessing an exponential growth in Covid-19 cases due to the second wave. According to the survey report submitted to Delhi government in June, the sero-prevalence was not much higher than the 56.1% antibodies found in the people screened during the fifth survey in January. Jain said genome sequencing of samples during and after the second wave had showed that about 80% of the screened population was infected by the Delta variant. “Delhi has already battled and overcome the Delta variant wave. All the reports have also been sent to ICMR and they also pointed out that Delhi was battling the Delta variant during the second wave.” Jain said the positivity rate had remained at 1% or less for a month now but Delhi government’s preparations for a likely next wave hadn’t slowed down. “We have doubled the number of the ICU beds and have added more beds overall.” The government is preparing 37,000 beds, out of which 12,000 are ICU beds, compared to around 23,000 beds, including 6,000 ICU ones, available during the second wave. He added, “While we are also preparing to take care of our children, the overall percentage of children who need hospitalisation is very less in comparison to the adults in the case of this pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seventh-sero-survey-to-begin-soon-in-delhi-jain/articleshow/85220371.cms||---

The Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) were asked to lift the antibody cocktail drug stock from the Thane store of the state health department. Officials at Nagpur and Akola GMCH and sources at Aurangabad GMCH confirmed that the authorities have refused to take the stock as there is no need of these drugs any more. Further, the expiry date of these medicines is nearing, so the GMCs do not want to stock the medicines for no reason. An official from the Nagpur GMCH administrative department said, “In June, Nagpur GMCH received a letter from the state health department asking to collect 750 vials of antibody cocktail, to which we had initially agreed owing to the situation at that time. But since then the Covid-19 conditions have improved significantly. So we have informed the department that we are not going to collect the drug now.” The official, who did not wish to be named, said that expiry date of the drugs was also nearing. Furthermore, the deep-freeze vehicles required for the transportation are also not available easily, he added. Similar letters were received by Akola and Aurangabad GMCH and sources confirmed that they have also refused to collect the medicines. Doctors treating Covid patients in Vidarbha said the antibody cocktail is more beneficial for those in the high risk category, especially senior citizens, whose immunity levels are decreasing. Till date, zero mortality rate has been reported among the people who were administered the drug cocktail. At present, Vidarbha hospitals have low admissions and very few of them are moderate or severely critical. More than 95% of the oxygen beds are unoccupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-takers-for-antibody-cocktail-maha-govt-hospitals-refuse-to-collect-stock/articleshow/85220355.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly considered during admission hearing an appeal by the government against the single bench order on a petition filed by S Kuttappan Chettiar. The order that was stayed by the single bench was issued by the government on February 6. Through the order, Nadars belonging to Christian religious denominations other than South Indian United Church (SIUC) were included in the list of socially and educationally backward classes for the purpose of providing employment and educational benefits. It was alleged by the petitioner before the single bench that the government took such a decision without collecting any quantified data. In the appeal, the government argues that Christian Nadar community was included in an existing list for modifying the OBC category and that the Supreme Court had held that until a decision is taken by the President, the existing lists are valid. However, the single bench had said in the order that the apex court’s judgment does not save the additions made to the list and that the apex court allowed existing lists in states to continue so as to not leave a vacuum until the President publishes a comprehensive list, so that the communities specified in the existing lists can continue to claim benefits until then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-bench-rejects-govt-plea-on-quota/articleshow/85222932.cms||---

A government spokesperson said that in 2018, UP was given the award for Best Buyer while in 2019, it was awarded as a Super Buyer. The award was accepted by additional chief secretary (MSME) Navneet Sehgal on behalf of the state government during a two-day conclave organised by CII on national public procurement to mark the fifth year of the GEM portal. “Transparency in government procurement is a priority for the current government. Through the GEM portal, we have managed to curb corruption of thousands of crores. There are 12,672 buyers on the portal, along with 98,552 sellers of which 61,809 are from the MSME sector.

Earlier, CBI investigating officer Jitendra Kachare, personally submitted a progress report in the case, as per HC’s July 12 orders in a sealed envelope. The HC then read the report and directed the registrar (judicial) to keep those in his safe custody. He was also told to not allow any person to read the report’s contents without HC’s approval. Later, Mugdha Chandurkar pleading for the CBI, prayed for two months for completing the investigations. Even Nimgade’s son Anupam, who has filed the petition for expediting the probe into his father’s murder, expressed satisfaction with the CBI’s progress. “In that view of the matter, we are granting four weeks’ time to the investigating officer to conduct further probe. He is directed to submit the next report of progress of investigation in sealed envelopes to this court,” the judges said. The assailants had shot dead the senior citizen when he was returning from a morning walk on September 6, 2016, at Lal Imli Chowk. A case was later registered by the tehsil police for murder and Arms Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-flays-cbi-for-slow-probe-in-nimgade-murder-case/articleshow/85220409.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Most of the major claims are expected to be settled within 2-3 months,” the registrar of cooperative societies said. The Reserve Bank of India cancelled the licence as the bank could not comply with banking norms. “The bank with its present financial position would be unable to pay its present depositors in full and public interest would be adversely affected if the bank is allowed to carry on its banking business any further,” the RBI had said. The central bank said that 99% of the bank’s 56,600 depositors will receive their funds. With the cancellation of the banking licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 56,600 depositors of the former bank will commence as per the DICGC Act. On liquidation, every depositor will be entitled to receive deposit insurance claim amount of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs 5 lakh from the DICGC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-goa-civil-services-officer-appointed-as-liquidator-for-madgaum-urban-bank/articleshow/85224184.cms||---

---||Delhi||No query from Centre on oxygen deaths, says Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia alleged on Tuesday that the central government hadn’t yet asked Delhi government whether there had been any deaths due to lack of oxygen in the capital. He said the state government had instead decided to send the Centre the complete information in the form of a report on the deaths caused by the oxygen scarcity at the peak of the recent upsurge in Covid-19 cases. “People in hospitals were dying due to lack of oxygen. The Supreme Court seriously questioned the central government on this, but it remains insensitive to those who died in this manner,” Sisodia said at Tuesday’s digital press briefing. Sisodia said that according to news reports, the central government instructed state governments to inform it on the number of deaths due to oxygen deprivation. Apparently,13 states responded, of which only one state submitted figures related to death, while the remaining 12 claimed no such deaths under their jurisdiction. “A few days ago, I had read that the Centre had given the states until August 13 to submit information about deaths caused by oxygen scarcity. But till date, Delhi government hasn’t received any communication on this,” the deputy CM claimed. “The central government is spreading the lie that states are not providing information, but the truth is it hasn’t asked for any information from the states.” Sisodia said that Delhi government had constituted an inquiry committee to audit the oxygen deaths, but the panel was rejected by the lieutenant governor. “This is proof that the Centre is neither asking for details nor allowing the states to work,” he alleged. “Without any investigation it is difficult to say there weren’t any deaths due to lack of oxygen in Delhi.” Delhi BJP President Adesh Gupta countered that Sisodia’s statement reflected the state government's insensitivity and it should have written to the Centre if it had knowledge about oxygen-shortage deaths. Gupta asserted, “The truth is that the Kejriwal government does not wish to admit oxygen shortage deaths in Delhi because its failure to provide oxygen would then be exposed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-query-from-centre-on-o2-deaths/articleshow/85220593.cms||---

Residents living around the site, a mango orchard, alleged that the stagnant water on the site was not only emitting foul smell but also facilitating breeding of mosquitoes. Akhil Goel, a resident of Sector 20, who has been pursuing the issue for the past nine months, said that he, along other area residents, met the local councillor of Sector 20 as well as HUDA and MC officials but no solution was provided. Residents also moved a joint complaint with the CM window, which is being processed. Goel said, “MC officials say the land belongs to HUDA while HUDA officials say that work of draining water is that of the MC. We have moved a complaint in all departments but no one is taking any action on the issue.” Resident welfare association members also raised the issue with Haryana Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta and the chief medical officer but to no avail. After a long wait, they decided to clean the area on their own. On Tuesday, residents collected funds and hired a person and a water pump set to drain water from the mango orchard but were faced with another problem. Vivek Kapoor, a resident of Sector 20 said, “The road gullies and sewerage system are not clean, causing issues in drainage of water from the road.” Since the orchard is located in a low lying area, it remains waterlogged even when there is no monsoon. Residents want officials concerned to identify technical issues and work on a permanent solution. Since HUDA has not fenced the land, they said, illegal felling of trees and encroachment is also an issue. Residents have planted trees here and are making efforts to maintain the place. Huda acquired this land a few years ago from a private land owner but it was not maintained, said residents, who also raised slogans against the Panchkula administration and Haryana government for not taking up the issue. They carried placards with slogans like, “Sarkar sirf tax samete, apna bachav naagrik tete” (Government just collects taxes, residents have to work on their own). BOX: Major problems on vacant land - Stagnant water - Mosquito breeding - Foul smell - Illegal tree felling (trespassing) - Encroachments - Improper sewerage and road gullies Photo quotes: Anuj Agarwal | Convener, Suncity Parikrama Society, Sector 20 As many as 1,500 families living in my society are suffering and many families living in other housing societies next to us are also having the same issues. It is a longstanding problem and the administration must provide a solution. Col Avinash Sharma | Sector 20 resident We have visited officers, written mails, posted tweets about our problem and approached Haryana Assembly speaker as well as Haryana CM but no one came or tried to resolve the issue. Akhil Goel | Resident, Sector 20 There is no office left in Panchkula where we have not raised our issue. We are forced to find a solution on our own but it is not a permanent solution. Officers concerned must visit the area and provide us a solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/infra-in-a-mess-admn-inertia-forces-residents-to-drain-water-from-vacant-site-themselves/articleshow/85220454.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

In a Facebook post, the Bishop urged the government to drop the project citing various factors. He urged all to take a serious note of the warning issued by the United Nations about the climate change and the observations and forecasts made by the panel on climate change. “Uncontrolled exploitation of nature has made the climate unpredictable. Development activities ignoring nature will not be permanent,” he said. The Bishop was surprised overthe move to evict around 1lakh people for providing way for the travel of some from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod in four hours. The impact of the project on our environment will be beyond our imagination, he said. “The project will also drag Kerala into a debt trap of over Rs 1 lakh crore. How can this government which already finds itself in a big debt bear this?” asks the Bishop. “If a project needs the eviction of a lakh of people and which affects the rhythm of nature in a big way is called development, then I am against development,” he wrote . How can a Left government come up with such ‘development’ projects? He ends his post by requesting the government to drop the K-rail project which he says is against the people and nature. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/k-rail-against-people-nature-says-coorilos/articleshow/85222974.cms||---
