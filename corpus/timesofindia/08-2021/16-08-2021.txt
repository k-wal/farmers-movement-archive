---||Bengaluru||With 26% of Bengaluru’s workforce now working late night shifts, irrespective of the night curfew, late night kitchens strive to meet increased demand for food post 9 pm||We’ve been through lockdowns. Found the time to discover the chef within. And then dived right back into work in the attempt to get back some normalcy, leaving us with very little or no time to cook a decent meal at home as often. Today, as Bengaluru’s workforce is busy handling increased work pressure and timings, they also need to work around the various curfews and deadline directives issued by the government to help avoid another lockdown and curb any rise in Covid cases during the pandemic. Coming to the rescue, are the city’s restaurants, cloud kitchens and home chefs, and with them the delivery boys, who are leaving no stone unturned to meet the increase in demand for the hungry souls post the city’s current stringent deadlines. Night time orders on the rise Karthikeyan Selvaraj, from Biryani2Home, shares that he’s noticed a steep rise in late night food orders. "The number of people ordering for home delivery of food later in the night has been increasing by the day. Around 26% of the city's workforce today has late night shifts. This is a huge potential. Clients are mostly working professionals, and sometimes even students and families who cannot step out due to the curfew," he points out. Arun Prasanna, General Manager, Operations, Byg Brewski, tells us, "Our home delivery orders have shown a decent growth after 11 pm, especially after the city’s 9 pm deadline set in. Our guests' ordering pattern shows that our one meal bowls, brewizzas and burgers are selling at an adequate number post 11pm." “With restaurants forced to close during lockdowns, food delivery became a lifeline to continue business. Lifestyle changes like people working in odd shifts, late-night studying and sleeping habits have resulted in a sudden upsurge of the demand for food and other products at late hours. This emerging trend has given birth to a new business segment," shares Hitesh Tulsani, head of sales and operations at Raahi Neo Kitchen and Bar. Tech workforce is the key factor India is the back office for many other countries. “There are thousands of people who work in night shifts, pushing demand for food at night. Seeing the open field for a ready market, we are booming in the midnight delivery segment, targeting a very niche clientele,” explains Hitesh. Meanwhile, there are quite a few people who have quit their regular jobs to cash in on the food and deliver trend too. Take the case of Chandan Gowda, who quit his job at an MNC after he found he could do something about the lack of food delivery options when he worked late nights. "When I was an MNC employee, I realised that there was a huge potential in the late-night food delivery market. I knew that there were many like me who were dependent on the few available options, which led me to explore this with a cloud kitchen called After Dark, which begins only after 8 pm and works till about 3 am. While there are eateries that open as early as 4 am or stay operational till midnight, there is a window in between that was an opportunity not to be missed," he shares. Unofficial late-night addas While a lot of these outlets are busy catering to delivery options, the fact that they are technically ‘open’ that late have turned them into unofficial late-night addas. “My wife and I usually wrap up work at midnight, and since we do not start work too early in the morning, a late-night drive around the city, occasionally, is somehow therapeutic. During one of these drives, we found a couple of chai and fast food outlets that were still open. They do not offer service as such, but you can manage to grab a bit. You will find that quite a few youngsters have discovered this too, and these spaces have now become the unofficial late-night addas where you can hang out for a while,” says Nithesh Rao (name changed), who works from home for an MNC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-26-of-bengalurus-workforce-now-working-late-night-shifts-irrespective-of-the-night-curfew-late-night-kitchens-strive-to-meet-increase-demand-for-food-post-9-pm/articleshow/85345303.cms||Sunayana Suresh

He carried the chopped hand of the deceased to the station. Kadir Pasha attacked Mahammad Suran, 27, with lethal weapons and chopped his right hand, police said. Suran, who was working in a private company in Bengaluru, married Rubina, sister of the accused, five months ago. He reportedly suspected his wife's fidelity and this angered Kadir. He brought Suran — who had come to Mysuru for the weekend — forcefully to his house. Kadir locked Suran in a room and chopped his right hand, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/youth-murders-bro-in-law-carries-hand-to-police-stn/articleshow/85354546.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Women on bikes, docs on cycles steal show at I-Day celebrations||BENGALURU: The first Bikers Fashion Show was indicative of the 75th Independence Day mood on Sunday across the city — 75 women from veterans’ families sashayed holding a 80-foot-long tricolour with 75 women bikers on rumbling bikes accompanying them. Under the aegis of the Mysore Sandal Soap and SHE For Society, the bikers from across Karnataka and attired in traditional outfifts representing various parts of the country, rode their BMWs, Harley Davidsons, Royal Enfields, Meteors, Kawasaki Ninjas and Dukes, among others, for 10km from the Soap Factory to the Manpho Convention Centre. Biker and society founder Harshini Venkatesh said, “Considering it’s the platinum jubilee of our Independence Day, we had to do something different. We thought of a bike fashion show which is quite unique. We wore attires from different states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu, and jewellery to go with them.” The bikers are between 25 and 45 years. Low-key event The official event at Maneskshaw Prade Ground was a muted affair amid fears of an impending Covid-19 third wave. While the ceremonial marchpast and flag hoisting were held, there were no cultural events. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai delivered the address after hoisting the tricolour. Elsewhere in the city, the freedom mood was overwhelming with the tricolour much in evidence. Seeking to promote awareness about the importance of vaccination and maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour, Specialist Hospital organised a ‘Freedom from Covid Ride’ involving over 50 healthcare professionals who pedalled for 12km in and around Bengaluru East. The ride was flagged off by Dr Shafiq AM, CEO and director, Specialist Hospital in the presence of co-founder Dr Prashanth R. The idea of the medical fraternity promoting vaccination was to build confidence among the public to dampen the impact of the third wave. Round Table India and Ladies Circle India - Area 6 organised the 11th edition of the Freedom Drive in Bengaluru, and honoured freedom fighters. It sought to create awareness about Round Table India’s objective of ‘Freedom Through Education’. Over 30 cars and bikes participated in it. On the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, rewards were given to 13 staff members of the Bannerghatta Biological Park for their exemplary work in conservation of wildlife, especially during Covid. The recipients included those involved in maintaining park hygiene, wildlife rescue operations and animal management operations and also those who had recovered from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/women-on-bikes-docs-on-cyclessteal-show-at-i-day-celebrations/articleshow/85354550.cms||---

The deceased is Chandan, class 10 student of a private school in Chikkathottalukere. Shashank, 16, class 10 student of a private school in Tumakuru and Pavan, 19, who worked in a tractor showroom, sustained minor burns in the accident. All three were rushed to a hospital in Tumakuru, where Chandan was declared brought dead. Kumar, Chandan’s father and a bus conductor, fell unconscious on seeing his only son’s body. According to deputy director of public instruction C Nanjaiah, the three boys, all residents of Karikere, were the alumni of the school and had volunteered to take part in the celebrations as they used to do every year.  Villagers alleged that the teachers of the government school were responsible for the death and demanded action against them. Nanjaiah, however, said every year, the former students and villagers participate in the programme held on the school premises. He claimed no teacher had told them to erect the flagpole. “A compensation of Rs 1 lakh will be given to the parents of Chandan and the department will bear the medical expenses of the injured,” he said. Nanjaiah said SDMC members and teachers had submitted several applications to Bescom seeking removal of the overhead wires drawn over their campus, but in vain. “They are now saying the overhead cables will be removed on Monday,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/16-yr-old-installing-flagpole-electrocuted/articleshow/85354560.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Govt doctor, nurse jailed for taking bribe||TUMAKURU: A special court in Tumakuru on Friday sentenced a government doctor to seven- year simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs 20,000 for accepting a bribe of Rs 4,000 from a patient and refusing to discharge her until the amount was paid. The court also sentenced a nurse, who acted on behalf of the doctor and accepted money from the family members of the patient, to three-year simple imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 10,000. The orders were passed by VIIth Additional District and Sessions Court and Special Court for Prevention of Corruption Act Judge S Sudindranath. Dr K Mamata and HS Gangamma, the nurse, have been sent to Tumakuru district prison. Lokayukta police had trapped the duo on September 8, 2014 inside Kunigal government hospital while accepting the bribe. The patient’s family members had already paid Rs 6,000, but Mamata demanded Rs 4,000 more while refusing to discharge Jayamma. Mamata had demanded Rs 10,000 to operate Jayamma, a widow and farmer from Kunigal, for uterus-related issues in the first week of September 2014. Jayamma’s daughter Nandini had sold their cow to arrange the amount. Public prosecutor N Basavaraj said the recorded conversation between Nandini and Mamata played a vital role in establishing the allegations. “Nandini had recorded the conversation with Dr Mamata. In one such call, Mamata shouted at her for the delay in paying the balance amount. She also warned Nandini that she would not discharge her mother until they pay the whole amount,” Basavaraj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-doc-nurse-jailed-for-taking-bribe/articleshow/85354561.cms||---

BSF troops and Pakistani Rangers had also exchanged sweets across border outposts under Jammu Frontier region on the occasion of Pakistan’s Independence Day on August 14, said a BSF spokesman. Earlier on Eid on July 21 this year, both forces exchanged sweets for the first time after the Pulwama terror attack on February 14, 2019, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-bsf-exchange-sweets-with-pakistani-counterparts-on-i-day/articleshow/85354995.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Champagne was flowing in the Veuve Clicquot tent over the weekend, and a long queue formed outside the Indian Street food stall serving kathi rolls with masala fries. At lunchtime, the famous Bharat Army could be spotted near the nursery ground swigging some spirits and enjoying a picnic of samosas and dhokras. "It is brilliant to be back at the home of cricket after such a long time – not just to see the cricket but to be back with the Bharat Army who are like a family to me," said Bobby Upple, a resident of Rochester. "Lord’s is very civilised – you are not allowed flags or instruments or chanting. It is different to Oval, and here people are focused on the game and players. It is a different experience." Vish Bains has been driving down from Birmingham every day to watch the Test Match. " I need (Joe) Root out before I can go back in," he said as play resumed post-lunch on Saturday. Then there was a huge cheer. The Indian fans desperately checked their phones if it was a wicket. Was Root out? No it was Johnny Bairstow. There were huge cheers and the Bharat Army launched into a song and dance: "Oh Johnny Bairstow! You are the love of my life….!" Food kiosks in the ground sold everything from fish and chips, to Cornish pasties, to "Lord’s Butter Chicken". For Purushotham Belludi Chandrashekar, it was his first time at Lord’s. "It is a lovely atmosphere and the crowd is fantastic," he said. "We are fortunate to be here after 15 months of turbulence. We can enjoy the game as a community. It’s a quality experience. I prefer to watch Test cricket in a stadium. India is playing well but we need wickets badly." Ganapati Bhat blamed the pitch for India's plight, saying the ball was not "swinging much". But he felt this could still be India’s best chance to win a Test series in England. "The India team is better than the England team as Ben Stokes is not playing and they have a lot of injuries," he said. "It is mesmerising" said Nachiket Datar of the Lord's experience, more so after a long Covid-induced drought of spectator entertainment. "It is really heartening to see such a crowd for a Test match. They were saying Test cricket is dying. It clearly isn’t."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/lords-of-the-stands-troop-back-to-home-of-cricket/articleshow/85355521.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Hectic efforts were on to trace the missing pilots of the ill-fated ALH-WSI Rudra. On August 13, the elite Submarine Rescue Unit of the Indian Navy was roped in to trace the missing pilots. Confirming tracing of one body, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Kathua, Ramesh Kotwal said: “Joint teams on Sunday evening found the mortal remains of one missing pilot, Lt Col AS Baath, from a depth of 75.9m from the Ranjit Sagar Lake. The operation is still on to trace the other pilot, who is still missing. The mortal remains have been dispatched to MH Pathankot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-chopper-crash-body-of-1-missing-pilot-found-from-ranjit-sagar-lake/articleshow/85355675.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani flees, Taliban set to declare Islamic emirate||KABUL/ISLAMABAD: Kabul fell to the Taliban in a swift and seemingly bloodless takeover on Sunday as President Ashraf Ghani took a flight to Tajikistan, later left for Tashkent in Uzbekistan, leaving a small band of political representatives to complete the handover of Afghanistan's final frontier to the advancing forces that had captured most of the country in the span of 10 days. The last act of the Taliban's resurgence came nearly 20 years after the militant regime had been toppled by American troops in pursuit of al-Qaeda to avenge the 9/11 attacks on the US. Soon after Taliban fighters took over the presidential palace, sporadic gunfire was heard in central Kabul. Checkpoints were abandoned by government troops even as panic-stricken residents blocked the streets. By afternoon, the Taliban had taken over Kabul’s main Pul-e-Charkhi prison, freeing thousands of inmates, videos on social media showed. As Kabul was being taken over, Ghani exited the country along with his key aides without waiting for what the Taliban had said would be a formal handover to a transitional government following his resignation. Late in the evening, Reuters quoted two Taliban officials as saying there would be no transitional government, followed by reports of Kabul airport coming under attack. "The security situation in Kabul is changing quickly, including at the airport. There are reports of the airport taking fire; therefore, we are instructing US citizens to shelter in place," Reuters quoted the US embassy as saying in a security alert. Earlier in the day, there were reports of negotiations at the presidential palace between the Taliban and government representatives, headed by former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the Afghan National Reconciliation Council. Afghan media said Ali Ahmed Jalali, the country’s former ambassador to Germany, could head the interim government. Acting defence minister Bismillah Mohammadi said a roadmap for peaceful transfer of power to the transitional government was being prepared. Taliban leaders, who had earlier asked their fighters to refrain from violence in Kabul and allow safe passage to anyone wanting to leave the city, were later ordered to clamp down on the city to prevent looting. The Taliban victory coincided with the quick exit of American and British diplomatic staff and other citizens before flight operations at Kabul airport were halted for some hours. Ross Wilson, the top US diplomat in Afghanistan, and other staff took a helicopter to the airport even as the US flag fluttering over the embassy was removed. Smoke had been spotted over the embassy’s roof before the Americans left, fuelling speculation that the US diplomats destroyed all sensitive documents before leaving the compound. Germany said it would send military aircraft late Sunday to evacuate Germans as well as Afghan support staff. NATO is said to be discussing the evolving situation while the UN security council will meet on Monday morning, Reuters said quoting diplomats. Pakistan’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Ahmad Khan, and ex-envoy Muhammad Sadiq confirmed receiving an Afghan political delegation, including Wolesi Jirga (national assembly) speaker Mir Rehman Rehmani, Salahuddin Rabbani, Muhammad Yunus Qanooni, Ustad Muhammad Karim, Ahmad Zia Massoud, Ahmad Wali Massoud, Abdul Latif Pedram and Khalid Noor. "Honoured to receive a delegation of Afghan political leaders arriving Islamabad for a three-day visit for consultations on the way forward for peace and stability in Afghanistan," Khan tweeted. In the lead-up to the last lap of the Taliban surge, its fighters had taken control of the strategically important city of Jalalabad in the eastern Nangarhar province, on the border with Pakistan. The forces then captured the Bagram airfield and prison, on the outskirts of Kabul. The Bagram complex was the epicentre of the war against the Taliban and al-Qaeda for some 20 years until last month, when the US military left the facility without notifying the Kabul administration. Bagram prison, once dubbed Afghanistan’s Guantanamo, was handed over by the Americans to Afghan authorities in 2013. Sources said it had been decided at the recent Doha meetings that blood would not be spilled in Kabul. Sohail Shaheen, a Doha-based Taliban spokesperson and part of the militant group’s negotiating team, told the media that they would take full control of Afghanistan in the next few days, albeit with "a peaceful transfer". He laid out the policies of the Taliban ahead of the expected power transfer. "We want an inclusive Islamic government... that means all Afghans will be part of that government," the spokesperson said. Shaheen urged foreign diplomats and workers not to leave the country, assuring them that Taliban fighters would not target them. "There will be no risk to diplomats, NGOs, to anyone. All should continue their work as they were doing in the past," he said. He also tried to dispel fears that Afghanistan would be chained once again by the ultra-conservative version of Islamic law prevalent in the country before 2001. "The Taliban will instead seek a new chapter of tolerance, peaceful coexistence and national unity for the country and its people," Shaheen said. "We want to open a new chapter of peace, tolerance, peaceful coexistence and national unity for the country and its people. We reassure all that there will be no revenge on anyone." The Doha-based spokesperson said the Taliban would also "review its relationship with the US" to pursue a new chapter of cooperation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-captures-kabul-in-bloodless-coup-as-afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-flees-country/articleshow/85355748.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Mumbai||How can restaurants in the city shut at 10pm? Extend deadline to 1.30am, say Mumbaikars||While the new ‘Break The Chain’ unlock guidelines issued on August 11, by the government of Maharashtra, have come as a temporary relief for restaurant owners in the city, and eateries were seen open till 10pm since yesterday, restaurateurs and a huge section of Mumbaikars feel that the revised guidelines aren’t enough and do not serve much of a purpose for them. They firmly believe that the government should let them resume their operational timings of 1.30am. Columnist, author and food critic Rashmi Uday Singh, who feels rather strongly for the restaurateurs says, “Extending the hours to 1.30 am, which is the original licensed time, is crucial for several reasons. First of all, it is physically impossible for diners to complete their meal in less than two hours. Moreover, our restaurants are bleeding. They’ve been shut 52 per cent of the period since the first lockdown and opened only with limited hours. Extending time till 1.30 am is crucial, to help give restaurants a shot in the arm.” TimesViewThe new guidelines by the Maharashtra government permit restaurants to remain open till 10pm at 50 per cent capacity. This move, though a significant step ahead from the earlier situation, seems like a halfhearted attempt because the extension up to 10pm will barely help resurrect the hospitality industry that has suffered a massive blow due to the pandemic. The food and nightlife industry cannot rationally be clubbed with malls in terms of timelines since the consumer behaviour is very different for both. Most Mumbaikars have long working hours and dining out forms the fabric of Mumbai’s lifestyle and culture. The young working professionals form a huge part of the footfalls that restaurants witness on regular days, and expecting them to wind up work only to rush to their favourite restaurants is bizarre. Further, this could lead to overcrowding between the evening hours of 7-10pm, and restaurateurs may have to turn away guests who have been waiting for a table. The 10pm timeline will therefore, in all probability, lead to flouting of rules and encourage a mix of harassment and corruption as owners struggle to keep the business alive. It is crucial to extend the timings to 1.30am in the best interest of the restaurant owners and Mumbaikars. The extended timing will also enable restaurateurs to plan social distancing comfortably. The government has taken a step in the right direction, but it has hesitated to go all the way. It should.Officials at AHAR (Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association) couldn’t agree more. Shivanand Shetty, President, AHAR, explains, “Given the hectic life they live, some Mumbaikars prefer having dinner between 9 - 10 pm. So, in the given 10 pm deadline with 50% occupancy limit, we are able to cater to only one set of diners, as taking orders and food preparation takes time and we won’t be able to do justice to our patrons. Enforcing this deadline could lead to unnecessary arguments between owners and authorities and in some cases corruption, too. So, we would be grateful if the administration could extend timings to pre-COVID time period, i.e. 1.30 am.” Columnist, author and social commentator Shobhaa De isn’t happy with the restrictions either. She tells us, “If the same people could work and earn at the old restricted timing of 4 pm, how does anything suddenly change at 11 pm? The restaurant business has been seriously impacted during the pandemic. It should be given an optimum push to get back on its feet. Provide incentives, remove arbitrary restrictions.” Reshmi Raut, a 31-year-old media professional from the suburbs, has taken both the vaccines and is looking forward to the new guidelines and relaxed timings. She feels that with the cases plateauing, we should slowly go back to leading our lives the way we used to. She tells us, “If we want to bring life back to normal, we will have to do the things we did before; of course, with adequate precautions. So, restaurants should be allowed to remain open till 1.30am and not just 10pm. We want businesses to start like earlier and hence, we should go back to old timings. People, too, want to get back to their regular life and go dining like they used to.” Entrepreneur Divya Gupta is a Bandra resident, which is the hub of Mumbai’s most-loved eateries and pubs. Divya, who is a stickler for COVID safety protocols, tells us, “I understand malls having a 10pm deadline, as we mostly shop during the day, or early hours of the evening. And then, we head out to have dinner. But if restaurants shut by 10pm, then it will prevent us from going out for dinner completely. We’d rather have friends over at home then. We are all waiting to feel some sense of normalcy, and this change (of extended timings to 1.30am) will be a big step in that direction. Having said that, I will only go to places that are following all COVID safety protocols. Safety is of prime importance, and I believe that all restaurant owners understand that, too.” South Mumbai resident and a big foodie, Farzana Contractor, adds, “One way of normalising life and infusing positivity into the life of the Mumbaikar would certainly be to open up restaurants till 1:30am. Eating out in Mumbai is its lifeline. A very necessary factor. Keeping eateries open until 10pm is just not enough. The other factor is that it’s going to be open to only 50 per cent capacity. Putting all these embargoes doesn’t lead anywhere. You cannot give with one hand and take with the other. Just open it all up and then review it after a week or a month. The government should be wholehearted about this decision and keep the restaurants open at night with guidelines in place. Restaurants are an outing for Mumbaikars, and we need to help the industry get back to normal.” Mumbai is a city that houses people from multiple strata of society, and everyone has demanding work schedules. Tina Jalan, CA, a resident of South Mumbai, really hopes that restaurant timings are extended till 1.30am. She says, “Most professionals like us, keep late work hours, till about 8pm at least. Very rarely can we step out for dinner before 9pm, so the deadline of 10pm is pointless for us. It’s as good as restaurants being shut. Also, this means there will be more crowds in the evening hours between 7-10pm, and I would rather not venture out then. We really need to extend the timings, it will be a huge relief for us, who have been cooped up at home for months, and for restaurants/ hotels who are struggling to keep their head above the water for survival.” ‘NO RESTAURANT WILL TURN AWAY GUESTS WILLINGLY AFTER 10 PM’Restaurateur Amrish Arora reiterates that the 10pm deadline is not a good idea as rules like these might lead to corruption and hafta. He says, “Diners will make reservations in all restaurants and not everyone will finish by 10pm. There will surely be some restaurants that will flout the rules to accommodate that. This will only encourage unscrupulous ways of doing business. It would be so much easier if guests know that there are two seatings, between 7pm to 1.30am, which is our licensed deadline. We can easily plan out social distancing comfortably. Right now, we are fighting over wrong aspects. We are trying to pack in tables and see our PNL accounts, pay salaries, rent, and we are turning away guests. No restaurant will turn away guests willingly. The government of Maharashtra has to take us into confidence as responsible citizens who will follow norms. Guests will be happy, we will be happy and the government will be happy.” STAFF SHOULD HAVE TAKEN AT LEAST THE FIRST VACCINE DOSEBMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal announced on August 13 that restaurant staff should have taken at least the first vaccine shot before reporting to work, “and no employee can be zero vaccinated”. This brings much relief to the industry because the earlier guidelines had stated that they would require all employees at restaurants to have taken both the vaccine shots. Shivanand Shetty, President, AHAR, says, “The age group of those in the hospitality industry is largely 18-44 years and many are not eligible to take the second jab yet. While we are actively pursuing setting up of vaccine camps at different locations, we will ensure that our staff goes for the second vaccine as soon as they are eligible. We will be following all SOPs and would love to welcome our patrons to have a good time and good food in a safe and secured environment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/how-can-restaurants-in-the-city-shut-at-10pm-extend-deadline-to-1-30am-say-mumbaikars/articleshow/85354843.cms||Debarati S Sen
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Researchers develop hybrid hydrogels to repair cartilage||BENGALURU: Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have developed hybrid hydrogels that can be used to repair damaged cartilage, a type of connective tissue that acts as a shock absorber and deters abrasion between bones. Although cartilage is usually tough and flexible, injuries, hormonal abnormalities or diseases can cause damage and make healing difficult, the IISc said, adding that recent advances are focused on using polymers called hydrogels to replace injured or diseased cartilage. “...Despite having some properties needed for cartilage tissue repair, commonly used hydrogels made of polyacrylamide (PAM) lack the required mechanical strength and puncture resistance,” an IISc statement read. Addressing this, researchers from the departments of materials engineering, mechanical engineering and inorganic and physical chemistry at IISc have now developed hybrid hydrogels by combining PAM with either carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or titanium dioxide (TiO2) or both. “They found that the most stable composite hydrogel (PAM+TiO2+CNT) had remarkable self-healing ability, high mechanical strength, and compatibility with biological tissue. They also carried out computational studies to understand the binding features and structure of these hybrid hydrogels,” IISc added. Designed by postdoctoral fellow Shikha Awasthi, the study showed that this modified hydrogel is more hydrophilic than either PAM alone or in combination with just TiO2 or CNTs; this allows it to absorb more water and swell, which is important for biomedical applications. “Its dense and compact structure helps it withstand degradation. The researchers also used a method called needle insertion to show that the hybrid hydrogel is puncture-resistant. Such materials offer great promise for cartilage repair applications,” the statement read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/researchers-develop-hybrid-hydrogels-to-repair-cartilage/articleshow/85354437.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘The 10pm deadline is tearing the restaurant business apart’||After facing massive losses during lockdowns following the pandemic, the hospitality and nightlife industry is still struggling to get back on its feet. As they try to stay afloat, while running at 50% capacity, the major challenge they have faced is operating with almost no revenue while incurring operational costs. What certainly isn’t helping in this scenario is the 10 pm deadline. Most restaurants’ major business comes from dinner hours, but with 9 pm being the last call for orders, hardly any customers can wrap up work and fight through hours of traffic to make it in time! “In cities like Delhi and Mumbai where people rarely follow a 9-5 kind of work routine, we can’t expect them to reach the restaurant at 7pm sharp. They have to go through hours-long traffic even if they want to catch up with friends for some food and drinks after work. Diners come for dinner at 8.30-9 pm, and by then it is already time for the last order. So, given these time restrictions, many people don’t even plan to go out for dinners, which is a huge revenue loss for us, and 90% restaurants are suffering because of it,” says Riyaaz Amlani, owner of restaurants like Social and Smoke House Deli. 'At least 80% of our revenue comes from dinner hours'Restaurateurs add that 80% of their revenue comes from dinner hours. “The 10pm mandate restricts the industry as a whole, specially at a time when the F&B industry is trying to recover from heavy losses incurred during the pandemic,” says Satyajit Dhingra, Chief Regional Officer – North, Impresario Handmade Restaurants. With the festive season kicking in, this is the time when more people would want to plan outings with friends and families, but restaurant owners say timing continues to play a big deterrent. “We should also look at the psychological need for people to now go out and socialise after being at home for months on end. If we are allowed to extend the deadline even by a few hours, we can get 50% more revenue,” says Amit Bagga, co-founder and CEO, Daryaganj Restaurant. Akshay Anand, co-founder, Ophelia and Toyroom, adds, “These time restrictions are tearing our businesses apart as we are not being able to recover the costs incurred in running operations. We need later deadlines to survive.” Restaurateur Umang Tewari, who owns seven outlets in NCR including Key nightclub in Delhi, had to shut his outlet Garam Dharam in Connaught Place after the lockdown last year. This year, he had to shut his other outlet, Sexy Soda, in Gurgaon after lockdown. He fears that if current timeline restrictions are not lifted, he might have to shut more outlets. “It is not just me, there are many others who will have to shut down as we are paying lakhs every month for rentals, electricity, overhead and other operational costs, with no revenue. Our business runs on dinners and drinks. If you restrict timings, why will guests even come to restaurants and bars? I do not understand that when we are being asked to pay licence fee, excise fee like we are fully operational, why should there be restrictions on our timelines. We are already running at 50% occupancy, adhering to all COVID safety norms, the least support we can get from the government is to allow us an extension in our timing. We are only asking for ease of doing business and extension in timing right now can actually go a long way in saving many businesses,” says Umang. Restaurateurs in Delhi and Noida are urging authorities to push back their deadlines from 10pm to 1am, citing the example of neighbouring city Gurgaon where operational timings were extended to 1am recently 'Delhi's timings should at least be at par with Gurgaon's'Unlike Delhi, Gurgaon bars and restaurants are now allowed to remain open till 1am. “The timings of restaurants and bars in Delhi should at least match that of neighbouring states. Businesses need a kickstart now. Deadline extension, even by a few hours, will also ensure less crowds, as reservations will be spread out over a longer period of time. In fact, the neighbouring city of Gurgaon has seen no negative impact on COVID discipline maintenance following extension of timings. The beleaguered industry will get a chance to stand on its feet and most importantly employment per restaurant will increase as there will be a requirement for additional shifts,” says Zorawar Kalra, Founder, Massive Restaurants that owns brands like Farzi Café and Made In Punjab in NCR. Anurag Katriar, restaurateur and President, National Restaurant Association of India NRAI), says, “It is very critical to expand the operating hours to normal as soon as possible. We must also look at relaxing the 50% capacity cap gradually with perhaps some additional COVID-compliant protocols. If we continue to work with these restrictions, then we are essentially underutilising our asset significantly. With establishment costs remaining largely unchanged, this leads to losses which cannot be funded for long.” How do you chill during dinner with a clock ticking in your head?: DinersMadhvi, who works in an IT company, says, “When we went to a restaurant in Vasant Kunj (DLF Promenade) last week around 7.30pm, it took us over an hour to find a place to eat. There were queues in the food court, where people were waiting to occupy a table once it was empty. We finally found one table at a restaurant, and once the order was served, our server politely reminded us that they will shut at 10pm. We had to finish our meal in a hurry and leave. There was no time left for dessert, or to just roam around. Once it’s 8.30pm, the clock starts ticking in your mind.” Mohd Faizan, a software consultant, says, “You can’t go out for dinner if restaurants are shut by 10pm unless you’re an early diner. Now, I prefer ordering food rather than going out. It feels unnecessarily complicated. Rather than chilling with friends, it becomes more about reaching on time, figuring out which city has what curfew, etc.” Times ViewThe concerns of the industry are legitimate and pressing. The decision of the government to keep to the 10pm deadline is poorly thought out. The industry is in an extremely precarious situation financially. To not allow greater flexibility will now amount to presiding over the gradual collapse of the sector. Putting arbitrary timelines – for a sector where the bulk of activity and revenue has always been during the later hours – is irrational. The longer the hours, the more dispersed will be the footfall, minimising the chances of crowding and the spread of COVID-19. In a sector that generates so much employment and is struggling to pay/engage staff, allowing a longer period of operations will encourage more shifts, and thereby, the necessity for more staff to be provided gainful employment. The virus does not multiply faster at night and curtailing night hours specifically is a middle ground that achieves nothing, either for economic revival or for public health. A 10pm cut off may not save lives but will certainly damage livelihoods. Not only should the govt easen the timeline restrictions, it should also, retrospectively, ensure that no licence fees are charged from the venues in the period commencing from the date of the first lockdown till the date where all restrictions are finally lifted. As the industry is asking, legitimately – when they are being asked to pay all expenses and fees as if they were fully operational, why is the restriction only on the operating hours? Initiatives such as the waiver of the excise license fee for the first quarter of this financial year are welcome; they should be executed proactively and should be extended for the second quarter as well. Rationality should not be abandoned in the process of rule-making, even if the ostensible objective is bringing and keeping down the COVID numbers. — With inputs from Niharika Lal||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-10pm-deadline-is-tearing-the-restaurant-business-apart/articleshow/85349381.cms||Divya Kaushik
---||India||PM Modi calls for ‘saturation coverage’ of welfare scheme beneficiaries||NEW DELHI: Calling on the nation to re-dedicate itself to unfinished tasks, PM Modi on Sunday said there is a need to “hand-hold” sections that are lagging and set a goal of “saturation” or 100% coverage of beneficiaries of schemes such as bank accounts for the poor, health cover under Ayushman Bharat and Ujjwala. In his 8th I-Day address, the PM spoke of the Centre’s decision to implement OBC reservations in all-India quota in medical seats in the context of the need to ensure equity. “We need to provide hand-holding to the backward categories... along with the concern of fulfilling basic needs, reservation is being ensured for Dalits, backward classes, adivasis and poor from general category,” he said. “By formulating a law in Parliament, the right to make their own list of OBCs has been given to states.” Modi called for efforts to ensure amenities reach each household, referring to plans like “har ghar jal” that has delivered tap water to over 4.5 crore households. There comes a time in the development journey of every country when the country redefines itself afresh and pushes forward with new resolutions,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said as he promised that there will be no shortfall in political will to grasp the moment and achieve developmental goals, adding “sabka prayas (efforts of all)” to the slogan “Sab ka saath, sab ka vikas, sab ka vishwas”. At the start of his speech, he called for a round of applause for the Indian Olympic contingent, saying they represent the potential of India’s youth and a can-do spirit. He similarly praised Covid warriors, saying India owes them a big debt and, in a rebuttal of criticism of the vaccination programme, he said India was one of few countries to have its own shots. “Think what would have happened if we didn’t have our own vaccines,” he said. The PM said the goal of ‘amrit kaal’ in the next 25 years to the centenary of Independence is to ascend to new heights of prosperity, to create an India where modern infrastructure ensures villages and cities are not divided on the basis of facilities and government does not interfere needlessly in the lives of citizens. The eastern India, northeast region, J&K, Ladakh and the entire Himalayan region as well as the coastal belt will be crucial for the development of India in future, Modi said, indicating that development deficits in these regions are being addressed. Modi highlighted the abrogation of Article 370 along with the “peaceful” resolution of the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute as major achievements. “The spirit of the democracy is to ensure equal opportunity to everyone’s capabilities. The development is reflecting at ground level be it J&K. The delimitation commission in J&K has been constituted and preparations are on to hold the assembly polls soon.” He said Ladakh is also marching to realising exponential growth. He called for a collective approach for the “next generation infrastructure”, world class manufacturing, cutting-edge innovation and new-age technology. In the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, he said, “India’s manufacturers should understand that their each product is brand ambassador of India.” The Covid crisis has witnessed emergence of thousands of startups that are working successfully. Modi also spoke about the new education policy, which, he said, has been drafted to make it a tool to fight against poverty. “Sports is now mainstream education and no more an extracurricular activity.” The PM also pointed to the decision to enrol girls in Sainik Schools. The Prime Minister made a brief reference to terrorism and border disputes without naming any country, saying “India is battling both the challenges impeccably and responding to them with immense courage”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-calls-for-saturation-coverage-of-welfare-scheme-beneficiaries/articleshow/85356529.cms||---

The Quad, he said, has become an important grouping in a 21st century which is more multipolar. But while India’s interests converge with the US’ in the east, there are divergences in the west, particularly Afghanistan, the minister said. Jaishankar, however devoted a lot of attention to India’s relationships in the neighbourhood which have come under fire recently. “Before Prime Minister Modi went to Nepal, that country did not get a bilateral visit from our side for 17 years. Sri Lanka did not get one for 35 years. The last Indian Prime Minister before Narendra Modi who went to UAE was Indira Gandhi. If you don’t give attention to your neighbourhood, and your extended neighbourhood, you are not going to be seen as a serious player.” The difference is showing, he said. “Today, Nepal is importing electricity from India, there is a fuel pipeline which takes petroleum and diesel. Bangladesh is buying electricity from India and a lot of our pre-1965 links are getting restored. If you look at Maldives, we are very much part of their development plans. With Sri Lanka, a lot of the reconstruction after the conflict has had our involvement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-has-divergences-with-us-on-afghanistan-eam-sjaishankar/articleshow/85356796.cms||---

Making the announcement as India entered its 75th year of Independence, he said the schemes will spur the growth of Tier II cities and reduce the regional imbalance in the state. The government will focus on both mega and mini projects in district centres so that development will not be concentrated in Bengaluru alone. KSRTC may run 50 e-buses on 6 inter-city routesYou could soon travel in KSRTC electric buses from Bengaluru to Mysuru, Madikeri, Virajpet, Chikkamagaluru, Davanagere and Shivamogga. The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation identified these six inter-city routes to operate 50 AC electric buses under the second phase of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme. Officials said Hyderabad-based Olectra Greentech Limited (OGL) emerged the lowest bidder in KSRTC’s FAME-II tender. It will be a 12-year contract in which KSRTC will pay on a per km basis. Olectra reportedly quoted Rs 62/km, including electricity, in the tender and reduced it to Rs 55/km after negotiations with KSRTC officials. “The KSRTC board is expected to approve the tender at its next meeting. Once cleared, we will approach the department of heavy industries (DHI) to extend the FAME-II deadline, which was March 2021. We have already intimated them about the delays due to the pandemic. We will issue a work order to the firm after DHI’s nod,” said a senior KSRTC official. He said Olectra will take care of operations and maintenance. “The firm will also deploy a driver and set up charging stations at these locations. But we will deploy conductors. DHI is giving a subsidy of Rs 55 lakh per bus. But there are not enough manufacturers in the inter-city segment,” said an official. The AC bus can accommodate 43 passengers and run up to 250-300km on single charge. E-buses will be a relief for KSRTC, which is struggling due to soaring diesel prices. The corporation is getting diesel at Rs 88 per litre now. “The operational cost of a Volvo diesel bus is Rs 56 per km. With diesel prices increasing, it will be profitable to operate electric buses in the long run,” the official added. BMTC tender stuckBMTC is yet to finalise the tender to induct 300 non-AC electric buses sanctioned under phase II of FAME scheme. The utility had already lost Rs 80 crore subsidy for 80 e-buses under FAME-I. Sources said the deadline for FAME-II was March-end. However, BMTC has sought an extension. It has floated the fifth tender under FAME-II since the earlier ones evoked poor response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-announces11-schemes-tohelp-75k-youth/articleshow/85357033.cms||---

---||India||No good House debates, sorry state of affairs: CJI N V Ramana||NEW DELHI: In what could be a caustic reference to the government pushing through bills in Parliament without debate amid opposition-led bedlam and protests, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana said that “it is a sorry state of affairs” as enacting of laws without debate leaves ambiguity in legislations and leads to a lot of litigation. Speaking at the Independence Day function in Supreme Court, the CJI recalled the contribution of the legal community, led by lawyers -- Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Babu Rajendra Prasad -- to the freedom struggle and reminded advocates that the first Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and assemblies were filled with lawyers active in public life. “If you look at the debates which used to take place in the Houses those days, they used to be very wise and constructive. The Houses used to debate threadbare any legislation which they were making. I have seen debates which had taken place on the Industrial Disputes Act and some amendments. A member from Tamil Nadu, CPM leader Ramamoorthy, used to discuss elaborately what are the consequences if the amendments are made, how it will affect the working class. Same way different, different laws were discussed and deliberated,” he said. “Now (it is a) sorry state of affairs. We see a lot of gaps in legislation. There is a lot of ambiguity in making laws. There is no clarity in the laws. We do not know what purpose the laws are being made at, which is creating a lot of litigation, inconvenience to the public and government and loss to the government,” the CJI said, adding that aversion of intellectuals and lawyers to foray into public life and be members of legislatures has led to this nadir in the House proceedings. The CJI said elaborate debates in the Houses always brought clarity to the object and intent behind legislations or amendments to existing laws. “So the burden on the courts while interpreting or implementing the laws was less. We (the judges and public) had a clear picture of what the legislature thought and what they wanted to tell why they are enacting such a legislation,” he said. “This is what happens if intellectuals and professionals like lawyers are not there in the House. It is time for the lawyers and legal community to lead and participate actively in public life. Do not confine yourself to your profession, earning money and living comfortably. Please think over and we must participate in public life and do some good service and I hope and expect good days will come to the country and lawyers will contribute to nation building,” he said. He said India runs unique legal aid services where free legal advice is given at state expense to poor and needy. “We are in the 25th year of providing free legal aid to the poor and 75% of the country's population is covered by it. No other country has done it. Earlier there were problems about the quality of legal aid. Now we have sorted that out,” he said. Speaking on the occasion in presence of two SC judges -- Justices A M Khanwilkar and V Ramasubramanian, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “CJI is the Karta (head) of the legal community. Once he has spoken his mind, I cannot possibly add to what he has already said. I agree with what the CJI said.” SCBA president Vikas Singh and secretary Ardhendumauli Prasad and other office-bearers were present during the unfurling of national flag at the SC premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-good-house-debates-sorry-state-of-affairs-cji-n-v-ramana/articleshow/85357190.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||India plans to finish evacuation in 48 hours||NEW DELHI: As the Taliban reached Kabul on Sunday, India prepared to evacuate its staff and embassy personnel from Kabul in the next 48 hours. With US forces still in control of Kabul airport, Indian commercial flights are continuing but not for long. India plans to complete evacuating its nationals before the US completes its own withdrawal. By Sunday evening, President Ashraf Ghani and his top advisers had resigned and fled Kabul. Taliban fighters had, according to reports, taken up security positions in various parts of the city. Follow live updates on Afghanistan crisisThe speed of the Taliban takeover has been a surprise though the inevitability of the Taliban returning to power in Afghanistan after the US left was never in question. On Sunday night, reports came in that the US had evacuated its acting ambassador from Kabul, while other western embassies were also moving their staff close to the airport. Russia called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council. Since India is president of the Council this month, the meeting is likely to happen on Monday. However, Russia said they would not close their embassy in Kabul, saying the Taliban had given them security assurances. Pakistan and China are also expected to keep their missions running in the city. India is perceived as a particular target for the Taliban and therefore the government is unwilling to take chances. Given the fact that India is not a contiguous country, there is less concern in the government of a refugee influx into India. Many Afghans fleeing the Taliban are crossing over into countries like Tajikistan and Iran, and many making their way to Gulf countries and Europe. However, India may be willing to let in Hindu and Sikh minorities who may want to leave Afghanistan, according to the MEA spokesperson. “We have our contingency plans ready,” said official sources on a possible evacuation. Sources said that though Taliban leaders had apparently promised in Doha that they would not touch foreign diplomats and missions, India was unwilling to take chances. A temporary evacuation therefore is likely to happen. As the events of Sunday unfolded, it seemed as if the last 20 years of US control of Afghanistan never happened. In the past week, the Taliban have overrun cities and provinces with a systematic military strategy, closing in on Kabul, and leaving the Ghani government with few options. A “deal” apparently worked out in Turkey with the Taliban, may see Mulla Abdul Ghani Baradar as interim president. Ghani’s flight came a day after he said “remobilising the Afghan security and defence forces is our top priority,” in a televised address on Saturday. Independent journalist Bilal Sarwary tweeted, “Part of the agreement was that President Ghani will join the transition of power ceremony inside the palace. Instead, Ashraf Ghani and his senior aides left the country. Palace employees were told to leave. The palace was empty, two Afghans involved in direct negotiations tell me.” Meanwhile, former President Hamid Karzai, head of the reconciliation council, Dr Abdullah Abdullah, and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar formed a coordinating council. Karzai tweeted that the council “calls on the government security forces and the security forces of the Islamic Tehreek-e-Taliban to resolutely curb the chaos and incitement of irresponsible and unrelated individuals while maintaining restraint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-plans-to-finish-evacuation-in-48-hours/articleshow/85357227.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Despite the fall, weekly cases in the country have remained between 2.5 lakh and 3 lakh for the past six weeks. During this period, infections have spiked in some parts of the country with Kerala witnessing a major surge while the northeast has seen cases rise and fall. Minor spikes have been reported in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and more recently in Himachal Pradesh. Also, the pandemic has been stubbornly persistent in Maharashtra, where numbers have fallen sluggishly. Besides, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha continue to report 1,000-plus daily cases. India recorded 2,55,819 fresh cases in the week ended Sunday, the lowest weekly count since 1,55,912 infections were reported in March 8-14. That was 22 weeks ago, when the second wave of the pandemic was rising in the country. Weekly cases in the country had peaked on May 3-9, with infections swelling to over 27.4 lakh. Since the peak, the weekly count dropped below 3 lakh for the first time in July 5-11. Since then the numbers have plateaued somewhat, with the July 26-August 1 week registering a spike of 7.5%. Meanwhile, deaths from the virus continue to gradually decline. There were 3,334 deaths recorded in the current week, a 5.8% drop from the last week’s toll of 3,540. On Sunday, close to 33,500 fresh cases were recorded, the lowest daily count in six days. The tally was 36,135 on Friday and 36,135 on Thursday. Meanwhile, 421 deaths from the virus were recorded on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-weekly-covid-cases-drop-to-5-month-low-daily-tally-at-33-5k/articleshow/85357272.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||Chennai||Light at the end of the tunnel for Tamil Nadu hockey||CHENNAI: The neighbourhood kid trying to imitate M S Dhoni’s helicopter shot or doing a Cristiano Ronaldo-style celebration after scoring a goal is a common sight. But ask the same group of teenagers who Manpreet Singh or Rupinder Pal Singh is, they would most likely draw a blank. It’s been more than a week since Manpreet-led India won a bronze after 41 years in men’s hockey while the women fell agonisingly short. The nation has been basking in the glory that these players have brought, but in reality hockey is still a poor cousin of cricket, when it comes to popularity. The situation is starker in Tamil Nadu, more so because this was the first time that not a single player from the state was part of an Indian Olympic medal winning hockey team. The state that once boasted of top-notch talents such as V Baskaran, Krishnamurthy Perumal, Charles Cornelius, V J Philip, Ranganathan Francis among many others — is now not even a speck in the hockey horizon. The MCC Murugappa Gold Cup hockey tournament, which has lost its sheen over the past decade, was a crucial part of the Tamil Nadu hockey culture for 93 years. Some may argue that star goalie P R Sreejesh is a registered player with the Hockey Unit of Tamil Nadu (HUTN) and Rupinder Pal spent his early years representing the state, but those were professional compulsions of their jobs at the Indian Overseas Bank. While Sreejesh has returned to his home state Kerala, Rupinder represents Punjab. But then, it’s not all about faded glory. There is still a following for hockey in TN and those associated with the sport in the state insist that the Indian players’ Tokyo show has comes as a shot in the arm. The Olympic win has invigorated youngsters, says Anil Kumar, physical director at Agarwal Vidyalaya and Junior College, Chennai. "There has been a surge in the motivation levels among boys and girls who are part of our institution’s hockey teams. They are keen to follow in the footsteps of our national side. I have also been getting a lot of calls in the past few days from parents who want to enrol their children in the sport," he said. Agarwal Vidyalaya, St Paul’s HSS in Vepery and Nellai Nadar Matriculation HSS, Thiruvanmiyur, are among the schools that encourage students to take up hockey. A hockey league for schools, according to Anil, could go a long way in tapping talent. "There have been school tournaments earlier, but a league could be a game-changer. Children taking up hockey will look forward to matches where they take on other schools and it will help them develop a competitive spirit," said Anil. India’s performances in Tokyo have cracked open a window of fresh interest, N Jagannath, a Class X student who plays hockey in school, believes there is ample motivation for youngsters now to take up hockey. "A top-class performance by our teams in Tokyo got us all excited to play better. Many of my classmates have been asking me for details about hockey. Some of them want to play," he said. Sports shops, too, have been getting calls for hockey sticks. "There have been a lot of inquiries from customers regarding hockey sticks. We have witnessed a 25% jump in the sale of hockey sticks and that’s heartening as it’s a sport that our state has done so well," said Syed Akbar, who runs two sports goods shops in Chennai. Adam Sinclair, the last state player in the India team, believes there has to be a concerted effort to nurture talent at the grassroots. "Tamil Nadu has ample support from the state government through Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu hostels and the presence of a centre of excellence for hockey in Kovilpatti. Conducting more district-level tournaments and sending players for events outside the state will give them exposure," said Sinclair, who was part of the Indian team during the 2004 Athens Olympics. The Olympian feels stadiums such as Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium — which has astro-turf — should allow all children and players to practice free of cost for a day each week. "It will give youngsters the feel of an international stadium. I don’t think it will be too much of a cost to bear for the hockey body or for the state government. Measures such as these can go a long way," he said. Sinclair’s sports accessories shop has sold 300 hockey sticks in the past week. "From corporates going for bulk orders to parents wanting their children to take up the sport — hockey may see a revival in the state," he said. In the past few years only S Karthi from Ariyalur and Mareeswaran Sakthivel from Kovilpatti have made it to the junior India squad. But Baskaran, who led India to gold at the 1980 Moscow Games, is hopeful that things will improve. "It is sad to see none from our state in the senior side but we have to remain optimistic. For TN to produce national-level players, everyone has to work towards it — the association, schools, encouragement from parents and good scientific coaching," said Baskaran. HUTN general secretary M Renukalakshmi is keen on initiating new programmes and training coaches. "We have been roping in prominent coaches such as Shiv Jagdev of Canada, Olympian Baskaran, Jude Felix and C V R Kumar to help state coaches stay up to date," said Renuka, who believes each school must have at least 100 hockey sticks and encourage students to play, so that the newfound interest can turn into a passion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-for-tn-hockey/articleshow/85354536.cms||Prasad RS

The area has become an unofficial dumping yard due to poor maintenance by APIIC and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC), motorists allege. National Highway 16 (Eluru Road) and National Highway 65 (Bandar Road) are the two major roads passing through the city and every day, the roads connecting the highways witness heavy traffic flow. APCRDA had proposed to widen the Guntathippa drain road and make it a major connection road to ease traffic congestion. But the proposal was later shelved. A major portion of the road separated the Jawahar Auto Nagar IALA area with Kanuru panchayat and VMC limits. All the three local bodies ignored maintenance and as a result, huge potholes developed, leading to water stagnation. “We use this road as it reduces distance by 5 km to reach Patamata from Ramavarappadu. The road is in pathetic condition and my vehicle’s suspension got damaged due to the potholes. Officials have ignored road maintenance despite requests,” said M Raghava Rao, a private employee. Heaps of garbage are piling up on the road and now vehicle scrap too are dumped which makes it tough to travel, he added. Locals in Kanuru said burning of garbage was causing breathing problems and urged IALA and VMC to step in to remove garbage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/potholes-garbage-dumps-draw-motorists-ire/articleshow/85353429.cms||Venu Lanka

Following this, the corporation has decided to carry out its operations from the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in India. “GIC Re decided to place its Dubai branch into runoff because of non-renewal of licence by Dubai authority, non-compliance in solvency requirement, etc,” the company said in its filing. The company said that it has already informed the Indian regulator of its decision on July 6. The corporation’s board also approved the decision on July 7 and decided to continue the activities relating to the Dubai branch from GIFT City. “We have major plans for growing operations in GIFT City,” said CMD Devesh Srivastava. GIFT City is the only International Financial Services Centre in India, which is the financial services equivalent of special economic zones focusing on exports. Companies here function like offshore entities. Further, they conduct business that would otherwise be done offshore. The GIFT IFSC regulator had recently issued regulations permitting Indian and foreign reinsurers to set up offices there. GIC had set up its international operations in Dubai in 2007 and had been providing reinsurance to the African continent. GIC also has permanent offices in the UK, Malaysia and Russia. It also has three subsidiaries — GIC Re South Africa, GIC Re Corporate Member, London, and GIC Perestrakhovanie LLC, Moscow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gic-shuts-dubai-office-will-shift-to-gift-city/articleshow/85355935.cms||---

The incident happened on Saturday but came to light on Sunday. The deceased have been identified as S Nagamani (25) and T Gayatri (20). Locals said the duo had taken their cattle for grazing near the farm on the outskirts of the village. While attempting to drive the cattle away from the fields and the canal, the duo went deep inside the water body and drowned. After the women failed to return home, their families launched a search, and finally, found their bodies inside the canal. Locals said the duo did not know how to swim. On receiving information, police reached the spot and retrieved the bodies. A case has been registered and the bodies shifted to a government hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/two-women-drown-in-canal/articleshow/85353449.cms||---
---||Business||PE-VC funds in electric vehicle sector up 3x this year||CHENNAI: The Indian electric vehicle (EV) sector has caught the eye of local and global investors. The surge in interest comes on the back of supportive government policies, increasing awareness of the importance of sustainability, and rising petrol prices. The year 2021 has already recorded 11 investment deals worth $519 million in the sector compared to 13 investments of $165 million value in entire 2020, and 22 deals worth $490 million in 2019, according to data from Venture Intelligence (see graphic). The deals are across the value chain in electric mobility — from battery makers to energy storage to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The investment tally includes renewable energy companies Fourth Partner Energy and Fortum that also operate in the electric mobility space. Hero Electric raised around $30 million in the first part of its series-B round led by Gulf Islamic Investments (GII) and existing investor Oaks Asset Management to expand production capacity in July. Battery tech startup Log9 Materials raised around $8.5 million from various investors. Euler Motors, the maker of three-wheeler cargo EVs, raised around $7 million from various investors this year. Ola Electric’s $100-million debt from Bank of Baroda this year is the largest debt financing for the sector. Industry trackers said as EVs gain critical mass, there is more willingness among investors this year to bet on startups in this segment. Conventional automakers warming up to EVs has also improved investor appetite. Globally, the shift to electric mobility has picked up with growing concerns of climate change. However, unlike the West and China, where personal transportation is going electric, here two-wheelers along with three-wheelers and buses will likely write the India EV story, analysts said. Neeraj Mohan, head of EY-Parthenon India (EY’s strategic consulting arm), said that technological breakthroughs have brought down the cost of EVs to within reach of the mass market, and improved consumer sentiment. “India today probably is where Silicon Valley was five years ago in terms of investment opportunities and is catching up fast. As a result, the interest among global investors is high and this is just the beginning,” he said. As early movers such as Ather Energy, Magenta Power, Ampere and Okinawa report an uptick in sales, and with the buzz generated by Ola Electric’s vehicles, more private investment is expected to flow into the sector. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat are a few states that rolled out incentives to encourage adoption of EVs. India’s electric vehicle sales are set to grow at 26% in FY21-23, Fitch Solutions said in a recent note. Nakul Kukar, co-founder and CEO of fleet-electrification solutions provider Cell Propulsion (which raised $2 million this year), said global VCs and corporate venture arms have been relatively more active in the segment. Cell Propulsion is currently gearing up for its series-A fundraise and has received lots of inbound interest from major VC funds, he added. EV experience platform BLive, which promotes EV tourism and has a multi-brand online EV store, said it has a customer base in over 50 cities and is soon launching offline stores. “We plan to raise our series-A early next year, by when we shall have over 20 offline stores up and running. We are already in discussions with investors who put in funds consistently in the category,” BLive co-founder & CEO Samarth Kholkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe-vc-funds-in-electric-vehicle-sector-up-3x-this-year/articleshow/85355117.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The deceased were identified as Bandari Manasa (30), Sharmila (3) and Jyothi (2). Manasa killed her daughters by strangulating them with her dupatta and hanged herself with the same garment. According to police, Manasa married one Sravan Kumar about seven years ago. However, their marriage was going through a rough patch of late and the two would have frequent arguments. On Saturday night, they quarrelled with each other, after which Manasa took both her children into a room and locked them from the inside. Sravan Kumar told the police in his statement that he thought that she would sleep with the children by her side, but did not anticipate that she would take the extreme step. When she did not come out of the room, he tried calling to her and the children, but when there was no response, he broke open the door with the help of neighbours. They found Manasa hanging from a fan and both children dead on the bed. Police rushed to the spot and shifted the bodies for postmortem. A case has been booked under section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/woman-strangulates-daughters-hangs-self/articleshow/85353355.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy hoists national flag in Vijayawada, vows to keep up welfare agenda||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has asserted that the state government was making every possible effort to brighten the lives of people from all sections. He said that the government will spend every rupee with utmost responsibility towards its people. The chief minister hoisted the national flag at the Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium on the occasion of 75th Independence Day here on Sunday. Addressing the public, the chief minister reiterated that the state is forging ahead on all fronts. He explained that they worked for the welfare and uplift of all sections despite severe financial crisis in the last 26 months. “We have spared every thought and every minute and relentlessly worked to create an environment where the rights of every citizen are honoured,” said Jagan. He said that the plight of common man seen and the promises made during his 3,648-km-long padayatra have kept him alert since taking over the reins of the state, helping him fulfill the dreams of farmers, women and weaker sections. He said that they have set their focus on health and education sectors to improve basic life standards of the poor. He said that the government is working to realise the dream of children in getting Right to English Medium Education instead of mere Right to Education (RTE). The CM said decisions taken in the last 26 months have changed the course of the state’s journey, paving way for a better society. “We have spent Rs 83,000 crore on agriculture including providing nine-hours quality free power supply a day, Rs 13,500 every year under Rythu Bharosa, Rs 1,261 crore towards zero interest crop loans. We have spent Rs 33,000 crore on paddy procurement,” said Jagan. He said that they have cleared massive dues left by the TDP government with a smile. The CM also added that the aspirations of people have changed, from having a grandiose capital city to making every village and town a power centre in order to create wealth. He said that they have rolled out Rythu Bharosa Kendras, village secretariats, bulk milk chilling units, YSR clinics, CBSE schools right in the village to usher development right from village level. The chief minister said they have created 1.3 lakh permanent jobs in the very first year by establishing secretariats to provide about 500 services to people. The CM said that the government had granted 27% interim relief (IR) to its employees and he is aware of clearing certain pending demands of the employees. The CM said that they have created equal share for women, BCs and Dalits in all elected and nominated boards for the empowerment of weaker sections. “We have distributed 31 lakh house-sites and are going ahead with construction of pucca houses for all in next two years. This accounts for transfer of nearly Rs 2-3 lakh crore assets to the poor in the society as each house is going to cost Rs 5-15 lakh,” said the CM. Meanwhile in Vizag, Independence Day celebrations were organised at PSUs and other industries. Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) chairman K Ramamohana Rao said VPT handled a volume of 23.48 million tonnes from April to July 2021 as against 21.03 MT in the corresponding period of the previous year, registering 12 % growth. Waltair Divisional Railway manager Anup Kumar Satpathy shared the division’s performance in the past six months and said it has achieved 61.17 million tonnes of loading during 2020-21and 21.64 million tonnes this financial year, from April to July. The division has ferried more than 3.28 million passengers in 2020-21 and 1.92 million passengers from April to July this financial year. The Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) managing director and CEO Professor Dr G Y V Victor announced that the corporation is shortly going to finalise the acquisition of three new dredgers that will boost its operational capabilities. CMD (additional charge) of RINL-VSP, D K Mohanthy said the plant recorded its best first quarter performance since inception. In almost all units, production recorded the best July performance, said Mohanty. Patriotism and spiritual fervour marked the Independence day celebrations at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) administration building parade grounds here in Tirupati on Sunday. TTD executive officer (EO) Dr KS Jawahar Reddy hoisted the national flag after receiving the guard of honour. In his address, Jawahar Reddy urged the employees to rededicate themselves in the service of Lord Venkateswara and His devotees. The EO recalled the moments when the nation attained Independence, which he attributed to the selfless efforts of countless freedom fighters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-hoists-national-flag-in-vij-vows-to-keep-up-welfare-agenda/articleshow/85354080.cms||Samdani MN
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh targets setting up 33GW hydro power storage plant||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh energy department is planning to set up pumped hydro storage power projects in various districts with a total capacity of 33.24 gigawatt. The government has identified 1.45 lakh acres in Kadapa, Kurnool, Anantapur districts for these proposed renewable energy parks. The AP energy department celebrated the 75th Independence Day on Sunday. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said these pumped hydro storage power will improve the power supply position in the state. “These will enable the consumers to get quality power. It will also help promote industrialisation. Andhra Pradesh has also initiated go electric campaign to promote electric vehicles in the state. The non-conventional energy development corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP) has already established 109 charging stations. It will set up another 400 chargers across the state and along the national highways at every 25 kilometre distance,” said Srikant. Srikant added that the state has introduced the concept of cost effective power. “It has become a role model for other states by saving Rs 2,342 crore in 2019-20 and 2020-21. The Union ministry of power has also appreciated the AP power utilities for their sustained efforts to achieve savings and reduce burden on the discoms. The power utilities completed the agriculture feeder upgradation works with Rs 1,700 crore to supply free power during day time to more than 18 lakh agriculture pump sets. The power utilities have taken up special measures to reduce interruptions in power supply and provide quality power to consumers. As a result, the interruptions reduced to 1.77 lakh in 2020-21 from three lakh in 2019-20. Similarly, the average cost of service reduced to Rs 7.18 per unit in 2020-21 against Rs 7.23 in 2019-20,” said Srikant. Joint managing director, AP Transco, K Venkateswara Rao; director, grid and transmission, K Praveen Kumar; director, finance, K Muthupandian, Genco director (thermal) G Chandrasekhar Raju; director, finance, B Venkatesulu Reddy and other officials and employees of power utilities were present during the celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-targets-setting-up-33gw-hydro-power-storage-plants/articleshow/85353403.cms||---

Addressing the 75th Independence Day parade at ENC here on Sunday, Ajendra Bahadur Singh urged everyone to prepare earnestly for the mega-events to enhance the prestige of the Indian Navy. This is the second time the ENC will be hosting the Presidential Fleet Review. Former President APJ Abdul Kalam had reviewed the naval fleet in 2006 in Vizag city. Every President, as Supreme Commander of the armed forces, reviews the naval fleet once in his or her term, in keeping with naval traditions. Ships from all commands and some merchant ships belonging to the Shipping Corporation of India participate in the review. Meanwhile, a ceremonial parade in observance of the 75th Independence Day, comprising platoons of naval personnel, was held at ENC. Speaking on the occasion, the Commander-in-Chief said despite the unprecedented challenges brought about by Covid-19, personnel of the ENC ensured combat readiness for operations at sea, underwater, or in air, including maintenance of operational assets and support functions ashore. He highlighted the command’s contribution in the fight against Covid-19 by assisting in setting up Covid Care Centres, medical aid to veterans, training and operationalisation of oxygen plants, provision of mobile oxygen plants, ferrying of oxygen and other relief equipment from overseas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/enc-to-host-presidential-fleet-review-and-milan-in-2022/articleshow/85353360.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Lepakshi temple frontrunner to get Unesco heritage tag||AMARAVATI: Lepakshi, the famous Veerabhadra Swamy temple complex, built in the Vijayanagara style of architecture is the frontrunner for the Unesco heritage tag from Andhra Pradesh. The main attraction at Lepakshi is the Basavanna, the largest monolithic sculpture of a bull (Nandi) carved in a single stone of granite decked with jewellery known for its art and beauty, in front of Veerabhadra temple. It was Lepakshi’s Nandi that stole the show at 2021 Republic Day parade in New Delhi as the AP tableau was designed with a Lepakshi theme. However, the lack of enthusiasm from the state government has taken the sheen out of Lepakshi’s race to get international recognition. Archaeological Society of India (ASI) had moved a proposal to get international recognition for the Lepakshi temple and it reached the tentative list of world heritage structures. ASI subsequently asked the state government to clear the encroachments in and around the Lepakshi temple in order to meet the criteria to get the world heritage structure label. However, the failure of the successive governments in removing the encroachments and make the historical area a clean heritage structure left the temple behind in the race. It is the magic pillar at Lepakshi that attracts tourists to this place. It is considered an engineering marvel. Curious tourists are seen pushing a piece of paper slowly under the pillar which then comes out from the other side. This famed ‘Hanging Pillar’ of Lepakshi temple does not rest on the ground. “Although the fabulous structure of the 16th century has about 70 pillars, the hanging pillar is best known as an engineering marvel of medieval India’s temple architects. The temple is built on a low, rocky hill called Kurmasailam (Tortoise hill) in Telugu, after the shape of the hill,” said noted archaeologist and Sthapati, Dr Emani Sivanagireddy. The temple houses a life size idol of Lord Veerabhadra. “Beautiful paintings are seen on the walls of the Veerabhadra and Ramalingeswara temples. The frescoes show impressive attention to detail with colours strikingly contrasted, black line work against an orange-red background with some green, white, black and shades of ochre-gold and brown mostly applied to a stucco surface specially treated with lime,” said historian Gopireddy Srinivasa Reddy of Nandyal. He explained that the oldest inscription found at Lepakshi dates to 1493 and describes donations offered by Saluva King Narasimha to Papa Naseswara temple. The inscription of 1531-37 has details of donations of King Achyutharayalu, Virupanna and Viranna to the temple. Some bronze inscriptions of 1538-42 show that Achyutharayalu donated villages and monies for festivals following the request of Virupanna. The focus on major temples and structures seems to have faded with the Tallikota war of 1565 and demise of Achyutharayalu. “The state government should initiate measures to protect the historical structure and get heritage structure recognition for Lepakshi,” said Intach member SVS Lakshminarayana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lepakshi-temple-frontrunner-to-get-unesco-heritage-tag/articleshow/85353368.cms||Samdani MN

---||Goa||National team doors remain open, with less foreigners, more India players will emerge this season: Igor Stimac||Panaji: Igor Stimac is now into his third year as coach of the national football team. A large part of the first two years were washed away due to Covid-19. With just two wins from 15 matches, the numbers have not been encouraging. But the Croatian coach explains why there’s hope for a better future. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with TOI. Were you confident of getting an extension? I need to be honest and say yes. If you consider what we were planning in the beginning, the difficulties we faced throughout the last two years and in the end, achieving what was in front of us, I expected to get an extension. We had great communication (with AIFF and technical committee) throughout the two years. Even before I started work, we were discussing about long-term targets. That’s why I joined hands with AIFF. We never spoke of short-term goals. Indian football needs huge changes. We are working hard. We are on the right track. That’s why I am happy that the trust is alive. Two wins, six draws and seven defeats since you took charge of the team. Are you confident this record can change soon? When someone says this way, it sounds bad. There’s a huge difference with the teams that India played friendly games (in the past). We played friendlies (with stronger teams) while trying to complete the list of players who will perform in the World Cup qualifiers. We could not choose to play lower-ranked teams and have 15 wins. Where would that take us? That’s not how football works. You have handed international debuts to 20 players in two years. Have you now settled on the core of this Indian team? Yes, absolutely. India is no longer a team that is dependent on one player, if he is injured. I have on my list 36-40 players. For each position, we have three candidates, for some even four. But who remains available is difficult to say. It depends on the performances in their respective clubs and opponents we are facing. I am counting on the actual form, quality of preparations they are having at the clubs and the situation which the pandemic is dictating. I am not saying this list is decisive one. In the new season, there will be new faces. The new ISL season will see reduction in foreign players from five to four. Will that help? We can have more India players emerging this season. I'll be happy to see new players and give them a chance. Our aim with the national team is to prepare a stronger team which will compete in future (World Cup) qualifiers in a better way, with more quality. Will India continue to play stronger opponents in friendlies, or do you have a different thinking now? The first phase of our plan is over. We now need to choose teams which will be similar quality with the teams we will face in the third round (of Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers). In our first phase, we used every opportunity to play better teams. We were never going to choose easier teams. We wanted our players to grow. We were taking risks. It's not easy to get results in such friendly games. But we took that risk without fear, very confident that we will develop through these game and defeats. So what next for the national team? We need to develop our game in the final third of the pitch. We need to develop our game in creating chances and scoring goals, and to do so, we need to choose teams with similar qualities as us. That's the phase we are looking forward now. India has been found wanting in the attacking third. It’s an area that needs improvement and something that the technical committee also pointed out. What measures need to be taken? We have two systems that we use when we play. The system dictates the players’ positioning and movement. That’s something we have to find a way to explain to the players what are their obligations. It’s again about time. You need time to execute so the players really understand the position they are occupying. You cannot do that overnight. Many under-23 players have already played at the senior level. Will that be to India’s advantage in the AFC qualifiers? That was part of our plan. We always believed that giving opportunities to our youngsters at the right stage will be a greater benefit for Indian football in the future. These are boys we trust. We believe in their future. Giving them opportunities when they are 18-19 to play and feel senior team football will make them better. In four or five years, they will be ready to compete in a proper way for the World Cup qualifiers. That’s the biggest gain. I know we have suffered. I said before there will be lots of suffering, but we had to take a risk. We were criticised. Of course, the criticism was coming from a realistic point of view because expectations were higher than results in the end. But for that period, we had to suffer, if we want a much better team in three or four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/national-team-doors-remain-open-with-less-foreigners-more-india-players-will-emerge-this-season-igor-stimac/articleshow/85384060.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The officer, alone and without police protection, met the villagers at the entrance of the village and apologised for hurting the sentiments of the village due to the misunderstanding over Friday’s attempt to hoist the national flag on the tiny island. There was a misunderstanding a few days back and we got agitated when strangers came to our village. In our agitation we sometimes react in the wrong way.“I am here to give my life for you. The first person, if anything happens to St Jacinto island, I will be the first person to stand for you,” said the officer while speaking to villagers at the entrance of the village. The Indian Navy extended an olive branch to the locals and convinced them to participate in a joint flag hoisting ceremony on Saturday afternoon. The villagers in turn, invited naval personnel for their Independence Day celebrations on Sunday morning. The islanders continued their annual tradition of unfurling the National Flag after the Mass to celebrate the feast of assumption of Mary. Naval personnel joined the villagers in the church square, showing solidarity with the village. “There was a misunderstanding a few days back and we got agitated when strangers came to our village. In our agitation we sometimes react in the wrong way. We misunderstood when we saw the pick-axe and shovel in their (naval personnel) hands,” said Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president for Goa Jose Philip D’Souza. D’Souza, a former revenue minister, said that every citizen has a right and duty to hoist the National Flag. “There are some ministers, the chief minister too, who tried to create a divide,” said D’Souza, after the flag was unfurled. Expecting trouble, the government had sent a police force to the island’s church square but the event was largely peaceful, though villagers remain upset after being branded anti-national by the state government. “I have requested the Navy to go ahead with their original plan and have assured full cooperation from Goa Police. These attempts of anti-India activities shall be dealt with an iron fist,” Sawant had said on Friday. Sawant made the statement after D’Souza and a few villagers claimed that the Navy’s attempt to hoist the flag was a ruse to “capture land on the island”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/united-we-stand-navy-personnel-join-st-jacinto-locals-for-i-day-flag-hoisting/articleshow/85356236.cms||Newton Sequeira

The archival exhibition, titled Freedom Struggle in Delhi, has been organised by the Delhi government’s general administration department in collaboration with the department of Delhi Archives on the occasion of 75 years of India’s Independence under the Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. “The exhibition showcases the vibrant history of the city and the great fight put up by our freedom fighters for an independent India. The path to peace and non-violence enshrined by Mahatma Gandhi will continue to be a great learning for all of us for years on,” Sisodia added. In a statement, the Delhi government said that the exhibition showcases the events of India’s freedom struggle in the city starting from the first war of Independence in 1857 to the day the country attained freedom in 1947. The exhibition also showcases the works of freedom fighters, especially Mahatma Gandhi’s struggle for peace and non-violence. The role of women, such as Satyawati, Parvati Devi Didwania, Aruna Asaf Ali, Ved Kumari, Brij rani, Memo Bai and others, who widely participated in the picketing of shops and launched an agitation against the sale of foreign goods will also play a big part in the display.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-opens-exhibition-on-delhis-role-in-freedom-fight/articleshow/85353344.cms||---

Mumbai on Saturday saw a bumper turnout as more than 2 lakh people got vaccinated at public and private centres. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said 1,15,000 vaccine doses had come from the state. Vaccination will be held through walk-ins at community level centres on Monday. Private centres on Sunday vaccinated nearly 21,000 people. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said Saturday’s feat of over 2 lakh vaccinations was because centres were told to vaccinate as many as possible. A day after the state record of vaccinating more than 9 lakh people in a day, less than 2 lakh got jabs on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-gets-1l-doses-to-help-speed-up-drive/articleshow/85356118.cms||---

Apart from this, he said, Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs) will also be set up at each taluka. Delivering the Independence Day address at the South Goa district collectorate, Margao, Kavlekar said that the agriculture department was in the process of setting up 500 organic farming clusters across the state with a view to providing a boost to organic farming. This, he said, will result in 10,000 ha of land under organic cultivation with nearly 13,000 farmers engaged in organic farming. “Agriculture is turning out to be a major industry in the state and becoming the backbone of the economy. It’s the endeavour of the government to provide a boost to agriculture alongside mining, tourism and other industries for the growth of the state’s economy. Government’s every effort to attract people towards agriculture is showing good results,” the agriculture minister said. The agriculture department provided 3,200kg of various vegetable seeds at the door steps of farmers during the pandemic, which, Kavlekar said, resulted in 36% growth in the production of vegetables in the state. He added that 40 tonnes of various types of fruits have been produced this year in the state. “The state horticulture corporation, while procuring vegetables and fruits from the farmers, is taking care to see that the farmers will get at least 50% profit on the cost of production,” Kavlekar said. Stating that the agriculture department had also increased the support price of the various crops, he said that the government was taking every step “keeping in mind that farmers’ income will be doubled in the coming days”. Referring to the government’s initiative of providing subsidy at source to farmers for procuring seeds, plantation, fertilizers, machines, pumps, etc, he said that no farmer will be deprived of the various agricultural schemes, subsidies and facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/processing-units-for-khola-chilli-barcem-jaggery-soon-dy-cm/articleshow/85356189.cms||---

When asked if police have recovered the clothes of the deceased, Saxena said that multiple teams have been constituted to trace the clothes and that even CCTV footage is being examined. Reacting to the father’s statement on Saturday that police confused him, the SP North said that they have recorded the father’s statement twice — at the Mapusa and Calangute police stations. But he did not suspect any foul play in the case and took the body in possession and performed the final rites, Saxena said. “In his both statements, the father said that his daughter was under depression because of Covid,” Saxena told TOI. When police questioned the conductor of the bus, he said she looked disturbed, the North Goa SP added.  Saxena said that they are in continuous touch with the family to clear their apprehension. The father of the girl on Saturday had said that he was disturbed after seeing his daughter’s body. “Despite being in this disturbed condition, police personnel began confusing me all the more by questioning me if she had gone for a picnic and whether she knew swimming,” he had said. “Police have told the media that I have not given my daughter a mobile phone. They also told the media that we used to have fights. She was my loving daughter,” he had said. Saxena said that as per the post mortem report there is no report of violence or sexual injuries and doctors have concluded that the death is due to drowning. The PI Calangute is conducting the inquest, he said. Meanwhile, neighbours and family members have decided to sit at Azad Maidan on Monday to seek justice for the girl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-mystery-shrouds-teens-death-sp-says-cops-did-best-investigation/articleshow/85356494.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Singer Jagjit Kaur, whose voice lent melancholy to Khayyam tunes, dead||MUMBAI: Singer Jagjit Kaur, who sang the dulcet ‘Tum apna ranjo gham’ (film: Shagoon, 1964), and the haunting ‘Dekh lo aaj humko jee bharke’ (Bazaar, 1982), passed away on Sunday at her Juhu residence following "age-related illness". Kaur, who often assisted her composer-husband Khayyam, was 89. Kaur sang for films such as ‘Shola aur Shabnam’, ‘Kabhi Kabhie’, ‘Chambal Ki Kasam’, ‘Noorie’, ‘Thodi Si Bewafai’, ‘Razia Sultan’ and ‘Lori’. “There was a special melancholy in her voice,” said filmmaker Muzaffar Ali. Kaur sang ‘Kahe ko bhyaahe bides’, written by medieval poet-scholar Amir Khusro and used in Umrao Jaan (1980). Ali had heard the song from mirasans, traditional singers who perform during occasions of joy or mourning. In Sagar Sarhadi’s Bazaar, the song Dekh lo aaj humko jee bharke, plays in the backdrop of a girl bidding farewell to her lover when she is married off to a Gulf-returned man twice her age. The innate pathos in her voice makes the scene unforgettable and underlines how she was underutilized by the film industry. Kaur started her film career in music director Ghulam Mohammed’s ‘Dil-e-Nadaan’ (1953), ‘Mohabbat ki dhun’, alongside Talat Mahmood and Sudha Malhotra. Most of her songs were composed by Khayyam, including her signature track, ‘Tum apna ranjo gham.’ However, writing an article for the book, Khayyam: the Man, his Music, edited by Vishwas Nerurkar and Bishwanath Chatterjee, Kaur revealed she recorded the number only because the scheduled singer had not turned up. “Sahir Ludhianvi asked Khayyam saab to get it done in my voice…Sahir-ji had not written the full lyrics…When I reached the studio he penned down the lyrics of the stanza, ‘Main dekhoon to sahee duniya tumhe kaise sataati hai’…the song was okayed in the fourth take,” she wrote. In the article she spells her name as, “Jagjeet” and some of her film credits, Shagoon for instance, spell it the same way. Kaur was born on November 1, 1931, in Kangmai, a village close to Hoshiarpur in Punjab. She was the daughter of a musically-inclined school principal who encouraged her to sing. She sang regularly at Lahore radio station (before Partition) and for Jalandhar and Delhi stations thereafter. She recalled being asked to perform in a show to be attended for a few minutes by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Her first song, ‘Jogee uthar pahadon aaya’, had an “astounding” effect on Nehru. “He said to the organisers: “I like her voice. Please arrange for her to sing all her songs before anybody else comes on.” Due to this request, the organisers were thrown into a flurry of activity. Then I sang all my songs in a row. Panditji thus remained in his seat for an hour and a half. My joy knew no bounds on that day and in that state of ecstasy I forgot to meet Panditji personally. Nevertheless I shall always cherish those golden moments of my life,” Kaur wrote. Kaur’s inter-faith marriage to Khayyam was a remarkable story. “She seemed to inspire his compositions. They complemented each other musically,” says Ali. In his ‘Anjuman’ (1986), the couple sang a memorable duet, ‘Kab yaad mein tera saath nahi’ (lyrics: Faiz Ahmed Faiz). In 2016, they set up the Khayyam Jagjit Kaur KPG Charitable Trust to support budding artists and technicians. Khayyam passed away in 2019. Their son, Pradeep Khayyam, who acted in films such as Jaan-e-Wafa and assisted his father, died in 2012.

---||India||Three sub-lineages of Delta-plus in circulation in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Three sub-lineages of the Delta-plus variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus are currently in circulation in the state, which, experts said, called for more epidemiological analysis to understand their impact on ongoing viral transmission. The recent genome sequencing reports have shown the presence of 66 cases of Delta-plus in the state, which include sub-lineages Ay.1, Ay.2 and Ay.3. The highly transmissible Delta variant mutated into Delta-plus, formed due to Delta acquiring an additional mutation called K417N in the spike protein, which enhances attachment of the virus to infected cells. Now, scientists have found 13 more sub-lineages of the Delta-plus stain starting from Ay.1, Ay.2, Ay.3 all the way till 13. In Maharashtra, the first three sub-lineages have been found so far. Initial data had found Delta-plus resistant towards monoclonal antibodies cocktail treatments. There is little evidence till now to show it is as transmissible as Delta, which continues to be the dominant variant. In Mumbai, 11 cases, including the death of a 63-year-old from eastern suburb, have been reported. From the deceased’s family, six contacts tested positive for Covid-19. Among them, two were also found positive for Delta-plus. One of the contacts was a family member and another a househelp, who was a slum resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/three-sub-lineages-of-delta-plus-in-circulation-in-maharashtra/articleshow/85357291.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The announcement came against the backdrop of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) announcement to provide free electricity up to 300 units. The CM said that once this kicks in, 60% of the families in the state wouldn’t have to pay water bills if they utilised water properly. On average, a person uses 100 litres a day, he said. “Water is essential to human life,” Sawant said. “It is our responsibility to provide water to each and every household. Today (Sunday), I am announcing that from September 1, the state government will provide free water up to 16,000 liters per month, and this would benefit the people of Goa.” In his address after unfurling the tricolour in Panaji on Independence Day, Sawant said that Goa tops the national list in administering the Covid vaccine. “Goa is the first state in the country to have administered the first dose of the vaccine to 90% of the eligible population, and in a few days, Goa will become the first state to cover 100% of the eligible population with the first dose.” Speaking on Mhadei, Sawant said that the state would form a Mhadei cell to coordinate with the advocate general over the various cases. “The Goa government will not compromise on Mhadei and the state will fight till it gets its water,” Sawant said. On mining, Sawant said that around Rs 100 crore of revenue has been generated through major and minor minerals. He also said that the state government would soon restart mining activities through the mining corporation. Sawant said that the state is going to implement a new education policy in the state. The chief minister said that to pass NET and SET exams, the state has started an NET monitoring program to give guidance to aspirants. He also said that the state government has set up a language laboratory to promote the local languages under the new education policy. He added that an Act has been passed to make Goa an educational hub. The CM also said that restoration of sand dunes has started, and that the animal health and welfare policy has been thrown open for public suggestions. He added that the state government has paid Rs 33 crore to over 6,000 dairy farmers to make Goa self-sufficient in milk production.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Test run for differently abled shows road blocks on widened footpaths||MUMBAI: What happens when a footpath is widened for universal accessibility? Fifteen differently abled individuals, who carried out a test run of one such stretch in Vile Parle on Sunday, found illegally parked motorcycles and a hawker with his wares on the footpath. Participants of the test run, who included wheelchair-bound sportspersons, unanimously said planning accessible spaces in the city will work only if they are kept encroachment-free. The 400-metre stretch of Vile Parle’s Nehru Road was transformed with wide footpaths, tactile indicators and kerb ramps after an activist with cerebral palsy, Jasmina Khanna, doggedly pursued BMC. Khanna, who organised Sunday’s test run with her physiotherapist, Sanket Khadilkar, said they wanted to find out if differently abled individuals faced problems using the stretch and how things could be improved for future projects. “When it comes to accessible streets, Delhi trumps Mumbai. Footpaths leading up to bus-stops and Metro stations are disabled friendly as are most public buses. I travel independently in public transport for sporting events in Delhi. But in Mumbai, I cannot dream of doing the same,” said Rahul Ramugade, captain of Mumbai Wheelchair Cricket Team and a test run participant. Ramugade spotted delivery bikes belonging to a pizza outlet parked all over the footpath and had a talk with the store manager. “They had encroached upon the footpath despite having alternative parking arrangements. While staff removed the bikes in our presence, we cannot be sure if they will stay off the footpath permanently,” he said. A customer at a paan stall had parked his motorcycle on the footpath and a hawker was selling his wares. “The hawker was partially blind and when we explained the purpose of our test run, he immediately agreed to move away,” said another participant. Besides those on wheelchairs, there were amputees and individuals using crutches at the test run. Rupa Raman, who wheeled her brother, Ranjan, on the accessible footpath, said the civic authorities need to fix gaps in manhole covers as wheelchairs were getting stuck in them. Ranjan, a musician, lives with cerebral palsy and has to travel in his own vehicle as buses and trains are inaccessible. Another participant suggested that a bumpy portion of road before getting onto the footpath should also be fixed to prevent injury to wheelchair-bound users. “When you design a disabled-friendly stretch, it automatically works for every other road user, whether senior citizens, pregnant women or someone with an injury. Through the test run, we also wanted to sensitise the community about accessibility needs of the disabled. Some pedestrians gathered to watch the participants and we spoke to them to create awareness on the issue,” said Khadilkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-test-run-for-differently-abled-shows-road-blocks-on-widened-footpaths/articleshow/85356129.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Delhi||Delhi: Calls for hoisting saffron flags in JNU, two arrested||NEW DELHI: Two people were arrested on Sunday for uploading a video on social media threatening to enter Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Independence Day to hoist saffron flags. The action was taken by police following complaints from students and office bearers of JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU). The arrested men, Vikas Sehrawat (30) and Raja Kumar (19), are both residents of Uttam Nagar. A case has been lodged under IPC sections 153A (offence of promoting disharmony/enmity or feeling of hatred) 295A (deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion), 505 (intent to incite any class or community) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation). While Sehrawat was the one who spoke in the video, Kumar’s phone was used to upload it on social media. Earlier, Sehrawat was arrested on August 11 for allegedly abusing and posting an objectionable video about a woman politician on social media. DCP (Southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said, “Vasant Kunj North police station got a call from a JNU student saying a video had been uploaded on the Facebook page of Ek Mahakal Youth Brigade saying they would attack the university on Sunday. A student was also contacted on his mobile phone. After receiving the call, cops were deployed in plainclothes at all JNU gates. The caller also came to the police station to file the complaint. JNUSU office bearers also gave a similar complaint alleging that the video promoted disharmony and enmity between religions, using inflammatory language and openly issuing threats of physical hurt.” The complaint signed by four JNUSU officer bearers mentioned, “This is to bring to your urgent attention that on August 9 and 14, a Facebook page by the name of Mahakal Youth Brigade uploaded videos making an open call to gather and march into the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus on August 15 from 12pm to 6pm to hoist saffron flags. In both the videos, there was an open call for violence on students, along with hate speech towards Muslims. Considering the fact that the JNU campus has been a witness to similar acts of planned and coordinated violence in the past, with the events of January 5, 2020 serving as a reminder, it is appealed that all necessary precautions be taken to ensure that harmony and peace is upheld.” JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh also submitted a complaint to the university chief security officer asking them to take action to prevent any untoward incident. The university administration did not comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/calls-for-hoisting-saffron-flags-in-jnu-two-arrested/articleshow/85353400.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 15-year-old girl among 2 dead in Dwarka hotel fire, six injured||NEW DELHI: Two people died, while at least six others were injured after a fire broke out at an Oyo facility in Dwarka on Sunday morning. The deceased included a teenage girl and her male friend. An FIR has been filed and a probe is being conducted by police and the fire department to ascertain the cause of the fire, apart from the negligence angle. The hotel was prosecuted by police thrice in the past. The fire broke out between 7am and 7.30am. Officials said they received a call around 7.40am and eight fire tenders were sent to douse the blaze. “The fire took place at Krishna Hotel in Sector 8, Dwarka, which was run by Oyo. The caller stated that fire had broken out and people were trapped inside. No hotel staff was present when we reached there,” said an officer. The firemen found two bodies on the stairs of the ground floor, indicating that they may have died while trying to run outside. A man named Lokesh (21), who was staying in one of the rooms, said that around midnight there was a short circuit and lights came after half an hour. “When I woke up around 7am, I found a lot of smoke inside the hotel and fire on the ground floor and reception,” he added. Witnesses said panic and chaos lasted for 15-20 minutes with people screaming for help and rushing out of the building. DCP Santosh Meena said an FIR was lodged for causing death due to negligence, mischief with fire and act endangering others’ lives under IPC sections 285, 337, 338 and 304A. Late in the evening, cops arrested the manager, Harshit Saini (21) and one Nisha Jha (22), who claimed to be the owner of the Oyo facility. Police have invoked IPC section of culpable homicide in the FIR. An initial probe revealed that the hotel was being run by Sunil Gupta, who had sub-let it to a man named Harshit from Dashrathpuri. “The owners of the building are Sidharth and Karuna from Ranchi, Jharkhand. The hotel was prosecuted under Section 28/112 of Delhi Police Act for violations twice and a case under IPC Section 188 was also registered earlier,” said a senior police officer. While forensics and crime team collected samples and evidence, the bodies of the deceased were shifted to a hospital and the injured were sent for treatment. The deceased girl was about 15-year-old and used to reside in Sultanpuri. When police contacted her family, her elder sister said she had gone to meet her male friend, Deepak, on Saturday. Deepak, who also died in the fire, lived in Bagdola in Sector 8, Dwarka. He worked at a club in Janakpuri as a DJ. Two of the injured have been identified as Harsh Singla and Bhagyak Mehra. The statements of the injured and other occupants of the hotel have been recorded. The staff has been questioned and hotel registers sought for analysis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/15-year-old-girl-among-two-dead-in-dwarka-hotel-fire-six-injured/articleshow/85353392.cms||---

He was also cautioned to desist from trying to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence.The court also observed that the footage shown by the police against the accused was unclear, since “the words uttered by the applicant/accused, are not audible.” Delhi Police thereafter assured the court to make proper arrangements to play the video with clear audio on the next date of hearing.Judge Kumar also pointed out that a court had already granted bail to advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, the main organiser of the event where the alleged sloganeering had taken place.A video showing anti-Muslim slogans being raised during a protest at Jantar Mantar was widely circulated on the social media, following which Delhi Police filed a case against unknown persons under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and under sections of the DDMA Act pertaining to violation of Covid-19 norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pre-arrest-bail-for-prime-suspect-in-jantar-mantar-sloganeering-case/articleshow/85353410.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two held for duping people of crores with railway jobs||NEW DELHI: The Economic Offences Wing has arrested two conmen who allegedly duped over three dozen people of crores of rupees on pretext of getting them jobs in Indian Railways. Police said that one accused posed as a facilitator of jobs and the other as a senior IAS officer and member of Railway Board. The two handed out forged appointment and training letters to targets and even organised a three-month-long training session at Dehradun before going underground with their money. The accused have been identified as Brij Kishore (34) and Sachin Kumar (36). “Kishore is a BTech graduate from Jaipur and worked for a private company earlier. These days he was involved in several fraudulent activities, involving transfers, postings, recruitments, etc, in various organisations and government departments,” said RK Singh, additional CP, EOW. Kumar, cops said, pursued his diploma in computer operations and was running an institute at Dehradun, Uttarakhand in the name of NRT India where students were coached for different types of entrance exams. The targets would be issues letters to get training at the institute for jobs in Indian Railways. Initial investigation shows that the accused persons took Rs 2.44 crore from 40 aspirants. Along with the fake appointment-cum-training letters and three months’ fake training, fake medical exams were also conducted. When the victims reached DRM office, Tata Nagar, Jamshedpur — the ‘reporting office’, as they were told — they finally got to know that the Railway Board had never released any such vacancies. Police received a complaint from one such target and registered an FIR. The victims had no idea about the whereabouts of the alleged persons except their phone numbers. They used to meet them in Paharganj Hotels and near the Railway Bhawan, Delhi. In this case, most of the victims belong to very poor families from the villages around Agra, Hathras and Patna. Technical surveillance confirmed the locations of the accused men. An EOW team acted swiftly and apprehended the two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-held-for-duping-people-of-crores-with-railway-jobs/articleshow/85353420.cms||---

In a reply to questions by four UDF MLAs, including IUML leader M K Muneer, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in the assembly on August 4 that the presence of sleeper cells of IS has not come to government’s notice and that the police chief has not given any such report to the government. On his last day in office, former state police chief Loknath Behera had said in an interview to television channels that the state is a recruiting ground for IS as the people in the state are educated and IS requires engineers and doctors. He further said the police were able to deal with it systematically after which it has come down. Though the chief minister has gone into a complete denial, the state police have been working on making inroads into the alleged recruitment of youth from the state to the terror organization. The threat to the state from IS was confirmed earlier by the government when it had asked all district collectors to take precautionary action anticipating acts of sabotage by the cells of the terror group in the state. In a confidential letter dated December 16, 2017 from the then additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) Subrata Biswas, the collectors were instructed to take necessary precautionary and safety measures to counter the terror organisation’s plans for sabotage in the state. The letter was issued on the basis of a confidential intelligence report and quoted the report to the government that said “an audio message was sent by Abdul Rasheed (who had joined IS from Kasaragod) to his group members, the contents of which are highly communally incriminating in nature. He exhorted ISIS followers to assassinate/destroy non-Muslims by choosing any methods, including poisoning drinking water, plying trucks over gathering of people like Thrissur Pooram, Kumbh Mela, by mass shooting, sabotage of trains etc”. The letter further quoted the report that in the backdrop of the exhortation, the IS module of the state is likely to plan an acts of sabotage in the state. The audio clip, allegedly leaked from a secret chat group of IS sympathisers, had instigated the followers to undertake a lone-wolf style attack against “Kafirs”. Interestingly, when the matter came out in the public after Thrissur railway police issued a communique to railway authorities asking to ensure fool-proof precautions, the state police had downplayed the matter saying that the public should not fall prey to such messages and should desist from spreading them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-unaware-of-presence-of-is-module-in-state-cm/articleshow/85353422.cms||KP Saikiran

Kozhikode special branch ACP Haridasan PC recorded the statement of two complainants on Sunday. The women’s commission had forwarded the complaint of 10 Haritha leaders to Kozhikode district police chief asking for a report. The commission will take further steps in the matter after getting the police report. Meanwhile, IUML leaders are trying hard to settle the matter by having the girls withdraw the complaint. The complainants have been told by the party that steps will be taken on their complaint within the organization. However, it is learnt that the Haritha leaders have stood firm in their demand that action should be taken first against the MSF leaders involved. Muslim Youth League state president Panakkad Syed Munavvarali Shihab Thangal had intervened to resolve the issue on Saturday. In a complaint to the commission, 10 women leaders of Haritha had said that attempts were being made to portray girl students in Haritha with sexual overtones and break them down mentally and personally while also levelling false allegations. The student leaders approached the commission seeking action against MSF leaders after their earlier complaint to IUML leadership failed to elicit action. The complaint said that during MSF’s state committee meeting in Kozhikode on June 22, MSF state president P K Navas asked the representatives of Haritha to explain their opinion about an organizational matter with the remark, ‘even a prostitute would have a justification, you tell that’. The student leaders added that MSF Malappuram district secretary V Abdul Wahab had used derogatory words to describe them while talking over the phone. They alleged that he used to threaten saying that if they don’t yield before them within the organization or in the public realm, then they will have to stop their public work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/womens-panel-seeks-report-from-police/articleshow/85353437.cms||---

Fernandes said that the work would be carried out in phases, and the existing CCP office would remain functional while work begins on other parts. Also, the CCP will begin a stray cattle drive on Monday, and will take the stray cattle to gaushalas in Valpoi and Bicholim, Fernandes said. “We want to keep our city and beaches clean. There is cow dung everywhere and whatever landscaping we have done at Miramar beach has been destroyed,” he said, adding that the corporation has got its vehicle to transport the cattle back from Dhyan foundation. The corporation hasn’t succeeded in rehabilitating the beggars and homeless on the streets of the capital. “They are refusing to go to homes. Although food and shelter will be provided to them, they want to continue begging. It’s a very organised gang,” Fernandes said. The corporation will also begin auctioning the abandoned vehicles at Campal ground. “We are doing an inventory of two- and four-wheelers before they are auctioned. At the same time, we will conduct a fresh survey of unclaimed and abandoned vehicles occupying space in the capital city,” he said. The corporation has already identified around 40 such vehicles in and around the city and will intimate the owners before seizing them, he said. “We will request owners to take them away to a safer place away from the streets,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-may-spend-rs-9-8cr-on-new-bldg-for-ccp/articleshow/85356473.cms||---
---||Delhi||Too late to save Kerala kid, lakhs collected may help other patients in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A spirited effort at crowdfunding to try and save the life of a toddler in Kerala may now end up helping patients suffering from rare diseases in the capital. Unfortunately, the toddler died while suffering from one of the rarest disorders — Spinal Muscular Atrophy — which needed a single dose of a wonder drug that costs Rs 18 crore. Delhi High Court had recently asked the Centre to examine if nearly Rs 64 crore collected through the crowdfunding campaign, during the attempt to save the young boy can be diverted to the government’s fund for rare diseases treatment where it can be used to treat similar patients. The court’s poser to the government came on a plea filed by a 41-year-old woman who is also suffering from a rare disease that requires prolonged and expensive treatment, which she cannot afford. As per the plea, the woman needs financial assistance from the central government for her medical treatment and care since she suffers from Von-Hippel Landaou Syndromeis, an extremely rare disease. In her plea, she apprised the court about the proceedings before Kerala High Court and how the local public representatives there ensured that the sum of approximately Rs 64 crore could be crowd sourced. Since the Kerala patient could not be saved, these funds are lying unutilised, the plea added, urging Delhi high court to direct the Centre to take necessary steps towards utilising the funds for her treatment and other similarly-placed patients under the National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021, which provides for a special fund. Taking note of her plight, the high court issued notice to the Centre granting two weeks’ time to file their reply. It also asked a senior law officer to appear on the next date of hearing. Earlier, on the court’s directions, the woman had to appear before a committee of doctors from AIIMS to decide her future course of treatment but since she was suffering from Covid-19 and also from pancreatic cancer, she could not appear before the panel. However, all her medical records were submitted before the committee and she would try and appear whenever called next. AIIMS had then assured HC that a fresh date for meeting of the expert committee will be communicated to her as and when decided. In another connected development, the Centre had earlier this month informed Delhi high court that as directed, an online crowdfunding platform — rarediseases.nhp.gov.in — had been set up to collect funds for patients suffering from rare diseases. The government’s stand had come on petitions filed by patients seeking funds for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/too-late-to-save-kerala-kid-lakhs-collected-may-help-other-patients/articleshow/85353426.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Mumbai||Afghan students send SOS to Indian institutes||MUMBAI: Afghan students enrolled at Indian institutes are seeking permission to return to campus, with many institutes willing to allow them in. As Afghanistan faces mass exodus of its citizens because of the Taliban takeover, worried students have contacted institutes to expedite paperwork for visas. On Saturday, in a social media post, IIT-Bombay director Subhasis Chaudhuri said, “A few Afghan students enrolled in the masters programme were participating in online classes from home. But due to the rapidly deteriorating condition in their homeland, they wanted to move out of their country and join campus hostels. Although we have approved their request to come to the campus as a special case, we are not sure how late it is for them to pursue their dreams…” Eleven Afghan students are enrolled in the masters programme at the institute, and two are already on the campus. “Since these students are sponsored by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), their Mumbai office is working closely with the Indian embassy in Kabul to issue visas,” said an IIT-B official. Dean (alumni and international relations at IIT-Delhi), Naveen Garg, said they have been getting similar requests from students. "The institute has made a provision for these students to return to the campus. But a lot depends on bureaucratic hurdles they may face now. For instance, a student wrote to us, saying he could not get his visa processed due to long queues at the embassy office,” said Garg. Of the 17 Afghan students, none is on the campus right now, and three have indicated that they would be coming soon, said the official. The administration at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi, is also looking into the requests made by Afghan students. A government official said one will have to wait and watch the situation developing in Afghanistan. Many students come to India to pursue higher studies under the ICCR's scholarship programmes. An IIT professor said, “Even if these students manage to get their visas, we do not know if flights will be allowed."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-afghan-students-send-sos-to-indian-institutes/articleshow/85356206.cms||Yogita Rao

He also said that they would hold a morcha in Aldona on Monday demanding justice. On Sunday, he visited the Calangute police station to inquire about the progress in the case. He also said that if police investigate based on the information provided by him, they would get some leads. “Sunday is the fourth day of the incident. Till date, police have not made a breakthrough in the case,” he said. Today (Sunday) they started the investigation, and I am confident that they will nab the culprit. If not today (Sunday), I am sure police will get a breakthrough in the case on Monday,” he said. The father said that his second daughter shared all the information in the deceased woman’s phone, including messages and phone numbers, with police. “I am confident that something will come out,” he said. He also said that such incidents should not take place in the state. “We dropped our daughter at the bus stop, and then they found her dead,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/father-visits-police-station-says-hes-hopeful-about-breakthrough/articleshow/85356512.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 17 months on, citizens get a ticket to board local trains||MUMBAI: Sunday’s reopening of local trains and malls, and relaxation in timings for restaurants, gyms, spas and salons brought welcome cheer to a city starved of travel, dining and shopping options during the pandemic. The resumption of train services for fully vaccinated citizens brought freedom to working citizens who were waiting to board local trains for17 months. “I work at Sarvodaya shop in Ghatkopar and stay in Mumbra. Today I was able to travel by train which is the fastest mode of transport, cheap and comfortable. Besides, I can catch a train anytime early morning or late night now. This is a great gift on I-Day,” said Mohammed Iqbal, an employee. The railways has announced 173 extra services— 99 on WR and 74 on CR—from Monday. Restaurants reported a hearty 60% increase in business with several dine-in reservations for Sunday evening, and many more inquiries. This despite the fact that many Mumbaikars had headed out of town during the extended weekend. Malls welcomed few visitors, though, largely owing to the state’s mandate that all visitors must be fully vaccinated. Their associations have demanded that those who have taken a single dose be allowed to enter. I-Day brings freedom of movement on lifeline; 173 more services start todayIt was freedom at last for many Mumbaikars who were waiting to board local trains for long. On Sunday, which was also celebrated as 75th Independence Day, the railways allowed commuters with double vaccines (and 15 days thereafter) to board local trains. It also announced 173 additional services, 99 on Western Railway and 74 on Central Railway—from Monday to cater to the rush. The number of monthly season passes issued on both CR and WR based on offline vaccination/online Universal pass crossed the 1-lakh markon Sunday; it touched 1.3 lakh. The rush of passengers on day 1 of suburban trains reopening for the general public picked up gradually by afternoon after a lukewarm response in the morning. From shop workers, mall employees to those working in private firms and restaurants, there was sense of freedom to take the train. Some even put up messages on social media that ‘it was a great day for freedom’. An office-goer who works on Sundays, said barring the occasional megablocks, train travel was always smooth journey during pre-pandemic times. “It is only after Covid-19 struck that I have been thinking twice before booking an expensive Uber ride or planning to take the BEST bus where waiting time is longer at stops,” said Girish Sawant, who travels from Santacruz to Lower Parel. The commuter rush is expected to increase on Monday, the first working day for private firms, and furthermore on Tuesday when government staff, who have holiday on Monday (Parsi New Year), join in. A section of commuters complained that the railways should also issue daily tickets. V K Srinivas, who was at waiting at the counter at Dadar station, said: “I need to go to a hospital in Vile Parle for a checkup for 2-3 days for which I will not require a pass. They should issue tickets instead of giving only monthly pass.” Girijaprasad Dubey, a senior citizen, had the same grievance. “I had planned to meet my relatives in Diva. I wanted a ticket for Rs 20 but ended up getting a monthly pass for Rs 215. I may not travel for more than 2-3 days in the next one month and this seems to be expensive travel for me. Why can’t the railways issue daily tickets ? With extra services starting Monday, WR will run a total 1,300 services, up from 1,201; and CR 1,686, up from 1,612. In pre-Covid times, WR ran 1,367 services and CR 1,774. Presently, WR and CR cumulatively carry 28 lakh passengers. Before the lockdown, 80 lakh passengers travelled on locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-day-brings-freedom-of-movement-on-lifeline-173-more-services-start-today/articleshow/85356220.cms||Somit Sen

Karur district collector Dr T Prbahushankar selected Chinnadharapuram panchayat for the honour for its efforts to shun untouchability in Vengadapuram hamlet in the panchayat. “We want to make our village free from caste system. In Venkgadapuram, we practice equality among the people of all communities,” village president Selvi Ravikumar told ToI. She said that basic amenities such as drinking water, sanitation and other facilities were provided to more than 800 dalits on a priority basis. The hamlet had a total population of 1,700 of all communities including dalits.  “We have improved their standard of living by giving them equal opportunities. The presence of dalits is made compulsory in all the decision making processes regarding the development of the village. Such practices keep our village free from visible untouchability,” she said, adding that the village was given Rs 2 lakh by the district administration. “I wanted to show their contributions to society in order to encourage them and motivate others. Even though there is a scheme for awarding the village for not practising untouchability, honouring them during the Independence Day would underline the importance,” the collector said adding that he also honoured sanitation workers, night watchman and a few other staff who are often missed to be appreciated. Pallapaylayam village in Thanthoni block in Karur was honoured for keeping the village free from child marriages. District social welfare officer (DSWO), Karur, C Umaiyal said that there were no incidents of child marriage in the village for the past three years. “It was made possible because of our regular interaction with the people of the village. Since we are connected to our people, they would inform us in case of anyone attempting to force their children into wedlock,” said the village president Sangeetha Govindaraj. Young farmer T Praveenkumar from Punchaithottakurichi was honoured for cultivating Red Rose in a polyhouse with the help of the agriculture department. Entrepreneur P Karvendhan, 30, was among the five first generation entrepreneurs honoured by the collector. Private firm SICGILSOL Gases private limited at Pudhukudi in Thanjavur, which ensured uninterrupted medical oxygen supply to the hospitals during the second wave of Covid-19, was also honoured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karur-honours-villages-for-junking-social-evils/articleshow/85354728.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Kochi||Kerala: Weather stations to come up in landslide-prone areas in Idukki||IDUKKI: To avoid Pettimudy-like tragedies, University of Kerala is establishing Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) in landslide-susceptible areas of Idukki district. According to officials, as many as eight AWS will be set up at Devikulam, Udumbanchola, Peermade and Thodupuzha taluks to measure real time rain data. The project is being carried out in partnership with another university and the works for setting up the weather stations have already been initiated. The university experts will measure the real time rain data for the next one year and then map the landslide prone areas in the district. “Measuring real time rain data in susceptible areas will be helpful to mark those zones and issue an early warning which will go a long way in preventing Pettimudy-like landslides in future,” said Sajinkumar K S, assistant professor, department of geology at University of Kerala. "The study will be conducted with the approval of the government. After conducting the study, we will hand over the weather stations to the Kerala Disaster Management Authority. A mobile app will be developed for the study, which is likely to extend for a two-year period," said Sajinkumar. A major landslide on August 6 last year at Pettimudy near Rajamalai in Idukki had claimed 70 lives. According to officials, on that day, the region had received an unprecedented 610mm rainfall, the highest ever single-day downpour recorded anywhere in the state as per data from the Kannan Devan Hills Plantation’s rain gauge centre in Pettimudy. "It was probably for the first time in the history of the area that a 61.2cm rainfall was received in a single day," said officials. However, state disaster management authority (SDMA) officials had questioned the claim, pointing out that IMD weather station in Munnar recorded only 226mm on that day, adding that when a region receives over 200mm rain within a day it is considered as extremely heavy rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/weather-stations-to-come-up-in-landslide-prone-areas/articleshow/85353467.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The business idea, which offers waste management solution by recycling the cloth waste generated from tailor shops and wholesale textile units into household items like curtains and carpets, was awarded a cash prize of Rs 1 lakh by the state government. Re-Tailors (recycling tailors) is a business model pitched by Shrinidhi Umanathan, a final year M.Com student of Cauvery College for Women in Trichy. The objective is to collect cloth scrap from tailor shops and wholesale textile units, clean them and then conceptualize ideas to design curtains, carpets, pillow covers and doormats. The shops pay Rs 10 for every 500 kg of cloth waste handed over to the startup. The end products are sold through e-commerce platforms . “If we are not collecting the cloth scrap, the waste would burden the civic body. The tailor outlets equally benefit since we offer a solution to get rid of their mounting waste,” Umanathan said. The startup employs at least 50 freelancers including women and 18 persons with disabilities (PwD) equipped with sewing machines . The freelancers are provided with the cloth scrap and design pattern to stitch the end product. “Faculties at our in-house incubation centre had mentored the plan. The recognition that has come after several levels of scrutiny will encourage other students to take up entrepreneurship,” Dr V Sujatha, principal of Cauvery College for Women said. The prize money awarded for the top 10 submissions across the state will have to be utilized solely for business development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-students-startup-bags-innovator-award/articleshow/85354750.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Admins of 462 housing societies under lens for major financial lapses||MUMBAI: In a move to check corruption in housing societies in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the state cooperatives commissioner in Pune has directed his Konkan region joint registrar to conduct a thorough inquiry of 462 administrators whose temporary appointment to various societies in the absence of elections or management committees has stretched for a long time. The commissioner says there is information that during the tenure of these administrators some societies took major financial decisions, such as redevelopment through new builders. TOI was the first to report about such deals early last month. In a letter to his subordinates, cooperatives commissioner Anil Kawde said he wants the senior officials in the department to investigate the ex gratia that administrators have been receiving from the societies, the amount disbursed by them to their subordinates in the society office, the crucial decisions they have taken such as redevelopment or building revamp in the absence of management committees, the letters or documents they have written with regard to such decisions, and irregularities or corruption in all financial dealings that they might be responsible for during their tenures. To conduct an in-depth investigation, a committee of core officers is to be appointed and a report should be submitted within 15 days, said the commissioner in his letter, a copy of which is with TOI. TOI was the first to report about the redevelopment and other deals early last month, following which many politicians, such as senior BJP leader and MLA Ashish Shelar, and society federations demanded a probe. Shelar demanded that a special investigation team (SIT) be formed to review the decisions of the administrators. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the TOI story had revealed that 42 registrars across MMR had appointed administrators to around 500 cooperative housing societies in the region. According to Shelar, over Rs 2,000 crore worth of redevelopment was at stake as there was a move underway to grab the common Mumbaikar’s right in collusion with real estate developers. Kawde, while talking to TOI, said a review on the report will be taken next week, based on which the line of action would be decided. According to him, his move was an attempt to ensure that only management committees or general bodies of societies take crucial decisions such as redevelopment as there were no such statutory powers with administrators, whose appointments are temporary. Society associations such as MahaSewa had demanded an immediate stay on redevelopment proposals undertaken without the consent of the AGM or an elected managing committee. Jeby Patel of the All India CHS Welfare Association said FIRs and prosecution should be launched against those administrators who have acted in contravention of society laws to favour real estate developers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/admins-of-462-hsg-socs-under-lens-for-major-financial-lapses/articleshow/85356656.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Sources said restaurants and food joints saw an almost 60% rise in business with several dine-in reservations for Sunday evening, and many more inquiries, with closing hour redefined as 10pm. This despite the fact that several Mumbaikars have headed out of town during the extended weekend. Monday is the Parsi new year holiday. With the earlier 4pm deadline, restaurants were witnessing only 15-20% patrons. Since Independence Day is a dry day, bars, cafes and pubs are expected to draw in customers only from Monday, sources added. Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India senior vice-president Pradeep Shetty said that restaurants in Mumbai received very good response on Sunday, but hotels and bars could not pick up given the dry day and long weekend haul. Indian Hotel & Restaurant Association president Shivanand Shetty said: “Since morning, restaurants have been registering a good number of customers; the mood has been upbeat. Customers have been cooperating with the staff in following all SOPs. Had it not been an extended weekend with people travelling outstation, we would have witnessed more numbers.” Meanwhile, MTDC officials said all their resorts at hill stations and beaches were 100% full as they received bookings from Mumbai, other parts of Maharashtra as well as other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dining-out-in-restaurants-is-back-with-60-rise-in-patrons/articleshow/85356239.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Tamil and English alphabets, science diagrams were painted with the help of two professional artists. Kuvalukudi panchayat union primary school teachers have placed a demand with the Shine Treechy NGO to paint the walls of classrooms with images to improve the school’s reputation. Establishment of new private schools in the locality were said to have dented the enrolment. A total of 30 volunteers including students from Bishop Heber college’s NSS programme painted the two classrooms of the panchayat school at a cost of Rs 15,000, sponsored by Ritz property developers. Various paintings including the national animal, national bird, diagrams of body parts, Thirukkural couplets and road safety signals were drawn in the classroom walls and school’s compound walls. “The teachers felt that colourful classrooms will encourage the parents in the village to enrol their wards. We mobilised the materials while volunteers came forward to improve the government school’s infrastructure soon after hearing about the proposal,” said B Vignesh, a member of the NGO. While the artists had marked the boundaries of the paintings and graffiti, the college students completed colouring within a few hours. Native tree saplings were also planted in the panchayat school campus by the youths to mark independence day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/youngsters-celebrate-i-day-by-painting-walls-of-govt-school/articleshow/85354808.cms||---
---||Trichy||Vaccination drive runs out of steam in Trichy city||TRICHY: With hundreds of unused vials of anti-Covid-19 vaccines being returned from vaccination centres across Trichy city recently, questions are being raised about the plummeting interest in vaccination and the need for new strategies to augment coverage. Sources said 587 of the 885 vials allotted were returned on Sunday. This at a time when only an estimated 48% of the eligible population has been vaccinated in the city. A total of 12 centres administered Covishield on Sunday with each allotted 35-50 vials. At the end of the day, each centre returned about 70% of them. Of the total 585 allotted, only 209 were utilised. At the five designated centres to administer Covaxin shots, as many as 211 of the 300 vials allotted were returned. While Coimbatore and Madurai are witnessing a surge in vaccination interest, Trichy which reported good patronage in the initial days is now witnessing a slowdown. Coimbatore is reportedly utilising 90% of the vials allotted. From vaccinating 300-500 people on average per camp a day, the recent daily vaccination average in Trichy city has dipped to 200. “As our venue was deserted, we approached the nearby residents inviting them. However, they did not seem to be interested. Some of them were asking for the vaccine we do not have,” a medical officer said requesting anonymity. Medical officers argue that 5%-10% of those vaccinated in the city could be non-residents, thus indicating that the unvaccinated population is still significant. Despite the fall in patronage for vaccination drives in the past week or so, the strategy has not changed much. Except for identifying new camp locations, the civic body is yet to pursue a dynamic approach to overcome hesitancy and lapses. “We are looking at alternatives such as establishing a permanent vaccination centre also where people can walk in and take the shot. Awareness has to be raised, we will also look at promoting the vaccination venues,” an official with Trichy corporation added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vax-drive-runs-out-of-steam-in-trichy-city/articleshow/85354786.cms||Deepak Karthik

While riders without helments were intercepted and penalised for their violations, the residents opined that similar enforcement is lagging as far as the one-way violation is concerned. Thennur RoB descending towards Marakkadai-Vellamandi road intersection was cited as the most violated one-way stretch. While vehicles were supposed to take only the upward movement in the RoB, even cars and load vehicles are violating this restriction. Since the RoB is accessed by government and private buses heading towards the Main guard gate, the one-way violation very frequently chokes the entire traffic. “Even during peak hours, people bypass the caution board saying that the road is one-way. Enforcement has to be regularised, we rarely notice police team penalising the vehicles for one-way violation,” said V Karthik, a resident of Alwarthope. A few other one-ways in the city including McDonalds road stretch in Cantonment and Oyamari road near Chennai bypass are witnessing such violations. Though traffic police personnel are stationed nearby, violators ride through the wrong way. West Boulevard road, another one-way arterial road is witnessing vehicular movement in both directions. The one-way on Amma Mandapam road near Srirangam Rajagopuram also sees similar violations. When contacted, traffic police personnel in Trichy city said crackdown on violations will be intensified in the aforesaid localities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/one-way-violations-causing-frequent-snarls-in-trichy-city/articleshow/85354791.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Malls reopen but full vax norm lowers footfalls||MUMBAI: Malls reopened for business on Sunday, but few visitors were visible despite the Independence Day holiday as the state government rules allow entry only for fully vaccinated visitors. Mall managers have sought a relaxation in norms to permit single dose guests to enter. A spokesperson for the Shopping Centres Association of India said, “We thank the Maharashtra government for allowing malls to restart...However...Considering that the percentage of fully vaccinated people in Mumbai is only 18%, footfalls will continue to be very low till such time this restriction is relaxed. On the first say we saw just 10-15% pre-Covid footfalls.” Visitor numbers issued by individual malls corroborated this fact. Sachin Dhanawade, COO, retail and real estate, of Growel's 1O1 Mall in Kandivli, said, “Due to the condition that mall visitors should be fully vaccinated, footfalls were barely 5% of the usual that we usually witness on August 15 (pre-pandemic). The footfalls would have been higher at 20%-25% of the pre-Covid Independence Day had partially vaccinated customers been allowed to enter.” Like elsewhere, here too, customers who are not fully vaccinated had to be turned away. Dhanawade said: “We hope that the government will soon relax the rules to allow mall entry for citizens who have taken even a single dose. Malls should be allowed to operate at par with other shops and markets. Malls are controlled spaces and in fact have the ability to follow safety and hygiene protocol more efficiently than markets.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malls-reopen-but-full-vax-norm-lowers-footfalls/articleshow/85356252.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

It all started in 2018 when about 165 residents of Misty Mountain residential association approached the then Dindigul district collector, Dr T G Vinay, and sought his help to evict encroachments on the land adjoining their residences. The encroachers were evicted and the revenue land brought under the panchayat with Misty Mount Trust given the responsibility of developing it. Three years down the lane, the four-acre land, which the public can access between 9am to 5pm, has a flourishing garden with a variety of flowers, an audio-visual ecological room for children, a library, mini forest and beehives to propagate pollination. Trust members contribute towards the maintenance, which works out to about Rs 40,000 a month. ``All our plants are grown organically and we allow cattle owners to graze their cattle on our sprawling lawns. We receive the cow dung in return on barter basis,’’ said trust chairman Ram Shankar . He says their park is rich in herbs, including brahmi, sweet flag, thyme, rosemary and basil, and the nursery offers plants at a very nominal cost to visitors. They encourage rural children to visit the park and learn about ecology. The mission is to create a holistic ecosystem for native children and tourists to respect and nurture nature and wildlife. The park uses ecological landscape to reduce water consumption for maintenance while enhancing wildlife and human values.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/kodaikanal-village-park-a-model-of-sustainable-living/articleshow/85354814.cms||---

Doubling work between Madurai and Theni as part of the 90 kms Madurai–Bodinayakkanur section is over. Theni-Bodinayakkanur section will be completed by December. As part of doubling the Madurai–Tuticorin/Tirunelveli section, completion of Thulukkapatti – Kovilpatti section is targeted for December while the Madurai – Thirumangalam section is expected to be over by February. “On completion of these sections, the entire stretch of Madurai – Tirunelveli will have a seamless electrified double line,” he said. About electrification projects, he said the Tiruchchirappalli – Karaikudi and Manamadurai – Ramanathapuram sections are targeted for September. Work on the Karaikudi – Manamadurai – Virudhunagar section is expected to be over by January. The Ramanathapuram – Rameswaram and Kollam – Punalur sections are targeted for March. The other electrification projects in the region to be completed in the next financial year are Dindigul – Pollachi and Tirunelveli – Tiruchendur sections by June, Sengottai – Tirunelveli by December 2022 and Virudhunagar – Tenkasi by March 2023, the DRM added. Ananth said faster freight trains have result in more loading of goods. “The division is focusing on the average speed of goods trains and has been maintaining it above 50 kmph,” he said. Madurai division has transported 7.3 lakh tonnes of freight from April to July, 25.84% more than the corresponding figures in 2020. The DRM said that Covid-related challenges have brought passenger revenue under pressure. The division’s overall earnings from April to July was Rs 179.44 crore against Rs 58.83 crore for the same period last year. It includes Rs 86.36 crore through passenger traffic and Rs 80.49 crore through goods traffic. The division performed well in revenue through scrap disposal (Rs 14.37 crore), sundry earnings (Rs 32.85 crore).

Over 35% of the work on the greenfield airport is complete, he added. The total cost of the project has gone up to Rs 2,615 crore due to court matters and the Covid-19 pandemic, Sawant said. “The Union government has notified a 6.5km highway to connect the Mopa airport to NH66, and the tender has already been issued. The state government will lay the foundation stone for the road soon,” he said. In 2018, the centre had given an in-principle approval for the construction of an 8km-long highway from Dhargalim to Varconda. A new skills development centre, built by GMR Goa International Airport Limited (GGIAL), will be operational from October and enrollment for the centre will start from September. GMR Airports Ltd, through its subsidiary GGIAL, is constructing the greenfield airport at the Mopa plateau in Pernem taluka. The first phase of the airport is supposed to be ready by March 2022. As per the concession agreement, GGIAL will have the right to operate the business for 40 years, extendable by another 20 years. The airport project will be completed in four phases. Construction of the second phase will commence only after 80% of the passenger traffic is handled. Meanwhile, Sawant said that to improve the network and voice connectivity, the state government has granted permission to install 146 towers in the state. The chief minister said that the state government will start the swachh bharat mission gramin in Goa from Sunday. Sawant urged the people of the state to work together to make the state self-sufficient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/modi-will-inaugurate-mopa-airport-next-i-day-sawant/articleshow/85356273.cms||---
---||Delhi||Under Covid shadow, Independence Day celebration at Red Fort has Olympians in limelight||NEW DELHI: For a second year in a row, Covid-19 protocols were in place at the Independence Day celebrations at Red Fort, but that did little to dampen the spirits of those in attendance. The customary cheer from the schoolchildren sitting in the forecourt overlooking the ramparts was missing yet again: the space was occupied by NCC cadets and the participants in the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, instead. The Olympic medal winners and their coaches, meanwhile, were the special guests, seated on one side of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he delivered a nearly one-and-a-half-hour-long speech, describing his vision for India in the coming years. There was a six-feet gap between each seat on the lawns. A sanitising kit, a face shield and a hand towel placed underneath were symptomatic of the times. At the entrance, each invitee was asked to sanitise their hands and to keep their face masks on. With the 32 Olympic medal winners occupying the seats up on the ramparts, several VVIPs were, instead, provided a separate enclosure on the lawns. In the forecourt, around 500 NCC cadets and nearly 240 Olympians took the seats, while a special block on the south comprised “Corona warriors”. The fort was decked up even more than usual to mark the 75th Independence Day. While the I-Day theme is generally depicted by schoolchildren sitting directly in front of the Prime Minister, this year, the number 75 was etched on the walls of Red Fort itself. The steel containers placed in front of the fort for security had mural paintings on the inside, depicting India’s glorious past. For the first time, the celebrations also saw the use of Indian Air Force helicopters, with two Mi 17 1V choppers showering flower petals on the invitees in an “Amrut” formation, taking many by surprise. Many stood up to shoot videos or take selfies as petals rained upon the fort. PM Modi, dressed in a traditional white kurta, a blue half-jacket and a white and red stole, adorned a saffron turban with red patterns and a long trail. He first paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat, before his cavalcade entered through the Lahori Gate entrance at 7.18pm. There was a round of applause from the crowd as the PM proceeded to the saluting base. There, he was given a general salute by the Inter-Services and Delhi Police Guard. Modi then inspected the Guard of Honour. He entered the ramparts of Red Fort, where he was greeted by defence minister Rajnath Singh, minister of state Ajay Bhatt, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs. At 7.30 pm, the Prime Minister hoisted the national flag, as a Navy band consisting of 16 men played the national anthem, while a 21-gun salute occurred simultaneously. This was followed by the showering of flower petals from the helicopters. At 7.33 pm, the PM began an 87-minute extempore speech, ending it at 9 pm with chants of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and “Vande Mataram” as the crowd erupted again. The national anthem was then sung by the NCC cadets, as balloons in tricolour were released in the air. As has become tradition of sorts, the PM, before his departure, decided to enter the area where schoolchildren would generally sit in white clothes. He walked past the Olympians and the 500 NCC cadets seated further behind, waving to them and exchanging greetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/under-covid-shadow-i-day-celebration-at-red-fort-has-olympians-in-limelight/articleshow/85354987.cms||---

He appealed to people to take the pledge to make the state and country free of Covid-19. Thackeray also warned that there would not be any option but to impose a lockdown if the state saw a spike in daily cases. Thackeray was speaking at the flag-hoisting ceremony held at Mantralaya to commemorate Independence Day. Thackeray in the context of Covid-19 said that the state is experiencing pre-independence conditions due to Covid since the last one and half years. “We are easing restrictions now. Covid has still not been eliminated. So we need to be more alert as it has resurfaced in a few countries. Considering the limited availability of medical oxygen, if the number of Covid cases see a rise, then we will have no other option but to reimpose the lockdown,” he said. He added that to avoid a lockdown, people must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The state has allowed the general public to board local trains from Sunday, Independence Day, provided they have completed 14 days after getting fully vaccinated. Also, some restrictions have been eased and malls, restaurants, gyms, salons and spas have been allowed to reopen. Thackeray also appealed to people to take the pledge to make the state and country Covid-free and celebrate the next Independence Day in a free atmosphere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lockdown-will-be-back-if-covid-rises-says-cm/articleshow/85356266.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Virudhunagar to enhance green cover through ‘Pasumai Vidiyal’||MADURAI: Virudhunagar district administration under the guidance of collector J Meganatha Reddy has taken up ‘Pasumai Vidiyal’, a mass tree planting project to convert poromboke plots into green patches. The collector inaugurated the pilot programme of the project on Saturday at Keela Kancharankulam village of Settikulam panchayat in Kariapatti panchayat union in the district. Around 20 hectares of barren land was identified by the District Rural Development Agency to plant trees under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation scheme. He said that mass tree planting will be taken up through scientific methods to retrieve the fertility of the soil. This would be a step towards enhancing the green cover of the district, he said. The land was tested for soil quality by the agriculture department. The soil quality was improved by adding manure among other things by the revenue department. “Every year, tree planting is being taken up under the 100-day work scheme, but nobody cares to follow it up and the trees never grow well. We hope to ensure that these trees develop well,” he said. At present, the district administration has identified five places at Srivilliputtur, Watrap and Irukkangudi for the programme. As grazing is an important livelihood aspect for the people of this region, two hectares of land would be left out exclusively for grazing. The grazing land would be cleared of juliflora plants and efforts would be taken to keep grazing animals away from the plants, he said. The collector said that they would establish a Miyawaki forest, an exclusive azolla cultivation tank, a farm pond and borewell to make the place sustainable. As many as 6,500 saplings including timber trees, fruit trees, flowering plants and herbs have been purchased and they would be planted and maintained. The scheme also plans to create a farm pond for Rs 5.50 lakh for rainwater. Another project, ‘Oorukoru Miyawaki’, is also being planned by the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/virudhunagar-to-enhance-green-cover-through-pasumai-vidiyal/articleshow/85354851.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

Out of the 520 students who applied this year, 293 are from government schools and 224 from aided schools. The most number of students were from Madurai (167) and Thirumangalam (154) education districts, compared to Melur (124) and Usilampatti (72) educational districts. The implementation of the 7.5% quota for medical seats for government school students has encouraged more students to apply for NEET this year, said officials. Last year, 14 students had got MBBS and BDS seats through the 7.5% quota from Madurai. This time teachers are hoping for at least 100 students to get seats. Students have also adapted to the free government E-box course which was new last year and online for the first time. “We have been continuously making efforts to motivate students and also helped students to apply for the NEET exam.

It urged HC to allow processions from August 18-20 for two hours daily by “allowing 1,000 persons in mourning rituals with restrictions” and individual processions. The petition stated that the August 9 unlock guidelines disallowed processions and stated that Muslims should observe Moharrum at home, like other religions. It does not permit taking out tazia (replica of the mausoleum of Imam Husain) and local administration’s nod was needed to set up sabeels (stalls where food and water is distributed). The petition stated that tazias are “an intrinsic part of the Shia religion, which have been carried out since centuries without which rituals of Moharrum are incomplete.” Last year, HC allowed only one tazia with strict restrictions in the state. The NGO’s petition said strict 2020 Moharrum guidelines should be relaxed this year as the lockdown situation was not the same. The matter is listed for hearing on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ngo-seeks-hc-nod-for-muharram-processions/articleshow/85356283.cms||---

A developer, who undertook slum redevelopment in the western suburbs, lodged a complaint after he got a call from Anwar. Two persons were arrested. Anwar had fled the country two decades ago and was reportedly living in Pakistan. The case was registered at Oshiwara police station. The anti-extortion cell of city crime branch is probing the case.

He has valid documents for one room. He claimed to have five more in the slum and asked the developer to give him five more rooms/flats. The developer told him the documents for the other rooms were not valid and told him to approach the authorities,” said a police officer from AEC. Shaikh then allegedly narrated this to Sayyed. Later, the developer received a call from Anwar who asked him to give more rooms to Shaikh.

The fishermen said they could not fly to India on August 12 as their employer cancelled their flight tickets at the last moment. They have been lodged in rooms since then and deprived of proper food and basic amenities. Justin Antony, president of International Fishermen Development Trust, who is coordinating measures to bring them back, said they have written to the President and Prime Minister as well as external affairs ministry urging repatriation of the men. Their families are unable to bear the flight expenses costing 30,000 per head. “On Sunday, Indian Embassy officials in Iran got the contact number of the fishermen and their employer. We hope the men are repatriated at the earliest,” the activist added. The fishermen — A Varghese, D Arumugam, A Ezhumalai, R Sathish and A Chelladurai from Tamil Nadu and Y Justin from Kerala were among a few who went to Iran to work as fishermen in March. Varghese said they had spent 1 lakh each to fly to the Gulf through agents. “Though we were told that we will be employed in Dubai, it was only after we landed there that we were told we should work in Iran. We headed to Iran and started working, but there was trouble with our owner as the catch was less. A few weeks ago he asked us to return to India,” Sathish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/6-fishermen-stranded-in-iran-await-help-to-return/articleshow/85354988.cms||---

This special reservation will be in addition to the 15% quota scheduled castes are getting in education and employment sectors in the state. Delivering the Independence Day address from the Golconda Fort after hoisting the national flag, KCR said the state government’s work is not limited to giving only financial inspiration to Dalits in the form of Rs 10 lakh grant to each SC family as part of Dalit Bandhu scheme. “The government is going to implement special reservations for Dalits. They will be given a quota in the government contracts to supply raw material and commodities to fertiliser shops, medical shops, hospitals and hostels, which take licence from the government to run their businesses,” KCR said. “The SCs will also be given contracts available through the government for licenses to establish wine and bar shops. The government is embarking to implement special reservations for Dalits,” he said. Sources said the government is working out modalities to extend the special quota to Dalits and the percentage of these special reservations will be announced later. The CM said: “I myself designed the Dalit Bandhu to financially empower Dalits and free them from social discrimination. The government has sanctioned funds for its implementation. This project will be fully implemented on pilot basis in Huzurabad constituency from Monday.” KCR said it will also be implemented partially in other constituencies in the state. “Dalits were not satisfied with limited support like small loans and subsidies provided to them by successive governments. There was no significant change in their lives. Hence, the government decided to give Rs 10 lakh financial motivation to the family to set up a unit under Dalit Bandhu,” he said. In case of any untoward incident to the beneficiary, Dalit Protection Fund is being introduced to support them. Of the Rs 10 lakh being given by the government, Rs 10,000 will be deposited under the share of beneficiary and another Rs 10,000 by the government. A special corpus fund will also be set up. Dalit Bandhu Samithis will be established at village, mandal, constituency, district and state level. The fund will be managed by these samithis. District collectors will play a crucial role in the implementation of Dalit Bandhu and supervision of the Dalit Protection Fund. All other welfare schemes being provided by the government will continue to the beneficiaries of Dalit Bandhu. The government will continue to provide rice, pensions and other facilities through ration cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-announces-special-quota-for-dalits/articleshow/85356675.cms||Roushan Ali

Patil, who had a mandap decoration business, was found strangled with a dupatta at Thakur’s house in Owale village in Panvel on August 13. Senior inspector Ajay Landge said Thakur was arrested on Sunday after she returned from Buldhana and alighted from a bus at Kalamboli on Sion-Panvel highway. “She revealed the name of Khetri, with whose help she committed the crime. On the afternoon of August 13, when Patil came to Thakur’s house, she called Khetri and planned to rob Patil’s gold ornaments. The duo stuffed chilli powder inside Patil’s mouth and nose and strangulated him using her dupatta. They then locked the house and escaped,” he said. Inspector (crime) Sanjay Joshi said the crime came to light after Patil’s son lodged a missing person complaint on Friday night. “Thakur’s son also informed police that she had left home without telling anyone. Police went to Thakur’s house and broke open the door. Patil was found dead and a dupatta entwined round his neck,” he said.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: 20-year-old BTech student stabbed to death in Guntur||VIJAYAWADA: A 20-year-old engineering student was stabbed to death in broad daylight on Independence Day in Guntur city of Andhra Pradesh on Sunday. The girl-student was identified as Nallapu Ramya, a resident of Amartaluru village in Guntur district. The attacker stabbed Ramya in the throat and stomach six times, killing her on the spot. The entire murderous assault was captured on a CCTV camera. The incident sent shock waves across the district and invited widespread criticism and stringent punishment to the attacker. Ramya was a third-year student of BTech. Within hours of the incident, the police arrested the accused at Narasaraopet. The accused, Kunchala Sasi Krishna (22), is a native of Mutluru village in Vatticherukuru mandal of Guntur district. He is a school dropout. Krishna studied up to class VIII. He worked as a mechanic in an automobile shop earlier and presently he is unemployed. Krishna came in touch with the girl over social media platform Instagram about six months ago. The police said as their friendship grew further, Krishna started suspecting her of having an affair with someone else. He quarrelled with Ramya on the same issue on Sunday morning minutes before he killed her. The police traced him at Narasaraopet with the help of CCTV footage and his mobile location. He allegedly attempted to commit suicide by cutting his hand after seeing the police. He was rushed to Narasaraopet government hospital and after first aid shifted to Guntur. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed shock over the incident. He spoke to the police officials and asked them to investigate the case expeditiously and bring the culprit to book. He announced Rs 10 lakh ex-gratia to the victim’s parents. Director-general police D Gautam Sawang told TOI: “It is an unfortunate incident where the girl has lost her life. I appeal to everyone to not bring caste and politics into this unfortunate incident. Safety and security of any girl and every girl in the state is equally important to us irrespective of their caste and social status. I assure you that the safety of women is the top priority for us,” he said. The attacker, whose identity police refused to disclose for the sake of further investigation was seen arguing with Ramya a few minutes before the attack near an eatery. He came back to the same place again on a bike after about 20 minutes and attacked her with the knife. It is learnt that she was acquainted with the attacker on social media and they developed a relationship over time. The incident sent shock waves across the city and the state as it happened when the Independence Day celebrations were going on. Krishna fled the scene after stabbing Ramya. The locals informed police but by the time the police reached the spot she was already dead. They shifted the body to Guntur Government General Hospital. Home minister Mekathoti Sucharitha visited GGH and condoled Ramya’s family members. She said stringent action will be taken on the perpetrator of the brutal crime. Police have gathered crucial details and more details will come out once her phone is unlocked, she said. Woman Commission chairperson Vasireddy Padma expressed shock over the incident. She said that the police should investigate the matter to ensure that the perpetrator gets the maximum punishment. Opposition parties aimed all guns at the state government criticising that there is no safety for women in the state. TDP women wing president V Anita said a dalit girl has been brutally murdered at the same time when the chief minister began “boasting himself about Disha Act”. She said the much hyped Disha Act remained on paper and there is no safety for women especially dalits in the state. Janasena, Congress and Left parties made a beeline to Guntur GGH where Ramya’s body was kept. They all criticised the government “for not taking enough measures”.

Some areas saw heavy showers early on Sunday and it drizzled right through the day. But lakes that supply water to the city did not see any steep rise in stock. BMC said lakes that supply water to the city have 82% stock, which is sufficient for 308 days. Civic officials said the city may not have water cuts this year if rain picks up in the remaining weeks of the month. But it will continue monitoring rainfall throughout August. “Total lake levels going above 85%-90% is considered to be safe, even 70% is safe, but we need rainfall in August so that we will not have water cuts,” they said. At the same time last year, lakes had only 71% stock, while in 2019 there was 93%. BMC’s data showed that Tulsi, Vihar, Tansa and Modak Sagar lakes have overflowed so far. As on August 15, Tulsi and Vihar had 100% stock. Tulsi, located in the city, was the first to overflow on July 16, followed by Vihar on July 18 and Modak Sagar and Tansa on July 22. Modak Sagar and Tansa have less than 100% stock.  Three minor incidents of house slab collapse were reported on Sunday, but there were no injuries. Moderate rain is expected on Monday in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rain-returns-after-a-week-no-steep-rise-in-lake-levels/articleshow/85356328.cms||---
---||India||In a first, CPM hoists tricolour in party offices||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: For the first time, CPM joined the country’s celebrations by hoisting tricolour flags in front of party offices on Independence Day on Sunday. CPM central committee, which met in New Delhi earlier this month, asked the party rank and file to celebrate Independence Day as part of efforts to resist the ultra-nationalist politics of BJP. CPM said that Independence Day should be celebrated in such a manner that it would help expose the ‘hollowness’ in the claims of right-wing forces, especially RSS and BJP. CPM’s celebrations did not pass without inviting criticism from its political rivals. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said he was happy to note the changing mindset of CPM. “The party which used to call August 15 as Apathu 15 (Danger 15) has now started hoisting the national flag. I’m happy that CPM has recognised the legacy of Congress. CPM is an organisation that rejected Gandhiji. They should show the gumption to accept mistakes of the past,” he said. CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan, who hoisted the flag close to the party red flag in front of AKG Centre here, said Sudhakaran’s criticism against CPM stemmed out his ignorance about the Indian independence struggle and the role played by the Communist movement in it. According to him, India should think aloud about whether the dreams of the freedom fighters has come true or not. BJP state chief K Surendran escaped humiliation by a whisker as he pulled the wrong end of the rope while hoisting the flag in front of BJP state committee office here. As the flag started moving up in an upside-down position, he noticed the mistake and corrected it. Meanwhile, CPM and CPI have come under attack as they hoisted the national flag next to the party flag. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his Independence Day message said that it was time to ‘reclaim’ nationalism from communal and divisive fascist forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-first-cpm-hoists-tricolour-in-party-offices/articleshow/85357360.cms||---

He looked at me and I smiled. Though we could not shake hands due to Covid-19 protocols, I am excited about getting back home to tell my parents all about it,” said 15-year-old Aman Pandey, a National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadet. Like the previous years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a break from tradition to enter the enclosure where the Olympians and NCC cadets were seated. He first met the Olympians and, then, proceeded to exchange greetings with the cadets. Modi has made it a habit to meet schoolchildren before his departure from Red Fort at the Independence Day celebrations. However, as school kids could not be a part of the event due to the pandemic, their usual space was occupied by the athletes and around 500 youngsters from the NCC. “We were informed by our seniors that the PM may enter our enclosure and we should remain seated. I wanted to talk to him. I admire him and wish to become like him when I grow up. However, seeing the PM from close made my day,” said Santosh Kumar, a student of Class X. Deepak Abrar (20) interjected excitedly: “I am overjoyed. PM sir always thinks about the youth.” Vishal Kumar, another NCC cadet from Sahibabad, said it was inspiring to be seated so close to the Olympians. Adesh Saxena, a 15-year-old who was seated in a far corner, said while he was able to get a good view of the Prime Minister, he was quick to come to the front once the ceremony was over, just so he could greet the athletes. “I am extremely happy to be here,” said Saxena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-ncc-cadets-its-moment-to-savour-as-modi-strikes-a-chord/articleshow/85355180.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Key bodies headless, rue minority groups||MUMBAI: In three months, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government comprising Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will complete two years in office. Opposition minority leaders and activists feel that the “secular” government led by CM Uddhav Thackeray has not done more than lip service for the minorities in nearly two years. The indifference to and negligence of minority issues in the state is illustrated by the fact that the MVA government has not appointed heads to all the departments/corporations/commissions directly concerned with the welfare of the minorities. These departments/corporations are: Maulana Azad Minorities Financial Development Council (MAMFDC), Minorities Commission, Urdu Academy, Wakf Board, and State Haj Committee. “The biggest losers are the minorities as welfare schemes and programmes aimed at the development of them get stuck. All the schemes that our government launched to educationally and economically empower the minorities are in limbo,” said Haider Azam, BJP city vice-president and former chairman of MAMFDC. In June 2020, Azam wrote to CM Uddhav Thackeray and minorities affairs minister Nawab Malik, requesting them to release Rs 130 crore funds lying unused with the corporation to help the lockdown-hit members of the minorities. “Apart from this, in my 16-month tenure as MAMFDC chairman, I had proposed loans to women self-help groups and scholarships to students. But all these schemes are on the backburner. There is no willingness to do anything for the minorities,” alleged Azam. He adds that since MAMFDC is an autonomous body, the minister cannot take policy decisions to be implemented by the corporation. Minorities affairs minister Nawab Malik refuted these charges. “If a corporation or a commission doesn’t have its chairman, it doesn’t mean it is shut. There are officials who ensure implementation of the schemes,” said Malik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-key-bodies-headless-rue-minority-groups/articleshow/85356361.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Goa||Will make Goa a model state after resuming office in 2022: Congress||MARGAO: Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Girish Chodankar on Sunday said that Congress will make Goa a model state in the country after coming to office in 2022 “by completely wiping out corruption with effective implementation of Time Bound Service Delivery Act and bringing strong Goa Lokayukta Act”. Speaking at ‘Swatantra Senani - Shahid Sanmaan Diwas’ organised by South Goa district Congress committee at Margao as a part of AICC programme to celebrate 75 years of independence, Chodankar said, “Former Union law minister Ramakant Khalap had drafted a strong Goa Lokayukta Bill when he was the chairman of Goa Law Commission. But then chief minister Manohar Parrikar shelved the bill as he wanted to promote corruption in Goa. The same bill was again tabled by leader of opposition Digambar Kamat in the last assembly session, but chief minister Pramod Sawant had no guts to discuss and pass the bill and hence they did not even list the bill in the business of the house,” Chodankar said. The state Congress president further said that the party’s focus will be on effective implementation of the Time Bound Service Delivery Act once it came to office, which, he said, will help in elimination of corruption. While speaking on the occasion, the opposition leader accused the government of “suppressing the voice of the people”. Stressing on the need to protect the identity of Goa and preserve its heritage, Kamat said, “The real tribute to all the freedom fighters who sacrificed everything in the freedom movement will be to respect democratic values and freedom of speech.” Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro and South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha also spoke on the occasion. Freedom fighters Gopal Chitari, Ramakant Kesarkar, Anthony Fernandes, Vaman Prabhugaonkar and Rama Budholkar were felicitated in recognition of their contribution to the freedom struggle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-make-goa-a-model-state-after-resuming-office-in-2022-cong/articleshow/85356362.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Want new policy to calculate cost of reserved plot acquisitions: BMC||MUMBAI: The BMC has asked the state revenue department to frame a new policy to calculate the cost of acquiring private plots that are reserved for public use like open spaces, schools and hospitals among other public amenities in the development plan. Presently, the BMC pays hundreds of crores for such land acquisitions as the collector’s office calculates the land cost based on the sale price of flats or built-up area of buildings in the vicinity. Using this formula, in November 2019, the BMC had acquired an encroached plot of land in Dahisar reserved for a hospital and playground for over Rs 330 crore. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh, who had opposed the Eksar plot acquisition, recently met revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and urged him to frame a fresh policy for land acquisition by BMC. In a letter to additional chief secretary (revenue) Nitin Kareer in 2020, BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal pointed out that the collector’s office can not derive the cost of reserved land acquisition from the value of a built-up amenity in the area. “...the methodology...results in exorbitant amount of award in land acquisition cases and puts a burden on municipal finances, which is public money,” the letter said. “The award should be declared considering the higher value of Ready Reckoner (RR) rate and sale instances of similar types of land...revenue department is requested to formulate a comprehensive policy in this respect and direct the collector to declare the award as per the RR rate only...” it added. Chahal further said that the collector’s office had refused to review the award once calculated even when corrections are permissible. His predecessor Praveen Pardeshi had also taken up the issue with the revenue department in September 2019. When contacted Kareer said, “Land acquisition is handled by the principal secretary (forest). If the BMC commissioner wants some specific issues to be considered in the annual statement of rates prepared by the inspector general of registration, we will look into them after he raises those points.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-want-new-policy-to-calculate-cost-of-reserved-plot-acquisitions/articleshow/85356365.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

TOI caught up with some of these passengers and all of them radiated a sense of relief on finally being miles away from the violence. Ahamdizai, a senior advisor to president of Afghanistan on public health, said boarding the Air India flight on Sunday was his “last chance” of escape. “I knew that I was in danger and, hence, I came to New Delhi. When the Taliban was entering Kabul, I reached the airport there around 8.30 am,” he said. “My 10 family members are still in Kabul and I am concerned about them. I will make some arrangements for them to leave Afghanistan.” Having worked hard for over 20 years towards nation-building, leaving his home country was not an easy decision for Ahmadizai. Follow live updates on Afghanistan crisisAnother Afghan citizen, who didn’t want to be named, said she couldn’t believe that the world had abandoned them. “Our friends are going to get killed,” she said, wiping her tears. Abdullah Masoodi (20) had mixed feelings. While he was relieved that he had escaped from Taliban’s clutches, he was extremely scared about his seven family members back in Kabul. “The first thing I did after reaching New Delhi was to send a message to my family that I am safe. As I am pursuing BBA from a college in Bangalore, my trip to Delhi was pre-planned. However, my family wants to settle down in another country. It is hard to get a visa now,” said Masoodi.

---||India||Working on nasal vaccine as booster dose, says Bharat Biotech CMD||NEW DELHI: Bharat Biotech is working on a combination of Covaxin followed by nasal vaccine which if administered can act as a booster dose and protect a person from getting infected, according to its chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella. The company expects significant data on the combination in the next two months which can then drive the future course of action based on regulatory approvals and policy decision regarding booster shots. “We are working on a combination of Covaxin followed by nasal, so that Covaxin primes the system of innate immunity and then the boost by the nasal which produces three immune responses — the IGG, the IGA and then mucosal immunity. All three immunities are powerful and can protect a person from getting infected,” Ella said at the Times Now India@75: The Freedom Summit. Even as Covaxin is found to be significantly effective against the dominant Delta virus, the government will take the final call on whether there is a need for a third dose of Covaxin to enhance the immune response for a longer time, Ella said underlining that data will be submitted to the government. “I think we have done a booster dose also. We are waiting for the results, but if you recommend a booster dose, there will be a shortage of vaccine. So, it’s a complicated situation. We are therefore adopting an innovative method,” he said. According to Ella, if the nasal vaccine works out well, production capacity is also likely to double. At present, Bharat Biotech is supplying around 2 — 2.5 crore doses of Covaxin per month, which is projected to increase to around 5.8 crore doses over the next few months. Amid concerns about limited supply of Covaxin and a slow ramp up of production as compared to other anti-Covid jabs, Ella highlighted how manufacturing an inactivated vaccine and expanding production capacity is reasonably difficult as compared to other platforms. “The mRNA vaccine can be produced with one of the easiest technologies in the world. You can produce in a week, and you can produce 20 million doses with mRNA. Coming to the adenovirus, which is a vector-based vaccine, I can manufacture in less than seven days. Whereas the same inactivated vaccine that we produce to be used in children, that can take 120 days to produce. The other two platforms, it is easy to scale up to 2,000 litres, 5,000 litres, whereas when it comes to inactivated vaccines, nobody has scaled up more than 1,000 litres in the world and we are the first company trying to scale it to 5,000 litres in our Bengaluru facility. People have not understood how complicated this technology is, and this is one of the oldest technologies and the best,” he said. Ella also clarified that WHO approval for Covaxin got delayed as the company had to do efficacy trials separately and during the second wave, which involved cases of Delta variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/working-on-nasal-vax-as-booster-dose-says-bharat-biotech-cmd/articleshow/85357510.cms||---

A handful of students who came by were treated to sweets along with the rest of the gathering NGO launches 3-week learn anywhere driveA nationwide campaign to nurture remote learning, ‘#MainJahanSeekhnaWahan’, was launched on Sunday in nine states, including Telangana, on Independence Day. Launched by NGO Room to Read, the idea behind the campaign is to encourage learning wherever the child is based. Resources developed for the campaign would be translated in four different languages - Hindi, Marathi, Telugu and Kannada. “We strongly believe that any child can read anywhere, can learn anywhere. During the campaign, we intend to equip parents and caregivers with easy-to-use tools and understand how spending as little as 15 minutes a day can do wonders for their child’s language learning and growth,” Room to Read country director Sourav Banerjee said. The campaign would be live on social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter. WhatsApp would be used extensively as the medium to disseminate the content further to the target audience Tracing our history in coinsAs India celebrated its 75th Independence Day, M Kesava Rao took us on a journey through independent India’s history through his extensive numismatic collection. Rao, a former government employee, even took voluntary retirement in 1996 to continue his passion. “In fact, I sold my Premier Padmini Deluxe BE to purchase a 2 ½ currency note printed in 1917 said to be the world’s biggest currency note,” Rao told TOI.

---||Delhi||Why Afghan students are caught in middle||NEW DELHI: Given the rapid pace at which the Taliban has been capturing different provinces of Afghanistan, a masters student at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) cannot even think about returning home. However, he doesn’t seem to have a choice as his visa is ending on September 15. His parents, who are in Kabul, have asked him to try everything to stay in India. His fears have been echoed by other students from Afghanistan studying in different universities in Delhi. Many of them, who are at the end of their programmes, are trying hard to get their visas extended. Many even want to continue their studies, especially at JNU, but they cannot afford the high fees for foreign students given the prevailing economic situation of their families. To get the Indian Council for Cultural Relations scholarship, they will have to return to Afghanistan. “Can’t the Indian government give us long-term visas because of the critical situation? Can’t JNU make an exception for us and reduce the fees? A few students from the Hazara community cannot return,” said the student, wondering for how long he would be able to continue talking to his family back home. Another student, Mohammad Shafiq Sultan, a masters student of international relations at JNU, said his home in Wardak province was already under Taliban control. “My visa is only till December. As the course is coming to an end, I will have to leave the hostel. I had spoken to the authorities at the Afghan consulate, but with the regime changing even they don’t know what will happen. Every year, the Indian government gives scholarships to 1,000 Afghan students. In this situation, the government should extend the scholarships,” Sultan told TOI. For Ali Asghar, an extension of the scholarship would help him pursue further education here. “The province I belong to is already captured by the Taliban. People are living in fear. If I return for the sake of scholarship, I will never be able to come back for studies or a job. I don’t think the Taliban regime will allow such scholarships and let students leave the country. Our future depends on how the Indian government and the university help us,” he added. Those enrolled in Delhi University colleges have also been having problems managing their lives. “I’m studying on self-financing mode and living in a paying guest accommodation in North Campus. My parents haven’t been able to send money. I have written to the dean (students welfare) and the college to allow me to shift to a hostel, but I haven’t heard from them,” said a second-year student on anonymity. Students who took admission in 2020 and attended online classes are still waiting to hear from their universities. A sociology masters student at JNU said, “In Kabul, banks and business centres are closing down. We are confined to our houses. In my family, we are four young women, including my sister-in-law. My family members are worried and want me to go to India and study. I have written to the administration, but they are yet to reply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-afghan-students-are-caught-in-middle/articleshow/85355514.cms||Shradha Chettri

Sena MP Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column RokhThok in the party’s mouthpiece Saamna, targeted the Centre and claimed that the independence of several institutions is dying today as the Parliament, judiciary and media are unable to function under a free and fair atmosphere. “Political opponents are not allowed to speak in the Parliament and ‘marshals’ are being deployed to control the opposition. Is this independence? Has independence been defeated?” Raut also claimed that “Delhi is currently witnessing the end of the golden era of democracy”. On the opposition parties meeting at Congress leader Kapil Sibal’s home last week, Raut said there was a consensus that all opposition leaders have no option but to unite for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “Sibal, however, raised questions over the method of voting and said we will not succeed in the 2024 polls until we do away with EVMs and get back the ballot paper system. I do not speak without evidence. Sibal is not that kind of a leader or lawyer who shoots in the dark...What can one comment on democracy or Parliament when questions are raised over the polling system,” Raut said in his column.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-raises-questions-over-democracy-evms/articleshow/85356432.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The Amaltas Garden Enclave Housing Society had consulted a few tree experts and spent over Rs 30,000 to finally revive the fallen tree, much to the delight of its members. Talking to TOI, the housing society’s committee member, Karthik Kasiraman, said: “xAfter the cyclone Tauktae in May this year, this tall tree which is related to the Gulmohar species, was completely uprooted, which was sad. Many members in our housing society wanted this tree to live as it had been earlier planted by the members themselves. So, we first consulted tree experts Deepti Nayar and Sanjiv Valsan, in order to save it.’’ He further added that they were advised to contact a civic contractor with a suitable heavy-duty machine in order to make a cavity at the site where the tree had fallen down; and then further harness its trunk with strong ropes so that it would stand properly while the roots get some time to stabilise it. “We have been following all the procedures for the last two months, including regular watering, to see the tree’s progress. A few new leaves are now seen on it, and we were very happy to know from the experts that the tree is doing well,” added Karthik. Environmentalist D Stalin of NGO Vanashakti said: “It is rare to see people going out of their way to give a fallen tree a second chance. xI congratulate Amaltas Garden Enclave society for working to restore xan uprooted treex. All housing societies must follow this green example and try to save trees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tree-uprooted-by-cyclone-restored-in-vikhroli/articleshow/85356435.cms||Vijay Singh

For the ones that are reopening, students have been divided into small groups of students for them to use the lab. Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowed schools to re-open for students of classes X and XII for practicals, projects, admission or counselling-related work from August 9. The directorate of education (DoE) had specified that the children can come to school after receiving consent from the parents. Ashok Pandey, director of Ahlcon School, said, “For now we have received some consent letters from the parents and children will start coming to the school from Monday. We have divided the students into small groups and the schedule has been divided to use each of the labs.” The Indian School, however, is only calling Class XII students for now. “We will hopefully start by Tuesday as we are expecting to receive the consent by Monday,” said Tania Joshi, principal. Rooma Pathak, principal of MM Public School, Pitampura, said, “We have received consent from 80% of the parents of both the classes.” Meanwhile, many institutions will reopen from August 21. Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector-8 Rohini, has decided to call students from August 21. “The children are already coming for counselling and admission-related work. But classes will begin later, once we collect the consent form,” said AK Jha, principal. Manav Sthali School Rajendra Nagar has decided to re-open only after Raksha Bandhan due to very few parents giving consent. However, students have started attending classes at some government schools from last week itself. “Almost 45% of the students of class X and XII visited the school last week. We are hopeful that this week more students will start coming in,” said Sunil Kumar Joon, English teacher at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Ghitorni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-parents-wary-attendance-likely-to-be-thin-on-partial-reopening-of-school/articleshow/85360027.cms||Shradha Chettri

CPM central committee which met in New Delhi early this month asked the party rank and file to celebrate Independence Day as part of efforts to resist the ultra-nationalist politics of BJP. CPM said that Independence Day should be celebrated in such a manner that it would help expose the ‘hollowness’ in the claims of right-wing forces, especially RSS and BJP. CPM’s Independence Day celebrations did not pass without inviting criticism from its political rivals. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said he was happy to note the changing mindset of CPM. “The party which used to call August 15 as Apathu 15 (Danger 15) has now started hoisting the national flag. I’m happy that CPM has finally recognized the legacy of Congress. CPM is an organisation that rejected Gandhiji. They should show the gumption to accept their mistakes of the past,” Sudhakaran said. CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan, who hoisted the flag close to the party red flag in front of AKG Centre here said Sudhakaran’s criticism against CPM stemmed out his ignorance about the Indian independence struggle and the role played by the Communist movement in it. According to Vijayaraghavan, the country should think aloud about whether the dreams of the freedom fighters has come true or not. BJP state president K Surendran escaped humiliation by a whisker as he pulled the wrong end of the rope while hoisting the flag in front of BJP state committee office here. As the flag started moving up in an upside-down position, he noticed the mistake and corrected it. Meanwhile, Museum police registered a case against K Surendran on a complaint by CPM local leaders that he did not show respect to the flag by not hoisting it in a proper manner. CPM and CPI too have come under attack as they hoisted the national flag next to the party flag. Youth Congress filed a police complaint in which they said the CPM and CPI violated the Flag Code of India protocol by hoisting the national flag near party flags on par or a notch above the national flag. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his Independence Day message shared on social media said it was time to ‘reclaim’ nationalism from the communal and divisive fascist forces. He said that Independence Day celebrations should be plush with thoughts about the socialist, secular, and democratic values enshrined in the Indian Constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/in-a-first-cpm-hoists-national-flag-in-front-of-party-offices/articleshow/85354154.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

There is a possibility of a new world order post corona. The world has seen and appreciated India’s efforts during corona,” said the PM in his Independence Day speech. “Today the world is looking at India from a new perspective. There are two important aspects of this perception — one is terrorism and the other is expansionism. India is fighting both these challenges and is also responding strongly in a restrained manner. Our defence preparedness has to be equally strong if India has to fulfil its obligations properly,” he added. The country has also delivered the message of the “might of New India” to its enemies by carrying out the cross-border “surgical strikes” in 2016 and the Balakot air strikes in 2019 against Pakistan, the latter in response to the Pulwama terror attack. “It shows India is changing. India can change. India can take the toughest decisions and it does not hesitate and stop in taking even the toughest decisions,” said Modi. Citing the examples of the recent maiden sea trials of the first indigenous aircraft carrier, to be named INS Vikrant, and the home-grown Tejas light combat aircraft, the PM stressed his government’s total commitment to strengthening the operational capabilities of the armed forces as well as boosting self-reliance in defence production. He also referred to the government decision, announced by the defence ministry in 2019, to open the 33 Sainik Schools in the country for girls from this session onwards. “I used to get lakhs of messages from our daughters that they want to study in the Sainik Schools. We did a pilot project in the Sainik School of Mizoram two-two and half years ago by giving admission to our daughters. Now the government has decided that all the Sainik Schools will be open for the girls,” he said. The Union government, incidentally, now plans to set up around 100 more Sainik Schools across the country in partnership with NGOs, private schools and desirous state governments to add to the 33 already existing ones, as reported by TOI earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-fighting-expansionism-in-strong-but-restrained-way-pm-modi/articleshow/85357552.cms||---

Within that period, the financial closure as described in the DPR will be ready and the approvals from the central government will come through, he said. “We expect that the central government will be approving the project within three to six months’ time,” Ajith Kumar said. “Meanwhile, we are preparing the general arrangement drawings, schedules, tender documents, the necessary approvals for mangrove cutting or coastal zone regulatory approval or tree cutting permissions. So, within one year, we will be able to be ready with all the permissions and tender documents. Once 80% land acquisition is complete, we can float the tenders,” he said. “Currently, the proposal is with the ministry of railways and they are processing it for more than six months. So, it is under consideration,” said Ajith Kumar. Meanwhile, the ministry of railways is making routine correspondence with K-Rail, like asking for the sketches of the railways’ land which is going to be needed for the Silverline project, he added. “Parallelly, we had applied for loans of Rs 33,700 crore with the department of economic affairs, which has almost been cleared by NITI Aayog and cleared by the department of expenditure and railway ministry. The department of economic affairs wanted an undertaking from the state government that they would take care of the surety for the entire loan amount, just in case the central government is not providing the equity as per the agreement. Right now, there is a joint venture agreement between the government of Kerala and the ministry of railways saying that they will invest in 51:49 ratio. The chief minister has said that the government will be provide surety for the project,” said Ajith Kumar. Presently, the state government is going on with the land acquisition process.

---||Coimbatore||Youngsters return to vacant plots for gentleman’s game||Coimbatore: The lockdown relaxation has prompted children of all ages to return to vacant lands on the outskirts of the city for a game of cricket.Club level cricket has always been popular in Coimbatore, where numerous tournaments have produced good players. But the last year proved a spoilsport because of the pandemic.Twenty-year-old J Nishanth, member of a popular cricket club here, says that unused plots and empty agriculture lands are ideal places to hone cricketing skills. “I get exposed to different bowling styles of players who may not be professionals, but know the game. Though my club may not like me playing outside club matches, I come here every week.”He is addicted to weekend cricket matches, says 40-year-old J Harish Kannan of Kaleeswara Cricket Club. “People say I look half my age. The game keeps me fit. I have been playing cricket since my childhood.”Harish had joined hands with 30 other people to clean a two-acre private land at Kovipalayam on Vellamadai Road to turn it into a cricket ground. They pay Rs 500 per month for using the land.Thirty-year-old S Kishore, who is running a hardware business at Ganapathy, says that the lockdown relaxation has come as a relief for people like him, who used to play cricket on small grounds. “My family doesn’t disturb me on Sundays, when I play cricket from 7am till the evening. It gives me the energy for the rest of the week and keeps me fit also,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/youngsters-return-to-vacant-plots-for-gentlemans-game/articleshow/85355822.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Surgeon honoured for selfless service||COIMBATORE: D Vijayagiri, a Mettupalayam-based private surgeon, was honoured by Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran on the occasion of the Independence Day on Sunday for rendering selfless service to the public. The public health department has given Vijayagiri, a paediatric and laparoscopic surgeon running SGK Hospital in Mettupalayam, permission to conduct surgeries in government hospitals as an honorary surgeon. He had done over 50 surgeries in the last three years and has been training young surgeons at the Mettupalayam Government Hospital, which is now renowned as a training centre for laparoscopic surgeons. Vijayagiri was given a commendation certificate for his performance during the Covid-19 pandemic and for guiding young doctors of the GH. As president of the Rotary Club of Mettupalayam during 2019-20, Vijayagiri was instrumental in installing a 15-bed post-operative care unit and digital x-ray units worth Rs 40 lakh at the GH. “This helped us to carry out complicated surgeries, instead of referring patients to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital,” said Dr Kannan, chief medical officer of the GH. “People from Pollachi and suburban areas are visiting the GH for surgeries. Vijayagiri was instrumental in equipping the hospital and carried out complicated surgeries for free.” Dr Kannan and psychiatrist Dr Krithika also received awards from collector for effectively running the emergency care and rescue centre at the GH. The collector had noticed Vijayagiri after he performed the first hepatic specialisation surgery at the GH in June, saving the life of a four-year-old girl. Sameeran requested him to carry on with his work and lauded him for being the perfect example of collaboration between government and private doctors. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/surgeon-honoured-for-selfless-service/articleshow/85355825.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Farmers, traders to protest in support of non-dalit||In the wake of a shoddy investigation by police officials that failed to unravel the entire sequence of events, members of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam have decided to protest in front of Annur taluk office in Coimbatore demanding the withdrawal of case registered against a non–dalit on charges of forcing a dalit village assistant to prostrate in front of him.Joining hands with the farmers, traders in Annur and neighbouring localities have also announced that they would down shutters on August 19 demanding the withdrawal of cases registered against Gopalsamy.The initial narrative, based on an edited video footage, was that Gopalsamy, a non–dalit had made village assistant Muthusamy, a dalit, fall at his feet at the village administrative office.Later it emerged through the unedited full video that Muthusamy had assaulted Gopalsamy at the office. Subsequently, Muthusamy fell at the feet of Gopalsamy on his own. Even though the issue caught statewide attention since the video went viral, a special police team that was formed to investigate the issue failed to bring out the truth. Now, police say that the village administrative officer Kalaiselvi and Muthusamy had hid the fact during the investigation.However, farmers and traders’ association members pointed out that there were eye witnesses to the whole event and it was also videographed.“If police bothered to inquire all the eye witnesses and get the full footage of the video from the person who shot it they would have found out the truth,’’ a farmer association member said. Gopalsamy, however, repeatedly told the police he was assaulted, which police chose to ignore. Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam (non–political) which has taken up the issue demanded that besides withdrawing cases against Gopalsamy, police should initiate action against the VAO and the village assistant.

---||Kochi||Kerala state electricity board earns Rs 200 crore via hydel power sale||IDUKKI: For the last two months, Kerala state electricity board (KSEB) earned nearly Rs 200 crore from the sale of power from major hydel projects, including in Idukki. The power generation had increased in hydel dams to manage the rule curve of major dams. “Nearly 39 crore units of power were sold in this period and the board earned about Rs 200 crore. For the first time, all six machines at Idukki generated over 15mu power per day. The power generation at Idukki was increased to follow the rule-curve level,” a senior KSEB official told TOI. “Now the board has decided to store more water in the reservoir to maintain summer power needs. Earlier, during monsoons the normal power generation at the plant was 3-5mu. But this year as per forecast of heavy rain, we decided to reduce the water level in the reservoir,” said the official. A KSEB meeting to review the status of power decided to reduce the generation at Moolamattom plant of Idukki hydroelectric project. For the last two months, the power generation was nearly 14-16mu per day. According to KSEB sources, the meeting decided to reduce the power generation per day to below 7mu per day. The generation at Moolamattom power plant on Saturday was 7.6mu. The water level in Idukki reservoir on Saturday was 2,371.72 ft, which is 65% of the total storage. The central water commission has fixed the rule curve level in Idukki reservoir at 2,386.81ft. “The water level in Idukki reservoir is now safe and there is no need to increase power generation. To manage the rule level in Idukki, we postponed the annual maintenance of generators and continued power generation. After Onam, we will move to annual maintenance,” said the official. On Thursday night, all six generators at the plant were cut off due to a technical snag.Power minister had sought a report over the sudden blackout. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kseb-earns-rs-200crore-via-hydel-power-sale/articleshow/85354275.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Hyderabad||Dalit Bandhu will make a dent in Telangana budget, say experts||HYDERABAD: With the state government contemplating to allocate Rs 20,000 crore on Dalit Bandhu scheme every year, experts predict that the state’s budget plans will undergo significant changes beginning this year. If the plans of granting Rs 10 lakh to every eligible dalit family are implemented, Rs 5,000 crore will be required in this fiscal year alone. In order to fully implement the scheme in poll-bound Huzurabad constituency, Rs 2,000 crore will be required. Despite a revenue deficit of Rs 16,222 crore in the previous fiscal year’s budget, the state government has proposed a revenue surplus of Rs 6,743 crore at the end of fiscal year 2021-22. With the impending cost of Dalit Bandhu scheme, achieving a revenue surplus appears unlikely. In the early years of the state’s formation, Telangana had a revenue surplus of Rs 2,000 crore in 2017-18. Despite the fact that the state government reported a revenue surplus of Rs 4,000 crore the following year, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) raised objections, citing it as a revenue deficit. The state government allots between Rs 70,000 crore and Rs 75,000 crore as revenue expenditure for implementation of various schemes. This year’s capital expenditure is estimated to be around Rs 29,000 crore. According to official sources, there is a possibility of reducing capital expenditure next year to allocate funds for the Dalit Bandhu scheme. In addition, the state already bears a significant debt burden. Given the FRBM limit of 4% of the state’s GDP, the government is permitted to raise loans in the range of Rs 45,000 crore to Rs 47,000 crore. This year, the state government proposed raising Rs 45,000 crore as a loan and half of that amount has already been raised. “In this situation, budget management will be difficult. There will always be a need to increase capital expenditure to ensure that development works are completed,” Krishna Reddy Chittedi, assistant professor, School of Economics, University of Hyderabad, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dalit-bandhu-will-make-a-dent-in-state-budget-say-experts/articleshow/85355842.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They would interact with the commuters, cyclists and pedestrians to find out the problems faced by them and help the civic body identify the places suitable to promote cycling and walking.The move is part of the corporation’s joint initiative with NGO Uyir and the German agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) to promote conventional ways of commuting in the city.They will also work on improving the safety of roads in and around the city schools and ensure a safe journey for the students. For this, they had launched the Safe School Precincts Partnership recently.As part of this, a team of experts had studied the road infrastructure and safety measures available in and around 25 corporation schools and found various issues like speeding and lack of signages threatening the safety of students.The study also found 50% of the students was living within 1km radius of the school. “They cycle or walk to the schools. Parents of the remaining students said allowing their wards to travel on their own was unsafe and cited heavy vehicular movement and safety concerns as reasons,” an official source said.The safety of the roads leading to the 25 schools were assessed based on the standards set by the international roads assessment programme and they were rated under the five-star rating system. Many roads did not meet the standards, GIZ officials said.Ranjith, urban transport expert, GIZ, said they were planning to take up 50-60 more schools in the next phase of study. “The objective of the initiative is to help students walk or cycle to schools without worrying about safety issues. It will encourage more people to take up the healthy way of commuting, while reducing the burden on the environment created by vehicular pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-corpn-to-study-problems-faced-by-cyclists-pedestrians/articleshow/85355852.cms||V Devanathan

The department has received 1,470 suggestions and opinions till Friday. Farmers are currently allowed to kill the wild boars that destroy their crops after securing permission from the forest department and their carcasses are to be buried under the supervision of forest officials. The department sought suggestions and opinions from the public in order to prepare a comprehensive report on man-animal conflicts in the state. The public can send their suggestions till Monday. While analysing the suggestions, it has been found that around 500-600 of them were sent by those under a ‘farmers’ organisation’. The department will consider these forwarded suggestions as a single one. “Only around 100 to 150 suggestions received till Friday seemed to be genuine ones as the farmers explained their plight due to loss following crop raid by animals. As pointed out by the farmers, wild boar attacks mostly happen at night. Forest officials and rapid response teams manage to deter large animals from venturing out to the fields to a certain extent and the problems they create are comparatively less,” said a forest official. As many as 173 wild boars were killed with the forest department’s permission from May last year to June this year. Months after the ministry of environment and forests rejected its demand to declare wild boar as vermin, the state forest department has approached the minister again recently to declare wild boars as vermin. For addressing the problems caused by large animals, solutions like solar fencing has been suggested by the farmers. The report, after including genuine suggestions, will be submitted to the state government by the month-end. “The report will include recommendations to conduct awareness programmes for people living in the fringes of forest areas. Shifting those who live in plantations to outside the forest, mapping of high conflict zones were among the other recommendations suggested to address the simmering wildlife conflict,” said another forest official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/farmers-want-to-consume-wild-boar-meat/articleshow/85354310.cms||T C Sreemol

While they used to get orders for Ganesh idols by this time of the year, this year they have so far received only calls inquiring about the chances of the district administration allowing them to celebrate the festival in public places. People’s concerns are not unfounded. With the daily Covid-19 count fluctuating anywhere between 220 and 260 in the district, restrictions are getting tighter. There are five major Ganesh idol making units in the city. They make idols that are 1ft to 13ft high. While the idols that are in 1ft to 3.5ft size category are mainly used for household worshipping, bigger ones are used for installing at public places by religious outfits and residents’ associations. While the festival falls only on September 10 this year, it’s high time the units started receiving orders. Idols made in the city are in demand in places such as Tirupur, Udumalpet, Pollachi and the Nilgiris. S Yoganantham, an idol maker, said he used to make 700 to 800 idols that were anywhere between 3.5ft and 13ft high in a normal year. “I haven't made any idols in that category so far this year. Things weren’t different last year either. While I used to make 5,000-6,000 smaller idols, this year I have made only less than 2,000 of them.” Last year, he said, the state government had started relaxing restrictions by this time. “But the infection seems to be increasing now. We are not going to take any advance amount from clients until we get a clear picture of what is in store.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pandemic-leaves-idol-makers-in-a-fix-as-festival-season-approaches/articleshow/85355891.cms||V Devanathan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 6.5 crore-year-old fossils found in Sitagondi forest of Adilabad||HYDERABAD: After Ginnedari finding of gastropod fossils recently, history enthusiasts discovered similar fossils in Sitagondi forest in Gudihatnur of Adilabad district. The site abuts the national highway connecting Adilabad to Hyderabad and is located 100 km from Ginnedari. Hundreds of limestone shells were found in the densely forested area at Sitagondi of Mekalagandi. History enthusiast B Venugopal Reddy of Adilabad, a member of Kotha Telangana Charitra group, found these fossils. Sriramoju Haragopal of the group said these are 6.5 crore years old. “These include snails, oysters, leaves and plant parts as well as microscopic fossils such as charophytes and ostropods. Gudihatnur area is said to be rich in fossils. It was mentioned in Geology India’s records,” he said. Haragopal demanded the government to work on the discoveries further. The fossils were confirmed by the experts as well. GSI former deputy director general Chakilam Venugopal Rao said he had visited the area a few years ago. Sitagondi forest is part of Deccan volcanic province that spreads over largely in Maharashtra and adjoining areas of Telangana. “Due to flow of lava, sedimentary layers are formed. This happened 65 million years ago. Generally, fresh water gets trapped in the layers,” he said. Venugopal Rao said fossil fragments were clearly seen here. “They are bivalves probably belonging to genus Unio. These are from the intertrappean beds that occur as thin sediments sandwiched between lava flows. Dr Yadagiri reported dinosaur bones from the intertrappean beds at Ada near Asifabad,” he said.

The recent genome sequencing reports have shown the presence of 66 cases of Delta-plus in the state, which include sub-lineages Ay.1, Ay.2 and Ay.3. The highly transmissible Delta variant mutated into Delta-plus, formed due to Delta acquiring an additional mutation called K417N in the spike protein, which enhances attachment of the virus to infected cells. Now, scientists have found 13 more sub-lineages of the Delta-plus stain starting from Ay.1, Ay.2, Ay.3 all the way till 13. In Maharashtra, the first three sub-lineages have been found so far. Initial data had found Delta-plus resistant towards monoclonal antibodies cocktail treatments. There is little evidence till now to show it is as transmissible as Delta, which continues to be the dominant variant. The 66 detections in Maharashtra include 31 cases of Ay.1, 20 of AY.3 and 10 of AY.2. The Ay.1 cases have been found in sequenced samples since April, while Ay.2 has been found since March and Ay.3 since June. Among the three, researchers said Ay.3 was fast growing in some US states. AY.3 has a non-spike protein mutation and there is not much known about it. Eight cases of this lineage were picked up in June and 12 in July. In Mumbai, 11 cases, including the death of a 63-year-old, have been reported. From the deceased’s family, two were found with Delta-plus. Addl municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that only one cluster-like spread was picked up from the Delta-plus cases. As for 31 Ay.1 cases in the state, ten were found in April, six each in May and June, and nine in July. The Ay.2, which was first detected in March, was later found in seven cases in May and two in June. An expert from CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology is sequencing Maharashtra’s samples and said the Delta-plus nomenclature is evolving. “Wwe are hoping for more clarity in a few days.” Whether they were causing more transmission or its effect on vaccine efficacy, the expert said, “Nothing can be linked without more epidemiological investigations”. INSACOG, a consortium of labs performing genome sequencing, had said in July that Ay.1 and Ay.2 didn’t show signs of gaining against Delta. It didn’t mention Ay.3 then. It had said that Delta was still the most dominant strain. Numbers show that of 12,000 samples sequenced from Maharashtra, 8,089 were positive for Delta. In Maharashtra, Delta was found in one sample in December, eight in February, 185 in March, 1,737 in April, 3,547 in May, 1,551 in June and 1,060 in July. In all, Delta has been found in 68% of state samples sequenced. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said Delta-plus didn’t appear to have caused severe disease in patients. “Delta is still our main concern. Delta-plus cases account for less than 1% of sequenced samples,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-strains-of-delta-plus-now-in-state-variant-has-infected-66/articleshow/85355998.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Following reports that the drinking water sources in Punjab had shown the presence of uranium contamination, the Centre had asked states to check the water quality index for the presence of uranium. In Kerala, these were divided into three zones - south, central and north Kerala. According to the analysis done by researchers at the School of Environmental Sciences (SES), MG University, the concentration of uranium was found to be varying from less than 0.5-12.54 μg/L in pre-monsoon and less than 0.5-5.93 μg/L in post-monsoon, which is well within the standard limit, i.e. 30 μg. This sampling was conducted in five central districts of Ernakulam, Kottayam, Idukki, Thrissur and Palakkad. A total of 830 samples in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season. They were from different sources like wells (290), bore wells (44), public pipelines (50) and surface water from sources like streams and dams (31). Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element and is present in water resources. Uranium contamination can happen from use of certain fertilizers, industrial, mining, quarrying and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. It will dissolve and attach itself to groundwater resources. “The only place where we actually saw a little high uranium presence was in Kanjikode belt in Palakkad. Normally while testing water quality, there is no testing for uranium. Hence these had to be tested specifically for this radioactive element,” said Prof C T Aravindkumar, SES-MGU and principal investigator of the study. The uranium concentration in the study area showed a maximum of 12.54 μg/L, which is well within the allowed limit. The WQI values indicated that more than 90% of sampling water sources are suitable for drinking water usage and a very low number is in the unsuitable category (10%). While conducting the study, they also checked for 11 other parameters of the drinking water quality index in pre and post-monsoon. The monsoon has been a blessing in that there is a lot of cleansing of surface water, and hence the contamination levels post-monsoon were much less. Most of the water samples analyzed during the study were found to be in the ‘Excellent’ and ‘Good’ categories. Among all five districts, Idukki has the most samples in the “Excellent” and “Good” categories. None of the samples from Idukki had an “unsuitable” quality of water in both seasons. Kottayam district has the highest number of water sources which are under the “Unsuitable” category in the post-monsoon season (19.75%) followed by Thrissur in the pre-monsoon season (9.2%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-uranium-content-in-states-drinking-water-says-mgu-study/articleshow/85354344.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Old City needs to grow and authorities must look into these issues seriously,” said Mohammed Abid Alam, a trader in Charminar. Moreover, the Congress has decided to resume protests demanding Metro rail in Old City. Osman bin Mohammed Al-Hajri, a Congress and Metro JAC member, told TOI that they would push the government and officials to take up the Metro rail project in Old City and alleged that the state government is ignoring the Old City. “Whenever polls are around the corner some engineers appear to carry out surveys as if they are certainly going to begin the Metro rail works here but disappear soon after the polls are over,” said the Congress member. Meanwhile, Old City residents said that the Metro rail will give huge respite to those who travel to faraway places every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/extend-metroto-old-citytoo-demandresidents/articleshow/85354362.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Old City of Hyderabad on road to development||HYDERABAD: Narrow roads and traffic congestion could soon be a thing of the past as many areas of the Old City are expected to sport a new look with wide roads and new buildings, thanks to the massive road widening and improvement works on flyovers and junctions being taken up by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). According to the civic body officials, the local elected representatives are coming up with new proposals to expand the roads in their jurisdiction. The GHMC officials said that around 20 roads were widened recently and as many as 22 road works were taken up in the last two years, especially in Chandrayangutta and Charminar constituencies. Road works are being carried out on various stretches, including Himmatpura to Fateh Darwaza, Doodhbowli to Vazeer Ali, Riyasatnagar road, Azha Khan mosque to Daira Mir Momin, Tippu Khan mosque to Purani Haveli (Cheta Bazar), Rakshapuram Road and Azeem Hotel to Church Gate. The municipal administration department has also accorded sanction for construction of flyovers like Bahadurpura flyover, Shastripuram road-over-bridge, flyover near Owaisi Hospital and works at Zohrabee Dargah junction. The works are in progress. Officials said that the first major road widening works in Old City were taken up on the Charminar to Falaknuma stretch, which was expanded to 100 feet from 30 to 40 feet and over 300 properties were acquired. Due to stiff resistance from locals and property owners, it took five years to complete the project. “Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi has submitted proposals to the GHMC for widening of roads in areas including Charminar, Chandrayangutta, Karwan, Goshamahal, Malakpet, Bahadurpura, Yakutpura, Nampally and Secunderabad. However, the corporation has not taken up all the projects due to paucity of funds,” Syed Aminul Hasan Jafri, AIMIM MLC, told TOI. GHMC chief city planner S Devender Reddy said that the locals, who were earlier hesitant over giving up their property, have now given their consent for road expansion works after seeing the growth in other parts of the city. Two roads—Himmatpura and Doodhbowli— have been declared as commercial roads by the government, which means that major commercial buildings such as shopping malls can be constructed on these roads. Town planning officials said that since road widening enhances the property value and commercial value, property owners are now seeking road expansion. However, many residents alleged that the GHMC is taking too long to lay the roads and is not shifting the utilities like electric poles and water pipelines immediately during the expansion process. “Though the road expansion works have been taken up on many stretches, problems persist as even after acquiring the properties and demolishing them for road widening, the GHMC is delaying compensation to property owners,” said Jafri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/old-city-on-road-to-development/articleshow/85354346.cms||Koride Mahesh

According to him, the government, management and workers should work together to increase the production of e-autos of KAL, a state-owned public sector undertaking, and to find markets. The minister was speaking to trade union representatives after visiting the KAL headquarters. “E-auto has received a great response from customers and vehicle sellers have also made excellent comments,” Rajeeve said. During the visit, the minister spoke on the phone with some of the vendors. According to him, the positive response in the e-auto market will help boost production. The minister said that this should be possible through a joint effort and as a new venture in the public sector, it will fill the existing gaps in the market. Public sector restructuring and internal audit board was tasked with preparing a detailed report on this. Discussions have suggested that there is a suspicion of a move from some quarters to organize false propaganda about e-autos, which has generated a good response in general. The minister visited the auto plant and office of KAL and even travelled in one of the e-autos within the campus. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/minister-good-response-for-kals-e-autos/articleshow/85354426.cms||---

In the past year it is estimated that there has been a roughly 20-25% increase in alcoholism. Even for those trying to kick the habit, the temptation has been stirred again after being shaken by the sudden lifestyle change. “At the beginning of the lockdown last year, it was extremely difficult to cope up with the change. Although I could reach out to the support group, I slowly started slipping deeper into alcoholism. Since then I have been on a higher level of scrutiny by my family as everyone is staying at home and the issue is raised frequently. It only led me to take refuge in alcohol more than ever before,” said one such alcoholic (name withheld on request). Apart from coping up with additional scrutiny and job insecurity, many alcoholics also face a higher Covid threat as they have at least one co-morbidity. “I constantly had the thought that I am going to die anyway once I get the virus and that made me drink even more. Now, I have got to a situation where I have to seek help,” admitted another alcoholic who is now seeking help at the Institute of Mental Health. Closeted at home and lack of human contact has also made many find company in the bottle instead. Krishna, a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AP and Telangana), said that there has been about a 25-fold increase in alcoholism in the last couple of months alone. “The reason why we are losing many people to alcohol now is that they are not able to meet. Our meetings have shifted to online mode, but unlike earlier people have a choice to log out and bolt from a meeting anytime they want. The reason we say that the desire to quit is at the same level is because we are getting an equally high number of calls seeking help for de-addiction,” said Krishna. While physical meetings allowed a level of control, pandemic has also made it difficult for Alcoholics Anonymous to reach out to those in need. “Many are falling back right into their old habits after having made considerable progress,” Krishna said. Lack of human contact has made many find company in the bottle instead.

The class teachers visited the homes of students and presented them with Onakkodi. SPV NSS Upper Primary school, an aided school, distributed ‘Onakkodi’, a traditional custom of the people in the state. The project was implemented jointly by the school management, teachers, PTA and the school’s alumni. The school, which was founded in 1957, has around 150 students from classes 1-7. The ‘Onakkodi’ was not only distributed to the students but also to their younger siblings too. The school is managed by the local unit of the Nair Service Society (NSS). Suresh Babu, the school manager, said that there was no financial burden on the PTA for implementing the project. He also said that the school took measures to cement a relationship between students, teachers and parents through programmes like this. “At the beginning of the academic year, teachers distributed books to the students at their homes. The ‘Onakkodi’ distribution is another attempt to part confidence to students and bring them out of isolation in this age of online classes,” he said. The Onakkodi distribution was well planned as around seven squads were formed with the presence of class teachers who travelled to houses of students following Covid protocol. “Students and parents got a chance to meet the teachers,” he added. President of the PTA Ashok Kumar said that the project became a reality with the help of the school’s alumni. “There is a WhatsApp group of the school’s alumni, and there were around 200 former students who are all well placed and spread across the globe. The expense was mostly met with their help,” he said, adding, “The Onakkodi gave a positive energy to the students, and we are planning to conduct similar programmes in future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/school-gifts-onakkodi-to-lift-students-spirits/articleshow/85354487.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

As local trains and malls opened on Sunday, civic authorities said that testing and tracing would be strengthened to note any surge in cases.  The state on Sunday added 4,797 cases, taking the cumulative count of Covid-19 cases to 63,92,660. It also recorded 130 deaths, taking the count of fatalities to 1,35,039. The highest number of cases was from Pune circle (1,982) and 55 deaths. Kolhapur circle added 921 cases, Nashik circle 901 cases and Mumbai circle added 699 cases.  Nagpur circle is now reporting cases in single digits. The entire administrative circle, including Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur, together reported seven cases and zero deaths. Akola circle, the first to see a surge in the second wave, saw 35 cases on Sunday. Amravati, which used to be a hotspot, reported six cases and zero deaths.  After unfurling the flag on Sunday at the state secretariat, Mantralaya, CM Uddhav Thackeray appealed to people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour though cases are under control. “We have experienced a spike in Covid cases, last year and in the second wave. Though numbers are under control as of now, we should be alert and adhere to strict Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Thackeray said, pointing out that availability of oxygen is limited. A taskforce member said oxygen availability remains the state’s only weak point in preparedness for the third wave.  Mumbai reported 262 cases that took the city's tally to 7,39,331. Deaths continued to be in single digits. Four fatalities were reported on Sunday, taking the total toll to 15,981. Active cases dropped below 3,096. Three of the four deaths were of senior citizens.

Cochin Port Trust has been entrusted with overseeing construction of the full-fledged international cruise terminal that is coming up at Vasco harbour. MPT has an ambitious plan to develop a domestic and international cruise terminal, which will include Ro-Ro and Ro-Pax services and will enable cruise passengers to directly travel by smaller ferries and boats to North Goa after disembarking. Rai also said that the contract to restructure berth 9 and three barge jetties will be awarded by March 31, which will enhance capacity of the three berths to 12 MMT per year. Rai said timely environmental clearances will help the port issue the work order faster. “The port has initiated the process to handover berth no. 10 and 11 for operation and maintenance on public private partnership mode and the same is under process. On the request of the Indian Coast Guard and the Indian Navy, steps have been taken to develop dedicated berths for defence at the Vasco bay,” Rai said, after hoisting the national flag. MPT has also resolved the pending issues pertaining to the ongoing works of four lane road from Varunapuri to Sada and the project is likely to be commissioned in December 2022. It has also decided to construct a 12m-wide concrete road connecting berth no. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to the four lane flyover. Rai said that despite the severe financial stress, the port has been able to pay 100% arrears to pensioners and 50% arrears to serving employees due to the implementation of revised pay scales. “The balance amount will be paid in due course based on our financial position. I am sure that, because of our continuous and sincere efforts, the port will perform better and we shall be in a position to clear the arrears soon,” Rai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-order-for-mpts-cruise-terminal-to-be-issued-by-dec-31/articleshow/85356062.cms||---

Data shows that while 49 positive cases were reported on August 9, a day later the number dropped to 34 only to rise to 56 and settled at 57 on August 14 in Thane city. The numbers in Thane district also saw a rise from 183 to 233 in the same time frame. Even as the positivity rate was 2.1% last week, it slid to 1.6% till August 15 even as it saw a slight jump to 1.7% mid-week, reveals xdata from Thane municipal corporation. Activists said any rise is expected, considering that a major chunk of the population, including the unvaccinated, that was till now restricted from movement will start moving around. The core market areas have been witnessing crowding through the last week as shops have been allowed to operate till late, said observers. Nonetheless, experts said any slight northward movement of cases shouldn’t be taken lightly, considering the third wave threat that could be lurking. “It is natural for people to flock outside after being locked up for long, but we must not forget that any slip-up could cause an escalation in infections, something that was noticed before the second wave,” said an activist. Civic officials meanwhile justified the rise, though marginal, was being taken seriously and clarified that the overall positivity rate was low due to increased safety measures adopted by residents and intensified vaccination drives and prompt detection of susceptible cases by the administration. “There is a rise in cases but it is minor and the situation is in control. However, irrespective of the wave coming or not, it is imperative for residents to remain careful and follow all safety protocol,”said Dr V Deogekar, medical officer of health at the Thane corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-covid-cases-in-thane-witness-slight-increase/articleshow/85356058.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The chief minister also said that to make yoga a mass movement, Delhi government would start classes across Delhi from October 2. He added that the AAP government wanted to make the per capita income of Delhi equal to that of Singapore’s and bid to host the Olympics in 2048, when India completes 100 years of Independence. “In the last 74 years, our children were taught everything from physics to chemistry, maths, history and geography in schools, but no one ever taught them Deshbhakti. It was a shortcoming that we assumed they would learn Deshbhakti on their own,” Kejriwal said. Mentioning that the curriculum would be “a tribute to Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh’s sacrifice that he made at such a young age”, Kejriwal said it would be activity-based through which emotions would be developed among children. “They will be told the history of this country and its bravehearts, made to realise their duty towards the country, contribute to its development and also make sacrifices in times of need,” he added. “Every state has Sainik Schools, but Delhi doesn’t. We are now preparing to open the first Sainik School and a Delhi Armed Forces Preparatory Academy to help prepare bravehearts for the country,” said the chief minister. Kejriwal added, “As we celebrate the 75th Independence Day, we should also prepare for the Delhi we want to see on the 100th Independence Day. The Aam Aadmi Party government made two promises while presenting its budget in March — making the per capita income of Delhi equal to Singapore’s and making the city modern with world-class infrastructure and public services.” “Delhi shall bid to host the 2048 Olympic Games. India has never hosted the Olympics, but I reckon that we will be able to develop the city in a manner that we will be a strong contender for hosting the event,” he said. The chief minister further stated that India needed 70 Olympic medals the next time and Delhi had established a sports university to help achieve that target. “I wish to tell all our athletes not just in Delhi, but across India that this sports university will serve you. You can come here and we will give you every facility you need,” he added. “To make yoga a part of every person’s life, from October 2 Delhi government will start yoga classes in parks, public spaces and community centres. We are preparing an army of yoga instructors for the cause. If a group of residents say we need an instructor, the Delhi government will provide them for free,” added Kejriwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/deshbhakti-curriculum-in-govt-schools-from-sept-27-kejriwal/articleshow/85353281.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: 5 of 500 high-mast flags up, dedicated to corona warriors||NEW DELHI: To celebrate 75 years of India’s Independence, Delhi government hoisted the Tricolor on the recently installed high-mast tricolours at five locations in the capital on Sunday. The five national flags are part of the total 500 such high-mast ones the Aam Aadmi Party government had announced during its Deshbhakti budget in March this year. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal hoisted the 115-feet high national flag at East Kidwai Nagar in New Delhi to Delhiites. All five flags were dedicated to Covid warriors. Kejriwal said that while five of the high-mast flags have been installed, all 500 tricolours would be in place by the coming Republic Day. “When we see the tricolour, we get goosebumps and our hearts are filled with love and pride towards the nation. Five hundred similar tricolours will be installed all around Delhi,” he said. “Now, these flags would act as a constant reminder of love and patriotism towards the nation,” he added. “Hoisting the tricolour today reminded me of the Anna Andolan days as the national flag was always present on the stage,” he said. “The movement instilled a sense of pride towards the Tricolor in our hearts,” he said. Another 115-feet-high national flag has been installed in the Patparganj assembly. Deputy chief minister and Patparganj MLA Manish Sisodia honoured about 350 people, including doctors, medical staff, NGO workers and teachers, who have worked to help people during the Covid pandemic, a statement from the government said. “We are living in a free environment because our brave martyrs had given up their lives for our freedom. Our freedom fighters gave us freedom, but on the 75th year of independence, it is the responsibility of all of us to realise the dream of a developed India, to make this dream possible and work hard to achieve it by the 100th year of independence,” Sisodia said. Health minister Satyendar Jain inaugurated another 115-feet-high national flag in northwest Delhi’s Rani Bagh. “Sacrifices made by the medical fraternity for the public in fighting Covid-19 is the perfect example of what patriotism really stands for,” Jain added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-of-500-high-mast-flags-up-dedicated-to-corona-warriors/articleshow/85353313.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Board told to set framework for Stds X, XII exams||With the routine of academics disrupted amid lockdowns due to the pandemic, the state government has instructed the education board x to submit a framework to conduct board examinations for Stds X and XII for the coming year (2021-22), to help schools, colleges and students prepare. The move comes days after Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examination (CISCE) introduced two board exams in 2021-22 for class X and XII students. In July, Central Board of Secondary Education launched two boards for class X and XII. These boards are holding exams offline and may hold it online depending on the pandemic situation. Schools and colleges in the state have been awaiting government instructions on how to proceed for 2021-22. “Except for a 25% cut in syllabus, there is no clarity on how SSC/HSC students have to prepare for exams, if held,” said a principal. Last year, SSC and HSC students were evaluated on internal marks. A college lecturer said students need to know if they are going to take a board exam next year. That will bring seriousness in studies. Minister of state for education Bachhu Kadu met state board officials recently. He said an announcement should be beamed in advance so that there is no confusion and coordination between students-teachers on scope of exams and evaluation is clear. “The next board exam will be held in March 2022, and if this situation prevails, schools should be ready for any form of assessment. The format should be in hand and there should also be back-up plans that students and parents have to be told about. We have informed the state board to prepare a proposal at the earliest and submit it.” State education officials are keen on a physical exam next March-April for SSC/HSC students. Kadu said an educational channel on the lines of Kerala government has been proposed to the chief minister and deputy chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-board-told-to-set-framework-for-stds-x-xii-exams/articleshow/85356106.cms||---
---||Goa||Court denies bail to accused in Porvorim extortion racket||PANAJI: Panaji court has dismissed the bail applications of five accused in a kidnapping and extortion racket in Porvorim. Two of the accused are from Pernem and three from Punjab and all are aged between 19 to 29. One of the victims was an Afghan national. “Here the offence is very serious. All the accused have played an active role in ensuring that the victims remained confined in the bungalow. All appear to have acted in a preplanned and concerted manner. In fact not one but more than one victims, who are young boys, were found in the bungalow at the time of the raid. If the accused are released on bail at this stage considering the manner in which the offence was committed, the possibility of the accused threatening the victims cannot be ruled out,” additional sessions judge Pooja C Kavlekar said. The investigating officer submitted to the court that the racket in this organised crime was huge and operating from different parts of India where the accused hatched a criminal conspiracy to trap gullible travellers. “The accused persons have also prepared forged documents like boarding passes of Air India and Spice Jet. The accused also prepared a fake photo page of an Indian passport and the accused persons assaulted both the victims and robbed their cash,” it was submitted to the court. The investigating officer said that the accused would “get in contact with the person desiring to travel abroad to countries like UK, US, Canada. etc. Further they would lure them by giving them false assurance of a safe and quick process of papers and travel documents which are required to proceed to the desired countries and they would fix a huge amount for all this ranging from 15 lakh to 30 lakh.” “Further, when the victim reaches Goa, the kidnappers would ask him to meet in regards to preparation of documents and abduct him to unknown destination and keep the victim under captivity and further by making use of the VPN, fake location app and fake IP Address Logger, the kidnappers would communicate with the relatives and make them believe that the victim has reached the destination and take the ransom money.” “The investigating officer submitted that the gang is operating on a larger level and one of their associates namely Sanjay Kumar from Kolkata is absconding and evading his arrest. They are linked with some persons, who are based in Malaysia, Dubai and other counties. This is a serious international racket and some persons involved in this case are connected to foreign countries,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/court-denies-bail-to-accused-in-porvorim-extortion-racket/articleshow/85356119.cms||---
---||Goa||Bus operators want app-based meters||PANAJI: The All Goa Private Bus Owners’ Association on Friday said the state government must allow taxi operators to work with app-based meters that generate bills instead of relying on digital meters. The state government started the installation of digital meters in taxis from May onwards. “Majority of the app-based taxi aggregators in other states run on app-based meter system wherein the bill is generated to the commuter via WhatsApp. We have seen the functioning of this system in other states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi. Operators in Goa must therefore be also given the option of installing a mobile phone app-based meter instead of the digital meter,” president of the association Sudip Tamhankar said. He further said that the app-based system is not just user-friendly but also ensures transparency to the customer. Ashish A, a bus operator who also runs a taxi, said he first got to know the benefits of the app-based system through a customer who suggested that he calculate the cost of the journey with the application of the system. “There already is an app built by a private company that can be downloaded and used by taxi drivers. All drivers need to do is upload their details and log in and the app tracks the movement of the vehicle through GPS on the phone and also calculates waiting charges,” he said. “This technology eliminates the need for the purchase of a digital meter worth Rs 11,000,” he said adding that the app-based meter should not be mistaken with app-based aggregators or taxi service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bus-operators-want-app-based-meters/articleshow/85356166.cms||---
---||Goa||To meet coastal plan deadline, daily updates being sent to Chennai centre||Panaji: The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has received 3,493 suggestions and objections from North Goa and 4,016 from South Goa on the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP). As the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) deadline of August 31 for Goa to finalise its CZMP nears, the state has begun sending daily updates to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai after verification of the inputs received from the public. Some of the main objections and suggestions received from the public over the draft CZMP are that either there is wrong or non-depiction of khazan lands, sluice gates, bunds, fishing zones, fish breeding zones, fishing wards, fishing village boundaries, sand dunes, mangroves and also heritage structures along Goa’s coast. Many have also claimed wrong depiction of the regulatory High Tide Line. The GCZMA has drawn up an action plan and distributed the task of verifying the claims to different government departments. Inspections are also being carried out by expert members of the GCZMA. Accordingly, as the verified inputs are coming in, they are sent to the NCSCM to update the draft CZMP. The plan has been drawn to expedite the process of finalising the CZMP to meet the NGT deadline. While in the case of objections related to khazan lands, bunds and sluice gates the water resources department is carrying out the ground truthing, the objections and suggestions related to fishing zones, wards and fish breeding zones are being verified by the fisheries department. The inputs received about wrong depiction of high tide line and sand dunes are being looked into by a team of expert members of the GCZMA. The departments of archives and archaeology and town and country planning are verifying details related to wrong or non-depiction of heritage structures on the draft CZMP. Similarly, a team of experts, including Simon D’Souza, N P S Varde, Prabhkar Shirodkar and Vinod Dhargalkar are carrying out ground truthing of claims of wrong depiction of mangroves and mangrove buffer zones. Goa and a few other states would have continued to drag their feet on readying the CZMP if not for a case filed before the National Green Tribunal in 2017 alleging that permissions were being issued without the plan being finalised. Taking cognisance, the NGT ordered the state governments concerned to prepare their individual plans and submit them to the Union environment ministry by August 31, 2019. It also directed that no further environment clearances be granted till the CZMPs were finalised. The deadline for Goa to finalise its CZMP today stands extended up to August 31 by the NGT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-meet-coastal-plan-deadline-daily-updates-being-sent-to-chennai-centre/articleshow/85356199.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The port is going to install an efficient harbour shore crane with funding from the Sagarmala programme, he said. Jalota said that a tender to appoint an operator for the harbour shore crane will be floated “soon”, while the mobile shore crane will most likely be purchased by the MPT and given to the operator. “We have taken a decision to float an operations and maintenance tender for a crane. Also we are approaching Sagarmala for funding of cranes so that the initial cost burden on the operator is less. If we can buy a crane and give it to the operator, the trade will benefit,” he said. Jalota, who holds joint charge of the Mumbai Port Trust and the MPT, said that though the MPT has a couple of shore cranes and a harbour mobile crane they are not efficient enough for containerised operations. The lack of efficient infrastructure and lack of containerised cargo dissuades container vessels and feeder vessels from calling at the port. “One of the biggest hurdles that I face is to develop the port to cater to the modern demand like container traffic. You need to have port infrastructure of the highest order,” the MPT interim chairman said at a logistics conference. Jalota believes that if the MPT improves its port infrastructure then the port will be able to attract a significant part of 70,000 TEUs of container cargo that originates in Goa. At present just about 28,000 to 30,000 TEU is shipped out through the MPT. The MPT is also in the process of allotting operations and maintenance of berths 10 and 11 along with redevelopment of berth 9 and three barge berths through PPP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mpt-to-get-new-shore-crane-for-better-container-shipping/articleshow/85356196.cms||---

For Fernandes, meeting the bare minimum requirements of food shelter and clothing for her two children and herself has been a challenge ever since the demise of her husband some years ago. To add to her difficulties, her older child, a girl, suffered a nervous breakdown seeing her struggle to make ends meet. Matters came to a head for Fernandes during the Tauktae cyclone that hit the state in May when the roof over their heads was blown off, literally. Unwell for six months prior to this with sepsis and hospitalised for over two months, Fernandes returned to a battered house. Empathising with her plight, former panch member Santan Costa took the initiative to reach out for help for her, requesting panch members and Good Samaritans to, at the very least, help with getting a roof for her house. In a video, he also requested the chief minister and the government to help the family at least have a decent house to live in. Costa speaking to TOI said that in order to keep Fernandes in the hospital till her wounds healed, he had to request many authorities. Costa said that, following his appeal, some generous people have helped rebuild the roof of Fernandes’ house by way of donating material. Presently, the Canossian sisters at Galgibaga and the parish priest of Galgibaga church have helped house Fernandes’ daughter with some nuns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/good-samaritan-organises-aid-for-impoverished-ailing-widow-her-kids/articleshow/85356214.cms||Albert Fernandes

Sardesai said that it is time for Goans to bring the state back on track. “Our women are under constant threat of being harmed, our wage earners are losing their jobs, our children are being robbed of their opportunities for a good education,” Sardesai said. “Our state is undergoing its worst financial crisis, and our infrastructure is crumbling,” he said. Sardesai urged Goans to accept the challenge and work to bring the state back on track by uniting to reclaim Goa. He said that Goa’s coming generations deserve a state that is future-ready and lives up to global expectations. He said that Goa’s unique culture and heritage is being lost due to a “fast track sale” of the state, its land and values. The Fatorda MLA paid special tribute to the nation’s armed forces and healthcare workers—doctors, nurses and emergency staff—adding that Goa will always be grateful for their service and sacrifice. “Goa has contributed significantly to the nation’s progress, while maintaining its unique identity, culture and way of life,” Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goans-must-unite-to-bring-state-back-on-track-vijai/articleshow/85356221.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Last 20 days have seen below-normal rainfall, says IMD||PANAJI: Rainfall activity over Goa has been below its normal value for the past 20 days, according to observations of the India meteorological department (IMD). This has been the season’s lowest state average cumulative rainfall so far. “The state average cumulative rainfall has been only 1% higher than normal this season compared to last year, which was 24% higher than normal,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. Goa had a prolonged weak monsoon spell or break-like situation from July 24 due to the absence of monsoon enhancing systems like offshore troughs and circulations. Meteorologist M R Ramesh Kumar said that the monsoon has weakened over Goa due to the movement of the monsoon trough to the north of the mean position, absence of offshore trough off the west coast of India from Kerala to Maharashtra and the absence of any convective systems such as a depression or deep depression till now, in the Arabian Sea or Bay of Bengal. Currently, there is a circulation over the central Bay of Bengal off the coast of Odisha. There is a possibility of the movement of that system towards the west-northwest direction owing to which there is a possibility that Goa may experience a comparatively higher rainfall activity over the coming days. On August 17 and 18, there is a possibility of heavy rainfall exceeding 6cms in 24 hours over one or two places over Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/last-20-days-have-seen-below-normal-rainfall-says-imd/articleshow/85356242.cms||---

The 1-day agitation was held near the Mayem village panchayat office in protest against the government’s delay in issuing sanads to the residents of Mayem. Samiti president Sakharam Pednekar said the country is celebrating the 75th Independence Day and Goa will celebrate the 60th Liberation Day on December 19. However, Mayem is still not free from the yoke of the Portuguese. “This is the greatest tragedy of the Independent India.” Pednekar said the law came into force seven years ago, but its implementation is taking place in a slow manner. He said the act has been challenged, but the government has not made a strong case supporting it. He said that if the Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta could appear in Tejpal case, then why can’t he be asked to protect the interest of Mayem villagers? The state government should not give only assurances, but instead resolve the issue by appointing a full-time deputy collector for the same purpose, he added. Santosh Kumar Sawant, a local, said the state had introduced the ‘Bhumiputra Adhikarini’ bill in the recent assembly session and maintained that it cannot be challenged in any court. “If the government can bring in the Bhumiputra bill for non-Goenkars, then why is it dragging its feet on Mayem legislation? If non-Goenkars residing in Goa for the last 30 years can get land rights, then why can’t the Mayem villagers get the same right even after 60 years of liberation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-bhumiputra-gets-nod-mayem-locals-too-deserve-land-rights/articleshow/85356285.cms||---

The state of Goa must not jump to conclusion and close this case as unnatural death. There should be a re-inquiry by senior officials of the state government at the earliest so that there is no doubt in the minds of the public at large,” Laurenco wrote to Sawant. He expressed fears that with several rapes occurring in the state, Goa could turn into a “rape capital.” He demanded setting up a fast-track court to deal with rape cases. “All necessary amendments to the law are to be brought in to hang criminals in public so as to deter others from committing such heinous acts of rape in the future,” Laurenco said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/reginaldo-pushes-for-impartial-probe-into-teens-death/articleshow/85356290.cms||---

This will be the second museum in India dedicated exclusively to philatelic material, after the National Philatelic Museum at New Delhi. “This is a very important project because there is no other philatelic museum except for the one in Delhi. We want to make Goa the philatelic hub of India so much so that people that visit Goa must start the Panaji city tour with this museum, especially children,” said senior superintendent of posts (SSPO) Sudhir Jakhere. A total of 75 frames will be permanently displayed at the museum with each frame capable of accommodating 16 A4-sized displays. The philately museum will have three sections: Goan art, culture and heritage, Indian panorama and international philately. An audiovisual room and workshop room will offer a wide range of interactive sessions and curate exhibits. A separate research room and philatelic library is also being set up for philatelists and researchers to refer books for study. “We intend to complete the works over the next three months,” the SSPO said. “Philatelists throughout India and abroad can contribute to this museum. We will give due credit to all the contributors,” he added. Goa post intends to set up a coordination team along with the philatelic bureaus across India and invite various school students and senior citizens to visit Goa and engage in symposia.

He also recalled his father and former CM M Karunanidhi’s letter to former PM Indira Gandhi that ushered in the tradition of CMs unfurling the tricolour on August 15. CM Stalin, who also unveiled a ‘commemorative pillar’ to mark the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of India’s Independence, said the year 2021 was notable for several things including the visit of the President for the centenary celebrations of the Tamil Nadu assembly, completion of hundred years of Justice Party being voted to power in TN, and 100 years of Mahatma Gandhi’s visit to the state after which he started using simple clothes. The year also marks the 150th birth anniversary of V O Chidambaram Pillai who sold his family’s wealth to float a shipping company against the British, the CM said, adding that the occasion will be celebrated in a grand manner. The year also marks the centenary of poet Bharathiyar’s death, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/in-first-independence-day-speech-cm-m-k-stalin-vows-to-document-tamils-role-in-freedom/articleshow/85357835.cms||---
---||Goa||Three structures near Reis Magos fort to be demolished||PANAJI: The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has ordered demolition of temporary structures in a property near the archaeologically important Reis Magos fort and located close to the River Mandovi. The authority has, however, said that the bungalows, swimming pool and other amenities constructed in the property in Reis Magos are as per approvals granted by various authorities. GCZMA received a complaint in January 2019 from three Verem residents alleging an illegal construction at Reis Magos. In April 2019, a stop work order and showcause notice was issued to the owners of the structure, after expert members of GCZMA carried out an inspection. The GCZMA held hearings involving both the complainant and the owner of the bungalows and also sought documents related to the construction from the town and country planning department and the village panchayat of Reis Magos. The complainant alleged that there are deviations in the constructions carried out as against the approved plans. The complainant also said that part of the structure is in River Mandovi. The owner of the structures, however, said that the riverine portion of the property was leased to them prior to 1991. The complainants had stated that the constructions were illegal as they were in a no development zone of CRZ and in close proximity to the Reis Magos fort. They said the GCZMA had approved three structures, but five bungalows were constructed in the area. “The construction touches the River Mandovi and is in complete CRZ violations which is climatically sensitive area,” the complainants states.  GCZMA, however, observed that the approval granted by the village panchayat of Reis Magos confirms the presence of a structure in the property prior to 1991. The authority said that in 2017 it had granted permission for reconstruction of the structure and approved construction of three structures in the property. The GCZMA said that as the complainant has not challenged the construction approvals and completion certificate granted to the structures, the complainant is now not permitted to indirectly challenge all the approvals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-structures-near-reis-magos-fort-to-be-demolished/articleshow/85356017.cms||---
---||India||PM Modi giving same speech for 7 years, but no impact on ground: Congress||NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday accused PM Narendra Modi of using his Independence Day speech to make announcements without ever following through on them. Leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said for seven years India has listened to the “same speeches” by the PM with nothing being done for any aggrieved section, including small farmers. “He announces new schemes, but these are never implemented or seen on the ground. And now, by bringing the three new farm laws, he has spelled doom for the farmers,” he said. Kharge also took exception to the PM targeting previous regimes on the issues of small farmers and development, saying the country will not progress by criticising Congress from the ramparts of the Red Fort again and again. “Congress has done a lot of work like providing irrigation systems for the farmers. Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi waived farmers’ debt when the UPA was in power,” he said. CPM chief Sitaram Yechury said the PM failed to offer an assurance on the Covid situation or the shortage of vaccines. Congress’s communication chief Randeep Surjewala also took a swipe at the PM over his announcement of Rs 100 lakh crore investment in the infrastructure sector, saying this was merely a repeat of what was announced in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-giving-same-speech-for-7-years-but-no-impact-on-ground-congress/articleshow/85357869.cms||---
---||Goa||Danger of mudflow looms over many Sattari villages||KERI: The danger of heavy mudflow from the landslide that took place 10 days ago in Satrem is looming over many villages of Sattari. Forest areas that were cleared for agriculture and other activities in Parwad, Chikhale in Belgaum district and other neighbouring areas of Karnataka which border Goa brought a load of sediment from the heavy downpour at the height of monsoon. This sediment load widened the cracks that developed due to instability and resulted in the landslide at Amyacho Gawal of Satrem on the way to Parwad via Chand-Surya ghat. Gajanan Shetye, a wildlifer who visited the area said, “When rainwater which had collected in the ground in the upper reaches of the Kalasa river basin gushed down, it resulted in a surge of water-soaked rocks, earth, and debris and resulted in heavy landslide thereby destroying a forest cover stretch of almost 2kms in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.” A seasonal nullah that used to emerge from the forests of the Amyacho Gawal has disappeared giving way to a new muddy nullah which is carrying heavy sediments in Sidhichi kond of the Kalasa river. On Sunday as per the directives of the government the Collector of north Goa Ajit Roy along with the officials of the disaster management cell visited the area where the landslide has occurred. Chief engineer of the Water Resources Department (WRD), Pramod Badami told TOI, “We are in the process of taking the help of Geological Society of India to find out the exact reason for the landslide in Sattari. We have never experienced such a type of landslide in Sattari. A detailed geo-technical investigation is needed to be carried out. Along with other government departments we will take precautionary measures so that such incidents will be minimal.” “From the landslide point, Parwad and Chikhale in Karnataka are situated at a distance of 3kms and 6kms respectively. The highest point in the vicinity is 578mts whereas landslides have taken place at the height of 350mts from mean sea level,” said Subodh Naik, a member of Vivekanand environment awareness brigade, Keri. Deputy conservator of forests, wildlife north Goa division, Jabestin Arulraj told TOI, “As per the information given by our officials, a large patch of forests has been destroyed, uprooting many trees underneath. We will carry out the study of the landslide area with the help of drones and other gadgets. Our staff is visiting the area on a daily basis and relaying information of the ground realities.” Villagers of Sattari who are living on either banks of the Kalasa (Surla) river that finally joins the Mhadei river at Uste in Sattari expressed fear that if no immediate mitigation measures are taken when heavy rain erodes the exposed mudflow, it will create inconveniences to the villages downstream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/danger-of-mudflow-looms-over-many-sattari-villages/articleshow/85356054.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Patients charged Rs 80 lakh extra, 14 hospitals ordered to refund||BENGALURU: The grievance redressal authority in Bengaluru Urban district has ordered 14 hospitals to refund Rs 81 lakh excess they had billed and collected from patients. A dozen of the cases involved Covid-19 infected patients. These cases were among 44 complaints of excess billing and medical negligence the authority received since March this year. Of these, 23 complaints pertained to Covid-19 patients who were infected during the second wave and 27 complaints were about excess billing. Of these 27, three were non-Covid patients. The cases were registered under provisions of Karnataka Private Medical Establishment Act and most have been resolved. Officials said in some cases, the hospitals were found to have not been at a fault. However, the exact number of cases resolved in favour of patients is unknown. The complaints also included overbilling issues involving patients admitted under government quota in private hospitals. Across the state, a total of 81 such cases were reported. J Manjunath, deputy commissioner, Bengaluru Urban district, who conducted meetings pertaining to these complaints, said some patients’ families alleged that they were charged more than what had been prescribed by the government. “In some cases, complainants said due care was not taken,” Manjunath said. “In a couple of cases, the patients’ families had issues with information dissemination from the hospital on the patient’s health. In some cases, the complainants questioned the delay in handing over bodies to relatives.” The committee held meetings with private hospitals involved and heard their version. “Where patients were billed in excess of the price cap, hospitals have agreed to refund the sum,” said Manjunath. In one case, a 60-year-old Covid patient was treated for 50 days. He was in the Covid ward for 23 days and non-Covid ward for 27 days. The patient’s family alleged the hospital charged them Rs 3.5 lakh more than prescribed. The committee ruled in favour of the patient’s family. In another case, the committee directed a private hospital to repay Rs 5 lakh to a complainant. However, in some cases, the hospitals were found to have acted rightly. Citing an example, Manjunath said one patient was admitted for 203 days. “He was billed Rs 52 lakh. The man had insurance which covered a portion of the bill and the family paid Rs 8 lakh. The hospital in fact, waived the remaining Rs 41 lakh,” said Manjunath. In some cases, patients who were treated for non-Covid issues in government hospitals said they were asked to buy medicines from outside although the government supplies drugs free to hospitals. “Hospital authorities were questioned, and they have reimbursed the cost incurred by patients,” said Dr Srinivasa SG, district health officer, Bengaluru Urban. However, officials point out that the number of complaints are a very small percentage of the number of Covid-infected people who sought hospital treatment. Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said hospitals must be taken to task if found guilty. “We don’t stand with hospitals that violate government norms. Hospitals must stick to price caps when billing Covid patients. We had issued an advisory on this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-patients-charged-rs-80-lakh-extra-14-hospitals-ordered-to-refund/articleshow/85357886.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Goa||Earning members ‘rehabilitated’ in old-age homes finally allowed to leave||Panaji: Following letters and appeals from Bailancho Saad that a family of four from Bicholim comprising young working members were being denied the right to earn their daily wages after they were rehabilitated in two old age homes under the Disaster Management Act earlier this month, the North Goa collector revoked the order. The family is currently staying on rent but sees no hope in being allowed to rebuild their house. North Goa collector and chairman of the district disaster management authority, Ajit Roy directed the deputy collector and sub-divisional officer (SDO), Mapusa to relieve the family with young earning members from the asylum of Mapusa under the Provedoria and from the Victor de Gama retirement home with immediate effect. In a letter to the Human Rights Commission, the family stated that they were forcibly evicted from their residence in Kothambi, Bicholim, under the Disaster Management Act, stating that it is in a dilapidated condition. Bailancho Saad convenor Sabina Martins told TOI that the case has a long history of the family being subjected to inhuman treatment by the state. “It began with the daughter in the family filing a sexual harassment complaint which angered villagers who came as a mob and damaged their house. Instead of exercising the option of repairing the house and providing protection to the girl, authorities stated that the house was dilapidated and forcibly evicted them”. “They have been subjected to one human rights’ violation after another. Their only shelter was taken away from them. They were rehabilitated in two schools and then locked in old age homes. What kind of rehabilitation is this? No authority has taken any action to facilitate the repair of their house,” Martins said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/earning-members-rehabilitated-in-old-age-homes-finally-allowed-to-leave/articleshow/85356108.cms||---

It was a sight to behold as city folk gathered in large numbers to witness the event which heralded the sailing season on a rainy Saturday evening. “The HMDA has given permission to the Yacht club to access the lake for sports like sailing, kayaking and canoeing. Since there was not enough time to host a tournament here just yet, we decided to host a preview sailing event at Durgam Cheruvu. It’s a great location for our young sailors to practise and compete. We felt it was fitting to start the sailing season here and we plan to also run regattas at Durgam Cheruvu in the future,” says Suheim Sheikh, president of the Yacht Club of Hyderabad. The event was a precursor to the Hyderabad Sailing Week which was flagged off by Telangana Governor Tamilisai Sounderajan on Friday. The sailing championship, which will get underway at the Hussain Sagar today, will see budding and professional sailors from across the country vie for top honours in various categories. Amol Kumar, a techie from Gachibowli, says, “I always enjoy watching water sports and often get to watch them when I travel abroad. This is the first time I’m getting to see sailors in action right here in Hyderabad and it feels amazing. I hope this becomes the venue for all water sports in the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sailing-returns-with-a-bang-in-hyderabad-after-2-years-amid-covid-19-pandemic/articleshow/85348997.cms||Sravan Vanaparthy

On Sunday, 1,896 people tested positive, pushing the case tally to 25.88 lakh. The test positivity rate remained stable at 1.2% with labs here screening 1.5 lakh samples or more every day. There was a sharp drop in deaths in the past 24 hours compared to Saturday and Friday. The 23 deaths on Sunday took the cumulative toll to 34,519 — third highest in the country next to Maharashtra (1,34,909) and Karnataka (36,958). TN’s current case fatality rate is 1.3% i.e., for every 100 confirmed cases, at least one patient passed away from the virus. Of the 23 deaths, 16 patients had comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. The state health department’s ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam Scheme’ has stepped up door-step medical services to people with such comorbidities. The number of beneficiaries under the scheme launched two weeks ago has crossed 1 lakh. This included 46,000 diabetics, 28,800 people with hypertension and 20,600 others with both these comorbidities, data tweeted by health minister Ma Subramanian showed. The overall recovery rate in Tamil Nadu is 98% (meaning for every 100 positive cases, 98 recovered from the virus). A total of 1,842 recoveries were reported on Sunday. For the fifth day in a row, the daily discharge count has dropped resulting in a slight increase in the number of active cases. As of now, the state has 20,458 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in hospitals and their homes. Nearly 10% of these patients are in Coimbatore, the district which once again reported the highest number of new cases (225). Chennai (225) once again reported 200-plus new cases. Despite clusters and repeated advisories, crowding was reported at Marina Beach and markets during the weekend. Apart from these two cities, Erode (179), Salem (127), Chengalpet (115) and Thanjavur (106) recorded new cases in three-digits on Sunday. As far as vaccination was concerned, 1,05,920 got their jabs on Sunday. Around 4.6 lakh vials were distributed to all district headquarters on Friday for uninterrupted vaccination drives during the weekend. Tamil Nadu’s total dosage count is 2.45 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fresh-covid-infections-drop-for-fourth-consecutive-day-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/85357863.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Two nabbed for cheating Bengalurean of Rs 3.5 crore||BENGALURU: Two persons have been arrested by South CEN Crime police recently for allegedly cheating a city based businessman of Rs 3.5 crore on the pretext of helping him invest in the cryptocurrency business. Piyushbhai Himmatlal Soni and Rajeshbhai Dhirajlal Soni are from Gujarat. The main suspect, Kunal Anup Chandrana, is still at large. A local court had dismissed Chandrana’s anticipatory bail plea on August 10. Businessman Gowtham, 37, of JP Nagar, had filed a complaint on June 28. After his friend, Ramesh TV, made profits, he took interest in cryptocurrency business. Stating that he has little knowledge in the sector, Ramesh asked him to contact his friend Chandrana who reportedly was an expert. On May 15, Gowtham transferred Rs 3.5 crore to two bank accounts provided by Chandrana to purchase cryptocurrency. But Chandrana neither arranged cryptocurrency, nor returned the money. Police gathered details of the bank accounts to which Gowtham had transferred the amount on May 15 and 17 and traced Piyushbhai and Rajeshbhai. Chandrana filed an anticipatory bail plea before the court in the first week of August. While rejecting it on August 10, the court said the investigation officer must recover the currency and record his statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/two-nabbed-for-cheating-blurean-of-rs-3-5-crore/articleshow/85357905.cms||Santosh kumar.B

He was inaugurating a photo exhibition called ‘Monuments of Victory & Valour’ at the National Monuments Authority here along with junior culture ministers Arjun Ram Meghwal and Meenakshi Lekhi. “Our history is replete with stories of bravery that have either not seen the light of the day or have been grossly misrepresented by colonial thinking. These gross misrepresentations in India’s history will be corrected,” he said. He also said while large parts of the country were celebrating Independence Day on August 15 1947, the Nizam region had to wait until September 17, 1948 when it was liberated by Sardar Patel. “The Nizam’s Razakar Army went about looting villages and molesting women and shot at people who tried to hoist the national flag, but this story has been suppressed and is hardly spoken about. These stories will also be brought to light now,” Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-correct-history-where-events-grossly-distorted-g-kishen-reddy/articleshow/85357985.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Dakshina Kannada sees 70% of July’s Covid cases in 14 days of August||MANGALURU: In an indication of just how imperative restrictions and Covid appropriate behavior are in the district, Dakshina Kannada recorded nearly 70% of the Covid-19 cases it recorded in the whole of July in the past 14 days of August alone. The gradual rise in cases — the positivity rate is now more than 4% — in the past four weeks has been keeping district health officials on their toes. The district, which recorded 7,488 cases in July, has already reported 5,163 cases in August. In the first fortnight of July, it recorded only 3,363 positive cases. The positivity rate was 3.1% between July 14 and July 20, but it rose to 3.7% and 5.1% before falling to 4% respectively in the next three weeks. The active caseload has also increased from 1,933 on July 14 to 3,682 on August 14 — a 90% increase. The district administration attributes the rise to a spillover from Kerala and together with help from the health department and police, officials have been focusing on interstate commuters from Kasaragod and other parts of Kerala, where the positivity rate is far higher compared to Dakshina Kannada. Kasaragod district alone had 6,331 active cases as on Saturday. Dr BV Rajesh, reproductive and child health officer, Dakshina Kannada district, told TOI that the emphasis is now on administering vaccines in border villages. “Following directions from chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, we launched special vaccination drives in villages near the border with Kasaragod district,” he said. “Meanwhile, we will continue our inoculation drives for priority sectors and to administer second doses for people who are eligible to take the second dose. We have been receiving sufficient stock of vaccines and the government has promised to send more from next week. A consignment of 25,200 doses is expected to arrive on Monday. Majority of the available stock will be reserved to vaccinate people in border villages.” As on Saturday, the district had administered 12.9 lakh vaccine doses, while the district has a target population of 18 lakh. Nearly 3.1 lakh have received both doses so far, Dr Rajesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dakshina-kannada-sees-70-of-julys-covid-cases-in-14-days-of-august/articleshow/85357984.cms||Vinobha K T

---||India||Economy at $5 trillion will double our per capita income, says Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri||NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Sunday that the per capita income of Indians will double when the economy grows to $5 trillion. The Narendra Modi government has set the 2025 target to achieve this goal. Speaking at the Times Now “Freedom Summit”, Puri said, “You know we were a $2.9 trillion economy pre-Covid, but our per capita incomes are low. When you move to a $5 trillion economy, per capita income will double, if not go higher.” He added that the economic policies that the Modi government has unleashed will make India a $5 trillion economy in the next four years and a $10 trillion economy by 2030. On the government’s focus on Atmanirbhar Bharat, Puri said the young generation did not go through the earlier developmental pangs. “But today Atmanirbharta is not something that should be looked at as inward looking. There is one thing that we learnt in the last two years, and may be even in the period earlier, that in order to be able to stand on your own feet, you must have your own entrepreneurial spirits unleashed. You must have your own production processes operational.” He slammed the opposition saying they thought the Corona virus was not the enemy, it’s the government which is the enemy and they got a whole set of equations wrong. He said “a previous government” which was in power between 2004 and 2014 dismantled the vaccine manufacturing capacity in the public sector and it’s a matter of record. Taking a potshot at the ruckus in Rajya Sabha, Puri said he went to a friend who “wears a turban” like him. “And I told him that I'm going to make a recommendation that in the Olympic we should have another category for people above the age of 50 who wear a turban and can throw a file or a javelin at the talks. It was a good laugh. He also had a good laugh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/economy-at-5-trillion-will-double-our-per-capita-income-says-union-minister-hardeep-singh-puri/articleshow/85358014.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu e-vehicle count doubles in 8 months||CHENNAI: The number of electric vehicles in Tamil Nadu has more than doubled in the past eight months. Repeated hikes in petrol prices and lack of public transportation during the lockdowns pushed many to opt for e-bikes, say transportation experts. Official data shows there are 14,366 electric vehicles (EVs) in use in TN, 95% of them two-wheelers. There were around 6,300 EVs at the start of the year. State and central governments too offered tax exemptions and perks for EV purchases, which brought down the prices of e-vehicles, said experts. Tamil Nadu in November 2020 scrapped road tax for EVs during registration. The Centre earlier this year revised guidelines for the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) scheme, increasing subsidies from 15%-25% to 40%. The subsidy for two-wheelers was particularly made higher, reducing the upfront purchasing price of e-bikes across the country, said Abhinav Soman, programme associate at Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a policy research institute. Despite such efforts from the government, financiers remain hesitant to offer loans for EVs due their limited battery life and uncertainty over resale value, said S Rajvel, state chairperson of Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA). Battery and motor account for 70% of an e-vehicle’s cost. Manufacturers offer warranty on pro-rata basis for maximum of five years, said S Rajvel. “If the battery dies within the first year of purchase, it is replaced. In the subsequent years, 25% to 75% of the battery cost is covered. So, people too fear that they might have to spend more eventually and prefer spending ₹100 a day on petrol. Many simply can’t afford to spend ₹15,000 or more in one go for batteries,” Rajvel explained. An e-bike’s battery lasts 50,000km and needn’t be replaced for seven years, said Ravneet S Phokela, chief business officer of Ather Energy Pvt Ltd, which is expanding operations to Madurai and Salem. It now sells e-bikes in Chennai, Coimbatore and Trichy. Even with the battery replacement cost accounted for, said Soman , EVs are a better bargain than conventional vehicles. “EV batteries, once they reach the End of Life (EoL) in terms of mobility, can be used for purposes such as supporting grids. Then minerals and metals can be recovered from them presenting an opportunity for urban mining industry in India.” J Sivasubramaniam from Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) said the EV market in the state is set to boom further with India’s largest EV factory coming up at Hosur. The state government has its own EV policy and Guidance TN is keen on promoting e-transport modes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-e-vehicle-count-doubles-in-8-months/articleshow/85357959.cms||Ram Sundaram

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: In a first, CPM hoists national flag in front of party offices||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: For the first time, CPM joined the country’s celebrations by hoisting tricolour flags in front of party offices on the 75th Independence Day on Sunday. CPM central committee which met in New Delhi early this month asked the party rank and file to celebrate Independence Day as part of efforts to resist the ultra-nationalist politics of BJP. CPM said that Independence Day should be celebrated in such a manner that it would help expose the ‘hollowness’ in the claims of right-wing forces, especially RSS and BJP. CPM’s Independence Day celebrations did not pass without inviting criticism from its political rivals. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said he was happy to note the changing mindset of CPM. “The party which used to call August 15 as Apathu 15 (Danger 15) has now started hoisting the national flag. I’m happy that CPM has finally recognized the legacy of Congress. CPM is an organisation that rejected Gandhiji. They should show the gumption to accept their mistakes of the past,” Sudhakaran said. CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan, who hoisted the flag close to the party red flag in front of AKG Centre here said Sudhakaran’s criticism against CPM stemmed out his ignorance about the Indian independence struggle and the role played by the Communist movement in it. According to Vijayaraghavan, the country should think aloud about whether the dreams of the freedom fighters has come true or not. BJP state president K Surendran escaped humiliation by a whisker as he pulled the wrong end of the rope while hoisting the flag in front of BJP state committee office here. As the flag started moving up in an upside-down position, he noticed the mistake and corrected it. Meanwhile, Museum police registered a case against K Surendran on a complaint by CPM local leaders that he did not show respect to the flag by not hoisting it in a proper manner. CPM and CPI too have come under attack as they hoisted the national flag next to the party flag. Youth Congress filed a police complaint in which they said the CPM and CPI violated the Flag Code of India protocol by hoisting the national flag near party flags on par or a notch above the national flag. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his Independence Day message shared on social media said it was time to ‘reclaim’ nationalism from the communal and divisive fascist forces. He said that Independence Day celebrations should be plush with thoughts about the socialist, secular, and democratic values enshrined in the Indian Constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-in-a-first-cpm-hoists-national-flag-in-front-of-party-offices/articleshow/85358071.cms||---

The chief minister will also launch the second phase of Nadu-Nedu and distribute Jagananna Vidya Kanuka to children. The state government has spent close to Rs 4,000 crore to convert 15,000 schools into ultra-modern educational institutions. Public schools were renovated with green chalk boards, LED tubelights, fans, RO units for drinking water, colourful paintings, kitchen for mid-day meal scheme and compound wall. Washrooms with running water facility is the highlight of the modernization project. “It is a surprise for me to see the transformation of public schools. The present generation children are so fortunate. I would love to go to school had such an opportunity is given by God,” said a former vice-chancellor of Andhra and Nagarjuna Universities, Dr V Bala Mohan Das. He said that investing to strengthen the government schools needs of lot of courage. He said that schools modernization had influenced the children so much as the enrolments were increased by 6.63 lakh students in the last two years while about 5.62 lakh students were dropped out of the schools during 2014-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/andhra-pradesh-cm-ys-jagan-mohan-reddy-to-launch-second-phase-of-nadu-nedu-scheme-today/articleshow/85358083.cms||Samdani MN
---||India||It was opposition's premeditated plan to disrupt Parliament: Piyush Goyal||NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, who is also the leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, has slammed the opposition for stalling Parliament during the monsoon session and said it could have got “much more mileage” by presenting dissent through debate and discussion in the House. Describing the session as a washout, he blamed the opposition for a premeditated plan to disrupt proceedings. “If you recall a senior leader of the principal opposition party at the highest level has been consistently saying from day one that this session should be a washout, possibly with some sort of a sadistic pleasure in getting a washout of a session. Another leader, of another very large party, probably the second largest in the House, had very categorically informed us that this session is gone till the 13th August. You can write it. So, I think the mind was made up. The mindset was to disrupt this house. It was not about a particular discussion or another,” he said during Times Now India@75: The Freedom Summit. While arguing that BJP leaders, led by defence minister Rajnath Singh, had reached out to opposition parties, the other side did not respond positively. Describing the recent disruptions as unprecedented, Goyal said, “…this time around, the opposition has exceeded all limits of tolerance. We have also been very tolerant. The honourable chairman, deputy chairman, Speaker have been more than indulgent to tolerate.” He then demanded strict action against some of the members. “…there needs to be deterrence... Maybe even stricter deterrence. We are grateful to the honourable Supreme Court for the very strong judgement and strictures in the Kerala assembly matter. And I do believe that this time around, some of the members will have to suffer the consequences of their actions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/it-was-oppositions-premeditated-plan-to-disrupt-parliament-piyush-goyal/articleshow/85358107.cms||---

In a bid to promote cycling as a way of life all over the world, the Bicycle Mayor Network, an international organization based out of Amsterdam Netherlands, named 40-year-old Samarth as the new human face and voice of cycling in the city. An athlete beyond excellence, Samarth has completed several renowned ultra-cycling races all over the world, including the Race Across America (RAAM), and Trans-Siberian Extreme His passion for cycling does not stay limited to massive distances. Samarth has a vision to motivate citizens to take up cycling not just as a sport but as a simple regular mode of transport. Samarth’s appointment as the Bicycle Mayor is a big step for Nagpur as he represents that unique individual who enjoys immense popularity and fan following not just in the city but across India. A master’s degree in public health gives him an edge to research, plan, collaborate and execute the details of how to go about making Nagpur a cycling city in the true sense. Samarth says, “We have to start now to make a difference ten years later.” The three simple ways Samarth has designed to make Nagpur a cycling city are the use of cycle to market, work and school or college. Samarth is already a collaborator with the Smart City Project to promote cycling and is also an ambassador for Nagpur Metro to promote cycling. WUCA recognizes Samarth’s solo ride across IndiaSamarth’s solo 5970.2km ride across India on the Golden Quadrilateral Highway of the country was duly recognized by the World Ultra Cycling Association (WUCA). Founded in 1980, WUCA is an international non-profit organization setting the standards for excellence and achievement in ultra-cycling. Samarth set a record from February 15 to 28 this year by covering 5970.2 km in 13 days, 9 hours and 50 minutes. He beat Bharat Panu's October 2010 record of this same route by 34 hours. Samarth completed the grueling distance on his route of Mumbai – Chennai – Kolkata – Delhi and back at the toll collection center at Vashi, Navi Mumbai. This ride was live tracked all along the way where all the parameters of Samarth like his speed, distance, power output, body temperature were monitored 24/7. During his ride across India, the 40-year-old Samarth was crewed by Jeetendra Nayak as crew director, Vivitt Walwe, Anand Fiske, Mukul Samarth, Raj Mahadik, Arushi Nayak, Ravindra Paranjape, Ashwin Mokashi, Bhavesh Patre, Dilip Warkad, Sudhir Baldota, Manish Bhati, Rishi Sehgal, Sachin Shirbavikar, Sheetal Kolhe, Shreehas Bardapurkar, Arham Shiekh, Anirudh Pandya and Milind Pariwakam.

---||World||Death toll of powerful earthquake in Haiti soars to 1,297||LES CAYES: The death toll from a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in Haiti climbed to 1,297 on Sunday, a day after the powerful temblor turned thousands of structures into rubble and set off franctic rescue efforts ahead of a potential deluge from an approaching tropical storm. Saturday's earthquake also left at least 5,700 people injured in the Caribbean nation, with thousands more displaced from their destroyed or damaged homes. Survivors in some areas were forced to wait out in the open amid oppressive heat for help from overloaded hospitals. Yet the devastation could soon worsen with the coming of Tropical Depression Grace, which is predicted to reach Haiti on Monday night. The U.S. National Hurricane Center demoted the tropical storm to a depression Sunday, but forecasters warned that regardless, Grace still posed a threat to bring heavy rain, flooding and landslides. The earthquake struck the southwestern part of the hemisphere's poorest nation, almost razing some towns and triggering landslides that hampered rescue efforts in a country already grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, a presidential assassination and a wave of gang violence. The epicenter was about 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, the U.S. Geological Survey said, and aftershocks continued to jolt the area Sunday. In the badly damaged coastal town of Les Cayes, Jennie Auguste lay on a flimsy foam mattress on the tarmac of the community's tiny airport waiting for anything _ space at a hospital or a small plane like the ones ferrying the wounded to the capital. She suffered injuries in the chest, abdomen and arm when the roof of the store she worked at collapsed . ``There has been nothing. No help, nothing from the government,'' Auguste's sister, Bertrande, said. In scenes widespread across the region hit by the quake, other families salvaged their few belongings and spent the night at an open-air football pitch. On Sunday morning, people lined up to buy what little was available: bananas, avocados and water at a local street market. Some in the town praised God for surviving the earthquake, and many went to the city's cathedral, which appeared outwardly undamaged even if the priests' residence was destroyed. ``We only have Jesus now,`` said Johanne Dorcely, 58, whose house was destroyed. ``If it wasn't for Jesus, I wouldn't be able to be here today.`` Prime Minister Ariel Henry on Saturday declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said he was rushing aid to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals were overwhelmed. UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said Sunday that humanitarian needs are acute, with many Haitians urgently needing health care, clean water and shelter. Children who have been separated from parents need protection, she said. ``Little more than a decade on, Haiti is reeling once again,`` Fore said in a statement. ``And this disaster coincides with political instability, rising gang violence, alarmingly high rates of malnutrition among children, and the COVID-19 pandemic _ for which Haiti has received just 500,000 vaccine doses, despite requiring far more.earthquake with the vaccine.'' The country of 11 million people received its first batch of U.S.-donated coronavirus vaccines only last month via a United Nations program for low-income countries. Sunday's count from Haiti's Office of Civil Protection raised Saturday's death toll from 304 dead. The agency said more than 7,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches were also affected. Medical workers from across the region were scrambling to help as hospitals in Les Cayes started running out of space to perform surgeries. ``Basically, they need everything,'' said Dr. Inobert Pierre, a pediatrician with the nonprofit Health Equity International, which oversees the St. Boniface Hospital, about two hours from Les Cayes. ``Many of the patients have open wounds and they have been exposed to not-so-clean elements,'' added Pierre, who visited two hospitals in Les Cayes _ one with some 200 patients, the other with around 90. ``We anticipate a lot of infections.'' Pierre's medical team was taking some patients to St. Boniface Hospital to undergo surgery, but with just two ambulances, they could transport just four patients at a time. Small planes from a private firm and the Florida-based missionary service Agape Flights landed at the Port-Au-Prince airport Sunday carrying about a half dozen injured earthquake victims from the Les Cayes area. Young men with bandages and a woman were hoisted on stretchers to waiting Haitian Red Cross ambulances. Silvestre Plaza Rico, who was supervising one of the volunteer flights, said rescue planes had made several airlifts of about a half dozen injured victims each on Saturday. ``There were many, many, many, from different towns,'' Plaza Rico said. The earthquake also struck just over a month after President Jovenel Moise was shot to death in his home, sending the country into political chaos. His widow, Martine Moise, who was seriously wounded in the attack, posted a message on Twitter calling for unity among Haitians: ``Let's put our shoulders together to bring solidarity.'' Shortly after the earthquake, Henry said he wanted ``structured solidarity'' to ensure the response was coordinated to avoid the confusion that followed the devastating 2010 earthquake, when aid was slow to reach residents after. U.S. President Joe Biden authorized an immediate response and named USAID Administrator Samantha Power to oversee the U.S effort to help Haiti. Power announced Sunday that USAID was sending a search and rescue team from Virginia at the request of Haiti's government. The 65-person team will bring specialized tools and medical supplies to assist with the disaster response, Power said on Twitter. Working with USAID, the U.S. Coast Guard said a helicopter was transporting medical personnel from the Haitian capital to the quake zone and evacuating the injured back to Port-au-Prince. Lt. Commander Jason Nieman, a spokesman, said another helicopter was being sent from the Bahamas, along with other aircraft and ships. Already on the scene were several members of Cuba's 253-member health care mission to Haiti, and the socialist nation's state media showed photos of them giving first aid to victims injured by the quake. The North Carolina-based aid group Samaritan's Purse announced Sunday it would airlift 13 disaster response specialists and 31 tons of emergency supplies to Haiti. Those include shelter materials and water filtration units. Humanitarian workers said gang activity in the seaside district of Martissant, just west of the Haitian capital, also was complicating relief efforts. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in a statement said Haiti's southern peninsula is a ``hotspot for gang-related violence,'' where humanitarian workers have been repeatedly attacked, including a Doctors Without Borders emergency health center that was targeted in June. The agency said the area has been ``virtually unreachable'' over the past two months because of road blocks and security concerns. ``All of these factors combined will create significant logistics challenges in reaching the most affected areas,'' according to the agency, which added that displacements ``has created ripe conditions for a spike in COVID-19 infections.'' Haiti, where many live in tenuous circumstances, is vulnerable to earthquakes and hurricanes. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake in 2018 killed more than a dozen people. The magnitude 7.0 quake of 2010 hit closer to densely populated Port-au-Prince and caused widespread destruction. Haiti's government put the death toll at more than 300,000, while a report commissioned by the U.S. government placed it between 46,000 and 85,000. Pope Francis on Sunday expressed his closeness to the people of Haiti, including prayers for the victims and encouragement for survivors. The pope called for the solidarity of the international community ``to help alleviate the consequences of the tragedy.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/death-toll-of-powerful-earthquake-in-haiti-soars-to-1297/articleshow/85358174.cms||---
---||Chennai||Elderly population up, Tamil Nadu has second highest||CHENNAI: Population of those above 60 years in India has been increasing steadily since 1961 and it touched 13.8 crore in 2021. It’s growing faster since 1981 due to decrease in death rate, said a study by the National Statistical Office (NSO). Between 2011 and 2021, the general population went up by 12.4% while the elderly population has risen by 35.8%. As per NSO’s projection, when the general population goes up by 8.4% between 2021 and 2031, the elderly population will increase by 40.5%. “Data on elderly population of 21 major states divulge that Kerala has the maximum proportion of elderly people in its population (16.5%) followed by Tamil Nadu (13.6%), Himachal Pradesh (13.1%), Punjab (12.6%) and Andhra Pradesh (12.4%) in 2021. On the contrary, their proportion is the least in Bihar (7.7%) followed by UP (8.1%) and Assam (8.2%).” It also stated that for the year 2031, maximum proportion of elderly people in its population is projected in the state of Kerala (20.9%) followed by Tamil Nadu (18.2%), Himachal Pradesh (17.1%), AP (16.4%) and Punjab (16.2%).” The study said that elderly males have outnumbered females over the last two decades (till 2021). But elderly women would outnumber elderly men in 2031.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/elderly-population-up-tamil-nadu-has-second-highest/articleshow/85358197.cms||---
---||Business||Abolish all petrol 2-wheelers in 4 years, says Ola co-founder||BENGALURU: Bhavish Aggarwal seems to be a man in hurry. As Ola gets its traditional taxi business back into action after the Covid challenges, Aggarwal has now asked for abolition of all petrol two-wheelers by 2025 as his company — backed by Masayoshi Son of SoftBank — makes a foray into the traditional two-wheeler market with a combative entry price of Rs 99,999. It’s not just about cash-burn like most startups, he insists, and adds that his company intends to make profits, even if not from Day 1. Asked about plans for entering the electric car market, Ola’s co-founder said, “We will get into it in the next two years. I will discuss details as we get closer to the project.” The 35-year-old Aggarwal, whose company takes on the old guard and heavyweights such as Honda, Hero Moto, Bajaj Auto, TVS and new ones like Ather and Hero Electric, says the price gets even lower and beats existing petrol models in states such as Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan with lucrative state subsidies for green vehicles and sweeteners such as zero registration charges. “The incumbents (current two-wheeler companies) should reject petrol. Consumers have already rejected it,” Aggarwal told TOI as he outlines an aggressive strategy for his company that has set up a mega factory in Tamil Nadu, which has an annual capacity of a million units, and plans to scale this up to 10 million units (more than market leader Hero Moto) over the next two years or so. Aggarwal minces no words as he wants “only leadership” for his fledgling but ambitious manufacturing venture, and says that Indian companies could take a global lead in green vehicles and their manufacturing. Ola Electric, Aggarwal’s automobile manufacturing company, plans to export vehicles to Asean countries, Latin America, Africa and even Europe. His first vehicle, the S1 scooter, gives a range of 181 km and can accelerate from 0-40 km in three seconds with a top speed of 115 kmph. It charges 50% in 18 minutes on a fast-charger, while at home it takes six hours (for full charge) on a standard charger. The bookings have been a “few lakh” units, and deliveries will be from October. Asked whether it’s ‘old versus new’ in the two-wheeler market, Aggarwal says that’s not the case. “I have a lot of respect for current leaders, including Pawan Munjal of Hero Moto. I don’t think it’s like old versus new… It’s about committing to this future of electric. We are fully committed (and) are also calling upon the incumbents to reject petrol and fully commit to electric. If they do that, and if we do our job well, then I think by 2025, we can make India a petrol-free market in twowheelers... We can lead the world and make India a global hub for electrics.” “We will be the most profitable company at the right time,” Aggarwal says. “Time will tell. This is the time for investments, and I am putting in my money as equity. I want to ask the incumbents how much money are they investing?” The backing by SoftBank carries the stamp of aggression and even cash-burns to capture the market. However, Aggarwal’s new venture has challenges. Not much is known about the charging infrastructure, and physical retail points and service centres will not be in abundance to begin with, while product quality and robustness remains still untested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/abolish-all-petrol-2-wheelers-in-4-years-says-ola-co-founder/articleshow/85358221.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Hyderabad||Veiled reality: Triple talaq still on, cost of court battles keeps count low||HYDERABAD: The handful of triple talaq cases reaching police stations and courts — post 2019 — might hint at better times. But the reality, hidden behind acute poverty and illiteracy, is far removed. TOI’s interactions with victims and support groups reveal that even now, scores of women across Hyderabad are unceremoniously divorced every so often, leaving them to struggle for survival. These cases go unnoticed as the women, with no financial or emotional support, choose to stay quiet. Some express willingness to remarry, instead. “Many people prompted me to take the legal route, but I refused,” said Rehana* whose husband walked out on her while she was bed-ridden with jaundice two years ago — her young child by her side. On his way out, he said talaq thrice. “The monetary commitment of first filing a police complaint and then pursuing it in court was too much to handle. Already, my husband had left me with a debt of over Rs 50,000,” the 37-year-old from Hussaini Alam said, sharing how she couldn’t even burden her parents as they are extremely poor. Rehana is open to remarrying, though. “What I earn (Rs 7,000 a month) as domestic help is too little, and most of it goes towards rent and repaying creditors. If I take a husband, my son’s education can be taken care of,” said the mother of a six-year-old. ‘Will get married again for the sake of my parents’ Activists working in this area confirm that many like Rehana, who cannot afford the legal fight, choose to find another husband. “We still get multiple cases of triple talaq. But most women do not want to pursue it because it’s a long-drawn process and monetarily draining. We counsel the women so they can at least get maintenance, but the success rate isn’t very high,” said Jameela Nishat, founder of Shaheen Women’s Resource and Welfare Association. Noor* too is ready to settle for a second marriage, “only for her parents’ sake”. “I earn some money from odd jobs (teaching and applying mehendi to those interested), but it isn’t enough for me and my child. For the sake of my parents, I will get married again, if we find a decent man,” she said. Since being given triple talaq in 2019, Noor shuttles behind her parents and brothers’ homes — in and around Shaheen Nagar, where she is not always welcome. That’s the reason why Irfana* chose to marry again in 2020 — two years after she was given talaq over the telephone. Her husband, she said, was having an affair with another woman. “Though I had no children and knew tailoring, I decided to find myself a partner and get married because my brothers used to ill-treat me. I was worried they will send me off with some other horrible man who would beat me and torture me like my first husband,” said the 24-year-old. Irfana has just given birth to a boy and is hopeful that her fate will change, for the good, at least now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-triple-talaq-still-on-cost-of-court-battles-keeps-count-low/articleshow/85358244.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Business||NSE records over 50 lakh new investors since April||NEW DELHI: The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has seen over 50 lakh new investor registrations in the current fiscal, its CEO Vikram Limaye said on Sunday. This is equal to 62.5% of the total number of new investor registrations, at around 80 lakh, that were added last fiscal (FY21), he added. Direct retail participation has strengthened significantly during the last few years, which has been reflected in a sharp rise in new investors and an increase in individual investors’ share in the overall market turnover. Limaye, in his Independence Day address, said, “NSE’s elaborate investor education programme in over 600 cities, significantly enhancing financial literacy pan-India, thereby leading to improvement in retail participation, and the continued surge in equity markets, has led to NSE witnessing 1.7 crore investor registrations in the last two years.” The average daily turnover in NSE’s equity and equity derivative segments registered a growth of 70% and 32%, respectively in the last fiscal, triggered by increasing participation from the retail segment, he said. “India’s young demography is its greatest asset, which can strengthen its competitiveness and influence globally. As India progresses towards becoming a self-reliant nation, we all need to strive towards building the right environment and infrastructure conducive for long-term sustainable growth and development,” Limaye said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nse-records-over-50-lakh-new-investors-since-april/articleshow/85358269.cms||---

The highway, which is one of the busiest routes, is witnessing traffic snarls as the incomplete work is choking the 75-feet-wide stretch for 2 km from Puranapul to Bahadurpura crossroads. Locals say that even an ambulance can’t make its way through the road as the entire stretch has turned into a bottleneck. “I think the delayed construction works of this flyover need to be taken into consideration immediately as it leads to 2 to 3 km long traffic jams that don’t even allow an ambulance to pass through the chaos. Also, the road that leads to the flyover is filled with construction waste which spreads onto the road every time it rains and makes the entire stretch prone to accidents,” said Mohammad Areef, a mechanic shop owner, at Bahadurpura. The foundation stone for the flyover was laid by municipal administration and urban development minister K T Rama Rao in 2018 under Strategic Road Development Programme (SRDP). The project, however, was to be completed by September 2019. A cab driver told TOI that the road from Puranapul to Tadbun or Zoo Park on the stretch is a busy one and motorists have been facing several difficulties. “The Bahadurpura crossroads have been closed for the purpose of construction and those travelling from Kamatipura to Kishan Bagh are now being forced to take a U-turn near the zoo. Similarly, those travelling from Kishan Bagh to Bahadurpura or Kamatipura should take a U-turn at Bahadurpura police station. These alternate routes are only adding to the chaos and not even letting an ambulance pass without being stuck in the traffic” said Zubair Ahmed, a resident of Puranapul. A motorist, Shaurya Prasad, complained that construction waste being dumped on the road has become a peril for motorists and it would be a double whammy in case of rain. As per the GHMC project, a 780-mt flyover would be built on 13 pillars from Bahadurpura Police Station to Nehru Zoological Park. “The delay in construction of this flyover is due to issues related to land acquisition but now work is going on. It might take a year for it to be completed,” said Saroja Rani, chief engineer, GHMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/slow-pace-of-bahadurpura-flyover-work-adds-to-woes/articleshow/85354415.cms||Moulika.KV

At present there are around 600 bicycles available for the riders to use. “We have procured another 400 cycles thereby taking the total number of bicycles available to 1,000. Now, there are 57 docks in the city and other areas along the metro corridor. We are planning to increase the number of docks to around 150. This will see the penetration of the project to more areas,” a senior official with the KMRL said. As of now, the total number of docking centres in the city is 10. Of this, seven docks are in Panampilly Nagar area while the remaining are in the city centre. “We propose to roll out 33 more docking centres in the corporation limits. We had submitted an application before Kochi Corporation authorities in March, but have not received the approval from the corporation so far,” an official associated with the public bike sharing project said. “Once we get the nod from the corporation, we will be able to roll out the docks without any delay. We are all prepared for the same,” he said. Lack of a proper monitoring and maintenance system is the major problem which the project faces. “We have now introduced a team for monitoring the facility. They would move around the city and check the usage of the bicycles in each dock. On the basis of the usage pattern, some cycles will be shifted to the docks with more demand from those with lesser demand. The team would also study the pattern of bicycle use. This will help us to bring changes in the system so as to make public bicycle sharing projects more people-friendly,” the official said. New docking centres will come up in Maradu, Thevara, Thoppumpady, Palluruthy, Fort Kochi, Queens walkway, Vypeen boat jetty, Tripunithura, Aluva railway station, Manappuram walkway area, Kalamassery-NAD Road etc. “We have already got the approval from Infopark authorities to roll out docks in their area. We will soon erect the docks there. The demand for cycles among the techies is high,” the official said. “Thrikkakara municipality authorities have agreed to give the nod for the docks after placing the proposal in the council,” he said. The rental of the bicycle is Rs 2 per hour and there are several packages. “A person can download mybike app for availing the service. Then, the person can check the availability of cycles in the city through the app. There are provisions for availing various packages for hourly, daily, monthly and six months rentals. They should pay accordingly. We also charge a security deposit of Rs 500 per person,” the official said. The KMRL also plans to start campaigns to promote the use of bicycles. “On Sunday, we organised a freedom ride to promote the use of bicycles. Around 25 riders took part in the event with freedom as its concept. We are planning to conduct more such campaign activities,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-metro-rail-limited-to-expand-cycle-sharing-service/articleshow/85358293.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The commission made an elaborate exercise on fee fixation in private schools after inspecting the infrastructure and teaching faculty. While schools across the state are going to reopen from Monday, APSERMC said that there will be no drastic hike in the fee structure. Aluru Samabasiva Reddy, secretary of APSERMC, speaking to TOI said, “We are concerned about the exorbitant fee collected by corporate schools. Many parents are requesting a fee concession. But it is not possible technically. The APSERMC will announce the fee structure for private schools. The state government had completed as many as 1.16 lakh works in 15,000 schools at a cost of 3,669 crores. The state government has spent 29,114 crores on the education sector in the last two years.

The Noida-headquartered digital payments and financial services giant is heading for its $2.2-billion IPO, which is the biggest such offer in the Indian stock market history and has filed a draft prospectus with market regulator Sebi for the same. ESOP, seen as a strategy to attract and retain talent, is an employee benefit plan that allows employees to own shares in the company. For an employee, turning ESOPs into shares comes with an exercise price and tax payments. “Lot of employees are facing this issue as most don’t have the reserves to pay for the transactions. We are trying to solve this and are in talks with a few lenders,” said a senior executive. SoftBank-backed Paytm will help employees get liquidity by facilitating loans from lending partners, making it easier for employees to manage liquidity to become a shareholder, he said. Employees who hold ESOPs will be able to convert them into shares and add them to their demat account. The company, which has given out the largest ESOPs as a startup in the country amounting to Rs 6.1-crore shares, will bear the full interest cost of all these loans for six months. The digital payments major’s move comes at a time when valuations of tech startups in India are at an all-time high, giving them the opportunity to provide buyback windows to employees who want to encash their stock options.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-will-help-staff-turn-esops-to-shares/articleshow/85358305.cms||John Sarkar
---||Gurgaon||CM Manohar Lal Khattar to flag off e-ricks to replace autos in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar is scheduled to inaugurate three projects worth around Rs 260 crore in the city on Monday. He will also preside over a meeting to hear out grievances of people. While the first project slated to be launched is about replacing diesel auto-rickshaws with battery-operated three-wheelers, the other two are a waste to energy plant in Sonipat and improved supply of drinking water in various sectors. The first project that Khattar will launch is Parivartan, under which 2,000 diesel autos will be replaced by e-rickshaws at a cost of Rs 6 crore. The chief minister will flag off the three-wheelers from the Galleria market area. In 2015, the Environmental Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) had ordered a ban on diesel autos across Delhi-NCR. In 2016 again, the state government had passed a similar order on diesel autos older than 10 years. The repeated orders and challaning, however, failed to phase out the polluting three-wheelers. What has posed a challenge to the drive against old diesel autos is the lack of alternative public transport. In the absence of a metro network in several areas or adequate bus services, these autos have emerged as the cheapest and most convenient mode of commuting. The government is now planning to incentivise the switch by giving subsidies to diesel auto owners and promoting e-rickshaw. The Parivartan project is a joint initiative of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). Some of the locations that have been proposed aa e-rickshaw zones are MG Road metro station, Iffco Chowk, Huda City Centre, Galleria market, Cyber City to Golf Course Road and Subhash Chowk “For the launch of this project, we had conducted a field survey and held consultations with all the stakeholders to get them on board,” said an RTA official. Khattar will launch the two other projects from the PWD rest house. One of them is a waste to energy plant in Sonipat, which costs Rs 176.9 crore. This plant is part of the integrated solid waste management of Sonipat-Panipat, which will cover a cluster of four urban local bodies — Sonipat, Panipat, Ganaur and Samalkha. The third project is about improved water supply to residential areas of sectors 81 to 99. Implemented by the GMDA, Rs 76.2 crore has been spent on this water supply scheme by the Haryana Urban Development Authority in over 16 sectors. Apart from this, the work of commissioning a partial water supply scheme will also be inaugurated in five sectors — 88A, 88B, 92, 95 and 95A. GMDA has already laid a 55.3km-long pipeline for the water supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/cm-to-flag-off-e-ricks-to-replace-autos/articleshow/85354894.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Mask rule violators in Gurugram have coughed up Rs 7.5 crore in fines||GURUGRAM: Police have collected fines worth Rs 7.5 crore over mask violations in Gurugram since March 23 last year. More than 1.51 lakh challans have been issued during the one-and-a-half-year period. Gurugram Police had started issuing challans in March last year when a lockdown, due to Covid, was announced across India. Initially, the police booked violators under the Disaster Management Act for not wearing masks. From May 28 last year, the state government made provisions for a fine of Rs 500 for not wearing masks in public places. The state government has been regularly directing officers to build awareness and enforce the rules on wearing face masks, which healthcare experts across the world have identified as one of the key defences — along with social distancing and handwashing — against Covid. Commissioner of Police KK Rao said that the total amount collected in fines has been transferred to the health department. Aseem Takyar, an RTI activist who received the information regarding the number of challans issued by police, claimed that the cops intensify the drive only when the number of cases rises in the city. Some residents alleged that the mask rule is not being enforced strictly. “One can spot people without masks in public places. There is a need to create awareness about wearing masks,” said Sameer Shukla, Sector 50 resident. Police officials said they conduct random checks in public places such as markets and violators are being penalised for not wearing masks. “All ACPs and SHOs have been directed to carry out drives in their respective areas. At all check posts and markets, drives are being carried out against such violators. We are also in touch with market associations and RWAs to ensure people wear masks and follow other Covid norms,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mask-rule-violators-have-coughed-up-rs-7-5-crore-in-fines/articleshow/85354936.cms||Bagish Jha

---||Kochi||Colleges see dip in UG admission applications in Ernakulam||KOCHI: Despite the high pass percentage in all streams in Class 12, many autonomous colleges in Ernakulam saw a decline in the number of applications for UG admission compared to last year. Some of the colleges have extended the deadline for submitting the applications. Though the authorities are clueless about the reason for the dip in the number of applications, they suspect it could be an impact of the pandemic. Teachers pointed out that while most colleges allow only online admission, several students face accessibility issues. They also suspect that financial problems brought about by the pandemic might also be a factor for the dip in the number of applications. “Usually, the number of applications increases each year but this time surprisingly, it has reduced. Last year, there was a huge increase in the number of applications. One reason was that with the pandemic outbreak many students were forced to drop their plans to get admission colleges outside Kerala. Last year, we had received over 11,300 applications in total but this year, until Friday, we have got only 7,000 applications. We had to extend the last date of receiving applications to Sunday,” said an official of St Albert’s College Ernakulam, said. A faculty who is part of the admission committee at Sacred Heart College, Thevara, said till Friday, the college received only around 10,000 applications compared to the total of around 15,000 applications last year. “Besides financial issues, most families might have decided to not send their children to colleges far away from their houses. So, many students might have opted for colleges near to their houses. There is a chance that students might opt for short-term professional course after Class 12 to secure a job at the earliest to survive the economic stress caused by the pandemic,” the official said. In Maharaja’s College, Ernakulam, only 13,705 applications were received compared to the 14,694 applications last year for admissions to 21 UG courses. However, sources said 12,196 applicants confirmed their applications by paying the fees and there is an increase of over 2,000 in application confirmations compared to last year. In Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kalamassery, which bucked the trend, there was an increase of around 15% in the number of applications. BCom and BA English continue to be the most sought after course with almost all colleges in the city seeing more applications for admissions in these courses. However, there is a tougher competition compared to last year with higher cut-off marks due to the high pass percentage. As a result even those who scored up to 99% marks may miss admissions in the first allotment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/colleges-see-dip-in-ug-admission-applications-in-ernakulam/articleshow/85358359.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Gurgaon||2021 vs 2020: August gasps for one ‘good’ air day in Gurugram this year||GURUGRAM: The air quality index (AQI) recorded in Gurugram in the 15 days of August is worse than the same period last year. This month, the city has not recorded a single ‘good’ air day. Track the pollution level in your cityGurugram, however, saw 11 ‘satisfactory’ AQI days this August. In comparison, 14 ‘satisfactory’ air days and one ‘good’ air day was recorded in August 2020. Moreover, last year during the same period, no ‘moderate’ days were recorded. A total of four ‘moderate’ days have been reported this August so far. According to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), low wind speed and local factors such as garbage burning and dust from construction sites have contributed to the deterioration of air quality in August this year. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor', and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. “We have witnessed less ‘satisfactory’ days this August in the region, which is a big concern. The main reason is that there is no lockdown. While the city received rainfall this month, which cleared pollutants from the air, local factors played an important role in trapping pollutants. This deteriorated the air quality index,” HSPCB member secretary S Narayan told TOI. “This August, the poisonous gases from waste burning and dust from construction sites have also contributed to air pollution in Gurugram. We cannot deny the role of these factors while analysing the city’s AQI,” he added. Meanwhile, the air quality is likely to improve in the coming days as the temperature in the region is expected to rise. “We are following suggestions made by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CMAQ) regarding monitoring of crop residue burning. We are hopeful that things will improve in the coming winter,” he added. On Sunday, the city’s overall AQI stood at 82. The Sector 51 monitoring station recorded ‘satisfactory’ AQI at 84), Vikas Sadan at 67, and Teri Gram at 96. Independent experts pointed out that ozone is also an emerging problem in Gurugram. Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said, “Ozone is only a summer problem and is not a concern during monsoon months. It is now well-understood that sunshine plays a critical role in triggering photochemical reactions between gases to form ozone and it is typically expected that ozone is a bigger problem in summer. But the problem seems to be quite uniformly spread across seasons. Thus, this has deteriorated the AQI in the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/2021-vs-2020-aug-gasps-for-one-good-air-day-this-year/articleshow/85355125.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Business||Exporters to get new duty refund scheme this week||NEW DELHI: The government is set to notify the new duty refund scheme for exporters — Refund of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) — this week, with a final clearance from commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal expected in a day or two. The scheme, meant to replace World Trade Organization (WTO) non-compliant incentives, was implemented in January but exporters have been waiting to get their dues for taxes paid by them for the last eight months. A notification will partially end the agonising wait, which has increased their fund requirement as the Centre has held back their claims. While commerce secretary B V R Subrahmanyam had said that the scheme will be implemented, some paperwork is yet to be completed after the commerce and finance ministries agreed to widen the scope of the scheme to cover all products, which also required higher budgetary allocation. The two ministries had earlier agreed to increase the allocation from the originally allocated Rs 13,000 crore to Rs 17,000 crore. Last week, the government had notified the Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) scheme, a similar mechanism, to allow textile exporters to get a rebate on central and state taxes till March 2024. According to industry estimates the government owes around Rs 8,000 crore to exporters in unpaid RoDTEP bills, with another Rs 3,500-4,000 crore arrears on account of RoSCTL. Further, around Rs 16,000 crore of payments from the now defunct Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) are due for April-December 2020. So, exporters are demanding payments of close to Rs 28,000 crore just from these three schemes. Exporters have been complaining of the government sitting on tax refunds and arrears from earlier schemes such as Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) and MEIS that were abandoned after the US dragged India to the WTO, arguing that they were not compliant with global trade rules. Government sources said refunds could be handy at a time when costs such as those on fuel and freight have gone up due to global as well as domestic price dynamics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/exporters-to-get-new-duty-refund-scheme-this-week/articleshow/85358436.cms||Sidhartha

The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) set a target of generating Rs 10,000 crore in revenue through various big ticket projects over the next three years, while the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) promised to turn the town into an IT and electronics hub. Some of the construction projects that were unveiled in Noida were service roads, footpaths and central verges in various sectors, an amphitheatre in the Sector 18 market, two pink toilets and so on. A mural of the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao programme of the government was also unveiled opposite GIP Mall. “GB Nagar MP Mahesh Sharma, Rajya Sabha member Surendra Singh Nagar and Noida MLA Pankaj Singh attended the event that was organised at the Indira Gandhi Kala Kendra,” an official said. Ritu Maheshwari, the CEO of the Noida Authority, handed allotment letters to 644 eligible farmers under the Kisan Kota Plot Scheme, 2011, which were pending for many years. The scheme was introduced for those farmers whose land was acquired by the Authority between 1976 and 1997. At the YEIDA office in Greater Noida, CEO Arun Vir Singh said that the authority hoped to garner Rs 10,000 crore in revenue from the medical park, data centre park and the Film City project over the next three years. He also praised officials for completing all paperwork and formalities to pave the way for the construction of the Noida International Airport to begin. “All YEIDA officials are partners in the success of its projects. I urge them to strive towards solving the problems of the allottees of the earlier schemes,” said CEO Singh. GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan, meanwhile, called Greater Noida a 30-year “young city”. He also praised the OneMap GIS Greno project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-unveils-projects-worth-rs-16cr-on-i-day/articleshow/85355210.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||World||Taliban declares 'war is over' as president and diplomats flee Kabul||KABUL: The Taliban declared the war in Afghanistan was over after insurgents took control of the presidential palace in Kabul as US-led forces departed and Western nations scrambled on Monday to evacuate their citizens. President Ashraf Ghani fled the country on Sunday as the Islamist militants entered the city, saying he wanted to avoid bloodshed, while hundreds of Afghans desperate to leave flooded Kabul airport. "Today is a great day for the Afghan people and the mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years," Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban's political office, told Al Jazeera TV. "Thanks to God, the war is over in the country." Naeem said the type and form of the new regime in Afghanistan would be made clear soon, adding the Taliban did not want to live in isolation and calling for peaceful international relations. "We have reached what we were seeking, which is the freedom of our country and the independence of our people," he said. "We will not allow anyone to use our lands to target anyone, and we do not want to harm others." In Washington, opponents of President Joe Biden's decision to end America's longest war, launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said the chaos was caused by a failure of leadership. American diplomats were flown by helicopter to the airport from their embassy in the fortified Wazir Akbar Khan district as Afghan forces trained for years and equipped by the United States and others at a cost of billions of dollars, melted away. A US State Department spokesperson said early on Monday that almost all embassy personnel, including Ambassador Ross Wilson, were at the airport and the American flag had been lowered and removed from the embassy compound. At Kabul airport, hundreds of Afghans waited for flights, some dragging luggage across runways in the dark, while women and children slept near security corridors. A source at the airport said some scuffles broke out among people unable to get a place as departures were halted. Local television 1TV reported that multiple explosions were heard in the capital after dark, but the city was largely quiet during the day on Sunday. Aid group Emergency said 80 wounded people had been brought to its hospital in Kabul, which was at capacity, and that it was only admitting people with life-threatening injuries. In a Facebook post, Ghani said he had left the country to avoid clashes with the Taliban that would endanger millions of residents of Kabul. He did not say where he was and it was not clear where he was headed or how exactly power would be transferred following the Taliban's lightning sweep across Afghanistan. Al Jazeera earlier showed footage of what it said were Taliban commanders in the presidential palace with dozens of armed fighters. Some local social media users in Kabul branded Ghani a coward for leaving them in chaos. A tweet from the verified account of the Afghan Embassy in India said: "We are all banging our heads in shame." SHARIA Many Afghans fear the Taliban will return to past harsh practices in their imposition of sharia, or Islamic religious law. During their 1996-2001 rule, women could not work and punishments such as stoning, whipping and hanging were administered. The militants sought to project a more moderate face promising to respect women's rights and protect both foreigners and Afghans. "We are ready to have a dialogue with all Afghan figures and will guarantee them the necessary protection," Naeem told Al Jazeera Mubasher TV. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the Taliban and all other parties to exercise the utmost restraint, and expressed particular concern about the future of women and girls in Afghanistan. The Pentagon authorized another 1,000 troops to help evacuate US citizens and Afghans who worked for them, a US official said. A senior US defense official told Reuters on Sunday evening in Washington that about 500 people, mostly Americans, had so far been evacuated, and that the number would rise to 5,000 a day when all planned US forces are in Kabul. European nations, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, also said they were working to get citizens as well as some Afghan employees out of the country. Russia said it saw no need to evacuate its embassy for the time being. Turkey said its embassy would continue operations. AMERICAN EXIT Asked if images of helicopters ferrying personnel were evocative of the United States’ departure from Vietnam in 1975, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told ABC News: "Let's take a step back. This is manifestly not Saigon." Biden has faced rising domestic criticism after sticking to a plan, initiated by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, to end the US military mission in Afghanistan by Aug. 31. In a statement on Sunday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell blamed Biden for what he called a "shameful failure of American leadership". "Terrorists and major competitors like China are watching the embarrassment of a superpower laid low," McConnell said. Naeem said the Taliban would adopt a policy of non-interference in others' affairs in return for non-interference in Afghanistan. "We do not think that foreign forces will repeat their failed experience in Afghanistan once again."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-declares-war-is-over-as-president-and-diplomats-flee-kabul/articleshow/85358455.cms||---

While farmers from Ambala and Karnal reached Singhu border and joined the protesters camping there, farmers in Jind and Hisar took out rallies at the block and tehsil levels. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had urged farmers to take out rallies and mark this Independence Day as ‘Kisan Mazdoor Azaadi Sangram Diwas ’ in an attempt to infuse fresh steam into their movement that began last year. In Sirsa, Rewari, and Jind, farmers took to the streets with tableau, farm machinery and charkhas. “At the border protest sites also, farmers organised padayatras (marches). In Haryana and Punjab, the call for the yatra has received an overwhelming response and it has strengthened the protest and the farmers’ resolve to fight,” said Manjit Thakral, a member of Jai Kisan Andolan. In Jind, more than 20,000 farmers in over 5,000 tractors took part in the rally on Sunday. “This year, Independence Day is more special for two main reasons. Firstly, we celebrated 75 years of freedom and recounted the sacrifices and struggles of our freedom fighters. Secondly, the farming community stands together, stronger than ever. The roads in Jind were flooded with tractors, many of which were driven by women,” said Virender Singh Sindhu, a member of Starol khap in Jind. The rally taken out from Rewari culminated at Shahjahanpur border where farmers have been camping for several months. A group of farmers also marched for about 9 km from Tankri Rewari to Shahjahanpur border. Protesters carried soil from their fields and water from their villages. Once they reached Shahjahanpur, they placed the soil and the water in front of a memorial built to pay respects to those who lost their lives while taking part in the farmers’ agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/farmers-reach-singhu-on-tractors/articleshow/85356048.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

The residents highlighted the lack of maintenance of sector roads, non-functional streetlights, encroached greenbelts, women safety and road safety among other civic issues during the meeting. Around 50 residents of various societies, including Mapsko Casabella, Royalville, Paradise, Vatika Seven Lamp, Lifestyle, K-block, G-21, SS Coralwood, Emaar Palm Gardens, Palm Hills, Bestech Ananda, Umang Winter Hills, Mansoon Breeze, Supertech Araville, Microtek Greenburg, DLF NTH-86, Pyramid Urban Homes and Vardhaman Flora, were present at the meeting. They have also raised the issue of a 24-metre internal sector road and urged the MLA to take up the matter with the government to bring some policy change to provide better road connectivity in the new sectors. Ravikant Sharma, RWA general secretary of Umang Winter Hills, said: “We have raised the lack of civic infrastructure facilities. There is no 24m internal sector road connectivity to our society due to bureaucratic hurdles and the road, which we have been using as an alternative is also in dilapidated condition.” The residents pointed out that they were happy when the Municipal Corporation of Manesar was formed in December last year, but nothing much has been done to improve the overall infrastructure in the area. “It has been eight months since the formation of the civic body but still there is no clarity on the pending development work by the GMDA, HSVP and other government agencies,” said Rao Dharamveer Singh, RWA president of Mapsko Casabella. Meanwhile, Jrawta assured the residents.

Chellanam Bazar, an area between Control point (CP) Stone 996 and 997 in the coast is probably the most-affected by sea erosion and yet no protective measures have been put in place in the region yet. Even during the recent Tauktae cyclone, Bazar region witnessed massive damage caused by the sea. The only barrier between the houses in these areas and sea is a heap of stones of the collapsed seawall and the ruins of a few buildings. The residents are upset with the government’s claim of initiating numerous projects and allege that many of them have been implemented ineffectively. A resident of Bazar and coordinator of Care Chellanam, V R Jinson had a submitted a letter on April 7 to the chief engineer of irrigation department requesting to implement emergency protective measures at Bazar before the onset of monsoon. He did not get a reply and Chellanam saw one of the worst sea erosions in May and June. Two weeks back, he received a reply which detailed the many projects the government plans to implement in the region but did not have any answers to Jinson’s queries . “It took more than two months to get a reply from the irrigation department entrusted with implementing various projects to protect the coast. Nothing mentioned in the reply has been done there so far. All the houses including mine in Bazar stand vulnerable to the next sea erosion. Projects remain on paper.

Ghani said he believed “countless patriots would be martyred and the city of Kabul would be destroyed” if he had stayed behind. “The Taliban have won... and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen,” he said in a statement posted to Facebook. “They are now facing a new historical test. Either they will preserve the name and honour of Afghanistan or they will give priority to other places and networks,” he added. He didn’t say where he had travelled to, but Afghan media group Tolo news suggested he had gone to Tajikistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-says-fled-country-to-prevent-flood-of-bloodshed/articleshow/85358697.cms||---

---||India||Erendro a habitual trouble maker, deserves no compensation: Manipur||NEW DELHI: Manipur government on Sunday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying activist Leichombam Erendro, who was ordered to be released within six hours by the apex court on July 19, deserves no compensation as he faced no custodial violence during detention and accused him of habitually posting insulting comments on social media to incite trouble. In the late evening affidavit, the N Biren Singh government said it withdrew the May 17 order invoking National Security Act against Erendro on July 19, the day a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah gave the state just six hours to release the activist detained since May 13 for a social media post on the inefficacy of cow dung and urine against coronavirus after state BJP president Prof Tikendra Singh succumbed to Covid. The BJP government said neither the petitioner L Raghumani Singh nor Erendro have sought compensation in their petition filed before the SC. "The detenu was not subjected to any kind of custodial torture or violence. Hence, there exists no ground for payment of compensation for the two month detention of Erendro." Describing Erendro as an influential young social activist, the state narrated the series of social media posts by him since 2018 which had the potential to cause unrest among the general public. It referred to the 2018 video posted by Erendro on social media displaying he and his associates throwing eggs at the posters of PM Narendra Modi and the CM over the appointment of Manipur University vice-chancellor, which had become a ground for agitation in the state. Apart from several objectionable social media posts, the Manipur government through counsel P Ramesh Kumar said that a case of cheating and forgery has been registered against the social media activist on the complaint of a woman entrepreneur. Justifying the May 13 arrest of Erendro for the allegedly offensive social media post immediately after the death of state BJP president, the Manipur government said, "His statement of May 13 was in utter disregard of the sentiments of a certain section of the people. His statement was disrespectful, insulting, provoking and had the potential to incite hatred and chaos, thereby disturbing public tranquility and was in no way an attempt to quell misinformation regarding treatment of Covid-19 for the benefit of the public as was stated by the petitioner." "Erendro's arrest at that point of time was very essential to prevent him from indulging in posting further hatred and insulting comments on social media abusing his position as a social media and political activist," the state said. The issue relating to compensation will be taken up by a bench of Justices Chandrachud and Shah on Monday. The SC had ordered release of Erendro on July 19 on furnishing a personal bond and said in its order, "having prima facie considered the contents of the petition, we are of the view that the continued detention of the petitioner would amount to a violation of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. We accordingly direct that the petitioner shall be released forthwith as and by way of an interim direction of this Court, unless he is required to be in custody in any other case, subject to further orders, subject to his filing a personal release bond in the amount of Rs 1000."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/erendro-a-habitual-trouble-maker-deserves-no-compensation-manipur/articleshow/85358747.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Farmers fear pandemic could wipe off smiles floriculture gave them||By S Bhuvaneshwari BENGALURU: Farmers in pockets of perennially drought-stricken Pavagada taluk in Tumakuru district, who thought they had found solace in growing a variety of flowers after suffering huge losses from cultivating groundnut, are worried they will be back to square one given the Covid-19 situation and the series of lockdowns and restrictions. Mostly into groundnut cultivation, farmers recently realised that the crop required a lot of water and was prone to various pests and diseases. So, they switched to growing flowers like chrysanthemum, tuberose (sugandharaja), jasmine, crossandra (kanakambara) and marigold. While income from groundnut cultivation was highly uncertain, floriculture gave them assured returns on their investment, revealed Adisheha, a farmer from Neelammanahalli in the taluk. While the area under flower cultivation has increased from 118.5 hectares in 2014-15 to 300 hectares in 2020-21, the yield has also gone up from 1,125 tonnes to 2,342.8 tonnes during the period. Kannamedi, Devayyanapalya, Kamanadurga, Bellibatlu, Gujjanoodu and Neelammanahalli are now massively into floriculture. The flowers are transported to Hindupur, Rayadurga, Kalyandurg and Madakasira in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, Ballari, Shivamogga, Kolar, Bengaluru, Chitradurga, Hyderabad and Tumakuru. Farmers said they suffered huge losses during the series of lockdowns, but now that the latest one has been lifted, they are able to get better prices for their produce. Steady income Byadanuru Doddahatti Pujarappa, a farmer and president Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha taluk, told ToI, “I earn Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 a day growing flowers in the one acre of land I have. We lost lakhs of rupees during the lockdowns. We will literally be on the streets if the government imposes another one.” He said the government should help farmers by providing compensation in case another lockdown is imposed. Jampanna, a farmer in Kilaradahalli, recalled how he used to borrow money from private moneylenders when he grew groundnuts and how he was humiliated every time he defaulted. “But now I get Rs 800-900 a day selling crossandra flowers. I would have cleared all my loans if there were no lockdowns,” he said. He said that they get a steady income from flowers during the wedding season and festivals, but Covid-19 was snatching away their means of livelihood. “My wife also plucks flowers and makes garlands along with other labourers,” he said. Employment generation People from Pavagada taluk would generally migrate to cities like Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mysuru and other places in search of jobs due to drought leaving their children in the care of elderly parents back home. During the recent lockdowns, these migrants returned and most of them who had sunk borewells began growing flowers, vegetables, fruits and groundnuts. Plucking, making garlands and transporting them to the market are generating jobs in the area. Homemakers are also earning extra money by making garlands. Shivakumar MH, assistant director, horticulture department, said flowers are not as water intensive as other crops and the yield is also better if farmers use drip irrigation. He said tuberose and jasmine growers could beat lockdown difficulties by supplying oil extraction industries. He said the department has linked about 20 farmers to oil extraction units. He said under the National Horticulture Mission, a subsidy of Rs 6,000 per hectare for marigold, jasmine, crossandra, chrysanthemum and Rs 18,000 per hectare for tuberose is provided to flower growers. The last date for submitting applications for subsidy is August 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-farmers-fear-pandemic-could-wipe-off-smiles-floriculture-gave-them/articleshow/85358808.cms||---
---||Business||One Infosys – the secret to our success: Salil Parekh||BENGALURU: Infosys has solidly regained its bellwether status in the Indian IT industry. Its revenue growth rate has been the fastest among peers for some quarters now. The company's revenue was up 16.9% in constant currency for the quarter ended June 30, making it its best first quarter in a decade. It made a smart recovery from the depths of the pandemic a year back. Its share price is up 80% in the past year. The man at the helm, CEO Salil Parekh, has delivered on the three-year transformation that he promised when he set foot in 2018. In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Parekh talks about what made the difference. Excerpts: At the end of the three-year transformation plan, you've landed Infosys in acceleration mode. Infosys is doing better than almost all your peers. What do you think was key to accomplishing this?It’s thanks to all the work that everyone in the company has done with a big focus on digital. The key element has been bringing all of Infosys’s capabilities together – what we call One Infosys. And there are specific elements, like our cloud services offering Cobalt, where we are way ahead of some of our peers. Almost every new work that we start has some element of Cobalt, which has 200 industry templates and 14,000 cloud assets. Our focus is also to remain very close to clients. Can you elaborate on One Infosys?It’s soft and difficult for us to make clear. But what it does is, the whole company is working together on everything. In many of the large transformation programmes, it’s the whole capability set that comes together to make the difference, unlike earlier, when only some elements would be there. The good part is, within Infosys, we have leading capabilities in 8 or 9 areas that require us to make this work. And within digital, we have leading capabilities in about 30 areas, across cloud, data, and analytics, AI, automation, cybersecurity, IoT. Infosys has surpassed TCS in constant currency revenue growth for the last eight quarters. But TCS has retained its margin leadership. Is your growth going to come at lower margins?We are helping clients navigate their next, and the more we feel we are relevant for clients within the operating margin guidance, we will not look at other things. Within the industry, we have margin leadership. We are very clear that we are going to be a high-margin business and that’s never in doubt. The priority is what is right for clients and employees. In the last three years, Infosys has closed a TCV of $32.5 billion with $16.8 billion as the new net. Is the acceleration from cloud migration and other cloud-related platform deals aiding this tailwind even as you’re betting big on the agile digital portfolio?The first is reskilling and we continue to expand it within the company. Besides the platform that we have put in place, individuals on their own are driving their reskilling. We will be hiring 35,000 college graduates this year of which 3,000 will be outside India. Localisation, digital capabilities, and centres of excellence -- each of these focused on horizontals -- data and analytics, cybersecurity, and verticals focused on retirement services and mortgage processing -- has given us a good mix on some of the large deal wins. Is the mega-deals (over $1 billion) upcycle showing signs of saturation? Or are big deals becoming the norm?We have in our large deal vocabulary everything above $50 million, and that is what we talk about. We see a good pipeline of that. What you’re calling mega deals, the periodicity is different. On an annual basis, we see a good pipeline and we see that level of transformation with the client. We have been fortunate that clients have looked at us to give more and more work. Digital transformation was happening even before the pandemic. But since then, even those who were behind in it, want to catch up. It’s a huge modernisation effort. Profitability per employee has increased for Accenture and Infosys at $10,100 and $10,065 respectively in 2020-21 financial year, a jump of 4% and 4.5% over the previous one. How important is it to recognise returns on talent?What it demonstrates is what we are doing in terms of creating value with talent and not just with capital, and that’s key for Infosys. How do we make sure that training is best in class! That’s the way the founders have looked at the business. If you look at our peers, there is not that much focus on training. There is a very clear difference across industries and this is the reason we are seeing tremendous industry-leading growth and the value we are creating. Revenue from North America has increased to $8.3 billion from $6.3 billion in the last five years, while Europe is still a slow starter at $3.3 billion from $2.2 billion. What are the divergent trends playing out in these markets?Last quarter, we saw broad-based growth across sectors. Many of our dominant sectors like banking, manufacturing, hi-tech, life sciences are doing well. All elements are in good shape and all those industries are coming back nicely. In geographies, the US and the UK are doing well, while Continental Europe is coming out quite well and summer is progressing. Growth is quite good across the board. Many IT firms fired their bench during the pandemic last year. You’re at 88% employee utilisation. Does the limited bench make it difficult to fill critical positions in large deals?That’s not a concern for us, but several other companies have some concerns. We didn’t take any action on the bench in the first phase of Covid like many of our peers did at that time. So the bench has given us some level of flexibility. And there is now a lot of inflow both at the college level and the lateral level which is also helping us. How much of a concern is attrition to you? Is it impacting customer deliverables?Compared to the industry, we are at the lower end of attrition levels. It has not impacted the work with our clients because of the massive inflow of new talent. We have also put in place many actions to tackle attrition—the way we connect with our employees, our compensation plans, our focused programmes on different skills. Fresher salaries have barely moved beyond the Rs 3.5 lakh mark for years ...Last year, that was where we were. At this stage, there’s no change in that. But there are significant changes for other levels. How is the hybrid experiment working for Infosys?We have continued with the work-from-home approach. We have opened our campus locations as we go through this. We have to be very clear about how different groups of employees are looking at this. There are various employee groups at different stages – some have older family members, while others have younger members. We should create an environment where each person feels safe, comfortable, and confident. We have enabled flexible or hybrid policy to our overall HR approach. We have 2.6 lakh employees and in different locations, things are evolving somewhat differently. Clients are also evolving in their thinking and they want to make sure we support them—we want to keep the client's position and employee safety in mind. Well-funded startups are driving up salaries. There's a supply crunch and exacerbated comfort on work-from-home has attracted global firms to tap into Indian tech talent. What are the perks you’re offering to retain talent?There is a lot of tech change which is a big positive for the country. What we are doing is expanding the ESOP plan to different levels in the company. We are putting in place methods for employees to benefit from their skills and digital tags in terms of what they are building. We are creating more flexibility and are seeing that there is tremendous value employees place on the foundation and growth that they are seeing within the company. There are 22 unicorns in India and more are getting added to the list. Many consumer startups are going IPO. Do you see them as potential customers and how do you want to be a part of their journey?They are doing so well and huge congratulations to them as they are truly innovative in the way they are leveraging tech. We would love to work with them as and when it makes sense. What are the new trends in GCCs versus third-party IT providers?We are supporting them even as they are growing their centres. We have services that allow for scaling of a centre in India, building some of the methodologies on how the projects should be done. For instance, if we have done some work on agile development, the best practices can be replicated at the centres. And as they scale up, we will have a strong partnership going forward. Japanese conglomerate Hitachi bought GlobalLogic for $9.6-billion, one of the biggest acquisitions in the digital engineering services space. Epam has seen spectacular results recently. However, Infosys has had a subdued performance in engineering services. How are you reenergizing it?We don’t break up growth. Engineering services is a large service offering that was built over the last several years focused on tech, semiconductor, and medical devices, and growth today is quite strong. We are not talking about taking the business out separately nor looking at unusual valuations. So much is going well for you, but there continues to be a lot of criticism around the income-tax portal glitches in India. Where does the fault lie – at your end, or does the government keep changing specifications?Many of the areas which required attention at the start, we have spent time on a lot of those things and they are working well today. We are working collaboratively with the department, with the association of CAs, and with a group of individual taxpayers, to make sure we create a great new experience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/working-to-create-great-tax-portal-infosys-ceo-salil-parekh/articleshow/85358803.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

A fire inspector, who was at the spot dousing flames, was injured when he fell from the second floor and landed on the first floor of the building. He has received shoulder and leg injuries and his condition is stated to be stable, officials said. No one else was injured in the incident but several vehicles parked near the chemical factory at Pandav Nagar have been damaged. The blaze was first noticed around 9.30 am and within minutes, flames spread to an adjacent factory, damaging parts of it. More than 15 fire tenders from Ghaziabad and Noida were called in and it took over five hours to contain the blaze. Sunil Kumar Singh, the chief fire officer (CFO), Ghaziabad, said: “We sent a few fire tenders to the spot after getting information from local people. As the flames started spreading, more fire engines were called in from other parts of Ghaziabad and the neighbouring district of Gautam Budh Nagar. No factory worker was injured in the blaze.” Yogendra Purusharth, an inspector with the fire department, was injured in the fire fighting operation. “A portion of the chemical factory’s roof had collapsed and a few iron roads were lying on the second floor of the building. While trying to douse the flames, Yogendra stumbled and fell from the second floor. He landed on the first floor and received some injuries. The officer is being treted at a hospital and his condition is stated to be stable,” Singh said. According to local people, smoke from the factory could be seen from a distance of 4-5 km. The fire spread quickly as a lot of flammable items were kept on the premises of the chemical factory, Singh said. He added that a probe has been ordered to ascertain the exact cause of the blaze. Factory officials said, initial estimates suggest that the loss amounts to around Rs 20 lakh. In another incident on Sunday afternoon, a fire broke out at a chemical factory near GT Road. Singh said that they got information about the incident around 2.45 pm. “Seven fire tenders were sent to the spot and it took about 45 minutes to douse the flames. No casualties have been reported and we are trying to find out what caused the blaze,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/officer-falls-off-2nd-floor-in-firefight/articleshow/85354740.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Ghaziabad||Long snarls on I-Day-eve as Delhi seals borders with Gzb||Ghaziabad: Commuters bore the brunt as Delhi Police started sealing the capital’s borders for Independence Day celebrations from Saturday night itself. The queue of vehicles stretched 4-5km as three of the four border points with Ghaziabad were sealed and the traffic from all these roads was diverted onto a single route. Around 8.30pm on Saturday, commuters were in for a shock when Delhi Police closed the border points near EDM Mall, Maharajpur-Anand Vihar and Surya Nagar in Ghaziabad. They were closed through Sunday morning as well. While two of the points were opened in the afternoon, the third remained sealed till the evening. Strict checking of vehicles over the past two days had anyway slowed down traffic to Delhi, but the border points hadn’t been closed till Saturday night. Stuck in the snarl, commuters took to social media to post pictures of the long queue of vehicles and vent out their anger at the lack of traffic management. Ghaziabad SSP Amit Pathak and SP (traffic) Ramanand Kushwaha inspected the choke points as around 300 police personnel helped the traffic move, although at snail’s pace. Vehicles from the three border points were diverted towards Seemapuri via Mohan Nagar. A traffic mess was inevitable as the road — the only thoroughfare between Delhi and Ghaziabad — was choked with the huge number of vehicles that had converged on it. Caught unawares, commuters either sweated it out in the snarl or took a turn to spend the night at a friend’s or relative’s place. Most reached Delhi around midnight or later. Delhi resident Akansha Srivastava had come to visit a relative in Ghaziabad on Saturday afternoon but got late on her return. “By the time I booked a cab, it was 8pm. The driver, too, was not aware that the three border points had been sealed. I was on the road for more than three and a half hours. I reached home only around 11.30pm,” she said. Mohit Raj, a CA from Delhi, had come to meet his client in Kavi Nagar. Stuck in the jam, he decided to spend the night with a relative. SP (traffic) Kushwaha said they hadn’t received any intimation from Delhi Police that the borders would be sealed. “We diverted the traffic towards Seemapuri and urged people to have patience. I was getting hundreds of calls on my official number,” he added. Around 2.30pm on Sunday, when Independence Day celebrations in Delhi were over, the border points near EDM Mall and Surya Nagar were opened but the one near Anand Vihar continued to be sealed till the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/long-snarls-on-i-day-eve-as-delhi-seals-borders-with-gzb/articleshow/85354760.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Mysuru||Mysuru: 50% of kids already infected, sero study suggests||MYSURU: Citing a sero survey conducted as part of paediatric Covaxin vaccine trials in Mysuru district and social, emotional, and nutritional disorders faced by children, experts are pushing for the resumption of on-campus classes in schools. The government ordered schools shut in March last year as a preventive measure against the pandemic and regular classes for lower grades have not been conducted since. Dr Pradeep N, associate professor, department of paediatrics, Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute, said the sero-surveillance study has shown that more than 50% of children have already been infected with the virus. “As part of our Covaxin paediatric trials, we conducted IgG antibody tests as a screening measure on more than 200 children. Of them, only 88 were eligible to take the vaccine as the rest tested positive for antibodies. Surprisingly, none of the positive kids showed any symptoms of the infection,” Dr Pradeep told TOI. He said the positivity rate is higher among younger age groups. It is around 60% in kids between zero and six years, 50% in children between six and 12 years and 40% in children between 12 and 18 years. He said the data suggests most children will be asymptomatic or will have mild symptoms even if they contract the infection. Strongly advocating reopening of schools, he said not only has there been an increase in child labour, child marriages and malnutrition, but children are also facing psychological issues like depression, temper tantrums, and other behavioural disorders which predispose them to psychiatric illnesses like anxiety, stress and mood disorders in their adulthood. “Also, nutritional disorders like obesity, being overweight and malnutrition are increasing, and they are predictors of systemic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease in adulthood,” he said. “However, we need to take some precautions in high-risk children like those with congenital heart diseases, chronic asthma, chronic renal failure, and other chronic illnesses which are seen in less than 1% of the paediatric population.” Ashvini Ranjan, Trustee, Pratham Mysore, which works in the primary education sector, said schools should re-start in a small geography initially. “Based on how things go, schools can be reopened in other places. It will give a real picture. The government should take a decision taking parents and the community at large on board,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-50-of-kids-already-infected-sero-study-suggests/articleshow/85358890.cms||Shrinivasa M

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Officials put brakes on 11 luxury cars cruising without life tax||HYDERABAD: Eleven high-end imported cars including Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Maserati, each costing anywhere between Rs 4 crore and 10 crore, were seized on Sunday by road transport officials for evading nearly Rs 5 crore in road taxes. Out of the 15 cars intercepted on Sunday, only 4 had paid the life tax. Officials said that the cars, some of them pre-owned, were bought and registered in other states due to lower taxes. Registered in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the 11 vehicles have been plying on Hyderabad roads without paying life tax in Telangana, officials said. The vehicles, mostly owned by families of politicians and industrialists from the state, have been under radar of authorities who have been collecting CCTV proof for the last six months. The drivers, mostly in the age group of 25-35, used to travel together during weekends. The vigilance wing finally zeroed in on them on Sunday morning after a tip-off that the group had hit the road and were heading from Jubilee Hills towards Novotel, Shamshabad. “We have registered cases against 11 vehicles plying without paying Telangana life tax. They have been living and plying in Hyderabad. We have enough evidence for it. These cars belong to other states. We are also requesting the parents of the youngsters to ensure that these youngsters do not speed,” said enforcement officer Papa Rao who led the team from transport department along with the police. Some of these cars had other traffic violation penalties against them too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-officials-put-brakes-on-11-luxury-cars-cruising-without-life-tax/articleshow/85358956.cms||Amrita Didyala

Most of the Covid-19 disease burden was contributed by Years of Life Lost (YLL). Losses due to Years of Potential Productive Life Lost (YPPLL) were reduced as the impact of Covid-19 infection was relatively lesser among productive cohorts. CPL values for 40-49-yearolds were the highest. “The productivity losses (CPL) calculated for the working population revealed a loss of Rs 141.95 crore and Rs 27.82 crore till June 10, 2021, for men and women respectively. Also, people aged from 40 to 49 constitute about 58.98% (men) and 58.73% (women) of the total CPL values (for premature mortality) of men and women respectively,” said Denny John, adjunct assistant professor, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences & Research Centre and co-author of the study ‘Estimation of the economic burden of Covid-19 using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and Productivity Losses in Kerala, India’ that is in preprint in the journal BMJ Open. From beginning of Covid-19, the focus globally has been on the prevention of transmission and treatment of the disease. The pandemic has had a huge impact on the economy and stressed the health care systems worldwide. The present study estimates Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), YPPLL and CPL due to premature mortality and absenteeism, secondary to Covid-19 in Kerala. For the study, the impact of disease on various agegender cohorts was analyzed and it showed that the severity of infection and mortality were higher among the older people, with men being more susceptible than women in most sub-groups. This might be due to the lifestyle, exposure at work, and management of hygiene practices. Older adults are at higher risk due to the prevalence of comorbidities. The DALYs for men and women were 15,954.5 and 8,638.4 till November 15, 2020, and 83,853.0 and 56,628.3 till June 10, 2021. The corresponding YPPLL were 1,323.57 and 612.31 till November 15, 2020, and 6,993.04 and 3,811.57 till June 10, 2021. “These estimates provide the figures and data necessary for policymakers to work on, in order to reduce the economic burden of Covid-19 in Kerala,” added John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cost-of-productivity-lost-in-kerala-is-rs-170-crore/articleshow/85358911.cms||Preetu Nair

With the lockdown easing after the second wave, fitness groups under the umbrella of Noida Express Cyclists (NEC) and Noida Express Walkers (NEW) started trooping onto the streets. On Sunday, the cyclists rode 75km to mark India’s 75th freedom anniversary. As a run-up, two cycling challenges were held in June. In the first one, the target was to complete 300km in the first week while in the other, 550km was the target. In the first challenge, 13 members accomplished the goal and in the second challenge seven pairs achieved the target. According to founder and moderator of both groups which have about 300 active members, Pradeep Panda, “In cycling, social distancing is automatically maintained, while in walking there was a fear of proximity. Therefore, we encouraged solo walking instead of in a group.” Similarly, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), organised a cycling event, NOFAATHON, with over 25 riders from 10 highrise societies. The event also covered a distance of 75km. The ride started at 4.30am from Manav Rachana School in Sector 51 and ended at 9am at Meghdutam Park in Sector 50. According to Rajiva Singh, NOFAA president, “The cyclists were enthused but did complain about potholes, lack of proper cycling tracks and safety of riders in the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/cyclists-ride-75km-to-mark-75th-independence-day/articleshow/85355168.cms||---

Following the cluster outbreak, officials have sealed down the village. Sources say, 11 days ago, locals had gathered in large numbers for the final rites of a person who had died. When a few people who attended the final rites developed Covid-19 symptoms three days ago, they and many others in the village took the Covid. Now, 25 have tested positive. To prevent infections from spreading further, the taluk administration sealed down the village and the health department carried out a sanitisation exercise on Saturday. Authorities say all who tested positive are recovering and none have needed to be admitted in hospital. On Saturday former minister, CS Puttaraju, who is the local MLA, visited the village and reviewed the situation. Ningaraju, vice-president of the gram panchayat, said all the infected are in home isolation. “All are now recovering, and the village has been sealed down. There is no need to worry,” Ningaraju said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-village-in-mandya-sealed-following-cluster-outbreak/articleshow/85359025.cms||---

The Google Doodle page reads: “In 1923, Chauhan’s unyielding activism led her to become the first woman satyagrahi, a member of the Indian collective of nonviolent anti-colonialists to be arrested in the struggle for national liberation. She continued to make revolutionary statements in the fight for freedom both on and off the page into the 1940s, publishing a total of 88 poems and 46 short stories,” Chauhan's poem 'Jhansi ki Rani', which describes the life of Rani Lakhmi Bai, is one of the most recited and sung poems in Hindi literature. She was born in a Rajput family in Uttar Pradesh's Nihalpur village in 1904. She passed the middle-school examination from Crosthwaite Girls' School in Prayagraj in 1919. After her marriage with Thakur Lakshman Singh Chauhan of Khandwa, she joined Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement against the British and became the first woman satyagrahi of the country. She was jailed twice for her involvement in protests against British rule in 1923 and 1942. She has started writing from an early age. Her first poem was published when she was just nine-year-old. As a participant of the Indian National Movement, she used her influential writing and poems as the weapon to motivate others. Her pieces depicted the hardships and challenges faced by Indian women during the freedom movement of India. Chauhan wrote in the Khariboli dialect of Hindi. She has also written poems for children and some short stories based on the life of the middle-class of the society. Chauhan passed away on February 15 in 1948. In honour of her exemplary work, an Indian Coast Guard ship was named after her. The government of Madhya Pradesh placed a statue of hers before the Municipal Corporation office of Jabalpur.

Air India Express has opened booking of tickets for this flight on its website. KV Rajendra, Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner, said a dry run at the rapid lab has commenced, and several people have been tested. There is a provision to conduct 30 tests at a time, and the test costs around Rs 3,700. With this facility, MIA will help numerous passengers bound for Dubai, who otherwise had to depend on other airports in the country to get there. UAE’s ban on flights from India, which kicked in on April 25, was lifted on August 5 but MIA could not schedule even a single flight due to the non-availability of the rapid RT-PCR test facility at the airport. Currently, the rapid RTPCR test is one of the main requirements for Dubai residence permit holders to enter the UAE. Wilfred Olivera, a resident of Kuloor and who lives 6km from MIA, said he had to book tickets from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai, to travel to Dubai. “I would have saved money and time if the facility was available at MIA. I am happy that travellers like me will not be burdened now,” he said. A passenger who recently travelled to Dubai via Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), said, “At KIA, the rapid RT-PCR test costs about Rs 3,200.” An MIA spokesperson said that the facility will be maintained by a private firm. “However, we have not announced the official date from when the facility will be available. We are not aware about Air India Express opening slots for ticket booking to Dubai,” the spokesperson added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/overseas-travellers-breathe-easy-as-mangalore-international-airport-finally-sets-up-rt-pcr-testing-facility/articleshow/85359086.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Chennai||Struggle for independence began from Tamil soil: CM MK Stalin||CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin on Sunday said the state government will undertake an exercise to document the contribution of Tamils in the Indian Independence struggle. The documentation will be undertaken in both Tamil and English, Stalin said on Sunday, after unfurling the national flag at Fort St George in Chennai for the first time. “This is the sixth time our government (DMK government) has come to power in the state. I have completed 50 years in public life. I am happy that people have recognised my public service and have given me this honour,” Stalin said in his first Independence Day address as chief minister, while thanking the people of the state for bestowing their confidence in him. “We are celebrating 75 years of independence. But the struggle for independence started 150 years prior to that from our Tamil soil,” chief minister Stalin said, while explaining the need to document their struggle. An RPF contingent at at Railway Ground, PeramburChief minister Stalin named several important freedom fighters, including Veerapandia Kattabomman, Poolithevar, Velunaachiar, Dheeran Chinnamalai and the Marudhu brothers, who contributed their might in the country’s Independence struggle. He said the ‘commemorative pillar’, erected by the state government to mark the 75 years (diamond jubilee) of Indian independence, is not just made up of cement and steel but represents the ‘heart & soul’ of the martyrs and freedom fighters. The commemorative pillar has come up at the intersection of Kamarajar Salai and Sivanandha Salai near Napier bridge. “These martyrs and freedom fighters do not just belong to Tamil Nadu. They belong to entire India. Tamil Nadu has been in the forefront of honouring and taking care of the welfare of the freedom fighters and martyrs,” Stalin said, while announcing the enhancement of the state pension to freedom fighters and their families to Rs 18,000 (Rs 17,000) and Rs 9,000 (Rs 8,500). He also said the Mahatma Gandhi Museum in Madurai will be upgraded at a cost of Rs 6 crore in such a way to attract even youngsters towards Gandhian principles Recalling the initiatives taken by the state government since he became chief minister, Stalin said whether it is the cabinet meetings or those attended by the experts, he has been stressing the need to work to achieve equitable growth for all. “Whether it is the economics of the state or the individuals, it should be self-sufficient,” he said. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit, who hosted the Independence Day reception for chief minister Stalin and his cabinet colleagues and other dignitaries, congratulated the frontline workers for tirelessly working towards combating the Covid second wave.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken also made a series of calls to the counterparts of his key allies. India was not one of them. Simultaneously more than 60 countries led by the United States and the European Union issued a joint statement urging those in positions of power and authority across Afghanistan to bear responsibility and accountability for the protection of human life and property, and for the immediate restoration of security and civil order. “At present we are completing a series of steps to secure the Hamid Karzai International Airport to enable the safe departure of US and allied personnel from Afghanistan via civilian and military flights,” said a joint statement issued by the Department of State and the Defense Department. “Over the next 48 hours, we will have expanded our security presence to nearly 6,000 troops, with a mission focused solely on facilitating these efforts and will be taking over air traffic control. Tomorrow and over the coming days, we will be transferring out of the country thousands of American citizens who have been resident in Afghanistan, as well as locally employed staff of the US mission in Kabul and their families and other particularly vulnerable Afghan nationals,” it said. “We will accelerate the evacuation of thousands of Afghans eligible for US Special Immigrant Visas, nearly 2,000 of whom have already arrived in the United States over the past two weeks. For all categories, Afghans who have cleared security screening will continue to be transferred directly to the United States. And we will find additional locations for those yet to be screened,” the statement said. The State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said that Blinken spoke separately with his counterparts from Australia, France, Germany and Norway about developments in Afghanistan, including the security situation. “They also discussed our efforts to bring our citizens to safety and assist vulnerable Afghans,” he said. Price also said that the safe evacuation of all American Embassy personnel is now complete. “We can confirm that the safe evacuation of all Embassy personnel is now complete. All Embassy personnel are located on the premises of Hamid Karzai International Airport, whose perimeter is secured by the US Military," he said. In a joint statement, more than 60 countries led by the US said that given the deteriorating security situation, they support, are working to secure and call on all parties to respect and facilitate, the safe and orderly departure of foreign nationals and Afghans who wish to leave the country. “Those in positions of power and authority across Afghanistan bear responsibility and accountability for the protection of human life and property, and for the immediate restoration of security and civil order,” the joint statement said. “Afghans and international citizens who wish to depart must be allowed to do so; roads, airports and border crossing must remain open, and calm must be maintained. The Afghan people deserve to live in safety, security and dignity. We in the international community stand ready to assist them,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-to-expand-its-security-presence-at-kabul-airport-to-6000-troops/articleshow/85359016.cms||---

---||World||The rise and fall of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani||KABUL: As the Taliban militants moved into Kabul on Sunday, President Ashraf Ghani flew out of the country without saying where he was going. According to media reports, Ghani had flown to Uzbekistan. “The former president of Afghanistan left Afghanistan, leaving the country in this difficult situation," said Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the Afghan National Reconciliation Council. "God should hold him accountable.” "To avoid bloodshed""To avoid bloodshed, I thought it would be better to leave," Ghani said on Facebook in his first comments. "The Taliban have won with the judgement of their swords and guns, and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen," he said in a statement posted to Facebook. Expert on failed statesA US-trained anthropologist, Ghani, 72, holds a doctorate from New York City's Columbia University and was named one of the "World's Top 100 Global Thinkers" by Foreign Policy magazine in 2010. He spent almost a quarter of a century outside Afghanistan during the tumultuous decades of Soviet rule, civil war and the Taliban's years in power. During that period, he worked as an academic in the United States and later with the World Bank and the United Nations across East and South Asia. Ghani prided himself on being one of the foremost global experts on failed states, only to watch his administration collapse. He was elected in 2014 on promises to remake Afghanistan. But the 72-year-old may ultimately be remembered for making little headway against the deep-rooted government corruption that likely underwrote his demise. In his last years in office, Ghani watched as he was first cut off from talks between Washington and the Taliban that paved the way for the US exit from Afghanistan, and then forced by his American allies to release 5,000 hardened insurgents to lock down a peace deal that never materialised. Dismissed as a "puppet" by the Taliban, Ghani was left with little leverage during his final months in the presidential palace, and resorted to delivering screeching televised diatribes that did little to improve his reputation with Afghans. He has variously been described as visionary, short-tempered, academic, and overly demanding. Renowned for his intensity and energy, Ghani introduced a new currency, set up a tax system, encouraged wealthy expat Afghans to return home, and cajoled donors as the country emerged from the austere Taliban era. But he also earned the divisive reputation that dogged him until the end. "He never allowed anyone to get too close, remaining aloof," wrote veteran author Ahmed Rashid, who has known him for nearly three decades. "Unfortunately his explosions of bad temper and displays of arrogance with fellow Afghans and Westerners were all too frequent and soon made him a loathed figure." Ghani is married to Rula, whom he met while studying for his first degree at the American University in Lebanon, and has two children. He maintained a disciplined daily routine since losing part of his stomach to cancer, leaving him to nibble on snacks as he is unable to digest a full meal. A Pashtun, he started using his tribal name Ahmadzai a couple of years ago to underline his background, though he stresses the importance of unifying Afghanistan's disparate ethnic groups. After performing poorly in the 2009 election, Ghani shocked many Afghans in 2014 by winning after choosing as a running mate General Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek warlord accused of numerous human rights abuses.

She was produced before a court in Saidapet and remanded in judicial custody till August 27. She will be lodged in Puzhal prison. Police said her friend Abhisek Shyam was also arrested. He was seen with the actor in a video, in which she used a casteist slur. He will be remanded on Monday. Meera Mithun was arrested by Chennai police on Saturday in Alapuzha in connection with her controversial castiest slur in a social media post. She was summoned by the police to which she failed to turn up. The cybercrime police launched a hunt for her and found her location. Soon after she was picked up, she released a video in which she claimed that police were harassing her.

---||Chennai||No more free lunch, gift for MLAs in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: The MLAs strolling along corridors of the assembly hall, carrying gift wrapped packages or relishing sumptuous biryani for lunch during the month-long budget session may be a thing of the past. Call it austerity, the first-time chief minister M K Stalin seems to have issued stern instructions to department heads and ministers to do away with the practice. The MLAs will have to either make their own arrangements for meals or rely on the assembly pantry. Beyond the fiery debates and walkouts, the budget session of the assembly had been famous for the lunches provided by each department for MLAs, ministers and staff, police, the Secretariat staff and journalists, when their demand for grants was taken up during the month-long session. It has been the practice for more than a decade, when members too, get high-cost gifts from the minister, who moves the demand for grants for his department. “The Assembly is the highest forum for law making and intellectual debates and known for its simplicity. But these gifts and sumptuous meals tend to lower its dignity and decorum,” said a senior bureaucrat. The demands will be taken up for debate between August 23 and September 21. Each department would have spent nearly Rs three lakh a day to feed more than 1,000 people, and there were occasions when MLAs were served breakfast at the Chepauk hostel. There are no budgetary provisions for the lunch served during the budget debate, but the departments intended to make the members happy with a lavish spread of vegetarian and nonvegetarian dishes from top restaurants and the expenses were brought under different account heads, sources said. The opposition MLAs preferred meals in their party offices at the Secretariat complex with arrangements of their own. From high-cost suitcases to trolley bags, watches to electronic goods, handicraft items to ornamental fishes and fish boxes, Aavin products to spices and forest products, milletbased products to traditional rice varieties, the MLAs were pampered by the ministers. “The members would sign the registers kept in the library and get the gifts from the departmental staff,” said a former MLA. The sources said the cost of lunch and gifts shot up after the demise of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and when ministers enjoyed clout in the day-to-day affairs of the departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-austerity-marks-budget-session-no-more-free-lunch-gift-for-mlas/articleshow/85359361.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Ghaziabad||Health lab in Ghaziabad looks at upgrade; more staff, equipment to be added||GHAZIABAD: The regional public health laboratory running under the district’s Integrated Diseases Surveillance Programme (IDSP) at MMG District Hospital is now going to be upgraded. The lab in Ghaziabad is the second such facility in the state after Lucknow. At present, tests for dengue, chikungunya, malaria and swine flu are being done here. After upgradation, tests for viral hepatitis, A and E, measles, blood culture and cholera would also be done, besides comprehensive testing of water samples. District surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said that the lab was established long back in the district and was working with the IDSP. “Regional public health labs are present only in two districts in the state. Till now, the lab in Ghaziabad was not functioning at its full strength due to various reasons. Recently, with an aim to increase the ambit of the laboratory, the matter was raised with the district administration, which in turn has written to the director of the National Health Mission to provide human resources and equipment,” the DSO added. At present, a microbiologist is working at the lab and some lab technicians from other wings have been deputed here. In the letter, the health department has demanded more lab technicians, assistants and supporting staff, besides the equipment. Dr Gupta told TOI that in place of rapid tests for dengue, they will be able to carry out Elisa tests for the disease, which is confirmatory in nature. “The lab would help us in collecting data of prevalent diseases and framing policies and preventive measures accordingly.” About two years ago, a central government team had recommended upgrading the lab after an inspection, but due to the pandemic, it could not be implemented. With the upgrade of the lab, the residents of the district will be able to get rid of expensive tests at private labs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/health-lab-in-ghaziabad-looks-at-upgrade-more-staff-equipment-to-be-added/articleshow/85359374.cms||Aditya Dev

He said the medals won by the women players in the recent Tokyo Olympics are an example to showcase the power of women. Surendra Sriram along with the immediate past president of GRT-86, Lanka Kranti Sekhar, distributed stationery and confectionery to the girl children at Amodini Girls' Home near Kaja village on the occasion of the 75th Independence Day on Sunday. Addressing the children and faculty, Kranti Sekhar said Round Table was at the forefront of encouraging the girl children in pursuing their dreams.  He assured that they would extend their fullest support to the girl children in continuing their higher studies. He said that they had taken exclusive programmes for the benefit of the girl students in several schools in the district as they wanted to make them feel secure in attending the classes.  Though the schools were shut due to the Covid-19 for the past 15 months, Kranti Sekhar hoped that the coming days would be brighter for the children. He said that GRT had readied an action plan in association with Ladies Circle and its members to provide support to the children. He wanted the children not to get discouraged at any stage of their student career and face the challenges with courage. He said that success was not far away for those who are brave enough to tackle the challenges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/empowerment-of-girls-will-make-india-more-powerful-grt-chairman-surendra-sriram/articleshow/85359460.cms||Samdani MN

The current lockdown was due to end on Thursday night but will now run until Sept. 2, Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne, the state capital. The state on Monday reported 22 local cases, down from 25 a day earlier. "The rules don't kick in until midnight, but I'm asking people to observe that curfew from 9pm tonight," Andrews said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australia-extends-covid-19-lockdown-in-melbourne-reinstates-night-curfew/articleshow/85359332.cms||---

In Les Cayes, as in other hard-hit cities on the southwestern peninsula, most of the population spent the night sleeping outdoors in front of their houses -- or what remained of them -- amid fears of new aftershocks. The streets there were filled with the grinding sounds of heavy equipment lifting debris from collapsed buildings, as well as the quieter sounds of people pulling away rubble by hand in desperate searches for the missing. "Thanks to God and also to my phone, I'm alive," said Marcel Francois, who was rescued from his collapsed two-story home in hard-hit Les Cayes. His younger brother Job Francois said a desperate-sounding Marcel had called to say, "'Come save me, I'm under the concrete'... He told me he couldn't breathe, that he was dying." The neighbors and Job spent hours freeing him and his 10-year-old daughter from the heavy debris. But at least 1,297 people were killed in the 7.2-magnitude tremor that struck Saturday about 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the west of the densely populated capital Port-au-Prince, which was devastated in a massive 2010 quake. Some 13,600 buildings were destroyed and over 13,700 damaged, trapping hundreds under rubble and leaving more than 5,700 people injured, the country's civil protection agency said in an update. Rescuers face new pressure as Tropical Depression Grace approaches, raising fears of torrential rainfall, flash floods and mudslides from late Monday, according to the US National Weather Service. The United States and other nations have pledged to help Haiti cope with this latest disaster. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman spoke with Haiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henry on Sunday to reiterate Washington's support and said the United States was "already putting resources in place" to bolster the beleaguered country's emergency response, spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. USAID head Samantha Power tweeted Sunday that her agency had deployed a 65-person urban search and rescue team -- equipped with "specialized tools, equipment & medical supplies" -- to join an earthquake disaster response team already in Haiti. Haiti's neighbor the Dominican Republic said it was shipping 10,000 food rations and medical equipment. Mexico also sent an aid shipment. Cuba and Ecuador dispatched medical or search-and-rescue teams. And Chile, Argentina, Peru and Venezuela also offered help, as did the United Nations. "We want to plan a better adapted response than in 2010 after the earthquake -- all aid coming from abroad should be coordinated by the Civil Protection agency," said Henry. A 7.0-magnitude quake in January 2010 left much of Port-au-Prince and nearby cities in ruins, killing more than 200,000. More than 1.5 million Haitians were made homeless in that disaster, which also destroyed 60 percent of Haiti's healthcare system, leaving island authorities and the international humanitarian community with a colossal challenge. The latest quake comes just over a month after President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home by a team of gunmen, shaking a country already battling poverty, spiraling gang violence and Covid-19. Police say they have arrested 44 people in connection with the killing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/death-toll-in-massive-haiti-quake-jumps-to-over-1200/articleshow/85359292.cms||---

He also asked the government to initiate action, after detailed enquiry, against officials, who allowed a free run for Sterlite and construct a memorial for the 13 people shot dead in police firing in Tuticorin. In a statement, Kamal recalled that chief minister M K Stalin in 2018 had asked for shifting the Sterlite plant permanently from the state and also to issue guidelines for the operations of copper industries in the state. “The DMK government, as part of its election promise, should immediately take steps to shift the Sterlite Copper plant out of Tamil Nadu. It should pass a special resolution in the state assembly in the current session itself and send a copy of the resolution to the Supreme Court,” Kamal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kamal-haasan-seeks-resolution-on-shifting-out-sterlite-plant-from-tamil-nadu/articleshow/85359549.cms||---

---||World||Taliban confirms no danger to embassies, foreign nationals in Kabul||KABUL: Following the collapse of Kabul to the Taliban, a spokesman of the insurgent group stressed that there was no danger to embassies, diplomatic missions and foreign nationals in the Afghan capital, pledging that the militant group will maintain security across the country. "We assure all embassies, diplomatic missions, institutions and residences of foreign nationals in Kabul that there is no danger to them," a news agency quoted Muhammad Naeem, a spokesman for the Taliban's political office in Doha, as saying on Sunday evening. He stressed that the forces of the Taliban movement are tasked with maintaining security in Kabul and other cities in the country. The announcement came as the Hamid Karzai International Airport was packed with tens of passengers awaiting flights out of the country who then took to the runway but found no plane and are still stuck there. After days of capturing provincial capital cities, the Taliban started entering Kabul from all sides on Sunday morning. Though the Taliban had earlier said that there is no plan to enter the Afghan capital militarily, the security vacuum in Kabul made them direct their fighters to enter and occupy the empty police outposts and police districts. As Afghan President Ashraf Ghani along with his close aides and the first lady left Kabul for Tajikistan, the Taliban also managed to enter the Presidential Palace or Arg. To avoid the power vacuum created after Ghani's escape, head of High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah, former President Hamid Karzai and head of Hezb-e-Islami Gulbadin Hekmatyar came together and formed a temporary council, said a Khaama Press report on Sunday night. The council is aimed at transferring the power peacefully to the Taliban and asked Afghan security forces and forces of the Afghanistan Islamic Emirate to secure Kabul and do not allow any chaos. The trio in their separate video clips delivered different messages to the people of Kabul. Abdullah accused Ashraf Ghani of fleeing the country and leaving the people in a mess. He also took to the streets of Kabul and greet the people who were hugging crying and thanked him for being with them. While Karzai encouraged people not to panic as he and his children are still living in the Afghan capital, Hekmatyar accused Ghani of continuing the war and remaining stubborn to transfer power peacefully to a government that is acceptable to all. The Afghanistan Islamic Emirate asked people to cooperate with them in identifying and arresting those who impersonate them and rob people and property. Sunday night was rather quiet but there were sporadic fires and the choppers were patrolling the Afghan capital, said the news report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-confirms-no-danger-to-embassies-foreign-nationals-in-kabul/articleshow/85359776.cms||---

---||World||As Kabul falls to Taliban, burqa shops of Afghanistan get busy||KABUL: As the Taliban entered the Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday, university lecturers gathered their female students for some final goodbyes. Telling the shocked young women “we may not meet again,” the lecturers, along with everyone else, were evacuated, and the universities, along with schools, offices and shops, were shuttered. I spoke by phone with Aisha Khurram, one of those students whose academic dreams have been cut short. There are thousands more like her. The 22-year-old is in the final semester of her international relations degree at Kabul University. With just two months left, she says, “now it seems I will never graduate.” Her monograph was on United Nations Security Council reforms and how they’ll affect special missions in countries like Afghanistan. Just one more thing the world will be deprived of now the Taliban are back in power. In Herat, the country’s third largest city, which fell to the Taliban on Thursday, girls who showed up at their universities were turned away, Khurram says. “The education system is collapsing.” There is, however, one business that is booming. In the provinces, burqa shops are reopening and the thick, blue garments that cover a woman’s body from head to toe — the repressive symbol of the Taliban’s previous rule — are becoming an expensive, must-have item. Though not for everyone. “I am seeing a lot of women who did not experience the previous Taliban period who are saying ‘we will not adopt this oppressive dress,’ ” says Khurram, who was the Afghan Youth Representative to the United Nations in 2019. “I do not know what will happen to the younger generation of Afghan women. They were coding. They were so brilliant. Now they are all sitting at home wondering what will happen. This generation formed the modern Afghanistan.” There’s a meeting of Taliban and Afghan government leaders in Doha on Monday, where negotiations are expected to take place for a peaceful transfer of power. All the citizens of Afghanistan can do is wait and worry. There were reports Sunday of dozens of helicopter flights over Kabul as the US and other nations rushed to evacuate their citizens, leaving Afghans to their fate. So this is where we are: The Taliban now hold most of the country, from the provinces to the regional capitals, the border crossings with most of the six neighboring countries and now, the capital, well before the full withdrawal of US troops on Aug. 31. It has instructed its fighters to stay at the gates of Kabul until talks have concluded. But that is cold comfort for Afghans, including the thousands of displaced people who’ve poured into the capital to escape the group’s draconian rule, as reports filter in of ugly reprisal killings, women ordered from their workplaces and into their homes, men told to grow beards and girls forbidden from attending school. In the tried and true playbook of militia all over the world, young men are pressured to join their ranks, their dreams of a better future evaporating with those of their sisters. We are straight back to the 1990s. Despite the very real risk, many Afghans are continuing to speak out, with some, like Muska Dastageer, a lecturer at the Kabul-based American University of Afghanistan, directly engaging with Taliban spokesmen on Twitter. “Afghans are done being victims. Afghan women will not hide. We will not be afraid,” Dastageer tweeted to Suhail Shaheen, a member of the group’s negotiating committee. “The glare of the whole world is on Afghanistan, on Kabul, on Taliban and what they do.” It’s hard to avoid the word betrayal. From the moment former President Donald Trump approved the deal between the US and the Taliban — signed on February 29 last year — that excluded the elected Afghan government, the writing was on the wall. It called for an initial drawdown of US troops and the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners. In exchange, the Taliban pledged to cut ties with all terrorists, prevent Afghan territories from becoming militant havens and to engage in peace talks that were meant to lead to a ceasefire and an end to decades of war. They got the troop withdrawal, and many of those prisoners who were released have since taken up arms and helped the group seize power across the country. What’s missing? Any sign the Taliban will fulfill their end of the bargain. That the US and its global cheerleaders allowed this to happen will dent Washington’s diplomatic stature for years to come. President Ashraf Ghani, whose government — mired in allegations of corruption and incompetence — failed to either anticipate the Taliban's rapid advance or unite the country’s powerful warlords behind the Afghan National Army, left the country Sunday with a coterie of aides. For now, people are in shock, Khurram says. There are no tears — no one understands what to feel any more. Traffic choked the capital, as panicked residents raced to reach the safety of home. The electricity has been out since Sunday morning, so it’s only those with power who can watch TV news and monitor Twitter for any signs of what the Taliban might do next. “People want to leave but the borders are closed.” (Bloomberg opinion: By Ruth Pollard)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/as-kabul-falls-to-taliban-burqa-shops-of-afghanistan-get-busy/articleshow/85359895.cms||---

Hardly 1 lakh of about 90 lakh taxpayers have been able to complete the process online in the current assessment year, according to senior officials in the income tax (I-T) department, Karnataka & Goa region. Issues have piled up ahead of September 30 deadline. The region stands second after Maharashtra in tax collection. The collection for 2020-21 was nearly Rs 1.2 lakh crore; for the current year (till June 30), it’s Rs 30,942 crore. While taxpayers are supposed to file returns online, tax payment has not been hindered. “As taxpayers have not been able to file returns for the year ending in March 2021, we are now processing returns of the previous year and issuing refunds. We hope the bugs on the new portal are fixed at the earliest so that we can take up new returns for processing,” said an official at the Income Tax Centralised Processing Centre, Bengaluru. An I-T official said that some bugs had been rectified and taxpayers under TDS were filing returns. But corporates are still waiting since the advance payment mode of tax is not glitch-free. Main issues resolved“Major glitches have been fixed. We have to address a few issues that we continue to face in some of the functionalities, and there are new functionalities. We are working in collaboration with the I-T department and other stakeholders,” said Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao, as mentioned at the recent quarterly results press conference. The development of the next-generation I-T filing system was aimed at reducing the processing time for returns from 63 days to one day and disbursing refunds instantaneously. But many taxpayers could not even complete the first step of downloading form 26A for verification of paid tax in the case of TDS, which is required for filing returns. “The biggest concern is that business owners and individuals are unable to get bank loans, for which one has to submit copies of I-T returns. Corporates are seeing their credit limits getting stuck or shrinking,” said BT Shetty, the chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Bengaluru branch. According to Vivek Mallya, a chartered accountant, processing of refunds to the tune of hundreds of crores is pending because of the delay in filing returns. “Working capital of corporations has been locked. The wait for individual taxpayers like salaried employees to get refunds seems to be unending,” he said. Some of the issues on the portal are failure to recognise the digital signature of taxpayers and authorised consultants, session expiry while uploading returns through JSON files, non-delivery draft assessment, and failure to generate OPT for e-proceedings through videoconferencing. The portal reportedly recognises July 31 as the deadline instead of September 30 and consequently, it generates notices seeking Rs 1,000 penalty and imposing 12 per cent interest. Currently, returns can be filed only online. Various stakeholders, including CAs and business owners, are urging the government to allow manual filing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/tech-glitches-only-1-of-taxpayers-file-returns-in-karnataka/articleshow/85360100.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

An I-T official said that some bugs had been rectified and taxpayers under TDS were filing returns. But corporates are still waiting since the advance payment mode of tax is not glitch-free. Main issues resolved“Major glitches have been fixed. We have to address a few issues that we continue to face in some of the functionalities, and there are new functionalities. We are working in collaboration with the I-T department and other stakeholders,” said Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao, as mentioned at the recent quarterly results press conference. The development of the next-generation I-T filing system was aimed at reducing the processing time for returns from 63 days to one day and disbursing refunds instantaneously. But many taxpayers could not even complete the first step of downloading form 26A for verification of paid tax in the case of TDS, which is required for filing returns. “The biggest concern is that business owners and individuals are unable to get bank loans, for which one has to submit copies of I-T returns. Corporates are seeing their credit limits getting stuck or shrinking,” said BT Shetty, the chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Bengaluru branch. According to Vivek Mallya, a chartered accountant, processing of refunds to the tune of hundreds of crores is pending because of the delay in filing returns. “Working capital of corporations has been locked. The wait for individual taxpayers like salaried employees to get refunds seems to be unending,” he said. Some of the issues on the portal are failure to recognise the digital signature of taxpayers and authorised consultants, session expiry while uploading returns through JSON files, non-delivery draft assessment, and failure to generate OPT for e-proceedings through videoconferencing. The portal reportedly recognises July 31 as the deadline instead of September 30 and consequently, it generates notices seeking Rs 1,000 penalty and imposing 12 per cent interest. Currently, returns can be filed only online. Various stakeholders, including CAs and business owners, are urging the government to allow manual filing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tech-glitches-only-1-of-taxpayers-file-returns-in-karnataka/articleshow/85360032.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

A military vehicle "en route to the airport in Menaka hit an improvised explosive device this Sunday," the army said on Twitter. An unspecified number of soldiers were also injured and stabilised at facilities operated by the multinational Takuba force, a European military unit involved in anti-jihadist operations. The Menaka region, close to the Niger border, is prey to regular Islamist militant attacks. Since 2012, it has experienced a surge in deadly violence from jihadist groups linked to the Islamic State, along with intercommunal clashes. Improvised explosives have been used by jihadists operating in the area against Malian, French and other international forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/three-soldiers-killed-in-ne-mali-explosion/articleshow/85360109.cms||---

Trump, in a statement on Sunday, said that it was time for the incumbent US president, Joe Biden, to resign, "for what he has allowed happening in Afghanistan, along with the tremendous surge in COVID-19, the Border catastrophe, the destruction of energy Independence, and our crippled economy." The ex-US president went on to say that it "shouldn't be a big deal" since, according to Trump's version of events, Biden "wasn't elected legitimately in the first place!". His statement comes after the Afghanistan government collapsed on Sunday with President Ashraf Ghani leaving the country and the Taliban's entry into the capital, the New York Times reported. Taliban terrorists have assumed control of the Afghan capital of Kabul and have taken control of the presidential palace. Reports suggest that the movement will soon proclaim the re-establishment of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the White House advisors are discussing how President Joe Biden should address the deepening crisis in Afghanistan, however, no final decision has been taken yet about whether he should return to Washington from his planned August vacation. A protest was also held out the White House with demonstrators blaming Joe Biden for betraying the people of the war-torn country and demand for sanctioning Pakistan as hundreds of people protested Sunday afternoon outside the White House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/trump-blames-joe-biden-for-afghan-crisis-seeks-his-resignation/articleshow/85360297.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Activists: 2 fee for a page of information a hurdle in RTI system||HUBBALLI: Earlier, the public information officer (PIO) designated under RTI Act of any department, used to provide information at no cost, if it was within five pages. Nowadays, some PIOs are demanding Rs 2, though a single page of information needs to be given. They are sending the letter by spending Rs 25 for postage, and instructing the applicant to pay Rs 2. The applicant has to send a postal order (PO) of Rs 2, which is not available in post offices, by spending Rs 25-Rs 30 for postage or courier. The irony is that the PIO will spend Rs 25 of the government’s money again to despatch the information, though it’s of a single page. RTI activists allege it’s a intentional act by officials to discourage citizens from filing RTIs. As per the act, the PIOs will collect Rs 2 per page, to provide a certified copy of the information. Bheemanagouda G Paragond, an RTI activist in Athani, told TOI that he is instructed to pay Rs 2 for a page of information from the Karnataka drugs control department. “The PIO has sent this letter by spending Rs 25 for registered post. As a PO of Rs 2 is unavailable at post offices, we have to obtain a PO of Rs 10, and have to send it by registered post by spending Rs 25. So it’s a burden on citizens as well as the concerned department,” he said. Dr Shekhar Sajjanar, former state information commissioner, said that asking for Rs 2 is legally correct, but that it is ethically wrong. “The PIO will spend Rs 25 to send a letter seeking Rs 2, and will spend Rs 25 again to despatch the single page of information. So the particular department or authority will spend Rs 50 to get Rs 2. Though they are spending for the postal department, it’s a burden on them. However, officials are least bothered about such unnecessary spending. Instead of making a letter and sending it to ask for Rs 2 by spending Rs 25, they can share the information in the same envelope voluntarily,” he said. J M Rajashekhara, who has authored 16 books on the RTI Act, said that earlier information commissioners used to instruct officials orally to furnish the information free of cost, if it’s within five pages. “As per the act, non-BPL card holders have to pay Rs 2 per page for the information, other than published under section 4(1)(b) of the act. As the state government is collecting Rs 10 as initial fee, the department of personnel and administrative reforms can issue a circular to provide the information up to five pages, free of cost. One need not wait for the amendment; just a circular will resolve this issue,” he said. Bhagoji T Khanapure, drugs controller, whose office has sought Rs 2, said that the PIO has done it as per the act. “If the applicant is not satisfied, he can file the appeal with the appellate authority” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/activists-2-fee-for-a-page-of-information-a-hurdle-in-rti-system/articleshow/85360530.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Chennai||Southern Railway has resumed 92% of its services||CHENNAI: Southern Railway has resumed nearly 92% of services and is taking steps to strengthen its health infrastructure to combat a possible third wave of Covid-19, its general manager John Thomas said on Sunday. After unfurling the Tricolour to mark 75th Independence Day, Thomas in his I-Day speech said, “Passenger traffic was severely affected in 2020-2021. However, this year we are running nearly 92% of our pre-Covid services and have had 64 million passengers from April to July 2021.” He added that train speed has been increased in more than 14 sections from April 2020 to July 2021 and that it will be increased in nine more sections soon. “In 2020-2021, loop line speeds of nine sections were increased and 27 permanent speed restrictions were relaxed. Our railway has also surpassed the Railway Board’s target in deep screening, turn out renewal and weld renewal of tracks,” Thomas said. During the year 2020-21, doubling was completed in seven sections. “During first quarter of 2021-22 we completed Andipatti-Theni section of Madurai-Bodinayakanur gauge conversion project, Tambaram-Guduvanchery section of Tambaram-Chengalpet third line project and Thattaparai-Milavittan section will be commissioned shortly.” Punctuality too has improved. “Punctuality percentage of the zone for April-July 2021 is 97.6%, the second best among all zones of Indian Railways.” The effect of improved infrastructure is visible by the increase of the goods trains speed to 50.7kmph during the first three months of 2021-22, he added. Thomas said a separate pediatric ward for Covid-19 is being developed at the Railway Hospital in Perambur and that the management has ensured adequate stock of drugs to treat Covid and mucormycosis. Covid vaccination is now available at all railway hospitals and more than 83,000 doses have been administered so far in railway facilities in the zone, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/southern-railway-has-resumed-92-of-its-services/articleshow/85360617.cms||---

The district administration has filed a case against the organisers. The procession, which was taken out from Tadas Cross till the tahsildar’s office, comprised men, women, children and college students who togher occupied the entire stretch of road. Passersby showed flowers arranged by the organisers en route. Thousands of people took a selfie with the mega flag in the backdrop. Children’s Hejje Mela of Shiggatti village was also part of the rally. As Covid norms, like maintaining social distancing, were thrown to the wind, the videos and phots of the procession went viral on social media, with netizens trolling the organisers. When contacted, Lad told TOI that the event was organised to mark of 75th Independence Day. “As per our plan, about 1,500 people were supposed to carry the flag while ensuring Covid norms. As the information about the event was put out on social media, a lot more people voluntarily joined, and we lost control over them. I apologise on behalf of the participants. I would like to know the government’s action against ministers who had taken thousands of their supporters to their oath-taking ceremony in Bengaluru. Even the Prime Minister had attracted crowds during the recent assembly elections in the northern states,” he added. Dharwad DC Nitesh Patil said that organisers had not obtained any permission for the procession. “So police have registered an FIR against them under Section 5(4) of Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act and Section 269 and 270 of IPC 1860. It’s learnt that many had not worn face masks and maintained social distance,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/procession-of-mega-flag-triggers-row/articleshow/85360650.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu to streamline forest treks, camps to boost eco-tourism||CHENNAI: The state forest and tourism departments are to work hand-in-hand to promote eco-tourism. While the Tamil Nadu Wilderness Experiences Corporation, functioning under the forest department, has already identified five eco-tourism spots, the tourism department is likely to look at streamlining activities such as treks and camping in forest areas. Though eco-tourism began in the state a decade ago, its potential remained untapped. Treks and camps are being organised on a small scale informally in hill stations. The tourism department is looking at cashing in on demand by streamlining things. A tourism department official said the idea is to generate revenue for the forest and tourism departments by promoting eco-tourism. Forest land cannot be leased to private operators under environment protection laws. TN is trying to follow the examples of Karnataka and Kerala, where camping, guided tours, jungle safaris and trekking are offered as part of eco-tourism packages. Stakeholders in the tourism sector said despite demand, there aren’t enough facilities for eco-tourism in the state. They point out that eco-tourism will not only attract domestic tourists, but also big-spending international travellers who will fly down if the infrastructure is good. N Ravi, former manager with the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation, said TTDC was operating packages that involved eco-tourism aspects to Anamalai, Kolli Hills and Yercaud from Chennai 10 years back. “We even conducted trekking at Tirusulam hillock in the city along with the forest department. Interestingly, the traction was high among youngsters and senior citizens,” he said. Moreover, when eco-tourism packages are offered by government departments in forest area, travellers safety and security is assured, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-to-streamline-forest-treks-camps-to-boost-eco-tourism/articleshow/85360679.cms||---

Separated from their mother, they are in isolation and are healthy. Executive chairman S Paulraj told TOI that reticulated pythons, native to South East Asia, are the longest snakes in the world and very sensitive. The new additions to the snake park have been born after nearly four years. In 2017, a dozen eggs hatched and seven of them are alive. A couple of months ago, the park designed and created a new enclosure for its reticulated pythons, complete with water flowing all around in a near natural forest environment. The male and female then mated. As soon as the authorities found out the female was getting ready to lay the eggs, she was separated from the others in the enclosure. “She was kept in an enclosure and it was ensured that she was not disturbed by anyone including the snake handler. She laid the eggs that hatched in about 65 days,” he said. The new born pythons are being fed mice and small frogs on alternative days, while their mother is given a live chicken and bandicoot. Worldover, reticulated pythons are one of the most sought-after pets. In the wild, their life span is not more than 20 years, but they can live up to 28 years in captivity, he said. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) had categorised this non-venomous snake species as ‘least concerned’, Paulraj added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/reticulated-python-at-chennai-snake-park-breeds-after-4-years/articleshow/85360936.cms||P Oppili

The woman, 26-year-old Wu Huan, was on the run to avoid extradition back to China because her fiance was considered a Chinese dissident. Wu told The Associated Press she was abducted from a hotel in Dubai and detained by Chinese officials at a villa converted into a jail, where she saw or heard two other prisoners, both Uyghurs. She was questioned and threatened in Chinese and forced to sign legal documents incriminating her fiance for harassing her, she said. She was finally released on June 8 and is now seeking asylum in the Netherlands. While "black sites" are common in China, Wu's account is the only testimony known to experts that Beijing has set one up in another country. Such a site would reflect how China is increasingly using its international clout to detain or bring back citizens it wants from overseas, whether they are dissidents, corruption suspects or ethnic minorities like the Uyghurs. The AP was unable to confirm or disprove Wu's account independently, and she could not pinpoint the exact location of the black site. However, reporters have seen and heard corroborating evidence including stamps in her passport, a phone recording of a Chinese official asking her questions and text messages that she sent from jail to a pastor helping the couple. China and Dubai did not respond to multiple phone calls and requests for comment. Yu-Jie Chen, an assistant professor at Taiwan's Academia Sinica, said she had not heard of a Chinese secret jail in Dubai, and such a facility in another country would be unusual. However, she also noted that it would be in keeping with China's attempts to do all it can to bring select citizens back, both through official means such as signing extradition treaties and unofficial means such as revoking visas or putting pressure on family back home. "(China) really wasn't interested in reaching out until recent years," said Chen, who has tracked China's international legal actions. Chen said Uyghurs in particular were being extradited or returned to China, which has been detaining the mostly Muslim minority on suspicion of terrorism even for relatively harmless acts like praying. Wu and her fiance, 19-year-old Wang Jingyu, are not Uyghur but rather Han Chinese, the majority ethnicity in China. Dubai has a history as a place where Uyghurs are interrogated and deported back to China, and activists say Dubai itself has been linked to secret interrogations. Radha Stirling, a legal advocate who founded the advocacy group Detained in Dubai, said she has worked with about a dozen people who have reported being held in villas in the UAE, including citizens of Canada, India and Jordan but not China. "There is no doubt that the UAE has detained people on behalf of foreign governments with whom they are allied," Stirling said. "I don't think they would at all shrug their shoulders to a request from such a powerful ally." However, Patrick Theros, a former U.S. ambassador to Qatar who is now strategic advisor to the Gulf International Forum, called the allegations "totally out of character" for the Emiratis. On May 27, Wu said, she was questioned by Chinese officials at her hotel and then taken by Dubai police to a police station for three days. On the third day, she said, a Chinese man who introduced himself as Li Xuhang came to visit her. He told her he was working for the Chinese consulate in Dubai, and asked her whether she had taken money from foreign groups to act against China. Li Xuhang is listed as consul general on the website of the Chinese consulate in Dubai. The consulate did not return multiple calls asking for comment and to speak with Li directly. Wu said she was handcuffed and put in a black Toyota. After half an hour, she was brought inside a white villa with three stories, where rooms had been converted into individual cells, she said. Wu was taken to her own cell, with a heavy metal door, a bed, a chair and a white fluorescent light that was on all day and night. She said she was questioned and threatened several times in Chinese. She saw another prisoner, a Uyghur woman, while waiting to use the bathroom once, she said. A second time, she heard a Uyghur woman shouting in Chinese, "I don't want to go back to China, I want to go back to Turkey." Wu identified the women as Uyghurs, she said, based on their distinctive appearance and accent. The guards also gave her a phone and a sim card and instructed her to call her fiance and pastor Bob Fu, the head of ChinaAid, a Christian non-profit, who was helping the couple. Wang confirmed to the AP that Wu called and asked him for his location. Fu said he received at least four or five calls from her during this time, a few on an unknown Dubai phone number, including one where she was crying and almost incoherent. The AP also reviewed text messages Wu sent to Fu at the time, which are disjointed and erratic. The last thing Wu's captors demanded of her, she said, was to sign documents testifying that Wang was harassing her. "I was really scared and was forced to sign the documents," she told the AP. After Wu was released, she flew to Ukraine, where she was reunited with Wang. After threats from Chinese police that Wang could face extradition from Ukraine, the couple fled again to the Netherlands. Wu said she misses her homeland. "I've discovered that the people deceiving us are Chinese, that it's our countrymen hurting our own countrymen," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-has-secret-jail-in-dubai-holds-uyghurs/articleshow/85360990.cms||---

But years of neglect and an almost defunct local body have made the place unliveable, say residents. In spite of repeated petitions to the state government, the roads are in terrible shape, groundwater is polluted and sewage is let out into a pond, they complain. Governed by a village panchayat, Pozhichalur comes under Chengalpet district. Mano Bala, a resident, said that most of the roads remain unpaved and the quality of groundwater is not good as sewage seeps in. “There are no storm water drains. The rainwater flows off to the side of the airport because of the slope of the terrain,” he said. Several people had moved into the loaclity because of its proximity to the airport, but many have also sold their houses and shifted out dye to the appalling civic conditions, he added. Kumaran S from JJ Nagar said that the groundwater was black due to sewage seepage. “Houses that have come up near a pond let out sewage into it. The panchayat officials warn the people but they do not take action against the violators,” he said. Bala said several people had fallen and got injured because of the bad roads. “My father fell from his motorcycle and could not walk for several months because the roads are not paved,” he said. The residents had filed a petition to the CM’s cell recently as there had been no improvement in the civic amenities over the last few years. Nothing much had changed since they first petitioned the government more than four years ago. Nothing much had changed in the area since TOI covered the issue in 2018. K P Subramanian, former professor of urban engineering at Anna University, said Pozhichalur may need special attention because haphazard development may take place because of speculation in land value increase as it is closer to Chennai corporation limits. “Unless it is corrected in the beginning by offering basic infrastructure, it will be difficult to regulate later,” he said. The condition can improve if Tambaram is made into a corporation, he added. Senthil Arumugham, who contested from Pallavaram in the assembly election, said a lot of housing development had happened in Pozhichalur though it is a panchayat. “There are no elected local representatives.

---||Business||Trust in science increases as Covid goes on backfoot||When Jayshree Seth, corporate scientist at 3M, was appointed the company’s first ever chief science advocate in 2018, one of the first things she did was to develop a State of Science Index, based on a global survey. The results shocked her. As many as 4 out of 10 said that if science wasn’t there, life would not be any different. And 29% said they were sceptical of science. Worse, over the next couple of years, science scepticism actually rose. It was 32% in 2019, and 35% just before the pandemic in 2020. “People might have asked themselves, what has science done for me lately? If people are not seeing science playing a prominent role, it’s not top of mind. And what makes the news is sometimes the negative aspects,” Seth told us in an interaction. Japan was at the bottom in the science trust score. And Seth thinks it might be because the Fukushima nuclear disaster is still fresh in the minds of Japanese. However, scores have changed dramatically in 2021. Science scepticism, at 27%, is at its lowest since the tracking began. 56% say science is very important to their everyday life, compared to 44% in 2018. 90% say the world needs more people in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers. “As we started turning the corner on the pandemic, and vaccinations started becoming available, people saw there’s a way out of this, and hope in science emerged. They realised we have ways to mitigate, ways to manage, ways to treat, and then ways to eradicate,” Seth says. But she also notes that when people were asked if appreciation for science would last, 41% said it may not last beyond the pandemic. “That gives us a call to action. There are sustainability challenges in the world, and we have to put science to that,” she says. S Sivakumar, divisional chair for the sciences, and professor of physics at Krea University, says if the fruits of science research are to be useful to society, it should be accepted by society as trustworthy and beneficial. “Building trust in science is important,” he says. Vivek Wadhwa, Distinguished Fellow at Harvard Law School’s Labour and Worklife Program, and who has written extensively on technology and its impact, says in countries where you have politicians trying to profit from disinformation, you see bigger doubts about science. Sivakumar says It is the communication of science to the lay public that is partly the fault. It is important, he says, that scientists engage the public in the science that is going to affect their lives, and if they could demonstrate the relevant aspects of the scientific process in a manner the public can comprehend, their credibility will grow. “In short, science needs a public relations team,” he says. Seth, whose role is precisely that, makes the same point. “Growing up, I did not see the connection between my pro-social (behaviours intended to help other people) goals and STEM careers. We talk about STEM in a very content-focused way. I’m so much more inspired by the context of solving problems,” she says. In other words, show how a chemical reaction leads to the production of steel, or how software code creates Google Search. The problem, Seth says, is particularly acute among women. “My daughter absolutely did not want to do science because her image of science was the typical media stereotype – of a male, a maverick, a genius, an evil scientist,” she says. Role models, she says, are also key to more women’s participation. She herself has been a great role model. She has 72 patents, including in making diaper tapes softer so that babies are more comfortable. Sivakumar says the lay person takes his or her cue from persons of distinction. Lawmakers, he says, should capitalise on this in the trust-building exercise, by publicly visible consultations with scientists. “Science and its benefits are for everyone and the strengthened relationship between science and society will only lead to long lasting benefits for humanity,” he says. As we started turning the corner on the pandemic, and vaccinations started becoming available, people saw there’s a way out of this, and hope and trust in science emerged. The way I put it is, science got personal. You saw how it impacted you, the world around you, and how it solved problems. People are also recognising that we need more STEM careers.Jayshree Seth, corporate scientist, 3MScience and technology are advancing at exponential speeds now and are going to make it possible within a decade to solve some of the grand challenges of humanity such as disease, hunger, energy, and education. It will take a global effort, and that is why Indian scientists, entrepreneurs, and its government need to play a role.Vivek Wadhwa, Distinguished Fellow, Harvard Law SchoolThere are three reasons why Indian youngsters gravitate towards STEM. First, being a poor country, people tend to pursue fields which promise exciting career opportunities. Second, tech leaders like Satya Nadella and Sunder Pichai are great role models. Finally, Indians are naturally very good in analytical subjects like mathematics.Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe Distinguished Professor, Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth CollegeThe effects of the general public’s lack of trust in science have been tragic and costly: the objection to the reality of the Covid disease, and to the vaccine, are the most conspicuous examples in recent years. It is the communication of science to the lay public that is partly the fault.S Sivakumar, Divisional Chair, Sciences, Prof of Physics, Krea University||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/trust-in-science-increases-as-covid-goes-on-backfoot/articleshow/85361787.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

---||India||Pegasus row: Centre files affidavit in SC, 'unequivocally' denies all allegations||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday filed a two-page affidavit on Pegasus controversy and "unequivocally" denied all allegations made against the government by petitioners led by journalist N Ram about using military grade spyware to snoop on journalists, politicians, activists and court staff. The Centre said PILs by N Ram, Yashwant Sinha, Editors Guild and 7 others have made allegations "based on conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material". Such material cannot be the basis for filing PILs, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said. The government will soon set up a committee of experts to examine all issues raised in the Pegasus controversy to dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and justices Suryakant and Aniruddha Bose was hearing the matter. On August 10, the top court had taken exception over "parallel proceedings and debates" on social media by some petitioners who have sought independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping issue and said there must be some discipline and they must have "some faith in the system". An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on a list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware. Opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi, two Union ministers -- Prahlad Singh Patel and Railways and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw -- businessman Anil Ambani, a former CBI chief, and at least 40 journalists are on the list on the leaked database of NSO. It is, however, not established that all the phones were hacked.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu short of public charging stations||CHENNAI: Around 12% of electric vehicles in the country are on TN roads and the figure is set to go up further, but there are not enough public charging stations. The Union heavy industries ministry has installed around 420 charging stations in cities and highway stretches across the country but not one of it was in TN, official data shows. Central public sector undertakings (PSUs) under the Union power ministry and oil companies have set up 49 charging points in TN. In Chennai, a few private companies and Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) have installed such points, mostly for twowheelers. Vivek Swaminathan, CEO of Meras Plug-ins, an IIT-M incubated company, said Chennai has few EV charging infrastructure when compared to Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru. “But with companies such as Ola and Ather having manufacturing units in TN, more stations are expected to come up as they will try to drive up local sales,” he added. EV owners at gated communities and houses without parking spaces continue to face challenges over access to charging stations and calculating power usage, says Rajvel from FADA. There are two types of EV chargers in Chennai market — One where the battery can be removed from the vehicle and charged separately through a three-pin socket in homes or offices, another where vehicles can be plugged into a charging point directly. R Rengachari, a transportation activist, said there is no clarity on whether offices, apartments or housing societies would allow vehicle owners to use common sockets in ground floors or parking spaces to recharge EVs. A separate electricity sub-meter needs to be installed for the purpose to avoid confusions, he said. “A problem arises when people residing in first floor or above try to use the charging points,” said Rajvel. Vivek in response said Meras Plug-ins is providing charging points with RFID-card access in reserved parking spaces in gated communities. A personal twowheeler charging point costs Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000. Companies are also working to create charging points in restaurants and commercial spaces in the city. A commercial EV charging space with multiple car, two-wheeler charging points could cost anywhere between Rs 45,000 to Rs 5,00,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-short-of-public-charging-stations/articleshow/85362138.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||World||I-Day: Separatist Sikh outfits protest outside Indian high commission in London||LONDON: Around 800 British Sikhs, chanting pro-Khalistan slogans, gathered outside India house and held ‘Black Day’ protest outside the High Commission of India in London on August 15 when the country celebrated its 75th Independence Day. The rally was organised by various groups, including banned separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) who are behind the Referendum 2020, which is illegal in India. There were many placards in the rally promoting this unofficial referendum, which will allegedly start in London on October 31. Mounted police were visible, along with a large police presence. The high commission building, which was damaged in violent protests on the I-Day in 2019, was barricaded and the protesters were penned in on the opposite side of the road outside Waldorf Hotel. The traffic was allowed to move through Aldwych. Meanwhile, a small group of Indian-origin cyclists—celebrating the Independence Day with a 15-km bike ride from Bombay Gymkhana to India House to raise funds for the Covid orphans in India—reached the protest site. They waved the Tricolour and chanted patriotic slogans such as “Vande Matram” (I praise to thee mother) and “Bharat Mata ki Jai” (Long Live Mother India) outside the India House, while the police officers had to stop the Khalistani protesters on the other side of the road from moving towards them. "The police initially advised us not to proceed. But at 3.15 pm (local time) we cycled past. The protesters on the other side started abusing us. Before the situation could spin out of control, we left through India Place," said IT consultant Nimit Shishodia. Prominent Khalistan supporter and alleged terrorist Paramjit Singh Pamma was among those who spoke at the rally. Pamma, who is a member of SFJ and has been linked with Khalistan militant organisations Babbar Khalsa International and Khalistan Tiger Force, lives in Birmingham and is on the most wanted list of NIA. One of the main speakers was Piers Corbyn, former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's brother, who leads the anti-lockdown and anti-Covid-19 vaccine movement in Britain and the UK. “I am here supporting the Indian farmers’ protest and the movement for independent Punjab because the (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi regime has failed. I am supporting Punjab as it is part of the fight against the new world order,” he said. He added the Indian farmers are resisting the destruction of food supply, which is happening in many countries, including in the UK where food workers, involved in transportation, are getting pinged because of the NHS app. He alleged that the World Economic Forum wanted to impose a global government run by mega corporations and super rich and in order to do this they need to close down small businesses. “PM Modi is signing up completely to the new world order and that’s why we support all the resistance against this Indian regime,” he said. Those TOI spoke to said they were still angry about the events of 1984 anti-Sikh riots and many felt the only way to end the agitation against the new farm laws was creation of “an independent Sikh state”. One of the organisers, Punjab-born Gurpreet Singh, who moved to the UK aged 16, said the kisaan and Khalistan movements are together now. “Around 500 farmers have died in the protest. We want independence. Democracy is having a referendum; so why is a referendum not allowed to happen? In India Sikhism is not even considered a separate religion.” Punjab-born Sarbjit Singh, who moved to the UK in 1983, said the Sikh issues have been pending since 1983. “When the government attacked the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the Sikhs then were protesting against farmers’ issues and diversion of water from the rivers of Punjab to other states.” He added the farm laws should be passed by the state, not the central government. “It is trying to establish a dictatorship under the name of democracy. We don’t feel safe in our homeland and we want to have our rights.” Gucharan Singh from Southall said he was opposed to the farm laws as they were taking resources away from ordinary people and giving them to large corporations. Some were protesting against the ongoing incarceration of Scottish Sikh Jagtar Singh Johal, accused of a murder conspiracy in Punjab. He was arrested in India in 2017 and currently languishing in Tihar jail. One man wore a black face mask saying “free Jaggi”. Meanwhile, a group handed out free roti and chai to protesters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/i-day-separatist-sikh-outfits-protest-outside-indian-high-commission-in-london/articleshow/85362130.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The senior party leader on Sunday welcomed the party chief's initiative of bringing like-minded political parties together, but urged her to strengthen her own party, saying no Opposition unity is possible without it. Sibal, however, said he along with other leaders of the "Group of 23" would continue to demand reforms in the grand old party and keep pushing for its strengthening. "I am happy that Congress president Sonia Gandhi is taking the initiative of bringing about Opposition unity. But our reform agenda has to continue and we will keep pushing for it to strengthen the Congress," he told PTI. The former Union minister said he and his party colleagues are ready to support these efforts in order to revive and revitalise the Congress. He said Gandhi can "jettison" him if he stands in her way, but he would continue to seek strengthening of the Congress for bringing it to the forefront of Opposition unity. "This is not about me, but about a revival of the Congress and bringing it to the forefront of Opposition unity. Without the Congress being strong, there can be no Opposition unity," Sibal said. Sibal said Opposition unity will not come about till the Congress is revived and strengthened. "This project of Opposition unity will fail if the Congress is not strengthened and rejuvenated.

State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has prepared the content and will provide worksheets to assess learning achievement in the courses. About 1/3rd of working days in 2021-22 will go for the bridge courses. With only 50% of students allowed in schools at a time, the course is likely to stretch over 40 days. “Refresher course for Class IX will cover basic and important topics from Classes VI to VIII since teachers cannot teach all the topics again,” a subject expert said. For example, the refresher course for language will focus on grammar and reading, writing skills. Lessons taught online and on Kalvi TV will also be included. Higher secondary will be taught basics for their school level so they get comfortable enough to sit through regular classes. G J Manohar, principal of MCC HIgher Secondary School in Chetpet said the bridge courses will be useful only if all students attend physical classes. The state, instead of giving blanket exemption, can ask schools to exempt students from coming to school on case-to-case basis for valid reasons. “If not, only 50% to 70% students will turn up. They will convince their parents against sending them schools. Students from contaminated areas alone should be given exemption,” he said. A Peter Raja, president, Tamil Nadu High and Higher School Headmasters’ Association, said students will turn up to schools only when classes begin after refresher courses. “Syllabus cut will lend confidence to students and will reduce pressure on teachers due to the delayed start to academic year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-students-in-classes-ix-to-xii-set-to-undergo-3-week-bridge-courses/articleshow/85362206.cms||A Ragu Raman

"The future is going to be electric and I hope our investments into the future factory and the revolutionary product we announced today will encourage all of you consumers to reject petrol and truly come to electric," he said in a presentation prior to the launch. Ola's electric scooters are being manufactured in a 500-acre factory in Tamil Nadu's Krishnagiri. The company targets making 10 million scooters annually, or 1 scooter every 2 seconds, making it the world’s largest two-wheeler factory. Ola, which is backed by SoftBank, said while India is the largest two-wheeler market, only 12% of its population own such a vehicle, thus keeping ample runway for future growth. The company is also looking to invest about $2 billion in the next five years, with its partners to set up charging stations in 400 cities, the biggest obstacle against the flourishing of electric vehicles in the country. The Ola scooters come in two variants and are priced at Rs 99,000 and Rs 129,000 respectively but in states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and New Delhi, they cost less due to the subsidies provided. Ola said previously that it received advance booking requests of more than 1 lakh. Aggarwal said the battery cells were sourced from South Korea along with battery packs and electronic items. "All other components are from India which has a decent ecosystem for two-wheelers." "For too long we have been the fifth largest car market, the fifth largest renewable market or the second largest innovation destination. but now it is time for India to be number 1. It is time for India to lead the world in electrification and build the technologies of the future here in India for the entire world," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ola-pushes-for-only-electric-two-wheelers-by-2025/articleshow/85362376.cms||Avik Das

---||Business||Afghan airspace closed for commercial flights; AI Kabul flight cancelled & US nonstops being rerouted||NEW DELHI: The Afghanistan airspace has been closed for commercial flights, including overflying, say airline sources. Air India’s nonstops enroute from the US to India are being diverted so that they do not enter the Afghan airspace. These flights will divert to Doha or UAE and after refuelling fly to Delhi. Due to airspace closure, Air India had to cancel its Delhi-Kabul-Delhi flight that was supposed to operate on Monday. Vistara says it has stopped overflying Afghan airspace on its Delhi-London flights. This closure will mean all flights between Delhi and the west, will have to take a longer alternate routes. Many other international flights flying between the east and the west will also be affected. As the airspace restrictions kicked in, Air India’s Chicago-Delhi was enroute. It took a U-turn just before the Afghan airspace and is now diverting to Doha/UAE for refuelling before continuing its journey to Delhi. A Terra Avia Baku-Delhi also changed course enroute for the same reason. This happened late Monday morning (India time) when the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority (ACAA) issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM) advising transit aircraft to reroute. The NOTAM added that Kabul airspace had been released to the military. ACAA said any transit through Kabul airspace — which covers all of Afghanistan — would be uncontrolled. “Afghan airspace has been declared uncontrolled. Due to that the Kabul flight had to be cancelled. We are working out alternate routes for another affected flights that needed to overly Afghanistan,” said an AI official. A Vistara spokesperson said: “We have stopped using Afghanistan airspace and are taking an alternate route for our flights to and from London Heathrow. We are closely working with the relevant authorities to monitor and assess the situation and taking necessary steps to ensure the safety of our passengers, staff and aircraft.” “Air India flight 244 Kabul-Delhi on August 16, 2021, stands cancelled,” a passenger who was booked to fly back to Delhi on this flight got this message on Monday while at Kabul airport. The Airbus A320 was fully booked on the return flight to Delhi, with 33 passengers from Monday’s flight who could not reach the airport. Thousands of people are gathered at Kabul airport, including on the tarmac to fly out of the country. Troops guarding the airport had to fire in air several times to disperse the crowds. Afghan airspace closure will mean flights between the east and the west, and north India and the west, will have to take longer routes. Airlines have prepared alternate for this scenario long time back. The DGCA had on August 10 asked Indian airlines to “relook at enroute alternates, in case of any diversion while overflying the Afghanistan airspace.” During the long closure of Pakistan airspace over two years back, airlines used to take longer routes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/afghan-airspace-closed-for-flights-air-india-kabul-flight-cancelled/articleshow/85362833.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||World||7 dead in Kabul airport evacuation chaos: Top developments||NEW DELHI: The US-backed Afghanistan government collapsed on Sunday as Taliban insurgents swept into Kabul to take over the control of war-torn country. President Ashraf Ghani left the country but there is no clarity about his final destination. Here are latest developments: Biden says he stands 'squarely behind' Afghanistan decisionStriking a defiant tone, President Joe Biden said Monday that he stands "squarely behind'' his decision to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan and that the Afghan government's collapse was quicker than anticipated. Biden said he was faced with a choice between sticking to a previously negotiated agreement to withdraw US troops this year or sending thousands more service members back into Afghanistan for a "third decade" of war. Biden said he will not repeat mistakes of the past and did not regret his decision to proceed with the withdrawal. "I stand squarely behind my decision," Biden said in a televised address to the nation from the White House East Room. "After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces." Pentagon says US and international forces working to clear Kabul airportUS forces are working with Turkish and other international troops to clear Kabul airport to allow international evacuation flights to resume, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. Kirby told a news briefing Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had authorized the deployment of another battalion to Kabul that would bring the number of troops guarding the evacuation to about 6,000. Joe Biden to address nation on AfghanistanPresident Joe Biden will address the nation Monday on the dramatic US retreat from Afghanistan, the White House said. Cutting short his planned vacation, Biden will return to Washington from the Camp David presidential residence and "will deliver remarks on Afghanistan" in the White House's East Room, a statement said. The address was scheduled for 3:45 pm (1945 GMT). US tells Taliban not to hinder Kabul evacuationA US defence official says the head of Central Command has met face-to-face with senior Taliban leaders to urge their fighters not to interfere with the US military's evacuation operations at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan. The official said that in the meeting on Sunday in Doha, Qatar, Gen Frank McKenzie won Taliban agreement to establish a "deconfliction mechanism" -- an arrangement by which evacuation operations at the airport can continue without interference by the new rulers of the country. Taliban will not get access to Afghan reserves held in US: OfficialThe Taliban will be denied access to any Afghan reserves held in US accounts, a US administration official told AFP on Monday. As US forces were evacuating Afghanistan's capital after the Taliban's swift takeover, the official said, "Any Central Bank assets the Afghan government have in the United States will not be made available to the Taliban." Biden team surprised by rapid Taliban gains in AfghanistanPresident Joe Biden and other top US officials have been stunned by the pace of the Taliban's nearly complete takeover of Afghanistan, as the planned withdrawal of American forces urgently became a mission to ensure a safe evacuation. The speed of the Afghan government's collapse and the ensuing chaos posed the most serious test of Biden as commander in chief, and he was the subject of withering criticism from Republicans who said that he had failed. Biden campaigned as a seasoned expert in international relations and has spent months downplaying the prospect of an ascendant Taliban while arguing that Americans of all political persuasions have tired of a 20-year war, a conflict that demonstrated the limits of money and military might to force a Western-style democracy on a society not ready or willing to embrace it. By Sunday, though, leading figures in the administration acknowledged they were caught off guard with the utter speed of the collapse of Afghan security forces. The challenge of that effort became clear after reports of sporadic gunfire at the Kabul airport prompted Americans to shelter as they awaited flights to safety after the US Embassy was completely evacuated. Kabul airport mobbed as Afghans make a desperate dash to exitUS troops fired shots into the air and all commercial flights were cancelled at Kabul airport on Monday as thousands of Afghans crowded onto the tarmac in the hope of catching any flight out after the weekend Taliban takeover. At least five people were killed as hundreds of people tried to forcibly enter planes leaving the Afghan capital, witnesses told Reuters. One witness said he had seen the bodies of five people being taken to a vehicle. Another witness said it was not clear whether the victims were killed by gunshots or in a stampede. The situation caused such a commotion that US troops fired into the air to restore order and all commercial flights were cancelled. Dramatic footage posted on social media showed a scene of chaos on the runway, with civilians frantically clambering up an already overcrowded and buckling set of airstairs. As a crowd of hundreds watched on, those who successfully climbed the stairs helped others up, while some hung from the stair railings by their hands. China: Ready for 'friendly relations' with TalibanChina is ready to deepen "friendly and cooperative" relations with Afghanistan, a government spokeswoman said Monday, after the Taliban seized control of the country. Beijing has sought to maintain unofficial ties with the Taliban throughout the US' withdrawal from Afghanistan, which spurred an advance by the Islamist hardliners across the country that saw them capture the capital Kabul on Sunday. China shares a rugged 76-kilometre (47-mile) border with Afghanistan. Beijing has long feared Afghanistan could become a staging point for Muslim minority Uyghur separatists in Xinjiang. But a top-level Taliban delegation met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Tianjin last month, promising that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militants. In exchange, China offered economic support and investment for Afghanistan's reconstruction. On Monday, China said it "welcomed" the chance to deepen ties with Afghanistan, a country that has for generations been coveted for its geo-strategic importance by bigger powers. "The Taliban have repeatedly expressed their hope to develop good relations with China, and that they look forward to China's participation in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan," foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. "We welcome this. China respects the right of the Afghan people to independently determine their own destiny and is willing to continue to develop... friendly and cooperative relations with Afghanistan." Taliban: 'War is over'The Taliban declared the war in Afghanistan was over after insurgents took control of the presidential palace in Kabul as US-led forces departed and Western nations scrambled on Monday to evacuate their citizens. "Today is a great day for the Afghan people and the mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years," Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban's political office, told Al Jazeera TV. "Thanks to God, the war is over in the country." It took the Taliban just over a week to seize control of the country after a lightning sweep that ended in Kabul as Afghan forces trained for years and equipped by the United States and others at a cost of billions of dollars, melted away. Al Jazeera broadcast footage of what it said were Taliban commanders in the presidential palace with dozens of armed fighters. Naeem said the form of the new regime in Afghanistan would be made clear soon, adding the Taliban did not want to live in isolation and calling for peaceful international relations. "We have reached what we were seeking, which is the freedom of our country and the independence of our people," he said. "We will not allow anyone to use our lands to target anyone, and we do not want to harm others." Left to avoid bloodshed: Ghani "To avoid bloodshed, I thought it would be better to leave," he said on Facebook in his first comments. "The Taliban have won with the judgement of their swords and guns, and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen," he said in a statement posted to Facebook. US lowers flag at Kabul embassyThe United States lowered the flag on its embassy in Kabul and has relocated almost all staff to the airport, where US forces are taking over air traffic control, officials said on Sunday. "We are completing a series of steps to secure the Hamid Karzai International Airport to enable the safe departure of US and allied personnel from Afghanistan via civilian and military flights," the Pentagon and State Department said in a joint statement. "Almost all" personnel from the embassy have relocated to the airport including the acting ambassador, Ross Wilson, who remains in touch with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, a State Department spokesperson said. "The American flag has been lowered from the US embassy compound and is now securely located with embassy staff," the spokesperson said. 'My first concern was to grow my beard'Kabul's streets were deserted and offices were empty on Monday, a day after Taliban insurgents took over the Afghanistan capital without a fight, but the airport was jammed with hundreds of civilians trying to flee. The Wazir Akbar Khan embassy district was deserted with almost all diplomats and their families either flown out of the city or at the airport awaiting a flight. There were few guards left at the checkpoints in the usually heavily fortified area - some motorists were getting out of their cars to lift barriers at the checkpoints before driving through. "It strange to sit hear and see empty streets, no more busy diplomatic convoys, big cars with guns mounted," said Gul Mohammed Hakim, one the city's ubiquitous naan (bread) makers who has a shop in the area. "I will be here baking bread, but will earn very small amounts of money. The security guards who were my friends, they are gone." He had no customers yet, said, and was still heating his tandoor (clay oven) in anticipation. "My first concern was to grow my beard and how to grow it fast," Hakim added. "I also checked with my wife if there were enough burqas for her and the girls." During the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule, men were not permitted to trim their beards and women were required to wear the all-enveloping burqa cloak in public. In the city's Chicken Street, the scores of shops for Afghan carpets, handicraft and jewellery, as well as small cafes, were closed. Sherzad Karim Stanekzai, who owns a carpet and textiles store, said he decided to sleep inside his shuttered shop to protect his goods. "I am in a complete state of shock. The Taliban entering that scared me, but (President Ashraf) Ghani leaving all of us in this situation has been the worst," he said. "I lost three brothers in seven years in this war, now I have to protect my business." He said had no idea where his next customers would come from. "I know there will no foreigners, no international people who will now come to Kabul," he said. Pentagon approves more troops to secure Kabul airport for evacuationsThe Pentagon has authorized another 1,000 troops to help evacuate US citizens and Afghans who worked for them from Kabul as the US government said it would assume air traffic control to facilitate the departure of thousands of Americans. A joint statement from the State Department and Pentagon after Taliban insurgents entered the Afghan capital confirmed that the United States over the next 48 hours will "have expanded our security presence to nearly 6,000 troops, with a mission focused solely on facilitating these efforts and will be taking over air traffic control." The statement said it was working to secure the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul "to enable the safe departure of US and allied personnel from Afghanistan via civilian and military flights." It added the United States "will be transferring out of the country thousands of American citizens" and others and added the government would "accelerate the evacuation of thousands of Afghans eligible for US Special Immigrant Visas." Airlines reroute flights to avoid Afghanistan airspaceMajor airlines are rerouting flights to avoid Afghanistan airspace after insurgents took control of the presidential palace in Kabul as US-led forces departed and Western nations scrambled on Monday to evacuate their citizens. Air India, United Airlines, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic said they were not using the country's airspace. Airlines and governments have paid more attention to the risks of flying over conflict zones in recent years after two deadly incidents involving surface-to-air missiles.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Pegasus controversy involves technical issues and hence the government is constituting a Technical Expert Committee to examine all issuess raised in the Pegasus controversy to dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests. "Government has nothing to hide," SG says and informs the court that eminent technical experts will be part of the committee. Justice Aniruddha Bose, part of the three-judge bench led by CJI N V Ramana, said he had some interaction with two petitioners in a social gathering. He asked petitioners and the government whether they have any objection to his being a part of the bench. SG and others say no objection. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on a list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware. Opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi, two Union ministers -- Prahlad Singh Patel and Railways and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw -- businessman Anil Ambani, a former CBI chief, and at least 40 journalists are on the list on the leaked database of NSO. It is, however, not established that all the phones were hacked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nothing-to-do-with-pegasus-whatsapp-tells-in-supreme-court/articleshow/85363010.cms||---

The price of liberty, they say, is eternal vigilance. Independence Day is an opportunity to renew our commitment to safeguarding the Constitution of India and a reminder that democracy survives only if citizens actively thwart moves to curtail freedom,” an official release from Vettiver Collective said. Isaivani’s gaana song too featured lyrics with satirical takes on issues such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging citizens to clapping and banging plates during the first lockdown as an expression of gratitude for those providing essential services. “Kaasu kuduthu Software vaangi… Sondha naatu makkalaye Vevu paaka sonniyae (You paid for software to spy on your own citizens,” the lyrics of Isaivani’s song continued, touching upon the recent Pegasus spyware controversy.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board second best in country: Study||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has been adjudged the second best board in the country. New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), which ranked State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBSs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) based on public disclosure, studied them for 18 parameters over a period of one year. Lab infrastructure and accreditation, latest technical publications, show cause and closure notices, public hearing, waste management and action plan for pollution control were some of the important criteria used for ranking the boards. TNPCB chairman A V Venkatachalam told TOI that the CSE collected the data for its study from two sources. The first is website of state PCBs/ PCCs and the annual reports of each board. The organisation, which collected the last of its data in June this year, in its report said: “We have carried out this study based on the list of indicators and rating criteria.” It further said that the rationale of this scoring methodology was to give more weightage to statutory indicators which must be available in public domain like information on board of members, number of board meetings, directions, consent information, compliance status of industry, inspection, accounts and financial details and manpower details.” The SPCB/PCC website is an important source for the dissemination of information among various stakeholders and the people. A good website keeps all the information under the relevant heading for easy navigation so that anyone can easily access environmental information available on the SPCB website, whenever required. Every state board must establish a laboratory to enable the board to perform its functions efficiently under the Water and Air Acts. It is also important that all SPCBs/PCCs share at least basic information about their laboratory on their websites like number of laboratories in the state, accreditation of lab, parameters which can be analysed in lab and contact details. Of 34 SPCBs/PCCs, those in Tamil Nadu, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram provided a significant amount of information on laboratory infrastructure and accreditation of their laboratories, the report said. The TNPCB has been taking all proactive measures to improve its functioning. Soon more new projects including an early warning system will be launched, Venkatachalam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-pollution-control-board-second-best-in-country-study/articleshow/85363245.cms||P Oppili

---||World||Left Afghanistan to avoid bloodshed, 'big human disaster', says President Ashraf Ghani||KABUL: Embattled Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has said he left Kabul to avoid bloodshed and a "big human disaster" in the city of six million people, urging the Taliban to reveal their intentions and reassure the people who are unsure about their future after the insurgents took over the war-torn country. Taliban insurgents swept into Afghanistan's capital on Sunday after a sudden and unprecedented collapse of the government, prompting president Ghani to join fellow citizens and foreigners to leave the country. Ghani in his first comments after he left Afghanistan said on Sunday he was faced with a "hard choice" between the "armed Taliban" who wanted to enter the Presidential Palace or "leaving the dear country that I dedicated my life to protecting the past 20 years". "If there were still countless countrymen martyred and they would face the destruction and destruction of Kabul city, the result would have been a big human disaster in this six million city. The Taliban have made it to remove me, they are here to attack all Kabul and the people of Kabul. In order to avoid the bleeding flood, I thought it was best to get out," Ghani said in a Facebook post on Sunday. "Talibanhave won the judgement of sword and guns and now they are responsible for protecting the countrymen's honor, wealth and self-esteem. Didn't they win the legitimacy of hearts? Never in history has dry power given legitimacy to anyone and won't give it to them," the 72-year-old politician, reportedly taking shelter in neighbouring Tajikistan, said. Ghani said the Taliban insurgents are now facing a new historical test of either to protect the name and honour of Afghanistan or prioritising other places and networks. He said that to win legitimacy and the hearts of people who are in fear and unsure of their future, it is necessary for the Taliban to assure all people, nations, different sectors, sisters, and women of Afghanistan. "Make a clear plan to do and share it with the public. I will always continue to serve my nation with an intellectual moment and a plan to develop. Lots more talk for the future," he added. An academic and economist, Ghani is the 14th President of Afghanistan. He was first elected on September 20, 2014 and was re-elected in the September 28, 2019 presidential election. He was announced the winner after a protracted process in February 2020 and was sworn in for a second term on March 9 last year. An anthropologist by education, he previously served as Minister of Finance and the Chancellor of Kabul University. The Taliban on Sunday seized the last major city outside of Kabul held by the country's central government, cutting off the Afghan capital to the east. The collapse of Jalalabad leaves Afghanistan's central government in control of just Kabul and six other provincial capitals out of the country's 34. Taliban insurgents began moving towards Kabul following the overnight collapse of the two remaining cities of Mazar-e-Sharif and Jalalabad. US President Joe Biden in April announced that all American troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by September 11 this year, thus bringing to end the country's longest war, spanning across two decades. The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, but following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the brutal regime of the militant group came to end as they were removed from power by US-led forces in 2001. The group, however, has been on the offensive in recent months and is now on the brink of seizing power again. They entered direct talks with the US in 2018, and in February 2020.The two sides struck a peace deal in Doha that committed the US to withdrawal and the Taliban to preventing attacks on US forces. But in the year that followed, the Taliban continued to target Afghan security forces and civilians, and advanced rapidly across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/left-afghanistan-to-avoid-bloodshed-big-human-disaster-says-president-ashraf-ghani/articleshow/85363464.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Shiv Sena: The pain of partition will not go away by mere symbolism||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Monday said the pain of partition will not go away by mere symbolism. "The present day rulers must take care that seeds of another partition should not be sown from the earlier pain," an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said. This statement comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that August 14 will be observed as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, It said the pain of partition remains even after 75 years, and BJP's LK Advani is the only leader who is a witness to it. "The pain of partition will not go away by mere symbolism, but a definite action is needed," the Marathi publication said. It said if Kashmiri Pandits were given their rights and homes in the Kashmir Valley, a lot could be achieved. "Just like the two countries were divided, hearts were also divided. (Former Indian prime minister) Vajpayee tried to bridge the divide by taking a bus to Lahore for peace. Even Narendra Modi made an unscheduled stop in Pakistan to meet the then PM Nawaz Sharif, which means he also wanted to forget the the past and make peace. But, now he has reopened the old wounds," it said. It would have been better if there was an introspection on whether to rekindle the partition horrors or whether to permanently bury those memories by "teaching a befitting lesson to those who inflicted the wounds", the edit said. The Sena, which shares power with the Congress and NCP in Maharashtra, said only (former prime minister) Indira Gandhi had managed to take "revenge" of the pain of partition by dividing Pakistan and destroying the "two-nation concept" on the basis on which the neighbouring country was carved out. The editorial claimed the seeds of the two-nation theory were sown first by Sir Syed Ahmed when he said "Hindus and Muslims were two separate nations". This was supported by the Muslim League later, it said, adding that even a staunch "Hindutvawadi" like Veer Savarkar propagated the two-nation theory. The editorial said among the many reasons the Congress leaders supported the partition was that it could resolve the Hindu-Muslim conflict. "But that didn't happen. The partition wasn't part of any politics or agreed upon happily. The partition was due to the divide and rule policy of the British and unavoidable to secure freedom from the British rule," it said. The Marathi daily noted that Hindus and Muslims had shed blood to make India free of the British rule. Poet Iqbal, who played a role in the creation of Pakistan, wrote the immortal words of the song 'Saare Jahan Se Achha Hindustan Hamara', it said. "Barrister Jinnah was also a prominent freedom fighter and a supporter of (Lokmanya) Tilak. Justice (Gopal Krishna) Gokhale was the political guru of Mahatma Gandhi and even Jinnah. But, the Hindu-Muslim divide grew once independence from the British rule neared and resulted in the formation of Pakistan," it said.

From now on all public open spaces will remain open from 6 am to 10 pm. Earlier, in its order last week the BMC had allowed all indoor and outdoor sports activities except for swimming pools and all other sports related activities where close physical contact is required. However public open spaces like gardens were allowed to remain open only between 5 am to 9 am. Corporators had slammed the BMC stating that there was no logic in allowing outdoor sports activities on all days of the week but keeping gardens and playgrounds open only between 5 am to 9 am. Congress Corporator from Bandra (West) said, “This is a good decision. I did not see any logic in keeping the gardens and open spaces shut in the evening hours. If outdoor sports activities were allowed, why can’t citizens go to public open spaces and gardens? It looks like the BMC was only thinking about this with club memberships and not about the common man. This was unfair. We welcome the decision to keep all public open spaces open in the morning and evening.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/open-spaces-to-remain-open-from-6-am-to-10-pm-in-mumbai/articleshow/85363784.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: TMC celebrates 'Khela Hobe Divas'||KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress Monday celebrated 'Khela Hobe Divas' across West Bengal, as party leaders observed the day by organising football matches in every nook and corner of the state. The events are aimed at promoting sports and as a mark of respect to 16 people who had died in a stampede during a football match in Kolkata on this day in 1980. TMC supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee had last month announced that August 16 would be observed as 'Khela Hobe Divas'. 'Khela Hobe' (will play) was the battle cry of the TMC during the high-octane assembly polls in April-May this year, as the party defeated the BJP to storm back to power in West Bengal for the third consecutive time. The TMC, which is looking to increase its national footprint, has also made mega plans to mark the day in various parts of the country, including Tripura, where it has directed a lot of energy with an eye on the 2023 assembly polls. "The 'Khela Hobe Divas' is being observed across the state. In other parts of the country, too, we have plans to organise events. However, in some BJP-ruled states, we were not given permission. We are still pursuing the matter with the authorities," TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said. The West Bengal government has also lined up programmes at various stadiums and distributed footballs to various clubs. Meanwhile, the BJP voiced its opposition to the 'Khela Hobe Divas', claiming that the Muslim League had launched its Direct Action Day and began the Great Calcutta Killings in 1946 on August 16. The saffron party has decided to observe the day as 'Paschimbongo Bachao Divas' (Save West Bengal Day).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-observes-khela-hobe-diwas-across-west-bengal/articleshow/85363785.cms||---
---||World||Four Palestinians killed in shootout with Israeli forces||JERUSALEM: Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian gunmen during a late-night arrest raid in the occupied West Bank, killing four Palestinians in one of the deadliest battles in the area in years, Palestinian health officials said Monday. The fighting erupted in Jenin, a city in the northern West Bank where tensions have been high since a man was killed in fighting with Israel earlier this month. Israel's paramilitary border police said its forces were attempting to arrest a suspect when they "came under heavy fire from close range'' by a number of gunmen. It said Israeli forces returned fire, and none of its officers were injured. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, said four men were killed by Israeli fire and a fifth was seriously wounded. Amateur footage from the scene appeared to show an intense exchange of gunfire in the streets of Jenin. Senior Palestinian official Hussein Al Sheikh accused Israel of "a heinous crime'' and tweeted that "the international community should be ashamed of its silence about this and its failure to provide protection to the Palestinian people from this oppression.'' During the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, Jenin experienced some of the heaviest fighting with Israel, though the area has generally been quiet in recent years. According to the Israeli military, there have been at least eight clashes between troops and Palestinian gunmen over the past two months. The West Bank has experienced an uptick in deadly violence in recent months, with over two dozen Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in recent weeks, including children and Palestinian protesters. Israel's war in May in the Gaza Strip, driven by friction in at a contest Jerusalem holy site and attempts by a settler group to evict Palestinians in east Jerusalem, and the recent establishment of a West Bank settlement outpost have contributed to the tensions. Last week, Israel's military chief urged troops to follow professional regulations and "act with discretion" in light of the complexity of the situation. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and in the decades since has established dozens of settlements where nearly 500,000 settlers reside. The Palestinians seek the West Bank as part of their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to resolving the conflict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/four-palestinians-killed-in-shootout-with-israeli-forces/articleshow/85360348.cms||---

Hours later, she joined Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress. "While young leaders leave we ‘oldies’ are blamed for our efforts to strengthen it. The party moves on with: Eyes wide shut," wrote Sibal on Twitter as he took a dig at the Congress leadership.

Sibal had also recently invited several opposition leaders for a dinner at his residence, where questions were raised on present condition of the Congress and also on its leadership. The Congress it appears was caught off guard with the development. (Sushmita Dev with Trinamool leaders Abhishek Banerjee (C) and Derek O'Brien)Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said he will not comment till he speaks with Sushmita. "I tried speaking with Sushmita Dev, her phone was off. She was a dedicated Congress worker and perhaps is, even today. Congress president Sonia Gandhi has not received any letter from her. She's mature enough to take her decisions, can't comment until I speak with her," Surjewala said. Congress MP Ripun Bora said "Sushmita Dev was a dedicated Congress leader, never thought she would take such a decision. We were like family. If she had anything against the party, she should have discussed it. I request her to reconsider her decision and withdraw her resignation." However, leaving no room for any reconciliation, Sushmita Dev joined the Trinamool Congress hours after quitting the Congress. She joined the Trinamool in the presence of party leaders Abhishek Banerjee and Derek O'Brien and is likely to play an active role in Trinamool's expansion plans in Assam and Tripura.

However, WPI inflation remained in double digit for the third consecutive month in July, mainly due to a low base of last year. WPI inflation was (-) 0.25 per cent, in July 2020. "The high rate of inflation in July 2021 is primarily due to low base effect and rise in prices of crude petroleum and natural gas; mineral oils; manufactured products like basic metals; food products; textiles; chemicals and chemical products etc as compared the corresponding month of the previous year," the Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement. Inflation in food articles eased for the third straight month, and was at 'zero' per cent in July, down from 3.09 per cent in June, even as onion prices spiked. Inflation in onions was high at 72.01 per cent. Inflation in crude petroleum and natural gas was 40.28 per cent in July, against 36.34 per cent in June. In manufactured products, inflation stood at 11.20 per cent in July, against 10.88 per cent in the previous month. The RBI, which mainly takes into account retail inflation, in its monetary policy last week kept interest rates unchanged at record lows. It projected CPI or retail inflation at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22, up from its earlier projection of 5.1 per cent. Data released last week showed retail inflation eased to 5.59 per cent in July, mainly due to softening food prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wpi-inflation-eases-to-11-16-in-july-food-crude-prices-soften/articleshow/85363828.cms||---

---||World||Australia's worst day of pandemic sees restrictions tighten||CANBERRA: Australia's most populous state on Monday reported its worst day of the pandemic with 478 new infections and seven Covid-19 deaths as pandemic restrictions tightened in other parts of the country. The previous record daily tally in New South Wales was 466 new cases reported on Saturday. Two of the dead had received a single dose of a two-shot vaccine. The rest were unvaccinated, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. Only 26% of Australians aged 16 and older had been fully vaccinated by Saturday. Australia has one of the slowest vaccine rollouts among wealthy countries, which is making the spread of the delta variant particularly dangerous. The first shipment of 1 million Pfizer doses that Australia bought from Poland arrived in Sydney overnight. Residents aged 16 to 39 in Sydney's worst-effected suburbs will be given 530,000 of the new doses, the government said. This age group was responsible for most of the virus spread. Berejiklian blamed Sydney residents' failure to comply with the city's lockdown restrictions and stay-at-home orders for the escalating infections. "The case numbers are disturbingly high and we are ... at a fork in the road," Berejiklian said. "We will see the numbers come down when people stay home and people don't move about unless they absolutely have to. Until we see that, we're not going to see the case numbers go down," she added. Melbourne reported 22 new infections on Monday. Even with the substantially smaller problem, Victoria state Premier Danial Andrews said Australia' largest city after Sydney was at a "tipping point" in its battle to stamp out all infections. A lockdown that was due to end on Thursday was extended to September 2 with a 9 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew beginning on Tuesday. Tougher restrictions include a ban on people removing face masks to drink alcohol in public. This followed a "Walk. Talk. Sip" event advertised on social media that encouraged people to stroll from pub to pub in the suburb of Richmond with takeout drinks over the weekend. "We've seen people turning the footpath into an impromptu beer garden and doing pub crawls," Andrews said. "We've seen lots of people flouting these rules, not doing as they should, making really poor choices." The national capital Canberra also extended a lockdown that was to end this week until September 2 after reporting 19 news infections on Monday. The virus came from Sydney but authorities don't know how. There have been a total of 28 cases recorded since Canberra locked down when the first case was detected on Thursday last week. The Northern Territory introduced a snap three-day lockdown because of a single case detected on Monday. The American man, aged in his 30s, tested positive in the Northern Territory city of Katherine where he had traveled for a job, officials said. Katherine and the Northern Territory capital Darwin, where he spent three days last week, will be locked down until Thursday. People are only allowed to leave home for essential reasons and must wear masks outside their homes. The New South Wales government has been criticized for waiting 10 days before locking down Sydney after a limousine driver was infected while transporting a US air crew from Sydney Airport and tested positive on June 16. Surrounding New South Wales was entirely locked down from Saturday because of recent infections detected in regional towns and virus found in wastewater north and west of Sydney.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australias-worst-day-of-pandemic-sees-restrictions-tighten/articleshow/85364082.cms||---

An agreement could be reached as soon as the coming weeks, according to the report, which cited people with knowledge of the matter. Reliance announced a sale of a 20% stake in its oil-to-chemicals business to Aramco for $15 billion in 2019, but the deal stalled after oil prices and demand crashed last year due to the pandemic. In late June, Reliance's billionaire chairman Mukesh Ambani said it hopes to formalise its partnership with Aramco this year and its chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan will join the Indian conglomerate's board as an independent director. Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Reliance declined to comment.

The rumbling sound could be heard several kilometers (miles) away as Mount Merapi erupted, sending hot ash 600 meters (nearly 2,000 feet) into the sky. Ash blanketed nearby towns, but long-established evacuation orders are in place near the volcano, and no casualties were reported. It was Merapi's biggest lava flow since authorities raised its danger level last November, said Hanik Humaida, the head of Yogyakarta's volcanology and geological hazard mitigation center. She said the lava dome just below Merapi's southwest rim and the lava dome in the crater both have been active since the end of July. The southwest rim dome volume was estimated at 1.8 million cubic meters (66.9 million cubic feet) and about 3 meter (9.8 feet) tall before partially collapsing Monday morning, sending pyroclastic flows traveled fast down the southwest flank at least twice. Smaller pyroclastic flows of searing gas and lava traveled up to 1.5 kilometers (a mile) southwest at least twice more during the day. The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) peak is near Yogyakarta, an ancient city of several hundred thousand people embedded in a large metro area on the island of Java. The city is a center of Javanese culture and a seat of royal dynasties going back centuries. Merapi's alert status has been at the second highest of four levels since it began erupting last November, and Indonesia's volcanology and geological hazard mitigation center has not raised it despite the past week's increased volcanic activity. The four levels describe eruption activity as normal, minor, moderate or major. People are advised to stay 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from the crater's mouth and to beware of the peril of lava, the agency said. Ash from the eruption blanketed several villages and nearby towns, Humaida said. Cloudy weather obscured views of the peak. Mount Merapi is the most active of more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia and has repeatedly erupted with lava and gas clouds recently. Authorities in November had evacuated nearly 2,000 people living on the fertile slopes of the mountain in Magelang and Sleman districts and about 550 more people in January, but most have since returned. Merapi's last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people and caused the evacuation of 20,000 villagers. Indonesia, an archipelago of 270 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the Pacific "Ring of Fire,'' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the ocean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/lava-streams-from-indonesias-mount-merapi-in-new-eruption/articleshow/85364438.cms||---
---||World||Hong Kong reclassifies 15 countries as 'high risk' for Covid-19||HONG KONG: Hong Kong's government said it would upgrade 15 overseas places including the United States, Spain and France to "high risk" from "medium risk" by August 20, meaning international arrivals from those countries will face lengthened quarantine due to a resurgence of the coronavirus. The government said arrivals from Bangladesh, Cambodia, France, Greece, Iran, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States would all face the new restrictions, according to a statement released on Monday. Hong Kong has some of the most stringent coronavirus entry requirements globally, with arrivals from countries considered "high risk" mandated to undergo compulsory quarantine for 21 days in a designated quarantine hotel, even those who are vaccinated. The government said there had been acute surges in the number of confirmed cases in a short period of time in many countries. "Despite large-scale vaccination programmes, many places are also experiencing resurgence of the virus, which poses enormous challenges to our local anti-epidemic efforts," the statement said. Australia will be reclassified as "medium risk" from "low risk" from August 20, meaning that even vaccinated arrivals will need to quarantine for 14 nights unless they have a positive antibody test result conducted by a laboratory recognised by the Hong Kong Government, which then allows them to do a seven-day quarantine. Countries including Brazil, India, and the United Kingdom had already been classified as "high risk", but the government had largely relaxed measures for travellers from most other countries, prompting hope of increased international travel for residents and a greater number of foreign visitors. Hong Kong has largely controlled the virus with hardly any locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, but has seen a steady inflow of imported coronavirus cases over the past two months. The city has recorded around 12,000 Covid-19 cases in total.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/hong-kong-reclassifies-15-countries-as-high-risk-for-covid-19/articleshow/85364717.cms||---

---||India||This is a way to discover hidden stories in places where traditional scholars will not venture: Partition archive founder||Ever stopped at Delhi’s Mandi House metro station to catch a glimpse of the huge photographs of elderly women and read their heart-wrenching stories of Partition? If so, thank 1947 Partition Archive, a global digital archive dedicated to documenting the “people's history of the 1947 India-Pakistan Partition”. The archive, started around a decade ago, has over 9,000 stories today.  TOI’s Neel Kamal spoke to 1947 Partition Archive founder and director Guneeta Singh Bhalla who says pursuing the stories of Partition survivors has become a part of her life. How did 1947 Partition Archive reach out to over 9,000 people to record their harrowing stories? This is such a beautiful and life changing experience that we felt it would be important for everyone to have it. We are a crowdsourcing-based archive, and we train and encourage people who reach out to us. Many Partition witnesses reached out to us directly via e-mail, while many young people reached out to us for interviewing their parents or grandparents. Besides, our trained citizen historians and story scholars also reach out to individuals. This is actually a way of connecting with communities, especially the traditionally underrepresented ones, and discovering hidden stories in places where many traditional scholars will not venture. How did people find out about you at first place? We began posting stories on social media almost a decade ago. These were followed by over a million people. Since 2017, the stories have received over 10 million interactions every year. This provides a glimpse of how far the stories are spreading. This is what inspires people to share their stories from around the world. This has been the primary means of how people have found out about our work. It's sort of democratisation of information. How did you start the archive? In the very early days, I spoke at as many student clubs as possible. Once a group of local volunteers from all walks of life joined, we were able to start setting up tables at gurdwaras, temples and mosques in California. Here, Partition witnesses would sign themselves up, and we would then go to their homes and record their stories. We worked with freely available material at Baylor University and with experts at the Regional Oral History Office at UC Berkeley to develop our oral history protocols. Did you face any problem in reaching out to people in other countries apart from India and Pakistan? We didn't face too many problems because we let the people reach out to us. Now, we are also doing interviews remotely due to the pandemic. Many people get left out. But if we had sufficient money, we could travel all over the world and reach out to every Partition witness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/this-is-a-way-to-discover-hidden-stories-in-places-where-traditional-scholars-will-not-venture-partition-archive-founder/articleshow/85364774.cms||Neel Kamal

The insurgents mixed threats and lures with propaganda and psychological warfare as they took city after city -- some with barely a shot fired -- eventually capturing the capital Kabul. How did this happen?As foreign troops began their final withdrawal in May, Washington and Kabul were confident the Afghan military would put up a strong fight against the Taliban. With more than 300,000 personnel and multi-billion-dollar equipment more advanced than the Taliban arsenal, Afghan forces were formidable -- on paper. In reality, they were plagued by corruption, poor leadership, lack of training and plummeting morale for years. Desertions were common and US government inspectors had long warned that the force was unsustainable. Afghan forces put up strong resistance this summer in some areas such as Lashkar Gah in the south, but they now faced the Taliban without regular US air strikes and military support. Faced with the smaller but highly motivated and cohesive enemy, many soldiers and even entire units simply deserted or surrendered, leaving the insurgents to capture city after city. The seeds for the collapse were sown last year when Washington signed a deal with the insurgents to withdraw its troops completely. For the Taliban, it was the beginning of their victory after nearly two decades of war. For many demoralised Afghans, it was betrayal and abandonment. They continued to attack government forces but started to combine those with targeted killings of journalists and rights activists, ramping up an environment of fear. They also pushed a narrative of inevitable Taliban victory in their propaganda and psychological operations. Soldiers and local officials were reportedly bombarded with text messages in some areas, urging them to surrender or cooperate with the Taliban to avoid a worse fate. Many were offered safe passage if they did not put up a fight, while others were reached through tribal and village elders. With Afghan forces unable to hold off the Taliban advances, many of Afghanistan's famed -- and notorious -- warlords rallied their militias and promised a black eye to the Taliban if they attacked their cities. But with confidence plunging in the ability of Afghanistan's government to survive, never mind hold off the insurgents, the writing was also on the wall for the warlords. Their cities fell without a fight. Warlord Ismail Khan in the western city of Herat was captured by the Taliban as it fell. Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Mohammad Noor in the north fled to Uzbekistan, as their militia members abandoned humvees, weapons and even their uniforms on the road out of Mazar-i-Sharif. The Taliban had started putting deals and surrender arrangements in place reportedly long before the launch of their blitz in May. From individual soldiers and low-level government officials to apparently provincial governors and ministers, the insurgents pressed for deals -- with the Taliban all but victorious, why put up a fight? The strategy proved immensely effective. The images from their final march to Kabul were not of bodies in the streets and bloody battlefields, but of Taliban and government officials sitting comfortably on couches as they formalised the handover of cities and provinces. According to one reported US estimate less than a month before the fall of Kabul, the Afghan government could collapse in 90 days. But once the Taliban captured their first provincial capital, it took less than two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/how-did-the-taliban-take-over-afghanistan-so-quickly/articleshow/85366004.cms||---

The Mamata Banerjee-led party welcomed her into its fold. "We warmly welcome the former President of All India Mahila Congress Sushmita Dev to our Trinamool family," the TMC said in a tweet. We warmly welcome the former President of All India Mahila Congress @sushmitadevinc to our Trinamool family!Inspi… https://t.co/16ZSEB3WaK— All India Trinamool Congress (@AITCofficial) 1629104162000'Mamata has excellent vision'Dev said later West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has an "excellent vision" for the party's future and hoped that she would be helpful in that regard. "Met TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and had a good discussion with him. He has an excellent vision and clarity for the party. Then the three of us met the (West Bengal) chief minister. She clearly has an excellent future vision for the party and I hoped that I would be helpful in that regard. "I would be meeting the press in Delhi On Tuesday and answer all questions," Dev said in a video statement released by the TMC. A former MP, Dev was the national spokesperson of the Congress and the chief of the All-India Mahila Congress. She sent her resignation letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, sources said, but offered no reason for her quitting.

She also changed her Twitter bio to a former member of the grand old party and a former chief of the Mahila Congress. She said she is resigning from the primary membership of the Indian National Congress. "I cherish my three-decade-long association with the Indian National Congress.... I hope I have your good wishes as I begin a new chapter in my life of public service," Dev said in the letter. The Congress, however, said Gandhi has not received any letter from her. The chief spokesperson of the party, Randeep Surjewala, said he and other Congress leaders tried to reach out to Dev but her phone was switched off. "I am unable to speak to her as Sushmitaji's phone is switched off. We have tried to reach out to her. "Sushmitaji is a very dear friend. She is extremely versatile, talented and capable. Sonia Gandhiji and Rahul Gandhiji have always appreciated it," he told reporters when asked about Dev's resignation. Surjewala said Dev has a generational relationship with the Congress ideology and the Congress family and that "we treat her as a member of that family". "I am certain that she is mature enough to take whatever political decision that she takes with an appropriate consideration of her history, her legacy as also her own capacities. I only wish her the best for her future," he said. Soon after Dev's resignation, another Congress leader Kapil Sibal said the party is moving on with its "eyes wide shut". "Sushmita Dev resigns from primary membership of our Party. While young leaders leave we 'oldies' are blamed for our efforts to strengthen it," the former Union minister wrote on Twitter. "The Party moves on with: Eyes Wide Shut," he said. Dev had met the Congress president, along with other leaders of the party's Assam unit, only on Saturday. Her Twitter account was temporarily blocked last week after she shared Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's picture with the parents of a nine-year-old victim of alleged rape and murder in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/former-congress-mp-from-assam-sushmita-dev-joins-tmc-in-presence-of-senior-leader-abhishek-banerjee-in-kolkata/articleshow/85366610.cms||---

Lufthansa shares fell as much as 4.9% to 8.81 euros in early trade after the announcement. The state's 20% stake was acquired for 300 million euros ($353.67 million) as part of a bailout for the German carrier as the company and the entire aviation sector took a battering from the coronavirus crisis. Lufthansa had received a 6 billion euro package from Germany's economic stabilisation fund (WSF), which was set up to help companies to ride out the pandemic. The WSF has said it would sell the complete stake, which is currently worth more than 1 billion euros, before the end of 2023. Lufthansa plans to issue new shares, probably before the September 26 parliamentary elections, to help it to return bailout money to taxpayers. Shareholders have approved a potential capital increase of up to 5.5 billion euros.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/germany-to-sell-up-to-a-quarter-of-its-lufthansa-stake/articleshow/85367072.cms||---
